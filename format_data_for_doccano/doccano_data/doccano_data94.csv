"Australia is experiencing more extreme heat, longer fire seasons, rising oceans and more marine heatwaves consistent with a changing climate, according to the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO’s state of the climate report. The report, published every two years, measures the long-term variability and trends observed in Australia’s climate. The 2018 report shows that Australia’s long-term warming trend is continuing, with the climate warming by just over 1C since 1910 when records began. That warming is contributing to a long-term increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, fire weather and drought. “Australia is already experiencing climate change now and there are impacts being experienced or felt across many communities and across many sectors,” said Helen Cleugh, the director of the CSIRO’s climate science centre. The report’s key findings include: Australia’s fire seasons have lengthened and become more severe. In some parts of the country, the season has been extended by months. The number of extreme heat days continues to trend upward. There has been a shift to drier conditions in south-eastern and south-western Australia in the months from April to October. Rainfall across northern Australia has increased since the 1970s, particularly during the tropical wet season in north-western Australia. Oceans around Australia have warmed by about 1C since 1910, which is leading to longer and more frequent marine heatwaves that affect marine life such as corals. Sea levels around Australia have risen by more than 20cm since records began and the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. There has been a 30% increase in the acidity of Australian oceans since the 1800s and the current rate of change “is ten times faster than at any time in the past 300 million years”. Karl Braganza, the bureau of meteorology’s manager of climate monitoring, said the increase in average temperature was having an impact on the frequency or amount of extremes Australia experienced in any given year. “In general there’s been around a five-fold increase in extreme heat and that is consistent whether you look at monthly temperatures, day time temperatures or night time temperatures,” he said. He said there had been a reduction in rainfall of 20% in south-western Australia and in some places that was as high as 26%. In south-eastern Australia, April to October rainfall had fallen by 11%. The report also highlights an increase in the number of extreme fire danger days in many parts of Australia, particularly in southern and eastern Australia. Braganza said there was a “clear shift” towards a lengthened fire season, more fire weather during that season and an increase in its severity. “Often the worst fire weather occurs when you’ve had long-term drought, long-term above-average temperatures, maybe a short-term heatwave and then the meteorology that’s consistent with severe fire weather and the ability for fire to spread,” he said. “It’s those types of compound events that are going to be most challenging going forward in terms of adapting to climate change in Australia.” David Cazzulino, the Great Barrier Reef campaigner for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report confirmed what many Australians already knew about the rising risks of climate change. “The big line around oceans warming one degree since 1910 is a huge wake-up call,” he said. “It’s undeniable that warming oceans lead to more marine heatwaves, coral bleaching and coral mortality.” He said the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, and climate change policy generally, would be a key campaign issue ahead of the 2019 federal election. “We are running out of time to keep warming to a safe degree for the reef to have a future,” Cazzulino said."
"William Goggia awoke to a poisonous orange atmosphere so thick with smoke he couldn’t see the sun. It was 8am on Thursday 8 November. He heard the piercing metallic clang of propane tanks exploding in the distance. His sister, who lived nearby, called to ask him to help a relative in the area, but Goggia told her that he couldn’t: chunks of burning wood were falling from the sky.  Goggia inhabited the same stucco, three-bedroom house he grew up in. Now it was time to leave. By 9am he was on the road, accompanied by his tabby cat, Mikey. But the street was so clogged with people trying to escape that Goggia barely moved. The fire was getting closer. The van was going to burn up with him and the cat inside, he thought. So he turned back around against the traffic. Goggia didn’t know it yet, but he had been engulfed by the deadliest wildfire in recorded California history. Soon at least 86 people would be dead in a new and ferocious kind of climate change-inflected wildfire. And Paradise would suffer a fate that appears increasingly likely: the total destruction of a modern American city. This is a reconstruction of Paradise’s final hours, based on interviews with more than 50 residents, first responders and wildfire scientists. “You are ascending into Paradise,” read a road sign on the way into town, a charming spot in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California. In truth, if this was a utopia it was a mellow sort. Dating back to the Gold Rush, Paradise was less a garden of earthly delights than a quiet community of 27,000, with homes and trailer parks hidden amid dense stands of pines and oaks. Most here were middle and lower income. The population skewed towards retirees, but residents say there was also a younger influx escaping real estate prices elsewhere in California. When a Starbucks opened several months ago, a local joke went, Paradise had truly arrived. But one menace was constant. Wildfires are a normal part of the forest ecosystem in California, and over the past decade parts of Paradise have been threatened by at least four fires. More than 200 structures were destroyed in 2008. Recent conditions have boosted the risks. Years of drought exacerbated by global warming have left its forests achingly dry and littered with dead trees. And because there has been a policy of suppressing wildfires to protect homes and businesses in the state since the early 1900s, the landscape is now unusually dense with shrubs and young trees that would otherwise have been burned off by naturally occurring blazes. Fire experts, who have long spoken out about the danger, don’t see this as vegetation – they see it as fuel. Paradise’s geography makes it particularly vulnerable. It sits on a ridge between two canyons that meet like the lines at the top of a triangle, providing magnificent vistas but also impeding escape in the event of a disaster. One main thoroughfare, Skyway, leads out of town and into the valley to the west. Residents could opt in to an alert system that would notify them of trouble via telephone, text and email, and Paradise had an emergency plan that split the city into evacuation zones. Evacuations would proceed based on which areas were affected, and during a disaster, cars would be permitted to use both lanes on certain roads to flee. But the plan, officials would later say, had a crucial vulnerability: it did not envision the panicked evacuation of the entire town at once. Two days before the fire, the gas and electric company PG&E, which serves much of northern California, warned roughly 70,000 customers in nine counties, including in Paradise, that it was considering shutting off power because of increased fire risks from high winds and low humidity. Sparks from PG&E equipment have been blamed for igniting a number of fires, including the Tubbs fire, which killed 22 in wine country in 2017, and 2015’s Butte fire, which killed two and destroyed more than 900 structures after a tree came into contact with a power line. The night before the fire, the utility company said it was continuing to monitor weather conditions, and by 10pm it still hadn’t made a final decision about whether to turn off power. 3.30am Thursday, Paradise  On the day the blaze broke out, Susan Van Horn was having trouble sleeping. Lying in bed in her double-wide mobile home, she noticed the wind: gusts tearing through the oak trees on her half-acre property, falling branches and acorns clattering on to her roof. “I thought, ‘if we’re going to have a fire, this is it,’” said Van Horn, 66. Normally the wind in California blows from west to east – from the Pacific Ocean inland. But, particularly in the fall, a different pattern emerges: hot northerly air from the Nevada deserts courses over the Sierra Nevada, rushing downslope over towns like Paradise. These are winds that firefighters fear because they disperse wildfire embers like dandelion seeds flung into the breeze. In Paradise that morning, there were northerly gusts of up to 70mph. At 6.15am, PG&E reported a power outage on one of its transmission lines near the community of Pulga, in the hills about 10 miles east of Paradise. By 6.30am, according to the company, an employee observed fire on the same transmission line. It would be christened the Camp fire, after the fire’s location at Camp Creek Road. Cal Fire officials are investigating a second possible ignition point, also at 6.30am and near the same area. Rob Nichols, 51, an 18-year veteran of the Paradise police, rose at 7am to gusty winds and an unsettling red glow in the sky, visible from the back patio of the home he shared with his wife and young stepchildren. The glow concerned him, and he called a colleague at the station, who told him about the small fire burning near Pulga. Paradise, the colleague said, would probably be OK. 8am, Paradise police station When Nichols arrived at work, 911 calls were pouring in, and ash was falling from the sky as if from a volcano. He had a very bad feeling. He called his wife and told her to pack the kids in the car and leave. Evacuations were ordered for the tiny communities east of Paradise, but the situation quickly spiraled into something far more terrifying. The flames were being propelled downslope by gales at speeds of 80 football fields a minute. Suddenly they were approaching Paradise itself. At around 8.30am, Nichols got a call to respond to a fire. Strangely, it wasn’t east of Paradise – it was in the heart of the city. Nichols and a trainee officer went looking for flames. They drove past the homes of family and friends and arrived at a small gated lot where they found the fire. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. They hopped a fence and Nichols turned on a hose, but no water came out. By this time, firefighters were being inundated with calls from all over town and could not respond. The pair were left with no choice but to run from house to house, banging on doors to alert people, some still asleep, that it was time to go. Nichols recognized what was happening. Extreme winds were lofting embers to areas far to the west of the main body of flames, igniting so-called spot fires. These spot fires destroyed all hope for an orderly evacuation, said Nichols. “When you make fire evacuation plans you think in your mind the fire is going to come from the east or the west side.” But this one blew fires all over town. “Before you knew it, all your evacuation routes are on fire.” 9am, Paradise elementary school Some of those who opted in to the alert system say they received warnings, but others did not, and many locals say they had no official notification at all that they were in the fire’s path. That could be because the fire destroyed cell towers and other communication infrastructure, preventing the alert from reaching some residents. Early on Thursday morning Krystin Harvey, a 44-year-old homemaker, called her daughters’ high school to ask whether classes had been canceled owing to the plume she could see on the eastern horizon. “They said they’re not going to cancel school for smoke,” she explained. After all, fires were a regular part of life in Paradise. So she and Arianne, 17, and Arissa, 16, climbed into her car. On the way they noticed that the pines were coated in ash, as if there had been a blizzard. She dropped them off, but at around 8.20am the school called: it was evacuating, and the girls would have to be collected. At Paradise elementary, a teacher named Lynn Pitman, 54, had also seen the smoke and thought little of it. When it became so stifling that the children were sent in from the playground, she began to worry. Sitting at her desk to call parents, “I was shaking pretty bad.” Once only a few kids were left she gathered with the other teachers and their remaining students in a classroom upstairs. Outside it was now growing dark, as if an eerie twilight were falling at 9am. “Looking at the kids’ faces I thought, ‘I gotta do something with them,’” Pitman said. Forcing cheeriness, she gave them snacks and began playing games, until police came through to check the building and told them to move. Buses were waiting next door, they said. “Once I got outside, the smoke, the darkness – it looked like midnight,” Pitman said. “Then I got really scared.” The winds were blowing plumes of smoke low over the town, forming a choking, swirling shroud about 1,500 meters deep. A fireman seemed shocked to see Pitman. The buses had already left, he said, and instructed her to find a car. Pitman quickly flagged down a woman named Millie, who she vaguely recognized, and threw herself and three students in the car. But it was no escape. 10am, Skyway As many of the tens of thousands of inhabitants of Paradise, and of Magalia higher up in the hills, all tried to leave at once, the result was predictable but no less horrific: gridlock. Cars, RVs and trailers inched along as the fire outpaced them and trees and homes on either side of the road went up like torches. Some vehicles ran out of gas or caught fire themselves, blocking the way and making the jam worse. “You’re fight or flight, you’re trying to get out, to escape, and it’s bumper-to-bumper LA traffic,” said Pitman. “You can’t move, and flames are all around you.” Inside their car, the temperature was rising. One of the boys asked if he could pray, and for a while they could all hear his small voice asking Jesus for help. Pitman called her husband to apologize for not leaving sooner. He listened as, in the background, Millie, the driver, pounded the steering wheel and shouted: “Go, go, go, everybody go.” By now, the fire had morphed from a countryside blaze to one that raged its way from building to building. The Safeway, the Skyway Villa RV park, the Gold Nugget local history museum, the Paradise Adventist church, the mayor’s home, the police chief’s home: all went up. Fires aren’t supposed to act like this any more. In 1906, a fire that broke out in the wake of San Francisco’s great earthquake incinerated the city. But decades of research into fire safety and changes to building codes were meant to have ameliorated large-scale structural conflagrations, said Faith Kearns, a researcher at the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In recent years, though, things have begun to change. In 2017, some 3,000 single-family homes were destroyed in the city of Santa Rosa, and over 1,000 homes burned in summer 2018 in a fire that advanced into the city of Redding, which also saw a bizarre “fire tornado”. The main drivers, Kearns believes, are a more extreme climate and more people living in fire-prone, semi-rural areas. “We engineered our way out of that kind of fire,” she said. “Now we’re seeing it come back.” Back on the road, Allyn Pierce, the manager of the intensive care unit at Adventist Health Feather River, was on the run with two colleagues. After evacuating 67 patients they had hopped into Pierce’s Toyota truck but were almost immediately waylaid amid exploding gas tanks and burning cars. The air conditioner was running full blast, yet the windows were hot enough to burn skin. Trying to keep the atmosphere light, Pierce put on music. Celine Dion’s song Ashes came on, and he skipped it. Instead they sang along to Peter Gabriel’s In Your Eyes. A Volkswagen Beetle passed Pierce’s truck and caught fire. Its driver jumped out and ran. Cars, some abandoned, now completely blocked the road, and when a fire truck pulled up next to the Toyota, Pierce’s colleagues sought refuge in the cab. But he stayed: he hoped the road might somehow clear, and he didn’t want to trap anyone else behind him by leaving his own vehicle. Soon the firefighters began covering their windows of their truck with heat-reflective blankets – their last resort when surrounded by fire. Pierce recorded a video for his family and friends, and buried it deep in his center console, hoping that it would survive if he did not. He expected that flames would overtake his truck in minutes. Listening to an acoustic version of A-ha’s Take on Me, he put his hands on the wheel and sang along to the chorus, trying to blot out the whirls of fire outside the window. Pierce made it. A bulldozer miraculously appeared and began clearing abandoned cars to create a path out. By 10.30am, Pierce was back at the hospital, helping to set up a triage center and treating incoming patients. Pitman also eventually made it off the ridge with her students – a journey that was usually 20 minutes took over three hours. On TV, she watched footage of her school burning. Ken Lowe had never seen a fire so intense. As residents tried to flee, the Cal Fire chief, leading a “strike team” of five engines with three firefighters each, went the opposite way – back into town, trawling through the vicious jam. Near the Fastrip gas station in the north of town, as vehicles began to catch fire and their occupants fled with nowhere to go, Lowe and his crews did the only thing they could think of to save lives. They shouted for people to run toward the wide intersection. There, Lowe’s five fire trucks formed a physical barrier around 100 or so civilians and their dozens of dogs and cats, protecting them as the flames went past. “It was panic,” Lowe said: pitch black, trees lighting up like matches all around, power lines arcing, embers skidding through the sky like amber snowflakes. As escape became impossible, firefighters elsewhere also tried to help people shelter in place. One couple, Diana and Helmut Bredow, and their son were corralled with others into an intersection as firefighters aimed water cannons at the encroaching flames, like soldiers defending a position from attack. Near the site of the old Optimo bar,crews hatcheted their way inside some empty, newly constructed buildings and hustled anywhere from 100 to 200 people inside with their animals. In the memory of one of the evacuees, everyone, and even the dogs, was composed and self-possessed. By contrast, Erin Roach 58, recalled that “people were crying – “I don’t wanna die.”An amateur artist, Roach had her paints with her, so she did the only thing she could to stay calm: she started painting. “I didn’t know what else to do.” That morning Roach encountered a police officer who looked particularly stressed, so she put her arms around him. It happened to be Nichols, the policeman who had discovered the spot fire a few hours earlier. “I thought she seemed like she needed a hug,” Nichols said, “and I’m sure she thought I needed one.” For those the firefighters could not reach, survival was a matter of outpacing the flames. After following a light blinking in the darkness, one fire crew found a paraplegic man with scorched feet who had dragged himself 50 yards (45 meters) along a dry creek bed, and out of harm’s way. In the town of Concow, east of Paradise, over a dozen people waded into a reservoir for shelter, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. After turning his van around, William Goggia headed toward the home of his neighbors, the Romeros. On a rocky patch they had erected three enormous crucifixes. That was where he decided to leave his van with the cat still inside. He recalled addressing God: “I said, ‘I’m gonna leave him in your hands.’” In the suffocating smoke, he went back out and followed the road by foot, hoping it would be easier to make progress. Yet he was not in perfect health. A locksmith for 30 years, Goggia, 56, had a heart attack three months previously and did landscaping work as his health allowed. He hadn’t advanced very far before he was overcome by the choking fumes and collapsed to the ground. Vainly he tried to get up or get the attention of passing vehicles. At some point, his left eye was injured so severely that he was permanently blinded. Lying in a ditch at the side of the road, he thought he was going to die. Finally a truck stopped for him. “Hell yeah, you can get a ride,” said the two men who crammed him into their truck among their belongings. Instead of aiming for safety, however, they turned towards the flames: one of the men wanted to save his tiny home, a residence the size of a garden shed that could be transported on a trailer. Goggia thought the man was out of his mind, and indeed, just as they reached the spot, the tiny home caught fire, and the man retreated. It seemed like a fatal detour. The road out was now blocked by flames, and the driver seemed unsure what to do. His friend pulled him out of the front seat, but the car would not start. Flames coiled and flickered into the cab through the open windows, and the sides of the truck began to melt. The floorboard was so hot that they had to lift their feet. Goggia’s leg nearest the door was severely burned, and he poured a bottle of water over himself to stop himself being cooked. The man in the back was trying to stomp and pat out fires that were igniting in the cab. Finally the engine caught. The driver jammed the accelerator, and they blasted through the wall of fire. It took firefighters 17 days to bring the Camp fire under control, by which time it had destroyed 14,000 homes, including almost 90% of those in Paradise, according to city officials. Authorities have spent weeks sifting through the rubble for human remains. Of the 86 people who died in the fire, the overwhelming majority were found in Paradise. About 20 were found in the communities of Concow, Magalia and Butte Creek Canyon. Most were inside homes and other structures, and a smaller number were in cars. The fire moved so quickly that it trapped the town’s most vulnerable inhabitants – its senior citizens. Of the deceased identified so far by authorities, 46 were aged 65 or older. Paradise resident Chellie Saleen, 56, had risen at 6am, went for a coffee with a friend and observed a pall of smoke. Returning home, she received an alert by phone, and “all of a sudden someone was banging on door – it was my neighbor saying, ‘we gotta go now.’” She quickly changed out of her nightgown into jeans and a shirt and tried to call her 75-year-old mother, Joanne Caddy, who lived in Magalia, but couldn’t get through. Her mother didn’t drive and depended on her for everything from her shopping to her medication. Saleen threw a few things in the car and headed in her mother’s direction through the abysmal traffic, but she was blocked by “a wall of fire”. “She was probably expecting me,” Saleen said. She isn’t sure how her mother, or her mother’s two dogs, died. “I hope she was just sedated and sleeping and didn’t suffer.” Saleen’s own home was destroyed. She has no idea where she will go next. “I feel alone,” she said. “I lived alone and took care of her.” In the year before the fire, Beverly Craig Powers, 64, a nurse, had posted on social media of her deep affection for Paradise. She and her partner, Robert Duvall, 76, loved to camp and fish. According to Kelci Craig, Powers’ niece, Duvall was trying to move his fishing boat to safety when the flames overtook him. Perhaps he, like many residents, assumed that the fire would be like the others that had imperiled Paradise: a threat, but not life-threatening. His remains were found in the car, and remains have also been discovered in the couple’s trailer, which the family assumes are Powers’. Powers’ own brother worked for decades as a firefighter with Cal Fire, the state’s fire-protection agency, said Kelci Craig. “That’s what makes me sick. He spends his whole life fighting fire then loses his sister in one of the deadliest.” Experts are urging change in the wake of the fire. Prescribed burns should be implemented more widely to reduce the fuel load, they argue, and the wisdom of siting settlements amid forests and grasslands should be questioned. Yet for those trained to read it, future tragedies are already inscribed on the California landscape. Eighteen years before she was a fire scientist at the University of Idaho, Crystal Kolden worked as a firefighter based in Placerville, about 85 miles south-east of Paradise. Last month, she drove from Idaho to southern California for Thanksgiving. It was like retracing earlier parts of her life, but the memory and the reality were jarringly discordant. Over 100m trees, mostly conifers, are estimated to have died in California in a five-year period of drought in the 2010s, and Kolden was “blown away by how many dead pine trees we saw – alone, in clusters, all over the place”, she said. Of greater concern, she also saw that oaks, a resilient species that dot even the driest hills in California, were suffering. “When I fought fire, we didn’t worry much about the oaks,” she said. They are more moist and can slow fire. “Now what I see is a continuous bed of 20 to 40ft-high oak and pine trees that is tinder dry and ready to burn.” The consequences for places like Paradise are clear. “The vegetation is responding very, very obviously to climate change extremes, and setting the stage for more disasters,” Kolden said. “Paradise will not be the last town we lose.” Craig Clements, who researches the weather associated with wildfires at San José State University, had a blunter assessment. “This whole place is going to burn down. Paradise is just one example.” Little remains of this understated utopia: the Starbucks; a gourmet pizza place; the occasional house, inexplicably still standing. Some hope the town can stage a comeback. The mayor, Jody Jones, for one, plans to rebuild her own home. But many Paradisians remain rootless: stuck in evacuation centers or scattered elsewhere. In the heat of the moment, there was not always time to grab precious belongings. After waking at 3.30am, Susan Van Horn escaped with her “go-bag”, some changes of clothing and utility bills. She considers herself lucky. A high-school teacher, Virginia Partain, only had time to pick up her students’ draft college admission essays and a blanket. Retired teacher Suzanne Linebarger left with $30 of scallops she had purchased for dinner, a pair of mismatched shoes, and her swimming fins from a vacation to Mexico. “Why didn’t I grab my grandmother’s mandolin worth hundreds of dollars?” she wondered. William Goggia got out with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. The fire left him with searing injuries: burns on his right leg and ear and a ruined eye. Even now, he cannot sleep without dreaming of the flames, and his sister is seeking donations for his care. Something else of his, however, did survive the destruction. A day after he escaped, and while the town was still cordoned off by officials, Goggia snuck back in. The extent of his injuries had not yet been recognized – he was in terrible pain, and would later be admitted to the hospital for almost two weeks. But he was determined. Below the crosses, there was his van, still intact. He opened the door to a miaow.

"The New South Wales government’s call to end the “climate wars” has won a tick of approval from the Australian Industry Group, which represents Australia’s largest industrial energy users. The employer body’s chief executive, Innes Willox, told Guardian Australia an emissions reduction obligation in national policy was “vastly superior” to separate state schemes and also pushed for policies to reduce emissions outside the energy sector.  AiG was one of a number of business groups – including the Business Council of Australia, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and National Farmers Federation – which supported the Coalition’s national energy guarantee (Neg) before the emissions reduction component was dumped by Malcolm Turnbull in August. After months of lobbying from the Labor states, on Wednesday the NSW energy minister, Don Harwin, joined calls to restore that component with a plan to ask the Energy Security Board to draw up a new emissions reduction trajectory. The issue was deferred at the energy council meeting in Adelaide after intervention by the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor. On Thursday Willox said that “adding emissions reductions to the objectives of reliability and affordability, as the Neg proposed, was a way to facilitate investment in generation by giving investors greater certainty”. “We would support minister Harwin’s call for an end to the ‘climate wars’ and a resumption of an approach to energy that reinserts the objective of emissions reduction,” he said. “We also agree that a national approach would be vastly superior to having a myriad of state and territory approaches.” NSW plans to ask the ESB for options to achieve zero net emissions in the electricity sector by 2050, the state government’s preferred target. Willox said that approach “wouldn’t hurt but we need to bear in mind that the energy sector accounts for about 40% of Australia’s emissions”. “In any national target we need to have contributions from other sectors and we need clarity about the policies that will govern how we meet those targets,” he said. “Energy is a big part of the equation but far from the only one.” On Thursday Harwin told Radio National the Neg “has wide support among the stakeholders and was the right policy in terms of securing Australia’s energy supply into the future with new investment”. “We’ve got one half of [the Neg], the reliability obligation … my point yesterday is we need the other half of it as well,” he said. The South Australian energy minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, told Guardian Australia it had also reiterated its “ongoing support for the emissions reduction obligation” in the Neg but the “earliest opportunity” to consider it is an out of session meeting in February. Harwin denied that the Berejiklian government was spooked into action by the impending March state election, arguing it had “been advocating for a policy for a lower emissions future for some time”. He said it had “consistently supported” the work of the former federal energy minister Josh Frydenberg and the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to achieve the Neg. Echoing a favoured dictum of Turnbull, Harwin said he supported emissions reduction targets “backed by economics and engineering”, agreeing with Taylor that “Labor’s target is too much too fast and would cause substantial upward pressure on prices and cause a reliability problem”. Federal Labor’s shadow cabinet and national conference have endorsed a target of 45% reduction in the electricity sector by 2030. Harwin said Labor’s targets were “as much of a risk as the fact we don’t have a Neg at all”. Since the emissions reduction obligation was ditched in August, the Morrison government has failed to release new climate policy to drive emissions in the electricity or other sectors. On Thursday Taylor defended the government’s claim Australia will meet its Paris target to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030, telling Radio National that “departmental numbers” show in the electricity sector a 28% reduction will be achieved by 2023. Taylor conceded the figure applied only to the energy sector and dismissed the latest data showing Australia’s emissions are climbing by claiming “from year to year you see ups and downs”. By 2020 Australia will beat its Kyoto target by 300 million tonnes and the Coalition is “very confident” it will then meet the 2030 Paris target, Taylor said, against the advice of climate scientists and economists. At the latest round of UN climate talks Australia lobbied to exploit a controversial climate loophole, using carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris targets. The Climate Council’s acting chief executive, Martin Rice, accused Taylor of “misleading the public” by citing electricity sector figures when Australia’s commitment is for economy-wide reductions. “His government’s own published data clearly indicates Australia is not on track to meet its Paris commitments,” he said. “The energy minister is using very slippery language. The fact is Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen for four years in a row.”"
"In Scott Pruitt’s final weeks as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, his political advisers were still considering ways to formally raise doubts about climate change science, agency records show.  The scandal-plagued Pruitt had long pushed for a public “red team, blue team” debate between mainstream scientists and the small minority of scientists who disagree with them about climate change and its causes. In late 2017, White House officials urged him to abandon the idea. Yet according to emails obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act request, as recently as mid-May 2018 aides were considering an alternative: the agency could ask for public comments on a 2009 legal finding that requires the US government to regulate greenhouse gases. If by that process the EPA could successfully rescind the conclusion that greenhouse gases endanger public health, the federal government would no longer have to regulate major sources of carbon pollution, including power plants. According to a former senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity, the plan to ask for comments rather than hold a public debate was a compromise struck between the White House and the EPA. In July, however, Pruitt resigned, following dozens of stories about his ethical troubles. The emails obtained by the Guardian offer a glimpse of how the Trump administration has struggled to settle on a position on climate change. Trump himself has repeatedly doubted overwhelming research that shows humans burning fossil fuels are emitting greenhouse gases that raise global temperatures and cause catastrophic environmental changes. A number of top officials have expressed similar feelings or questioned how bad climate change will be, and federal agencies are reversing climate change mitigation efforts for power plants and cars. However, many Republicans and large energy companies urging Trump to rescind regulations do not want the EPA to debate the 2009 climate change finding, fearing a losing battle. The Midwest power provider American Electric Power, for example, opposes reconsidering the finding. It has long relied on coal but is shifting its electricity mix. “I don’t think the business community wants this at all,” said Paul Bledsoe, who was a climate change adviser to Bill Clinton. “They all came out against leaving [the Paris climate agreement]. They all have statements on their websites that they believe in climate science. The last thing they want is to get thrust into the middle of this.” Pruitt’s most conservative supporters pushed him to re-examine the finding anyway, a move which would require a full scientific review and prompt massive legal battles. It is not clear how serious the EPA considerations were or whether Pruitt’s staff intended to eventually propose a rollback. Attachments shared in emails between senior staff members included an “Endangerment ANPRM draft”, referring to an “advance notice of proposed rulemaking”, an early step in the regulatory process. Another email contained a version of talking points for a “Notice of Opportunity to Comment”. Conservative groups, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, had petitioned the EPA to re-evaluate the endangerment finding. The EPA could have posted those petitions and asked for public comments. Or it could have solicited input as part of another climate-related rollback. The documents referred to in the emails were not released, because the Freedom of Information Act does not require the government to release records that were part of ongoing deliberations. One subject line referenced an afternoon meeting. The staffers exchanging the drafts, air official Mandy Gunasekara and the policy chief, Brittany Bolen, stayed at the EPA when Pruitt left. In a brief interview this month, Gunasekara said the agency’s “understanding of CO2 and greenhouse gases continues to evolve”. She declined to comment on the released emails. Spokespeople for the EPA and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Emails released to the Guardian also showed the EPA air chief, Bill Wehrum, planning in December to make an announcement about the “RTBT”, the notional “red team, blue team” debate. This month, in a draft rule to ease standards for new coal plants, the EPA said it would accept comments on whether the agency had correctly interpreted the endangerment finding. Climate advocates say the EPA should be transparent about its plans now. “Americans deserve to know whether acting EPA head, Andrew Wheeler, nominated to be EPA administrator, disputes that carbon pollution endangers human health and the environment,” said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. According to a peer-reviewed paper published last week in the journal Science, scientific evidence showing that greenhouse gases are dangerous to public health is even stronger than it was when the endangerment finding was established in 2009."
"Australia will miss its 2030 emissions reduction targets, despite Scott Morrison’s claim the country is on track to meet its obligations “in a canter”, new government projections show. The government published its 2018 emissions projections report on Friday, just before Christmas, in its now customary style of releasing greenhouse data just before a public holiday.  The report details how Australia is tracking towards its 2020 and 2030 emissions reduction obligations under the Paris and Kyoto agreements. It projects total emissions in 2030 will be 563 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is an emissions reduction of 7% on 2005 levels. Australia’s targets under the Paris agreement are for a 26% to 28% emissions reduction on 2005 levels. The report says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector. The report projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030. It forecasts electricity emissions will fall to 2023 before starting to increase again. The government’s emissions calculations for 2030 also appear to suggest it intends to used carryover from overachievement of previous Kyoto targets to try to meet its Paris obligations, unless this is opposed through UN negotiations. Climate scientist and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, said use of carryover would effectively mean the target Australia was aiming for was “more like 12% to 14%” on 2005 levels by 2030. “They’re as far away as ever from meeting the 2030 target,” he said. “The underlying projections show a substantial deterioration because the key sectors including direct combustion of fuel, transport and industry have larger increases than last year and the power sector begins increasing again from 2023 significantly.” The report says Australia will beat its 2020 emissions reduction target of 5% on 2005 levels. It says Australia will “overachieve” on the target by 367 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, if carryover from beating the first Kyoto target in 2012 – which allowed Australia to increase its emissions from 1990 levels – is included. If carryover is not included, Australia would beat the target by 240 million tonnes. In a statement released with the report on Friday, the environment minister, Melissa Price, focused on Australia’s progress towards the 2020 target, describing it as “a great result for the environment”. She said “we have also made significant progress to our 2030 target”. “We have overachieved on our 2020 target and are well on our way to meeting our commitment to the Paris agreement 2030 target, all while maintaining a strong economy,” she said. Scientists and environment groups said it was clearly not the case that Australia was making progress towards 2030. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the government had no policy to address Australia’s climate pollution problem. “Prime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly said Australia will meet its Paris agreement targets in a canter, but the government’s own emissions projections tell a very different story,” the ACF’s economics program manager, Matt Rose, said. “The prime minister is not the only one having trouble accepting that Australia isn’t on track to meet our Paris target. “Energy minister Angus Taylor released a misleading statement this week titled, ‘National Electricity Market emissions to hit Paris target eight years early’, and on Radio National Breakfast tried to pretend Australia’s Paris target would be met by reductions in the electricity sector alone.” Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said Australia “remains off track to achieve our currently inadequate 2030 target and, critically, achieving net zero emissions by 2050”. She said the longer the country delayed taking credible action, the harder the economic adjustment would be and Australia risked losing the benefits of investment in clean energy and other low carbon opportunities. Herd said the suggestion in the report Australia might try to use carryover was concerning and “undermines the investment needed to transform the economy to net zero emissions”. “Australia’s targets should be strengthened, not weakened, by 2020,” she said. “To secure the long-term prosperity of Australia, targets need to be in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement – limiting warming to 1.5C and well below 2C.” The Greens’ climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government was resorting to “accounting tricks” to try to meet its Paris target. “So far the government’s only plan to meet Paris appears to be using dodgy accounting to cook the books and count dodgy ‘carryover’ credits from Kyoto towards Paris,” he said. “Other major countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany voluntarily cancelled their Kyoto carryover credits.” Morrison disputed in a statement issued on Friday that the government was not on track to beat the 2030 target."
"This summer’s heatwave was a real wake-up call. I felt we were up against it and it was becoming real. Seeing British lawns the colour of dry hay for weeks, getting a heatstroke when vising Kew Gardens, and lastly the extent and ferocity of the wildfires in California truly scared me. I’ve joined Greenpeace. Catherine Laz, 56, London  The moment that did it for me was reading the IPCC report that said we have 12 years to reduce carbon emissions to keep global warming to a limit of 1.5 degrees, and that 2 degrees is the tipping point. Knowing that we are warming at an average of 0.2 degrees per decade is scary, and the projections of reaching 4 degrees by 2050 if business as usual is continued shocked me. I’ve been reading more about climate change and the hot summer of 2018 has definitely been an eye opener in demonstrating its huge impact. We have been fed the lies by governments and businesses that we can significantly reduce climate change by taking personal responsibility – such as recycling more and turning off lights – when really we need to be demanding government to tax carbon, divest from fossil fuel and invest in renewables. Amina Jahan Ali, 26, London I’ve always thought I was reasonably aware of climate change so this summer I had a fairly uneasy feeling about the heatwave we were experiencing. In August I read the hot house earth article in the Guardian and had what can only be described as a mental breakdown. I had a week where I barely ate, drank or slept. It was like I was suddenly thrust into a different world. The thought of having brought children into a dying world was hugely distressing. I hid from the news for a week or two but then decided that this was making things worse so plunged into articles on the true state of the planet, and am doing what I can including going vegan and becoming a member of the Extinction Rebellion. Jennie Gibson, 34, Manchester What really made me take notice was the UN report this year and an article in the New York magazine, which said we basically now have the permission to freak out. I don’t think people realize how climate change is going to affect us – we’ve seen it in 2018 with extreme heatwaves in countries such as India. It makes me so mad to know that the really rich people in the world will probably escape death from this and the ordinary people are the ones who will suffer. It’s very frightening and unjust. I heard children in Australia were striking in schools for more action to be taken and hope this tactic is adopted by more people to demand appropriate action if it’s not being done. Margaret Lynch, 31, Ireland Climate change has made me fearful before, but in 2018 I am thinking about it every day, and I am terrified that the lives my children might be living in a few years will be ones of desolation and suffering. It was really brought home by the launch of Extinction Rebellion, which I discovered via George Monbiot. I still feel unsure about what I can actually do, beyond the micro-scale – avoiding plastic, driving and flying as little as possible, etc. In this country I’m not prepared to get myself arrested – but what, other than civil disobedience, will change the minds of the policymakers? Shari Daya, 40, Cape Town Fires in Northern California, where I live, were one of the main factors for me. Two years in a row, in addition to many lives lost and homes destroyed, we have had several days of choking, toxic smoke affecting millions and millions of people, including me and my loved ones. Last year the smoke lasted about 5 days; this year it was 12. Next year, will the smoke last for 20 days? A month? How much clean air will we have in Northern CA as the years go on? When my daughter becomes an adult, will she say “well, in my day at least we still did outside sports.” Of course I had heard about climate change before, but I think I really thought it was mostly about sea-level rise, and I thought, “well, as long as I live more than a few feet above sea level, I’ll be okay.” But in this piece, a professor says “the odds of human civilization reaching the 22nd century are often estimated at no better than 50/50.” This statistic walloped me, shocked me, and in fact frightened me beyond belief. Among other things I have joined 350.org and attended the Climate March in San Francisco in 2018. Isobel White, 50, San Francisco Bay Having endured ex Hurricane Ophelia last year and the Beast from the East this year, the message did become more relevant than ever. My concern is that some remedies put forward raise legitimate concerns too. For example, the French riots show us that there is little democratic appetite in developed countries to implement the IPCC’s solution, which is to rapidly decarbonise our economies using carbon taxes as tools to ration fossil fuel consumption, while the coverage of the activities of Extinction Rebellion in the UK towards the end of the year shows that extreme measures are currently only being undertaken by relatively few. David, 50, Ireland I think I’d recognised it before and seen the effects, but this year it really seemed to hit home in the developed countries. People, the media and politics are starting to take notice – now we need to act. Aid agencies have been complicit in past downplaying of the threat – choosing not to emphasise climate as a clear diver and direct cause of emergencies for fear of alienating donors and supporters. This must change: we have to galvanise all elements of society and international politics and ensure we act. Much of the work I do as an aid worker is in response to climate change or the effects of climate change on politics and people – this isn’t just serious, it’s an existential threat that drives crises across the globe. People in the worst affected regions won’t stay where they are and we are woefully underprepared to deal with the consequences. David Wightwick I have been concerned about climate change for some time, but was prompted to be more actively involved this year due to the changing political landscape. No longer can we count on our governments alone to address the threat in a meaningful and comprehensive way. Democracy and societal good needs loud citizen voices now. Aside from supporting political parties that have policies to address climate change I have joined a local group working for a more locally sustainable society.

"In his four years leading Canada, the Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has gone to great lengths – at home and abroad – to bolster his environmental credentials. Now, with a federal election looming, he is gambling his parliamentary majority and political future on them.  When Canadians cast their votes next October, they will do so amid standard electoral issues: jobs, the economy and foreign policy. But in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, a pair of politically fractious additions have risen to the top: carbon taxes and pipelines. “The good news for the prime minister is that when you ask Canadians who they think would make the best prime minister, he still has a comfortable advantage over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer,” said Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster. “The bad news is that leading up to the next federal election right now, it’s basically a coin toss between the Liberals and Conservatives.” Canadians have shown an increasing concern for the environment, but in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, the results are often messy. Earlier in the year, as part of its pan-Canadian climate change strategy, the federal government required all provinces have a minimum level of carbon pricing. For those that fail to do so, the government will implement its own carbon tax, set to begin in July 2019. Already, the levy has fired up Trudeau’s political opponents – at both the provincial and federal level. But the prime minister had been forced to fend off barbs from critics – including the left-of-centre New Democratic party and Indigenous communities, that any environmental goodwill he might have earned through his carbon tax has been sullied by the support for – and subsequent nationalisation of – an oil pipeline. “The only true test of a climate change plan, after all, is whether carbon is going up or down,” said the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, in a statement about his frustrations with the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs from Alberta to the British Columbia coast. The result for Trudeau is a tricky path forward as he heads off attacks that he has done too little on the environment – or too much. “Trudeau has moved from having an environment that was friendly and pliant to one that is more combative and hostile,” said Nanos, pointing to a string of shifts to Conservative – or right-of-centre – provincial governments across the country since Trudeau was elected in 2015. Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, has repeatedly called carbon pricing “the worst tax ever” and at least five provinces have banded together to fight the tax in the courts, a battle legal experts believe they will lose. Along with their provincial counterparts, the federal Conservatives have pledged to repeal any carbon taxes, with Scheer dismissing the policy as an “election gimmick”. This fight comes amid reports that Canada is not on pace to meet its 2030 climate goals. “The opposition or the politicians will convince people that the carbon price is hurting them, even though that’s a lie,” said Mark Jaccard, professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University. Jaccard, who has also served as a policy analyst, has previously warned respective governments that carbon taxes – while effective at reducing emissions – are politically difficult to sell and often not as effective as other policy options. He points out that the biggest emissions reductions in Canada came from the Ontario government’s closure of coal plants. The recent plan to close all of Canada’s coal plants by 2029 will have a far greater impact than a carbon tax – yet the tax will probably remain at the centre of the discussion. The tax could end up being particularly appealing from an electoral standpoint, said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. All proceeds from the levy will be remitted back to households in the form of a cheque, the first of which will arrive in July – a date Wiseman suspects will be close enough to the election that people will take notice. But Wiseman, who has studied the country’s elections for generations, cautions: “We’re still a long way off. And things can change on a dime in politics.”"

"Like the Keating government before it, the Howard government of 1996 and 1997 was deeply resistant to taking any action on climate change that could harm the Australian economy. But by 1996, John Howard was facing intense international pressure to step up Australia’s commitments as his government prepared for the meeting to discuss the protocol to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change to be adopted at a meeting in Kyoto in December 1997. Australia had adopted a “no regrets” policy towards tackling climate change under Keating. This meant it would consider only measures that involved cutting emissions without any adverse impact on the economy or trade competitiveness, leaving it largely reliant on on tree-planting and limiting clearing for its response. The Howard government clung to that negotiating position, despite growing evidence that Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were rising quickly. By 1996 Australia was facing a new dynamic: the European Union and the US had both proposed legally binding targets as part of the Kyoto discussions. The cabinet papers of 1996 and 1997, released by the National Archives of Australia on Tuesday, reveal Australia’s increasing isolation on the international stage. In June 1996, cabinet agreed that “Australia’s overall objective in climate change negotiations should be to safeguard our national trade and economic interests while advancing compatible outcomes that are environmentally and economically effective”. While Australia recognised “the need for effective global action on climate change”, it vowed to pursue an international agreement that “does not contain targets which are legally binding” and argued for differentiated, rather than uniform, reduction targets. The then environment minister, Robert Hill, reported to cabinet that for the first time the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific report had said that the balance of scientific evidence supported the view that the changes in climate and greenhouse gas concentrations were due to human activity. Small island states were proposing a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 levels by 2005. While other time frames were being discussed, all were potentially problematic for Australia because of its carbon-intensive economy. Hill told the cabinet that modelling showed Australia’s emissions from the energy sector – accounting for half of national emissions – were projected to be 30% above 1990 levels by 2010. The Geneva conference of parties, held in June 1996 in the lead-up to Kyoto, intensified government anxiety. Hill, who led the Australian delegation at Geneva, told the cabinet it had “proved a difficult and complex meeting for Australia” and that Australia had been singled out for criticism by environmental organisations and by the UK environment minister in an “ill-considered attack”. There was a perception that Australia was isolated in its position, he said. “The emergence of a US-EU alliance on legally binding targets was one of the most significant developments and served to shift the debate beyond the position held by Australia,” he said. Australia found few allies for its proposal for variable emission reduction targets and it had attracted criticism for being one of “very few “ to publicly articulate its concerns about defining a dangerous greenhouse gas concentration level in the atmosphere. Cabinet agreed it had to beef up its domestic greenhouse gas response policy before the Kyoto meeting if was to have any chance of convincing the international community that it should have differentiated targets. The consternation grew further by mid-1997. A joint submission to cabinet warned of the prospect of an “EU–US bilateral understanding for progressing climate change” at a forthcoming G7 summit. Australia worried a deal at G7 could provide the basis for the UN special session adopting a position “which narrows down our [negotiating] options” in the lead-up to Kyoto. The cabinet actively considered walking away from Kyoto altogether. It was facing publishing its future emissions as part of the Kyoto process but modelling was now showing that emissions from the energy sector would be 40% to 50% above 1990 levels by 2010. Options included arguing it was premature to agree to targets, or for a longer time frame. “Australia’s strategy should be to ensure that we are seen to be excluded from an agreement by the international community rather than having Australia reject agreement … we should be seen to be ‘pushed off the cliff’ rather than ‘walking away’,” the submission advised. But by July 1997, Hill and other ministers reported the G7 meeting had not produced a deal between the EU and US, and had instead exposed differences. The memorandum particularly highlighted Howard’s international advocacy with “Australia’s opposition to legally binding uniform targets” having “figured prominently in the prime minister’s [recent] discussions in Washington and London”. The cabinet also agreed in July to establish a climate change taskforce to advance Australia’s domestic greenhouse gas strategies, to strengthen its bargaining stance. One option to be explored was “domestic and international emissions trading”. In the following months, Treasury modelled various measures for reducing domestic emissions. The memorandum warned that none of its scenarios would cap carbon emissions at 1990 levels but would achieve potential cuts of 22%. And so began Australia’s long and tortured debate over carbon trading schemes. A proposal was put forward by the Australian Greenhouse Office in 2000, but was scuttled in cabinet; another came forward in 2003, but was vetoed by Howard. Finally, in the dying days of his government in December 2006, Howard announced an emissions trading scheme, after bureaucrats convinced him it was the most efficient way to meet Australia’s commitments. Both parties went to the 2007 election promising to implement such a scheme. It would prove no easier for Kevin Rudd, or Julia Gillard. Or for Malcolm Turnbull."
"Climate change is happening now and it’s happening faster and much worse than predicted. It’s threatening to the world we know and everything in it. It’s already killing people. This is beyond doubt or argument. We have just years to change course. If we manage it, we could save the world, at least the one we recognise. Realistically, the prognosis at the moment is that we won’t manage to steer the ship around in time.  So why have we, as people with everything to lose, not acted sooner? We have a global climate agreement and we know what needs to happen. This is a problem we know how to solve. But we aren’t acting with anywhere close to the urgency fit for the situation. Renewable energy is cheaper than the bad stuff anyway. Australia is a rich country with the means and the smarts to take on big challenges, so why aren’t we doing it? What will it take to get people to respond in a fitting way? It’s not surprising that in response to a problem this huge, this existential, people seek out something they can do, from using a keep cup to being fastidious with the recycling. It makes us feel better, it gives us something tangible to do, it stops us from despairing. But we need to admit that even if every plastic bottle and tin can ever produced was recycled, we’d still be on track for catastrophic climate change. No matter how many plastic straws are declined or ocean plastic turned into shoes, every indication points to our children never knowing coral reefs, the Arctic melting and the seas rising. It is liberalism’s most dangerous lie that an individual’s action can solve problems of this scale. So what should we be doing? Stop Adani. Do not let that mine go ahead. My baby who has not figured out that a triangle block goes through the triangle hole could probably figure this one out. We need less pollution in order to keep the world’s ecosystems functional. Digging more new coal to burn is bad maths. We cannot let new coalmines happen. Join a local action group, meet your MP, flick some cash to the people working on this full-time, lock yourself to a bulldozer – this one is really important and there’s a movement set up ready for people to join in and get involved. More important than any one person’s composting is government policy. Shortly after Australia signed the Paris agreement, Queensland relaxed its land-clearing laws, wiping out any reduction in our pollution that we had committed to in front of the world. We have a coal-smooching, wilfully ignorant prime minister and a government refusing to take on any climate leadership because it doesn’t fit in with their ideology. Conservatives began the conservation movement, but this current crop of conservative politicians are trying to keep coal plants like Liddell open that even the coal companies want closed.  Australia does not have an energy policy. This is not due to lack of knowledge or understanding. It’s due to lack of leadership and the influence of people who stand to make a buck now and will probably not be alive to see the worst of catastrophic climate change. That’s not something you can reason with. They’re simply not up to the job. So people need to act collectively. The first step is getting involved in this year’s election, when governments are most susceptible to influence. The most important thing we can do is try and influence government decisions. We urgently need to stem the flow of climate pollution into the atmosphere and absorb the pollution already out there on a scale that individuals can’t muster. When we sort our waste in our homes or remember our reusable shopping bags it’s helpful, but in itself it is not up to the challenge of stopping climate change. If we are going to respond to the problem at the scale and urgency that reality demands, we need to do more. School children going on strike demanding climate action provide a shining example of disruptive, urgent, agenda-setting activism. They acted like their lives depend on it – we all should. • Emily Mulligan is head of campaigns at GetUp"

The screenplay, written by Ben Elton, follows the playwright’s return to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1613 after the Globe theatre burns down.  On stage, the pure-voiced Olivier award-winner Sheila Atim, who starred in Girl from the North Country, has written the music for Chè Walker’s Time Is Love/Tiempo es Amor which opens, with Atim starring, at London’s Finborough theatre in the first week of January. Pitzhanger Manor & Gallery in Ealing, the Regency era country home of the architect Sir John Soane, reopens to the public in March after a £12m restoration project. Architecture will also mark 100 years since the founding of the Bauhaus movement with a book by Fiona MacCarthy about Walter Gropius, due this summer. The astonishing notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci are to be gathered under the British Library’s roof in June, with his Codex Leicester on display for the first time in Britain since it was bought by Bill Gates. And, while the biggest drum roll in the gallery world this winter is reserved for the Van Gogh show arriving at Tate Britain in late March, a fresh take on another troubled painter comes out in print the same month when the Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard launches his book, So Much Longing In So Little Space: The Art of Edvard Munch.

Iterations of the iPhone still account for the majority of its revenue, and with an entry point device costing £749, it feels increasingly like a company aimed at wealthy baby boomers. Throwing $100bn at next year’s revamp of Apple TV doesn’t feel like a new paradigm. Moreover, despite some recent deals with Amazon to get its services on Alexa devices, Apple has fallen behind and priced itself out of the burgeoning market for connected gadgets and digital assistants. Google Home or Alexa-based devices are increasingly embedded in homes (and cars) and often don’t play well with iPhones. Whether you are wired in to Apple, Google or Alexa has become like choosing a football team – you can only support one and it’s impossible to swap. Meanwhile, Facebook will be hoping its declining popularity in Europe doesn’t turn into a stampede if the EU’s investigations about data sharing result in enormous fines, the advertising it is introducing to WhatsApp in 2019 doesn’t prompt users to join other messaging services, and the cloning of Instagram’s Stories format by Facebook and YouTube doesn’t divert revenue and readers to other platforms.

And, in Portugal, England’s men will hope to win the inaugural Uefa Nations League, a triumph that could yet signify the end of 50-odd years of hurt, depending on the current tournament exchange rate for agonising nostalgia. The year in cricket will be dominated by the 50-over World Cup in England, followed almost directly by the Ashes, an epic-scale domestic double-bill that offers the summer game a chance to either dig its talons back into the national consciousness or confirm its own shift to the pay-TV periphery.

BR 1 January 2019 will – so the government says – be the last New Year’s Day that the United Kingdom spends as a member of the European Union. Both Theresa May and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insist we must honour the result of the 2016 referendum and end our membership on 29 March. That is in just under 13 weeks’ time. But whatever they say, the only thing that really is certain in British politics is that nothing is certain at all. Few new years have approached with so much up in the air. Much will be determined by what happens on Brexit – yet no one can be at all sure how Brexit will turn out. Will it go ahead as planned, be delayed, or stopped in its tracks? With parliament deadlocked and a no-deal outcome looming into view, there is increasing talk of pushing back the date, or holding another referendum to break the impasse. The other possibility is another general election. May clung on as prime minister before Christmas despite more than a third of Tory backbenchers in her deeply divided party saying they have no confidence in her. But, if she fails to get her own Brexit deal through parliament in January and if any of the three scenarios outlined above happen, it is hard to imagine how she could survive. Labour, too, is divided on Brexit. For the first time since becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn is coming under fire within his party for refusing to oppose Britain leaving the EU and throw his weight behind a new public vote. The centre ground, meanwhile, is wide open. Increasingly there is talk of discontented Labour and Tory MPs, perhaps backed by Liberal Democrats, forming a new centrist party from the political rubble left by Brexit. One to watch: Amber Rudd. She is now back in the cabinet as work and pensions secretary. Although she is a strong Remainer, few are better placed to succeed Theresa May if she does not survive 2019 as prime minister. TH The new year gets off to an ominous start with the inauguration on Tuesday of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to accelerate mining and agribusiness exploitation of the Amazon, the world’s biggest rainforest. Scientific attention may also be focused on the Arctic, where meteorologists will be watching to see if last winter’s high temperatures were a one-off or a disturbing new trend caused by a weakened polar vortex. If weather forecasters are correct, 2019 could also be another El Niño year, which means many parts of the world could also be in for another summer of heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, coral bleaching and forest fires. This will be a crucial year to determine how fast humanity can respond to the growing threat. On 23 September, the UN secretary-general António Guterres will convene a climate summit to urge government leaders to raise their emissions-cutting ambitions, followed on 11 November by the next regular conference of the climate talks, hosted by Chile. Environmental issues will increasingly shape and be shaped by politics. Buffeted by the gilet jaunes protests, the French president Emmanuel Macron has promised to put climate and biodiversity high on the agenda of the G7 summit he will host in Biarritz from 25-27 August. If the fossil-fuel championing Donald Trump survives the arrests of his former aides, he is likely to push back against a new bipartisan climate bill and continue unravelling pollution controls for national parks. In China, President Xi Jinping’s promise to create an “ecological civilisation” will be tested by the massive infrastructure investment of the Belt and Road Initiative. Globally, the big question will be whether emissions can finally start to fall after two years of rapid growth. If not, expect fiercer protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and 350.org. One to watch: Greta Thunberg. In September the Swedish teenager began a solo climate protest by going on strike from school, and more than 20,000 students around the world have joined her. Who knows what she’ll do next – but you can be sure it’ll make the headlines. JW  Forecasters have struggled to achieve a consensus about the prospects for 2019. The International Monetary Fund has warned that it could be a terrible year with much of the postwar financial infrastructure being torn apart. Washington’s policy initiatives threaten to jam the cogs of international trade, making companies circumspect about pushing into new markets. Uncertainty over a Brexit deal, the US-China trade tariffs stand-off – which could escalate in the coming weeks after a 90-day moratorium ends – and the battles between Brussels and Italy’s new radical right administration also threaten the old order. Since the 2008 crash, the west has relied on the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey to drive growth, but each is going through political upheaval and struggling to maintain momentum. China, in particular, borrowed heavily from its own banks and the more shadowy elements of the financial sector to fund investment. After a crackdown on easy money, it’s not clear how strong the economy’s growth will be in the future. Yet the IMF, which failed to predict the last crash, stands accused of over-reacting to every morsel of poor economic news. Analysts at Oxford Economics are among many who predict 2019 as a period of steady if unspectacular growth. In this outlook, Donald Trump is more bluster than action, China gets back on track and British politicians will secure a deal or a delay for another referendum vote. The Italian government is already on the road to patching up its differences with Brussels. The worst is already in the past. One to watch: Jerome Powell, the US central bank chief. If Fed rates continue to rise in 2019, money will be sucked into the US from across the world. Developing countries will struggle to find the funds they need to grow. Markets will become more volatile and global growth will slow. If Powell eases back, it will look like he has capitulated to Trump’s bullying, and the Fed’s independence will be in question. Whatever he does, it will have huge implications. PI Robert Mueller’s FBI inquiry into Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia during and after the 2016 US presidential election is expected to conclude in 2019. A key question is to what extent Trump may have lied and conspired to obstruct justice. Faced by similar accusations, Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, rather than be impeached. But Trump may try to brazen it out. Newly empowered Democrats in Congress will increase the pressure, just as the race for the 2020 election kicks off. Expect fireworks. Europe faces great uncertainty. EU parliamentary elections in May may produce further gains for far-right populist and Eurosceptic parties. Key “mainstream” leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron begin the year in a weakened state; the former has been replaced as leader of the CDU by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. If there is no Brexit deal, April in Britain could be the cruellest month. Bashar al-Assad’s vow to retake “every inch” of Syrian territory implies an all-out assault is coming on Idlib, the last hold-out province. Many Syrians in Turkey and Jordan appear poised to return home – if the war ends. But the unresolved problem of migrants travelling via north Africa will stoke tensions in Europe. The terrorist threat from Islamic State may intensify as it regroups in Iraq and the Sahel. Efforts to halt the Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict in Yemen will be a race against time. The UN says millions face famine and disease. Much may depend on what happens to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo shows signs of becoming an emergency. China will exploit the geopolitical vacuum caused by America’s distractions as trade tensions persist. Elections are due in India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, Argentina and Israel. Northern Syria, Taiwan, Venezuela, Cameroon, and Israel’s borderlands are likely 2019 hotspots. Russia-Ukraine enmities will cause more trouble. One to watch: Iran is in Trump’s cross-hairs, and he could escalate confrontation in 2019 to shift attention from his domestic troubles. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing bribery and corruption allegations, and the Saudi leadership is under withering fire over Yemen and the Khashoggi affair. Both might welcome a chance to bolster their positions by settling scores with Tehran. If hardliners in Iran gain the upper hand and resume nuclear activities banned in 2015, the consequences will be unpredictable – and dangerous. ST The new year will begin in spectacular scientific style when the US probe New Horizons sweeps past the tiny world of Ultima Thule. It will have travelled 4 billion miles to reach the piece of rock about 20 miles in diameter, left over from the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. The data from New Horizons could revolutionise our understanding of planet formation. Further space adventures for 2019 will include the launch of China’s Chang’e 5, a robot mission to collect rocks from the moon, while the US will return to putting humans in space when Elon Musk’s Space X company launches its manned capsule Dragon, and Boeing puts its CST-100 Starliner into orbit. Both will carry crew to the International Space Station. Next year should also see the results of efforts by scientists working on the Event Horizon project to produce images of the super-massive black lurking hole at the centre of our galaxy. The chief medical officer, Sally Davies, has been instructed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to produce guidelines in the spring on the maximum time young people should spend on social media. Given the lack of research in this area it will be interesting to see what her recommendations will be. One to watch: He Jiankui. The Chinese scientist shocked the world this year when he claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies. He is now under pressure to reveal details of his work, which created an outcry because of the ethical questions it raises. RM"

"Across the world’s land masses, measured wind speeds have been mysteriously weakening for the past 50 or so years, in some regions slowing down by as much as 25%. Several studies have come to the same conclusion, using wind observations from weather stations across the world. Strangely, the slowdown seems to be happening largely over land. Over the oceans the phenomenon is less pronounced, with some areas even showing an acceleration. One suggestion is that climate change is partly to blame by altering patterns in the global atmospheric circulation. Another suggestion is that urban development and more vegetation is creating a rougher ground surface that slows winds. However, winds have slowed down across Saudi Arabia, mostly desert, which probably means this is only part of the answer. Now an EU-funded project is trawling through historical records back to the 1880s to find out whether this phenomenon is part of a much longer climate cycle. Whatever the cause, the slowdown is worrying. Slower winds can affect plant growth and also make it more difficult for air pollution in big cities to dissipate. Wind turbines may also be affected but it is not clear whether this “stilling” is confined to surface winds or whether it reaches up to turbine height."
"The sea otters of Elkhorn Slough float by on their backs, greeting the occasional kayaker with unwanted socializing that can tip a boat. Chubby harbor seals lounge on large rocks and a great blue heron stands tall among hundreds of birds on a sliver of land. This Monterey Bay estuary south of San Francisco hosts about 20,000 migratory shorebirds a year and is a nursery habitat for fish and shellfish. It’s notable for having bolstered the waning population of the curious southern sea otters, which now exceed 100 and are webcast live daily. California is one of the most biodiverse states and its coast hosts most of its native species. Estuaries like Elkhorn Slough, where saltwater and freshwater meet, also filter pollution, reduce flooding and erosion and trap greenhouse gases. But as the seas encroach due to climate change and rising water levels, governments and conservationists are asking themselves: where will the coastal habitats go? If they retreat farther inland, they will meet cliffs, condos and farms. With intensive planning, minimally undeveloped land could be conserved to accommodate them. Without it, the west coast of the United States could lose a significant number of its unique ecosystems. “The coast of California that we know today is not going to be the coast of California of the future,” says Walter Heady, a coastal marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy. More than two-thirds of Californians live in coastal counties, and manmade pressures from development and pollution make it hard enough to protect coastal habitats, Heady said. Sea-level rise will only increase the challenge. The Nature Conservancy partnered with a state agency, the California State Coastal Conservancy, to assess how a sea-level rise of 5ft (1.5 metres) would threaten the 3,427 miles where land meets water along the coast in the state. In total, 59% of California’s coastal habitat is at risk, according to the group’s study of 40 different types of habitats, including estuaries, as well as beaches, tide pools and terrestrial areas. Reserving minimally developed land for those habitats to move into could spare more than half the losses, the assessment concludes. “We’re not trying to land-grab here, and it’s not my idea that all agriculture or golf courses or minimally developed lands should become habitat,” Heady said. “It’s a really small proportion of that human land use, and it could mitigate 61% of our losses.” Four state agencies, two regional groups, four counties and two cities have signed on to conservation commitments spurred by the assessment. “To my mind, this was an incredibly important tool that we need to acknowledge and to take into account and think through in all of our decision-making,” said Deborah Halberstadt, executive director of one of the state agencies, the California Ocean Protection Council. Halberstadt said until recently ocean and coastal issues have not been a primary focus in the climate change advocacy world. Estuaries in particular tend to be “some of the least-funded geographies”, she said. Halberstadt’s agency advises the governor and legislature on coastal matters and is looking to fund work focused on estuaries.  “The more we can do now, the less expensive it will be in the future because we will have addressed some of the issues, but it’s sometimes harder to get funding prospectively,” she said. Experts say that is the key problem with conserving coastal habitats: it’s hard to get people to proactively protect the places where those habitats will need to move as the seas rise. “If you’re a farmer who’s got very productive land, at what point do you pull the ripcord?” said Mark Silberstein, the executive director of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation. Silberstein has worked with nearby farms to retire their less productive acres of land that were using millions of gallons of water that would otherwise be buffering aquifers from salt water intrusion. In Oxnard, a city west of Los Angeles, farmland is likely to become wetlands. Farmers are not allowed to sell their land for development, said Carmen Ramirez, mayor pro tem of the city. “You can’t really farm on land that’s underwater, particularly saltwater. So it’s little by little going to be converted to wetlands anyway, like it or not,” Ramirez said. As sea-level rise quickens, local governments can have trouble keeping up. The state now recommends considering the possibility that if greenhouse gas levels are very high and ice melt increases, seas could rise 10ft by 2100. That would be 30 to 40 times faster than in the last century. While that is an extreme, California guidance says governments can’t afford to not plan for the worst-case scenario. In Santa Cruz, the projections are looking worse and worse for West Cliff Drive, a seafront street on a bluff that may have to be narrowed or abandoned. Tiffany Wise-West, sustainability manager for Santa Cruz, said the city will plan based on the state figures, its own vulnerability findings and the Nature Conservancy’s assessment. “This is the first time we’ve actually had an understanding of which habitats are vulnerable to climate change impacts,” Wise-West said."
"The output of British power stations fell this year to levels last seen almost a quarter of a century ago, while renewables achieved a record share of the UK electricity supply. Electricity generation in 2018 was the lowest since 1994, when Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour party. The reduced need for power came despite there being 8 million more people living in the UK. Analysts said the figures were a sign of increasingly efficient use of energy and the country’s changing economy. The UK website Carbon Brief, which analysed government and industry data, found that 335 terawatt-hours were generated by power plants last year, down by about 1% on the year before. Since 2005 the level has fallen by 16% – or the equivalent of two and a half Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations. Simon Evans, policy editor at the group, said: “It could be a combination of more efficient appliances, energy-saving lightbulbs and, more recently, LEDs. Then there’s supermarkets installing better fridges, industry using more efficient pumps. Across all of those businesses, efficiency will have been going up. And of course there’s the changing nature of industry in the UK.” The financial crisis could also have played a role in making homes and businesses more careful with their energy use, he added. While generation fell almost every year between 2008 and 2014, it remained stable between 2015 and 2017, before resuming its downward march in 2018. Previous research by the government’s climate change advisers has found that more energy efficient appliances helped save the average household £290 a year between 2008 and 2017. Continuing to use energy more efficiently would help the UK reach its binding climate goals, Evans said. “Using less as an end in itself isn’t the point. But it is the case that meeting carbon targets is made easier if we use energy efficiently.” Separate data from the National Grid showed that 2018 was the greenest year to date for electricity generation as more power is sourced from renewable sources and less from coal. The carbon intensity from electricity generation was down 6.8% last year and has more than halved since 2013. The analysis by Carbon Brief found that renewable sources including biomass, hydro, solar and wind power supplied a record 33% of electricity this year, up from 29% last year. Renewables were just 6.7% of the mix in 2009. Green energy was boosted primarily by new windfarms connecting to the grid, as well as new biomass plants, which included the conversion of a coal unit at Drax power station in north Yorkshire and the conversion of a former coal plant at Lynemouth, Northumberland. Meanwhile the coal-driven output was down 25% despite warnings of a coal comeback driven by high gas prices. Nuclear power also had a weak year, with generation down 8%, mainly due to ageing reactors being taken offline for safety checks. Gas remained the top source of electricity supplies, but fell 4%."
"The call from Extinction Rebellion for the BBC to make global warming its top editorial priority should be welcomed (Letters, 17 December). The BBC is journalistically objective when reporting global warming. If a scientist or activist talks on air about the human causes of climate change then someone else, often from one of the denial groups funded by the fossil fuel lobby, is usually invited to provide a “counterargument” (for example, that recent warming is caused by “natural” factors). This leaves many viewers with the erroneous impression that a genuine scientific is debate taking place and weakens social support for strong measures to address climate change, which is precisely what the organised denial lobby wants.  It is time for the BBC to abandon this illusion of impartiality. Global warming demands a new ethos of public service broadcasting. Scientific evidence has made it unambiguously clear that contemporary climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. There is no scientific equivalence, and certainly no moral equivalence, between what climate scientists have concluded and what the deniers assert. The only scientific debate left is on the scale and pace of change. How bad will it be; and how soon? And how should we respond? The BBC should commit itself to upscaling its coverage of global warming and working with other media to ensure that the public is accurately and fully informed on the most pressing public welfare challenge of this century.David HumphreysProfessor of environmental policy, The Open University • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"You warn of the fears of the wilting economy (More retail gloom as Asos warns on profits, 18 December), quite rightly the main concern at the moment being the loss of jobs. The loss of share value and company profits are also mentioned. But nowhere do you discuss this in the wider terms of climate change. If the downturn in the economy means that there is less consumerism, then that is a good thing for the planet. The only way we are going to tackle the rising temperature and the ensuing disastrous results is to live simpler lifestyles; this means consuming much less of everything and not being so dependent on a capitalist society where a drop in sales is seen as a disaster. It is sad that it has taken the mismanagement of this government to reduce consumerism; but more needs to be done with regard to education, enforcement and information about the effects of shipping produce all around the world. Until a drop in the retail market is seen as a benefit, there is no hope.Jackie JonesBrighton  • Michael Gove’s proposals for waste (Packaging producers to pay full recycling costs under waste scheme, 18 December) could progress faster, but they are welcome. However, the processing of currently non-recyclable plastic is not properly addressed. This is “all the other plastic crap that we burn”, as a senior manager in the recycling industry once told me. Included in this are toothpaste tubes, used Biros, crisp and chocolate wrappers, bits of toys, disposable razors, “string” bags for satsumas and onions etc. Every kilo burned creates three kilos of CO2, but it’s technically recyclable using a process called pyrolysis, which takes any plastic waste and converts it into diesel fuel or new plastic. The items are small; scaled up, the volume is large. I have filled a two-litre drinks bottle every week. In developing countries, people cram it into plastic bottles with a stick to make ecobricks for construction. There’s limited potential for these as building material in the UK, but they could be brought into our recycling stream. I’m doubtful that current sorting processes can extract these bits and pieces, but if households were to change their habits and always have a plastic bottle on the go, they could be collected weekly as a clean source of renewable material that is easy to handle. Furthermore, children love doing it. Schools could make it part of every school day and receive incentives or rewards for the carbon captured and hydrocarbon reused. The environmental lesson would be of immense value.Patrick CosgroveChapel Lawn, Shropshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Michael Bloomberg slammed Donald Trump’s inaction on climate change on Sunday and said any candidate for president in 2020 – he himself might be one – must have a plan to deal with the problem. At the same time, retiring California governor Jerry Brown likened the fight against climate change to the fight against Nazism during the second world war, saying: “We have an enemy … perhaps very much devastating in a similar way.” Both men appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press. The billionaire former New York mayor said: “It would be a lot more helpful if we had a climate champion rather than a climate denier in the White House. “You know, I’ve always thought Trump has a right to his opinions. But he doesn’t have a right to his own facts.” A vocal critic of the coal industry, Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at $40bn and who spent $100m on his last mayoral race, has said he plans to make climate change a leading issue in the 2020 race, whether or not he runs. “Any candidate for federal office better darn well have a plan to deal with the problem that the Trump science advisers say could, basically, end this world,” he said. “I can tell you one thing, I don’t know whether I’m going to run or not, but I will be out there demanding that anybody that’s running has a plan.” Bloomberg paid his latest visit to Iowa, site of the first voting in the presidential election cycle, earlier this month. Joining him in a call on Sunday to make climate change a national priority was Brown, a presidential hopeful in the past now standing down after 16 years at the head of the Golden state. He said wildfires in California should serve as a wake-up call. “We see it in the fear in people’s eyes, as they fled, many elderly who died,” Brown told NBC. “This is real, it’s dangerous. And we’ve got to wake up the country, wake up the world.” Brown, one of the few governors to have implemented climate policy, compared the challenge of galvanizing public opinion to that faced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1941. “It took Roosevelt many, many years to get America willing to go into world war two and fight the Nazis,” he said. “Well, we have an enemy, though different, but perhaps very much devastating in a similar way.” Brown echoed Bloomberg’s criticism of the president. “He is very convinced of his position,” Brown said of Trump. “And his position is that there’s nothing abnormal about the fires in California or the rising sea level or all the other incidents of climate change.” Brown contended that US economic wellbeing, conventionally trumpeted by the Trump administration, was the key issue on which Americans should vote. “We’ve got to get off this idea, ‘It’s the economy, stupid,” he said. “No, it’s the environment.” Seventy per cent of Americans believe “global warming” is happening, according to polling cited by NBC, but only 57% believe climate change is caused by humans. A rejection of the human role in climate change is a central plank for political leaders who refuse to back environmental regulations and other policies to confront the problem. “The world is getting hotter,” Bloomberg said. “There are bigger storms than ever before; there are droughts where we used to have floods and vice-versa; our water is getting less; and we’ve got to do something about it. “The challenge is what we do about it. And the opportunity is the value of what we do.”"

"Consider the plight of the satirist. I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really. The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were: 1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend. 2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects.  3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power. 4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend. 5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia. 6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed. 7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians. Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters. The Brexit endgame Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter divisions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders. Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice. I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles. Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone. It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that diversity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all. The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”. And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac. Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath. Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks. Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea. A Saudi Arabian horror show The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing. You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis; they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous; it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon. The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase. We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car. Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop. Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays; sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop; in China, a government official; and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand. Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty. There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful. Trump trumps himself Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished. Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour; it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison. The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands. What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.) Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president; it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided. Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent. There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators. With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages. A climate of fear At least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”. Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact. The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth. Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason. I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed. Consider the plight of the satirist. • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."

"Many agree that one of the most pressing problems the world faces today is climate change. The question of what to do about it, however, has become highly politicised. Scepticism about climate change is typically a conservative position and trust in the conclusions of the scientific community a more progressive one. While this politicisation is perhaps most evident in the United States, it is well known in many other countries. But this wasn’t always the case. Between 1972 and 1995, a US agency named the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) existed to provide the practical means to help overcome such politicisation. During its 23-year existence, the OTA was in a unique position to assist members of Congress in understanding complex issues in science and technology.  The OTA was a non-partisan agency governed by a technology assessment board which consisted of of equal numbers of senators and representatives and equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. Its assessments strove for objectivity and comprehensiveness, and were considered state-of-the-art documents by many. The OTA provided Congress, at its request, with the information and options it needed for the issues with which it was grappling, but it was careful never to tell Congress what it should do. The methodology that OTA used was widely admired and imitated in the parliamentary units that many European countries established following OTA’s lead. In the early 1990s there was still Congressional interest in taking action on climate change, which most of the scientific community already understood would become a major problem if not addressed. Thus, in October 1993, the OTA published a two-volume, 700-page report, Preparing for an Uncertain Climate, at the request of three Congressional committees. I was a principal author. The report identified more than 100 options to help coastal areas, water resource systems, agriculture, wetlands, forests, and federally protected natural areas adapt to climate change. Not only that, but the OTA had also proposed – in its comprehensive 1991 assessment, Changing by Degrees – steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that would help the US avoid climate change. Imagine where we would be now if Congress had begun to address climate change at the time of these reports (and the early reports of other organisations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Instead, the OTA was abolished in 1995, shortly after Republicans retook control of Congress and Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House of Representatives. At the time, the OTA was one of the most respected agencies in Washington. Many reasons have been suggested for the move, but it mostly came down to a change in attitude towards the value of science and analysis in Congress. The OTA’s abolition was the proverbial canary in the coalmine with respect to the current anti-science attitude among many conservatives in and out of Congress. Since the 1990s, the pace of technological change has continued to accelerate, but few in Congress have the scientific or technological background to understand the new developments. Now more than ever, the US Congress, as well as legislative bodies in other countries, need sources of unbiased and comprehensive information and analysis they can trust. When Democrats retake control of the House in 2019, they will have an opportunity to re-establish the OTA or an agency like it to assist Congress with complex science and technology issues. Ideally, this should be done by Democrats and their Republican colleagues together, so that technology assessment can once again be a bipartisan benefit to Congress. Congress has already scheduled two days of hearings in January 2019 to consider how to respond to a changing climate. It would be well served if it could turn to its in-house technology assessment office for advice. Congress might ask a reconstituted OTA, for example, to assess the costs and benefits of implementing the provisions of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, a bipartisan bill which was recently introduced in both the US House and Senate. Climate change aside, the number of science and technology issues that may require legislative action continues to grow. A new OTA could also provide assistance, for example, on such issues as artificial intelligence, gene editing, cybersecurity, self-driving cars, alternative energy technologies, voting technologies, and dozens of other multifaceted issues that have, or should, come before Congress. These issues, of course, are of interest to countries other than the United States. The need for organisations in Europe and elsewhere that can provide impartial, non-partisan advice on the complicated science and technology issues of the day has never been greater. We live in an age that seems at times to dismiss expertise, while the problems that require complex solutions grow ever greater. The OTA was an important source of clarity and understanding until it was abolished. Had we instead retained its valuable services, we could surely have reduced or avoided many of the very serious problems we now face. In 2019, will the world prove able to heed this lesson? • William Westermeyer was a senior policy analyst for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment from 1982-95 and a principal author of the 1993 report Preparing for an Uncertain Climate  "
"Politicians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted, according to the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis. From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to “real, stark choices” in the years ahead.  “If you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, biodiversity loss – if you actually want a planet that’s inhabitable – then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,” Lewis said in an interview with the Guardian. Having returned to Labour’s frontbench a year ago, after resigning in protest when Jeremy Corbyn whipped MPs to support the triggering of article 50, Lewis was given the job of examining how a Labour government could champion sustainable economics. He has repeatedly made it clear he regards the issue as a test of political leadership. “I think there’s a crunch point now coming for politics. You often hear there’s no leadership in politics – and this isn’t a leadership pitch, I promise you – but when you talk about leadership, there’s leadership in different forms,” he said. On red meat, for example, Lewis said: “I’m not going to sit here and say, yeah, let’s ban red meat … but you can show leadership by asking, well actually, is it right that we publicly subsidise an industry that is contributing so much to greenhouse gas emissions, and often is a very unsustainable practice?” He said the government’s role should be to “encourage people and show leadership as to how we’re going to shift people’s eating habits on to a more sustainable footing”. On air travel, he said Labour was starting to come up with options, including a tax “escalator”, which would have the biggest impact on frequent fliers, who tend to be the wealthiest. In a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the “fourth industrial revolution” benefits the wider public. While many such policies are at an early stage of development, Lewis said the next Labour manifesto should be significantly different to the previous one. “The 2017 manifesto gave a lot of people a kind of warm, cuddly glow, and it was a great reset of our values and where we are, but it was a base on which to build,” he said. “The next manifesto needs to be a radical manifesto, which builds on the reset, and is 21st-century socialism in action. There’s a hunger for that.” McDonnell has asked the former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake to examine how to rework the Treasury green book – the manual for government spending decisions. Lewis said he hoped environmental sustainability could be incorporated into Whitehall thinking as part of that review. “The Treasury has been the instigator of selling off the green investment bank, of scuppering [the] Swansea tidal [lagoon power plant], of undermining the plastic tax and electric vehicles – because it simply sees things in a very short-term, revenue-generating manner,” he said. “What we want to do is open out how the Treasury looks at spending and revenue, and looks in a longer term, more holistic and sustainable way – and that is radical.” Lewis recently secured £17,500 from individual donors to fund his work on sustainable economics, giving him a measure of independence from the party machine. He argued that developing a more sustainable economic model could allow Britain to take a leadership role in the world after Brexit. “Leadership and punching above your weight doesn’t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries,” he said. Lewis was widely considered a rising star on the left of the party when he arrived in parliament in 2015, and was catapulted on to the frontbench by Corbyn, as many more experienced MPs refused to serve or were sent packing. But the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn’s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech. In late 2017, he apologised after video footage emerged of him using the phrase “get on your knees, bitch” at a party conference fringe event, and was then suspended – and cleared – over accusations that he groped a party member. Most recently, Lewis was criticised after miming putting a gun in his mouth during a debate in the House of Commons as a Conservative MP interrupted his frontbench colleague Anneliese Dodds. Lewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch. “I couldn’t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,” he said. He said he believed countering the human threats to the environment would have to mean junking “the obsession with flat-screen TVs and consumption”. “On their deathbed, do people think: ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my Ferrari’? Or do they say: ‘I wish I’d spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I’d spent more time country walking’? “It’s about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that,” he said. On Brexit, meanwhile, Lewis stuck rigidly to the party line, dismissing questions about what Labour would put in its manifesto if there were to be a snap general election as “hypothetical”."
"I was, frankly, nervous about speaking to people of faith in the south about climate change. I wrestled with my own preconceived notions and past experiences, and was surprised when conversations took inspiring, if not transcendent, turns. Secular as I am now, I still think fondly of my childhood minister, Dr Lehman, who loved college basketball and Honda Accords (he drove 13 of them during his lifetime). At the conclusion of each Lakeside Baptist service, he’d call the eastern North Carolina congregation to action. “Go forth,” he said as the organ began to play, “and be involved in the world.” My family later moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and my high school experience felt ripped from the pages of the Footloose script. Local parents disowned gay sons; classmates openly questioned the science of evolution in biology class; Young Life leaders plastered an Abstinence Pledge on the wall of our public school cafeteria. My frustration from those years has at times stopped me from reaching out to those in the faith-based community, especially regarding political issues like climate change. I’m aware of my own bias, the way it was formed by negative experiences, and how it limits my understanding of believers and their choices. This realization helps me understand why believers might in turn have problems connecting with someone like me. But if we’re going to address climate change in time to prevent catastrophic results, we’re going to do it by taking cooperative action with those with whom we disagree. I find myself wondering if similar discussions are happening in faith-based communities, and why there hasn’t been a more palpable response to climate change among people of faith in the south. While climate change scenarios have all the hallmarks of biblical narrative – violent storms, epic floods, plagues, resource scarcity, the displacement of people – it’s considered liberal political terrain. Scott Coleman, a practicing Baptist and the amiable environmental manager of Little St Simons Island, a mostly undeveloped strip of shoreline off the coast of Georgia, tells me that “environmental stewardship is often associated with liberal politics, thus looked upon negatively”. The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. The political power of the pulpit is undeniable, even in the post-Billy Graham south, where in many states nearly half of all citizens attend church services. I can’t help but imagine the sheer impact a faith-based movement could have on expediting climate action. Scott Coleman agrees. “I think that if our faith leaders in the south were more outspoken about the importance of creation care, it would go a long way in helping to depoliticize environmental issues in our region,” he says. “And if we could depoliticize environmental stewardship in the south, imagine the progress we could make with elevating environmental stewardship in southern culture.” I spoke with people of faith in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, and it became clear that the primary barrier to climate action is the fact that it’s been yoked with the liberal agenda. Climate activist and author Anna Jane Joyner, whose father is the pastor of a megachurch in North Carolina, writes that she grew up lumping “environmentalists in with hippies and liberals and all the other people who were probably going to hell”. Dr Lucas Johnston, a professor of religion and environment at Wake Forest University, explains that “there is a longstanding antipathy toward environmental sentiments in Christian, and especially evangelical circles, because they have, for centuries, been imagined as pernicious and dangerous, and possibly bordering on paganism.” I asked former six-term South Carolina Republican congressman Bob Inglis why discussing climate change is so difficult in the south. A proponent of growing the eco-right and setting the free market upon the challenges of climate change, he called the environmental movement a bird with a left wing so large it can’t fly straight. Climate change is “rarely talked about in the language of conservatism”, he explained. “If you want someone to have a conversion moment, it helps for them to hear it in their own language, from someone they trust.” Inglis has been trying to start the conversation in conservative southern circles since having his own conversion moment on a trip to Antarctica in 2006. A scientist drilled into the ice, and Inglis saw, firsthand, the Industrial Revolution’s impact on the ice record, which revealed a long period of stability with a sudden uptick in carbon dioxide levels. He accepted then that burning fossil fuels changed the chemistry of the atmosphere. He was later booed at public events for stating his belief in climate change. We reject the notion that God gave us the Earth to do with whatever we please. While in office, Inglis introduced a Raise Wages, Cut Carbon bill. Though grounded in science and conservative economic principles, his efforts were seen as subversive by Tea Party opponents, who essentially implied his bill would destroy civilization. “I had crossed the line of orthodoxy,” he said. There’s a perceived social and political cost to speaking up about climate issues among people of faith in the south. Roughly half of the southerners I spoke with felt that people in the south avoided talking about climate change altogether because it was awkward and politically divisive. Mary Beene, a pastor in Savannah, notes that “in our congregation, it was a more controversial topic than race or sexuality”. She observed that some women in the south who believed in climate change worried “it simply would not be polite to challenge what the men … were saying in public.” Indeed, white male evangelicals are still dominating the conversation and decision-making power structures. Watch, for example, this clip from a 2014 GOP Senate primary debate in North Carolina, where four contenders, including Senator Thom Tillis, deny that manmade activity influences climate change in under one minute. Tillis, whom the Center for Responsive Politics reports as having received over $260,000 from oil, gas and coal interests, won the Senate seat, with 63% of his voters identifying as evangelicals or born-again Christians. Ninety-five percent of them were white. According to Pew, 77% of Hispanic Catholics are likely to say human activity has contributed to the Earth’s warming. Religiously unaffiliated (64%) and black Protestants (56%) are also likely to tie climate change to human activity. Pew points out that “fewer white mainline Protestants (41%) view climate change as primarily due to human activity … white evangelical Protestants are least likely to hold this view.” When Rabbi Rachael Bregman moved to Brunswick, Georgia, she was told: hurricanes don’t happen here. Then she evacuated for both Irma and Matthew. “Both of the evacuations were on top of the holy days where we say the words of the Unataneh Tokef,” she tells me. “It’s a prayer which asks, ‘who by fire, who by water … who by drowning’ regarding the end of one’s life. Those questions felt very real and not metaphorical.” Her synagogue is 12 feet above sea level and a half-mile from the ocean’s edge. During recent hurricanes, they “evacuated our five Torah scrolls, locked the doors and hoped for the best for our 130-year-old building. What has surprised me,” she says, “is how little has changed and how little environmental activism sprang up as a result.” Bregman, like many I talked to, has witnessed climate change firsthand and is eager to see more responsiveness in the faith-based community. She has made personal changes, like switching to an electric car; greening up at the synagogue; and offering a sermon on climate change. Tony Lankford, the senior pastor at the First Baptist church in Saint Simons, has also improved the church’s energy and water use, and organized a Coastal Green Team Summit for faith leaders to discuss climate change. There is a lack of emphasis on climate change in the South due to a lack of knowledge. We often experience it but, we don’t know how to articulate what we experience. Lankford feels that “regardless of political or theological leanings, there is agreement upon the basic tenet that God formed all of this beauty around us, and scripture [Genesis 1-2] gives us a responsibility to be stewards of that creation. For me, thus, mismanagement and abuse of creation is not only immoral or unethical, but is sinful.” The majority of southern believers I spoke to reported never hearing climate change mentioned in a sermon, but, like Lankford, could ground feelings about protecting the Earth in scripture, and felt that there was a strong moral imperative to protect the planet and its inhabitants. Several mentioned Dr Katharine Wilkinson’s book Between God and Green: How Evangelicals Are Cultivating a Middle Ground on Climate Change as helping them articulate a scriptural basis for taking climate action in the future. When Bob Inglis – someone with whom I probably disagree on several core issues – spoke with reverence about seeing an Australian scientist evangelize about the natural world at the Great Barrier Reef, I could recognize his passion for the natural world as my own. Sometimes, common ground gets lost in semantics. Inglis gave me the rational and the emotional case for his conversion from skeptic to climate change believer. The emotional case is what has stayed with me most since our talk, and is one I hope other skeptics manage to hear from their children, like Inglis did. His son once told him, lovingly: “Be relevant to my future. Show some courage.” A note from the author: I started this column with the intention of joining a conversation I knew was already happening in the south, and your emails helped make that a reality last week. I heard from retired marine biologists in Arkansas, philanthropists in Georgia, theologists in Virginia, poets and boat captains in Louisiana, lawyers in Florida, clean air activists in Mississippi. I also heard from climate change deniers, brand marketers, and … an old boyfriend. I want to witness and listen to the south as it really is - not just how I want it to be. I’m doing my best to stay curious and open-minded and look forward to your continued responses. I hit the road in January, with an eye toward Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. What should I see there? "
"The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, has appointed the Florida representative Kathy Castor to lead a special committee on climate change that will be reinstated in the new Congress. The climate panel is similar to one that Pelosi created when Democrats last controlled the House, from 2007 to 2011. It was eliminated when Republicans took the majority. Pelosi, the likely House speaker, said Castor brings experience, energy and “urgency to the existential threat of the climate crisis” facing the US and the world. Castor is set to begin her seventh term representing the Tampa Bay area and serves on the energy and commerce committee. “Congresswoman Castor is a proven champion for public health and green infrastructure, who deeply understands the scope and seriousness of this threat. Her decades of experience in this fight, both in Florida and in the Congress, will be vital,” Pelosi said. Castor said in a statement that she was honored to lead the panel and pledged to “act with urgency to reduce carbon pollution” and “unleash” American ingenuity to create clean-energy jobs. “The costs of the changing climate and extreme weather events pose greater risks every day to American families, businesses and our way of life,” Castor said. She added that the new panel “will tackle the crisis head on. Failure is not an option.” The membership and exact scope of the panel remain to be determined, but Pelosi said it would play a key role in shaping how Congress responds to the threat of global warming while creating good-paying, “green” jobs. The Maryland representative Steny Hoyer, the incoming House majority leader, said last week the climate committee would probably not have legal authority to demand documents under subpoena. But he added that he did not think the panel would need subpoena authority, since experts will be “dying to come before them”. Climate scientists and other experts “are going to want to testify”, Hoyer said. “I think they’ll want to give the best information as it relates to the crisis.” The Democratic representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and other progressives, have pushed for a “Green New Deal” that includes thousands of jobs in renewable energy such as wind and solar power. She and other leaders say the climate panel is a key platform to advance the green agenda. The headline on this piece was changed on 29 December 2018, to correctly identify the Florida representative Kathy Castor"
"A newly discovered blind and burrowing amphibian is to be officially named Dermophis donaldtrumpi, in recognition of the US president’s climate change denial. The name was chosen by the boss of EnviroBuild, a sustainable building materials company, who paid $25,000 (£19,800) at an auction for the right. The small legless creature was found in Panama and EnviroBuild’s Aidan Bell said its ability to bury its head in the ground matched Donald Trump’s approach to global warming. Trump’s distinctive hair has already led to comparisons to a poisonous furry caterpillar and a golden-plumed pheasant, while a yellow-crowned moth was called Neopalpa donaldtrumpi in 2017. Climate change is already harming Americans’ lives, from wildfires to floods, and will get worse, according to a US government report published in November. Trump’s response to the report was: “I don’t believe it.” The only event his administration put on at the recent UN climate summit in Poland extolled the virtues of fossil fuels, to cries of “shame on you” from protesters. The newly discovered creature is a caecilian and its naming rights were auctioned to raise money for the Rainforest Trust. The scientists who found the 10cm amphibian have agreed to use the name Dermophis donaldtrumpi when they officially publish the discovery in scientific literature. Bell said: “It is the perfect name. Caecilian is taken from the Latin caecus, meaning ‘blind’, perfectly mirroring the strategic vision President Trump has consistently shown towards climate change.” As an amphibian, the shiny animal is particularly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and is therefore in danger of becoming extinct as a result of its namesake’s climate policies, the Rainforest Trust said. Chris Redston, the executive director of Rainforest Trust UK, said: “Protecting the world’s remaining rainforests is acknowledged as one of the most effective ways to mitigate climate change, yet every day nearly 70,000 acres of rainforest are destroyed forever. “This destruction is not only one of the main causes of climate change, but it is also having a devastating impact on endangered wildlife, indigenous communities and the planet’s weather patterns.”"
"The Spanish sculptor Isaac Cordal sees the city as his playground. He specialises in miniature street art, producing tiny figures as a social commentary on the spaces they inhabit. “My work is a filter to try to understand and change the world we have created,” Cordal says. His sculptures, about 15cm in height, often represent a social stereotype as a critical observation on capitalism, power and bureaucracy. In one installation in a puddle in Hackney, east London, for example, a group of men dressed in suits with apathetic expressions represent “a very archaic form of patriarchy, and capitalism”, he says. Cordal first models the sculptures in clay then reproduces them in cement. “As a material, it seems very symbolic because it is one of our most recognisable footprints against nature,” he says. “Today we have turned cities into a kind of natural habitat.” For several years he’s been working on the project, Cement Eclipses, referring to the state when a building covers the sun: “It’s a critical reflection on the idea of progress.” These tiny cement figures have appeared in cities across Europe, found sitting on top of bus shelters or drowning in gutters, small interventions in the big city. “The street became a perfect setting in which I could find infinite semantic landscapes on a small scale,” he says. “Due to their small size and colour they blend really well into the urban environment. They even normally go unseen by passersby. I’m very interested in that moment of surprise when someone accidentally discovers them. “Nowadays there is a fear of not being seen in the public realm, so everything is always big and bold. We become a product of this and do not focus in as much. I think it is good to pay attention to small details and my work is a reward for those who do.” His work can be seen on the Instagram account @isaaccordal.

"A future Labour government would oversee an economic revolution to tackle the climate crisis, using the full power of the state to decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs in struggling towns and cities. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary who is driving the party’s climate agenda, said the UK’s “entire society and entire economy” needed to be refocused to meet the looming challenge of ecological breakdown.  “It could not be made clearer to us and people are starting to realise how incredibly dangerous this situation is,” said Long-Bailey, a close ally of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell. “There is no option but to radically transform our economy.” But, in an interview with the Guardian, she said the crisis was also an opportunity to bring well-paid, highly skilled jobs and economic regeneration to some of the most marginalised communities in the country. “We have to tackle climate change in a really radical way, the evidence is crystal clear,” said Long-Bailey. “But this is also a wonderful opportunity to invest in those towns and cities that have felt neglected for a very long time … this has to be – and will be – a genuine transformation of the economy.” Labour’s plan has echoes the Green New Deal being advocated by leftwing Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in the US. And Long-Bailey said the experience of the French president Emmanuel Macron – who has faced widespread protests in part over new environmental taxes – showed that action on the environment must be part of a wider programme of social and economic regeneration. “If you knocked on a door in Salford, where I am from, although most people care about climate change it is not going to be top of their list of priorities. Most people just want to know how their life is going to be improved. “So it is important for us to position ourselves as a party that is going to tackle climate change but turn that into an economic opportunity for the vast areas of this country that have seen decades of underinvestment and provide jobs for the future and provide that revitalisation that communities want to see.” Corbyn put a radical green agenda at the forefront of his conference speech this year and a senior source in the leaders office said both he and McDonnell were “100% committed” to implementing the transformative agenda laid out by Long-Bailey as soon as Labour were in office. The party’s current target is to get 60% of the UK’s energy from renewable sources by 2030 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century. But Long-Bailey said they needed to be “even more ambitious” and set targets for areas of the economy beyond energy, from heavy industries like iron, steel and chemicals to agriculture and land use. “[Tackling climate breakdown] is one of the central pillars of our industrial strategy … it will take a huge amount of work and we know it is ambitious – but we also know it is not ambitious enough in light of what we heard from the IPCC report – so we know we have got to move very, very quickly on this.” Labour has brought together a team of experts including leading industry figures, engineers, scientists, consultants and academics, who will report back with a comprehensive plan in the new year, outlining what a sustainable energy mix would look like, how to achieve it – and what benefits in terms of jobs and investment it would bring. Initial findings from the group suggest that to meet its current targets, Labour would by 2030 need to: increase the UK’s installed offshore wind capacity sevenfold bring all 24m homes in the UK up to the highest efficiency standard triple the UK’s installed solar capacity But Long-Bailey said this was just the start, with next year’s report likely to add a raft of new radical policy proposals. “They are working on a very detailed report at the moment about what our future energy mix needs to look like to hit these targets – we are talking about offshore and onshore wind and solar – but it is obviously going to go much further than that. “This is about so much more than just the energy supply, it is about developing the supply chains and the manufacturing base so we can export our expertise around the world.” Long-Bailey, seen as a rising star in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, said the influx of new, often younger members, had energised the party’s environmentalism and said it could no longer be viewed as “luxury item”, to be dealt with as a separate policy issue. Instead it was “now embedded into the DNA of every of every single department and every single economic decision we make”. “It can no longer be a message that if you want to help the climate it is enough to buy sustainable products or source your energy from renewable providers – we have gone beyond that. “It is critical that our entire society and our entire economy is centred around this mission to tackle climate change … and the really exciting thing is if we do it right we can also improve the long-term prospects of people in this country.” Part of the challenge, Long-Bailey said, is to paint a picture of the positive future that is possible if society successfully meets the challenge of climate breakdown, as well as being honest about the potentially disastrous consequences of failure. “When I was little I used to get this magazine called Quest,” she said. “It had science and glimpses into what the future might be like and I used to get excited and think … “Wow, I could be a scientist or an explorer.” She said it was time to create that excitement and optimism about the future again. “So in Salford we need to be telling people that by tackling climate change we can have a factory that is going to create wind turbines, is going to manufacture parts for offshore wind and show them that their child in the local school can become an engineer, that they will get proper pay and be in a job that is secure, well valued, with trade unions involved so they have that security and a collective voice,” she said. “Ultimately people need to know that their kids can have a really good, full and interesting life if we get this right.”"
"The discarded slices of pizza that litter New York’s streets have long fuelled its sizeable population of rats, but now the city’s growing swarm has a new reason to enjoy their home – warming temperatures. City officials have reported an increasing number of calls from residents complaining about rats, and have warned that milder winters are helping them feed and mate longer into the year. And as winters warm up, more frequent outdoor activity by humans is adding to the litter rats thrive upon. Rat-related complaints have been on the rise over the past four years, with 19,152 calls made to the city last year, an increase of about 10% on 2016. There are no reliable figures on the number of rats in New York – estimates range from 250,000 to tens of millions – but the surge in rat activity has been replicated in other cities. Houston, Washington, Boston and Philadelphia have experienced large increases in calls to pest control. Veteran anti-rat strategists have, in part, blamed climate change. “It’s a complex issue but we are seeing rat population increases around the world now,” said Bobby Corrigan, a sought-after rat-catching consultant who once spent a week living in a rat-infested barn in Indiana as part of his PhD research. “Requests for my services are through the roof, I can’t keep up with them,” he said. “You speak to any health commissioner from Boston to DC and the trend is upwards. “In winter rats slow down their reproduction because it’s so cold, but they are probably having one more litter a year now because it’s getting warmer. A litter is around 10 babies and that’s making a difference.” Mike Deutsch, a veteran rat-catcher at the New York-based Arrow Exterminating Company, said warming temperatures are having a “natural consequence. As the earth warms you’ll have more activity, more rats about. They won’t be able to keep growing if there’s not enough food or shelter for them but you’ll see populations rise.” Deutsch – whose recent research found that, contrary to popular belief, cats aren’t very good at catching rats – also pointed to other factors such as urban construction that has disturbed rat families, making them more visible. The increase in rat sightings has spawned viral videos of rats eating pizza and navigating escalators – but has also raised health concerns.  A death was recorded in the Bronx last year due to leptospirosis, a rare disease transmitted via rat urine. New York rats trapped and tested by Columbia University researchers were found to be reservoirs of E coli and salmonella, with some even carrying Seoul hantavirus, which can cause kidney failure. The city’s response has been muscular. Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a $32m plan last year to launch a mass slaughter of rats in infested areas such as Chinatown and the East Village. New York City makes about 100,000 inspections for rat activity each year, and exterminators gas rats to death in their burrows rather than poison them, because of fears over the impact on other wildlife. De Blasio noted darkly that he’s seen “many a rat” in the city. “I see them in the parks, and in the subway. We’re kind to rats. We just want them to go away.” However, New York is likely to remain a haven for rats because of its large human population, sprawl of hole-ridden buildings and its copious waste. A warming climate will only exacerbate these rat-friendly conditions. There is mountains of garbage in the city and the rats are saying, ‘Thanks, we'll bite through that and eat at will' “We are at war but we don’t have weapons to fight the war,” Corrigan said. “We could get the rat numbers down to tolerable levels but we need to rethink our whole system of doing things. “There are litter baskets all over New York City and every night you see rats in there gorging themselves because it’s easy. There are mountains of bags of garbage in the city and the rats are saying, ‘Thanks, we will bite through that and eat at will.’ The rats are taking advantage of our weaknesses.” Rats have become so ingrained in the fabric of New York life that researchers have discovered genetically distinct “uptown” and “downtown” rats. Even those tasked with killing rats recognize they will never be eliminated from the New York experience. An anonymous advertising copywriter, who calls herself the “Elena Ferrante of rats”, offers an unusual online gifting service where she will exterminate rats for a fee, providing a certificate to mark the kill. “I don’t have it out for rats. I think they’re pretty impressive,” she told the Guardian. “There’s just too many of them.” Deutsch, who has caught rats in places as diverse as Arizona and on cruise ships meandering around Europe, said he has developed “a relationship with rats.” “They are an incredible animal, I admire their ability to adapt to different situations,” he said. “I look at them as a tremendous success.”"
"Thanks to her stadium-husky voice, deployed on expansive pop full of unabashed emotion, Ellie Goulding has long been one of the UK’s biggest global pop stars. In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the Guardian, is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities. Where has your head been at since the last album?I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn’t really have the same rock’n’roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I’d often book studios and there’d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn’t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.  And you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn’t want to overanalyse what I had with him – it’s something much more pure, and something I didn’t need to explain to myself in a song. But on one new song, Love I’m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I’d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don’t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere – I’d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don’t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I’m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again. What else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with – I’m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can’t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I’d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn’t feel the need to be angry – so maybe that’s a good thing. Are you talking about Ed Sheeran? [Don’t is widely believed to be about Goulding.]Er … not specifically. [Sighs] There was a period where I felt someone was trying to sabotage me. So there probably are small pieces of the songs that relate to things that frustrate me, and things that are happening in the world, but I’ve always been conscious that I want to keep songwriting as an escape. There’s a bit of a pop-rap feel to some of the new tracks – were you trying to do something new?I think it’s important to know the way pop is changing – I would never release something completely blind, without listening to any radio or Spotify, and expect people to like it; and for it to compare with what’s out there. But I still find it thrilling when people release something that doesn’t sound like anything else – I’m always fighting to work with producers coming up with whole new soundscapes. My voice doesn’t sound like anyone’s in the world, so I’ve got that to my advantage, and I can also manipulate my voice as part of the track or make it into a sample. That’s how I stay not sounding like anything else – I have that locked, for ever.Does pop ever feel frivolous compared with your climate change activism?Sometimes it does. But often I really need to just write a bloody good pop song after meeting climate scientists, or going to the climate assembly in Kenya last year. Going to Greenland and seeing glaciers collapse. It’s gone beyond facts and boring data – we’re seeing it with our own eyes. The wildfires [in California] were exacerbated by climate change, the crazy storms that have been happening: it’s very obvious. One of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active; we need to compensate for what’s going on in certain political situations. I know that “celebrities shouldn’t get involved in politics”, but it’s something we have to act on now. I can’t help but feel a bit frustrated that I’m the only one speaking out about something so important – no one else in my peer group is. The next step is electing people who take this seriously, and to trust scientists. And having a bigger consciousness of your day-to-day actions. I don’t eat that much meat; I try to use sustainable fashion brands; we’re trying to make my tour completely plastic free, and cut down on flights, with a better eco-bus situation. I think I’m probably doing more good than bad, overall."
"Looking back over 2018, weirdly the things that are the easiest to see are the darkest. Write a year in review, and what first springs to mind is American nihilism in the form of Donald Trump, mass shootings and the opioid epidemic. In Britain it’s the Brexit quagmire and rolling political crises, and in Australia it’s the palpable disgust at the political class as they roll prime ministers, lock children up in brutal offshore detention camps, impregnate staffers, and treat their female colleagues with disdain.  Even if on a personal level things are going well, it is now pretty much accepted that we live in the worst of times. If 2017 was about fear (this Trump guy, what could he do?), 2018 was about learning to live in that fear. The edges of 2017’s anxiety were blunted. We were no longer surprised at the increasingly bizarre and dangerous tone of global politics. Instead, anxiety gave way to jadedness, with a side of depression. The year had vibes of a bad hangover. If we were unsure about it at the start of the decade, we knew it now: the planet is on fire and there are no adults in the room who want to put it out. Even the drugs of this era – benzos and opiates – speak of futility and surrender. In 2018 it seems easier to see the darkness than the light. But there was light. Good things happened in this year. And maybe part of the resistance, part of the thing that could rouse us from this jadedness, is naming and celebrating those good things. The two areas where a sense of futility had crept in – gun control in the US, and the climate debate – where suddenly given a new jolt of life by teenagers. The kids of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school who survived a gun massacre at their school in February, reignited the gun control debate with a sense of urgency and anger that had been missing. These kids are 100% gutsy. In the midst of their own personal trauma, they demanded a national rethink to America’s gun addiction knowing that they would be labelled crisis actors, have to come up against the powerful National Rifle Association and have their own personal safety imperilled by conspiracy theorists and gun nuts. Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school student Emma González gave the best political speech of the year – calling BS on previous limp efforts to pass gun control legislation. In 2018 if the penny hadn’t dropped already, then it was obvious to young people everywhere that older generations had failed them royally on so many fronts. Instead of apathy, the kids got angry and organised. In Australia in November, there was a massive school walkout over climate change inaction, in a protest organised and lead by teenagers. And young people in Britain are demanding a second referendum over a Brexit vote that will limit their future opportunities. The revelations published in the Observer about data breaches at Facebook on an industrial scale (the profiles of more than 50 million individuals were harvested) led millions of users – particularly in Europe – to delete their profiles.  2018 was Facebook’s annus horribilis. After appearing at a congressional hearing in Washington to answer questions about Russian meddling in US elections, Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, admitted: “One of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016. We have kicked off an investigation … I imagine we’ll find some things.”  But the reputational damage and erosion of public trust in Facebook may never be healed. How is that good news? With more (non-fake news) information about what goes on at Facebook and how our personal information is used, we’re more empowered to make a decision about whether or not to ditch the site. Prince Harry’s story could have been a tragic one: bereft by the early loss of his mother, the lost years of drinking, partying in Vegas and dressing up as a Nazi … But somehow things righted themselves. After a military career Prince Harry set up the Invictus Games for members of the armed forces with injury and illness, started speaking openly about mental health issues, and fell in love with a black American divorcee, a couple of years older than him. It was a lovely wedding, and a sign that although the monarchy is built on tradition, it is more open to change than we once thought. This was a well thought-out, well planned and clearly worded referendum that resulted in an overwhelming majority in Ireland deciding to overturn one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the western world. There was a large voter turnout, with only one county (Donegal) voting no to change. Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said after the vote: “Today is a historic day for Ireland. A quiet revolution has taken place, and today is a great act of democracy. “A hundred years since women gained the right to vote, today we as a people have spoken.  “And we say that we trust women and respect women to make their own decisions and their own choices.”  This, of course, is not good news for everyone – particularly investors. But for the increasing number of young Australians locked out of the housing market because of insane price rises, a drop in prices in the capitals of Melbourne and Sydney was welcome news. Supermarkets across Australia banned single use plastic bags, while parts of the US, Taiwan, Canada, Scotland and Britain banned single use plastic straws. Some of this is led by government, but mostly the initiative is through private companies responding to cues from consumers. Due to popular shows such as David Attenborough’s Blue Planet we can no longer close our eyes and pretend that plastic just vaporises after we use it. It clogs our oceans and kills marine life. While parts of the planet, such as California, which was devastated by wildfires, have had their hottest summer on record, the move against single-use plastic may seem like trying to stop a tsunami with a surfboard. But the change in collective consciousness is heartening.  The feel-good story of the year united all if us in hope, then joy at the rescue of 12 young soccer players and their coach. It also came at a time of unrelenting bleakness in the news cycle. Seeing global efforts to rescue the boys made me think “maybe we’re not totally doomed as a species”. A few honourable mentions for game-changers in pop culture are: The most successful comedian of 2018 inspired thousands of think pieces and global acclaim after her show Nanette was screened on Netflix. In an era where misogyny is rising to the surface like scum forming on boiled milk, we needed Gadsby – someone smart, funny and deadly serious – to explain the structural problems in art and life that lead to the #MeToo movement. Watching her in full flight felt bracing and absolutely necessary. The clip for This is America with its guns and casual violence (a gospel choir gunned down mid song) was, like Nanette, the shock we needed to properly see where we are right now. The place ain’t pretty, even if the music is good.  There is a pretty binary narrative to break-up songs: you’re either saying sorry or “fuck you” to an ex. Ariana instead this year said thank you to her exes and paid tribute to what they taught her.  More of this please in 2019."
"Folk music has long gone hand in hand with political protest. From Pete Seeger’s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan’s Ballad of ‘84, a clarion call for the Scottish miners’ strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists. Now, folk is turning its attention to the bees.  Bees are responsible for pollinating around 80% of plantlife in the UK and over a third of crops globally, yet from 1985 to 2005 the number of honeybee colonies in the UK fell by 53% and wild honeybees are now thought to be almost extinct across Britain. This is due to a variety of reasons including climate change, infectious diseases, the use of harmful pesticides, and the reduction of natural habitats. These worrying developments have led some to claim that if the bees become extinct, humanity would only have four years left to survive. The stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. “The environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,” he says. “All of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.” A waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. “People’s knowledge of the crisis is very general,” he says, “and they often don’t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that’s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.” Since Piggott’s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau’s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness. “I thought it’d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we’ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,” he says. With the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. “I always had the idea for making a record,” he says, “although I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.” Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested £1,000 of his own money and raised a £2,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs. Featuring Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene’s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge’s Queen’s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr’s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans. Since the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising £5,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April. “The response has been great,” he enthuses, “all ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.” Rosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. “Folk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,” she says, “injustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There’s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.” Another contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist’s genre. “The act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,” she says, “and that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.” With CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. “It’s not just bees, it’s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger – everything’s in trouble,” he says. For now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive’s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow. “Bees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,” Hodgson says. For Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. “Folk music here isn’t the people’s music anymore,” he says, “it’s become commercialised and the general public don’t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.”"
"An unnaturally late first frost across the UK means magic mushroom hunters could be in line for a remarkable natural high this year. Psychedelic mushrooms may still be in bloom on New Year’s Day, as the subzero temperatures that would normally have appeared by this time of year are yet to arrive. Owing to the warming climate, the first autumn frost arrives up to a fortnight later across the south-west of England and south Wales than it did 50 years ago, considerably extending the mushroom season – but 2018’s cycle could be unprecedented. “Climate change has had a dramatic effect on the fruiting season,” says Prof Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist. “Every year the start and end of the season is dependent on the weather, and we can see that up until the late 1970s it was largely consistent. “However, on average, the first fruiting date now comes much earlier in the year than previously, while the last fruiting comes later.” She says there used to be about 33 days of autumn fruiting, but now there are more than 70, giving the thousands of people who hunt for magic mushrooms and other fungi across the UK every autumn more time to forage. With this year’s first sustained frost unseasonably late, psychedelic fungi is still being picked from Dartmoor, across the Brecon Beacons and into Yorkshire by amazed mycology enthusiasts. “Magic mushrooms usually begin to sprout in September, but it was so warm this year that they didn’t get going until October,” says an experienced forager. “The first heavy frost spells the season’s end, which usually happens in late November, but this year in Devon the way the forecast looks I’ll still be picking on New Year’s Day.” Dr Patrick Harding, author of the Collins Gem guide Mushrooms, says 2018 has been a very unusual year for fungi thanks to the long dry summer. “Forty years ago, when I first came to Sheffield, snow and frost curtailed the season before the end of November and the happy local band of magic mushroom gatherers would have started hibernating before advent,” he says. “I’ll wait to see if we can still find any to help with the new year celebrations – the long range forecast even for Sheffield has very little talk of frost or snow before 2019.” At different temperatures, fungi grow at different paces. Liberty caps, one of the most prevalent species containing the psychoactive ingredient psilocybin, produce their mushrooms at below 15C in the day and 10C at night – often next to manure – with the first freezing temperatures heralding the end of the season. Magic mushroom use was popularised during the 70s when it emerged as a legal alternative to LSD, but they were banned in 2005. However, more than 200,000 people in the UK used them in 2017-18, an increase of a third on the previous year. According to the 2017 Global Drug Survey, they are the safest “recreational” drug. Recent studies have suggested magic mushrooms have therapeutic benefits and can help treat depression. Despite this, it is a class A drug and picking psychedelic mushrooms is an offence punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, it is not an offence to have them growing on your land."
"Extreme weather hit the headlines throughout 2018, from the heatwave across much of the northern hemisphere, which saw unprecedented wildfires in Sweden, drought in the UK and devastating wildfires in the US, to floods in India and typhoons in south-east Asia. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, last year was the fourth hottest on record and confirms a trend of rising temperatures that is a clear signal that we are having an effect on the climate. Droughts, floods, fiercer storms and heatwaves, as well as sea level rises, are all expected to increase markedly as a result.  Late in the year there was also the starkest warning yet from scientists of what our future will be if we allow climate change to take hold. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world’s leading climate scientists, which has been producing regular reports on the state of climate science since 1988, produced its latest comprehensive overview examining what the future will look like if we undergo 1.5C (2.7F) of warming. That does not sound like a lot – most people would be hard put to notice a temperature difference of 1.5C – but in climate terms, 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is enough to take us into the danger zone. It would see the mass die-off of coral reefs, the extinction of some species, rising sea levels, wet areas of the world becoming wetter and dry areas drier, and the decline of agricultural productivity across swaths of the globe. That is a future we should obviously try to avoid. But the UN climate conference in Poland that ended the year’s climate-related events in December showed little sign that the urgency of the scientists’ warnings had been heeded. Instead, countries discussed a “rulebook” for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice, including such arcane matters as how countries measure and verify their emissions, and how often they should report on them, and rows over carbon credits. In Poland, there were no firm commitments to ramp up countries’ national targets in line with scientific advice, and this is unlikely to happen before 2020 at the earliest. On current national emissions-cutting targets, we are in for about 3C of warming. Yet the IPCC warned that if we want to avoid 1.5C of warming, we have about 12 years to bring global emissions under control and swiftly move to just half of their current level. That represents a massive shift needed in the global economy, and yet emissions worldwide look to be moving upward again slightly after a decade in which they showed signs of stabilising. There was also bad news from the US at the talks, which played little part as Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Paris agreement, except to hold a side event at the conference celebrating a bright future for coal. Looked at this way, the omens from 2018 were not good. Fortunately, however, 2019 may indeed be a breakthrough year. Public opinion is mobilising around the world and politicians and businesses are paying attention. There will be a series of high-profile events that will engage the public and governments and may provide a better way forward than was managed last year. Chief among them is the promise of António Guterres, the UN secretary general, to hold a summit for world leaders that will require them to face up to the dangers of climate change head on. Guterres is uncompromising, warning in Poland that it would be “immoral and suicidal” not to take firm and urgent action commensurate with the scale of the problem. Leaders will be put on the spot, and will come under very public pressure as coalitions of civil society groups seek to put their case around the summit and in the lead-up to it. The role of women, who are among the most vulnerable to climate change, will be highlighted, and the role of young people, who will have to live with the consequences of their elders’ mistakes in a warming world. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is also holding a One World Summit, planned for the summer, at which the focus will be on persuading businesses to take a leading role, investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and changing the way they use energy. There are clear signs of hope on climate change also in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy technology, which is now competitive with fossil fuels. And the Keep it in the ground campaign has succeeded in encouraging many investors to move their money out of fossil fuel stocks. But most of all the civil society campaigns which have ramped up in 2018 and look set to increase their momentum in the coming year are taking effect. Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue. This can be seen in some unexpected ways, such as the rise of veganism and flexitarian eating, as people seek to reduce their impact on the climate from eating meat. Through well-publicised and effective movements and actions, more and more people are refusing silently to acquiesce in ignoring the dangers to the climate."
"An EU deal to slowly phase out coal subsidies is “completely inconsistent” with the bloc’s Paris climate agreement commitments, analysts say. Marathon negotiations ended early on Wednesday with a benchmark CO2 emissions standard of 550 grams per kWh for all European power plants by 2025. But coal-dependent Poland secured a loophole allowing countries another year to negotiate new “capacity mechanisms” that would be exempted from the deadline.  It could allow subsidies to keep unprofitable coal plants running until 2035, five years beyond a projected cut-off for meeting the Paris goals. Bill Hare, the director of the Climate Analytics thinktank and a former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author, told the Guardian: “Continued support for coal as just agreed by the EU is completely inconsistent with meeting the Paris agreement goals and in particular with limiting warming to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels].” “It appears to be a de facto rejection of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finding that coal needs to exit the power sector rapidly. In the EU this means by 2030.” Greenpeace said the stay of execution for coal subsidies showed many EU governments were still not serious about climate action. After the deal was signed, the EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, tweeted: “A more flexible market will facilitate the integration of more renewables. We also limit capacity mechanisms and #support550 to move #BeyondCoal. #CleanEnergyEU completed.” The European parliament’s chief negotiator in the talks, the MEP Krišjānis Kariņš, said the deal “will help the transformation to cleaner electricity production and it will open up more competition in electricity across the EU border – good for the climate and good for the wallet”. Europe is committed to a goal of limiting global warming to “well below 2C” and has pledged to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Last month, Cañete himself launched an EU strategy for achieving “climate neutrality” by 2050 in order to reach the UN’s 1.5C target. Florent Marcellesi, a Green MEP involved in the talks, said the delayed introduction of the emissions standard was “a free licence to go on polluting despite the impact on climate and public health”. It was also insufficient to meet the EU’s Paris climate goals, he said."
"In Larry Elliott’s article (We’re back to 1930s politics: anger and, yes, appeasement, 20 December), it is good to see an economics editor addressing, as Kate Raworth has done so effectively with Doughnut Economics, the fact that the economy is a complete subset of the environment. And Elliott is right to say that the official declaration that came out of Katowice was not nearly enough. But that wasn’t the only thing that came from the climate talks. There was a newly prominent place for civil society, from teenager Greta Thunberg to nonagenarian David Attenborough, and some companies, and many state and city governments, stepping up to the plate.  We’ve been trashing the planet over recent decades while creating a miserable, insecure society. The 12 years that the IPCC gave us is an agonisingly short period to transform the world economy. But both Facebook and Twitter were infants 12 years ago; rapid change is a normal part of the human condition. History is not pre-written, or destined to repeat itself. Offering the hope that with political, economic, social, educational and environmental transformation we can build a society that works for the common good, within the physical limits of this one fragile planet, is politically essential. The politics of the far right is built on fear and we must not feed that. Business as usual isn’t an option. But then that is one thing that certainly is not going to happen. That’s good news, for our planet and its people.Natalie BennettFormer leader, Green party of England and Wales • The graphics accompanying Larry Elliott’s article hark back not to the 1930s but to the framing of ecological problems from the second half of the 20th century. People are now realising that climate change is not just about polar bears but about all life on earth, and that it relates to people’s everyday lives. Rather than carrying banners with the now rather cliched “Save our Planet”, parents, grandparents and all people concerned for the future of life are now more likely to be holding a banner proclaiming “Extinction Rebellion”, or featuring its memorable hour-glass logo.Siân CharnleyBristol  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The BBC’s central London headquarters has been put on lockdown due to a protest by climate change campaigners who are demanding it uses its status as national broadcaster to declare a “climate and ecological emergency”. Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has recently shut down key London roads, has demand the BBC makes the environment its “top editorial issue”.  Broadcasting House was locked down early on Friday afternoon, with BBC staff and guests unable to enter or leave the building while security kept the peaceful but noisy protesters away from the entrance. Extinction Rebellion activists, who are demanding a meeting with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation had a duty to broadcast about climate change with “the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war”. The broadcaster Anneka Rice said she was stuck in the BBC reception “with Simon Mayo, Ken Bruce and three policemen” during the protest. Extinction Rebellion also organised protests on Friday at BBC offices in Bristol, Glasgow, Cambridge, Birmingham, Truro, Sheffield, Bangor, and the broadcaster’s Berlin bureau. The campaign group launched two months ago, with a declaration of support from public figures including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who backed a campaign of civil disobedience to draw attention to the threat of climate and ecological change. Since then, Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked bridges and glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street, earning media attention that has allowed the campaign to spread to 35 overseas countries. The BBC has been criticised for its coverage of climate change, especially the decision to give airtime to climate change sceptics such as Lord Lawson, who oppose the scientific consensus. Earlier this year, the head of news, Fran Unsworth, told staff that the corporation had struggled with the topic: “Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.” She added: “To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage; in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.” The BBC acknowledged it had received a letter from a “newly formed campaign group” but did not comment on the demand for a meeting with the director general. “The BBC has a proud record of leading the way in sustainability in the media industry and we’ve set out further action including cutting energy use further, eradicating single-use plastic and minimising the impact of necessary travel,” said a spokesperson. “In the last charter period, we reduced our carbon footprint by a third. People can also see the clear impact programmes like Blue Planet II and Dynasties have had on public debate about the impact of humankind on the planet.”"
"More than any other decade, the 1930s act as a reference point for just how bad things can get. Mass unemployment, totalitarianism, war: a repeat of these horrors is to be avoided at all costs. Eighty years after Neville Chamberlain agreed to Hitler’s demands over the Sudetenland, there is still no greater insult than to dub a politician an “appeaser”. The determination in policy circles to avoid a return to the 30s helps explain why up until now it has never happened. Central banks slashed interest rates and turned on the electronic printing presses a decade ago because they feared a second Great Depression. Welfare states are more generous than they were when John Steinbeck was writing The Grapes of Wrath. Decades of growth have made societies wealthier; advances in medical science have made them healthier.  That said, the world is currently closer to a return to the 30s than it has ever been. The echoes are loud and getting louder. Let’s start with the obvious. As it did in the period between the two world wars, something has gone seriously wrong with the global economy. The story of the past 20 years has been that of an unsustainable boom followed by a deep recession and the weakest recovery in history. Central banks have applauded themselves for preventing Great Depression 2.0, but what they never admit is that they did so by creating asset bubbles. A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing – the bond-buying process that boosts the supply of money – led to a speculative frenzy for commodities, shares and property. Those bubbles are now starting to pop. Oil prices are crashing, house prices are flat, shares on Wall Street are on course to have their worst December since 1931. In the 1920s and early 30s, there was a reluctance to give up on a conservative model of political economy: the gold standard, balanced budgets, a limited role for government and a belief that markets would deliver the best of all possible outcomes if left unhindered. Eventually, stark evidence of failure forced a rethink. Starting with Britain, countries came off the gold standard. Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. John Maynard Keynes explained why it was possible for unemployment to remain high. The economic problems of the 20s had prevented the full flowering of the technologies that appeared in the first few decades of the 20th century. It required a paradigm shift to full employment, capital controls and a fairer division of the spoils for that to happen. No such reassessment has taken place since the global economy’s near-death experience of a decade ago. Governments are supposed to balance their budgets, money is free to go where it will, the banking system remains largely untouched, and the imbalance of power between capital and labour remains unaddressed. Growth has only been possible because of a buildup of debt. This proved unsustainable in the past and will do so again. To make matters worse, the distribution of income and wealth has mirrored that of the period between the wars. Real wages – adjusted for inflation – have barely risen for those on low and middle incomes; such growth as there has been has been snaffled by the better off. If you own a home or own shares, the past decade has been good for you. If you are in a low-wage job with only modest savings, life has not been nearly so comfortable. All these factors – economic underperformance, the return to business as usual and the sense that we are not all in this together – have given rise to a different sort of politics: nationalistic, populist and angry. People in the 30s were susceptible to the cult of the strongman leader because parties of the centre-left and centre-right seemed impotent in the face of a financial crisis, triggered by the Wall Street crash. Now that cult – Putin in Russia; Modi in India; Erdoğan in Turkey; Trump in the US; Bolsonaro in Brazil – is back and for the same reason. Voters are no longer convinced that mainstream politics can deliver. Protectionism is back, and, although Trump’s trade war with China is so far more of a trade skirmish, the direction of travel is clear. “America first” is the modern-day equivalent of US isolationism in the 20s and 30s. Governments that pledge to look after their own – through tariffs or immigration controls – have tapped into a genuine sense of unease about how the fruits of globalisation have been divvied up. The 40s and 50s saw the creation of a network of multilateral organisations designed to prevent a return to the beggar-thy-neighbour world of the 30s and to embed the new social democratic order. These institutions – the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (conceived in the 1940s but created decades later) and the European Union – have all to a greater or lesser extent been captured by neoliberal ideology and by big business interests. Faith in international cooperation has frayed. One seeming difference between the 2010s and the 1930s is the absence of an ideological clash. During the Great Depression, there were plenty of people in the west who saw Stalin’s five-year plans as a credible alternative to free-market capitalism. That struggle ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the spread of the market to parts of the world where it had previously been off limits. In fact, there is a challenge to free-market capitalism and it is coming from environmentalism. On the one hand, there is an ideology that prioritises growth; on the other a belief system that sees the obsession with growth as an existential threat to the planet. Britain’s fixation with Brexit means it is easy to portray Theresa May as Chamberlain and to see the prime minister’s recent abortive trip to the EU summit as her Munich. This, though, misses the bigger picture. Brexit is not the most important issue facing the world; it is not even the most important issue facing Britain. Governments are aware of the risk posed by climate change. They know that they need to change the way their economies are run in order to hit targets for capping carbon emissions. They understand that time is not on their side. Yet at the UN summit in Poland they came up with an agreement they knew was inadequate to meet the challenge. Katowice was the real Munich and the feeble UN accord the equivalent of the piece of paper Chamberlain brought back home with him from his meeting with Hitler. Appeasement doesn’t work and merely delays necessary policy action. That was true in the late 30s and it is true again today. Ultimately, policymakers have a choice. They can put their economies on an environmental war footing or they can continue to bottle it. In the 30s, they acted in time, but only just. For today’s appeasers, the moment of truth is nigh. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"

"Take a deep breath. Dive into the emerald water. It’s 13 minutes and 70 metres down to lunch. Are you dead yet? Not if you are one of the Bajau “sea nomads” of south-east Asia, who have been free-diving like this for more than 1,000 years, relying on their remarkable physiology, and, as we learned in April, their genes. Humans left Africa 50 millennia ago, encountering new environments that required adaptation to survive. Adaptation is mostly cultural – building shelters, using fire, deciding what to eat, and transmitting instructions from generation to generation. But alongside this are advantageous genetic mutations grasped by natural selection.  Finding genetic changes that drive adaptations has become much easier now genomes can be sequenced cheaply, and a study this year of the Bajau people provided a beautiful example. Ultrasound scans revealed enlarged spleens – reflex contraction of this neglected organ helps during diving by pumping oxygenated red blood cells into the circulation. Sequencing Bajau genomes and comparing them with those of their non-diving neighbours revealed genes showing signatures of natural selection, one of which is specifically associated with spleen size. Understanding the dive response could have medical applications in acute hypoxia, a common killer in A&E.Mark Jobling, professor of genetics, University of Leicester Among the tsunami of bad news about plastic waste this year, there was a small piece of good news. This was an agreement in April by those responsible for more than 80% of the plastic packaging in the UK to make all plastic packing 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. This pledge, called the UK Plastics Pact, is significant because it has emerged not from government but from a consortium of companies and organisations including supermarkets, coffee chains, brands, manufacturers, waste disposal companies and local authorities. Thee organisationsy have clubbed together to solve this problem largely because they are under massive public pressure. They propose to create a circular economy of plastics, a seismic shift in the way companies engineer and use them. It is a big win for the environment of the UK, but it will also have a global impact, because many of the companies involved – such as Coca-Cola, Unilever and Procter & Gamble – are multinational corporations that sell products all over the world. Once the UK creates a non-polluting circular economy of plastic packaging, the likelihood of it being rolled out by these companies in the rest of the world is high. There is an enormous amount of work to do, but I hope when our children look back at the environmental catastrophe of the 20th century, they will see 2018 as the year plastic pollution started its decline.Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London Most people don’t think much about the high seas. Far beyond the horizon, they begin where national control ends, 200 nautical miles from the coast, and cover 61% of the ocean and 43% of the Earth’s surface. Few laws restrain fishing here; countries can opt out of those that exist, and much activity is in any case hidden by remoteness. But 2018 may signal the beginning of the end of freedom to plunder fish and slaughter wildlife caught alongside them. This year Global Fishing Watch lifted the veil on the high seas, exposing fishing vessels and companies to scrutiny for the first time. Their tool tracks ship movements based on satellite transmissions from vessels, and uses machine learning to determine what a vessel is doing from its behaviour. We learned this year that high seas fishing contributes only 4.2% of wild fish catches, that 64% of the spoils go to just five rich countries, and that much of this fishing would not be profitable without public subsidies. In September, the UN began negotiations for a new treaty to protect high seas wildlife, paving the way for marine protected areas that Global Fishing Watch can help to police.Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York While it is always nice to round off the year with good-news science stories, I feel that the publication of the new UN IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report in October was so important and with such huge ramifications that all else pales into insignificance. The report shook the world when it was published on 8 October, suggesting that the time for talking was over and that the window available for us to really act against the worst effects of climate change was closing fast. It stated that “limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. Written by 91 scientists and review editors from 40 countries, with over 6,000 scientific references and contributions from thousands of experts worldwide, it explained that we are already seeing the consequences of 1C of global warming: more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice. It also highlighted how much worse things could get if we do not act immediately. The report examined what it would take to avert disaster and what the consequences could be. But the omens are not good. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise again, as is the popularity of climate change-denying, populist world leaders, which makes everything more difficult. Jim Al-Khalili, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Surrey Europe’s hegemony on humankind’s story loosened when the record for the oldest known figurative cave art by Homo sapiens shifted from Germany to south-east Asia. The painting of a local wild cow, a banteng, in a remote cave in Borneo was dated in November as being a minimum of 40,000 years old, just nudging ahead of the Lion Man carving of Hohlenstein Stadel in Germany. In September, a flake of stone with hashed patterns made with an ochre crayon from the Blombos Cave in South Africa was dated at 73,000 years old, though these markings fall short of being identifiable as art. All these artefacts show the emergence of minds like our own, so-called behavioural modernity, all around the world. But it wasn’t limited to Homo sapiens. An abstract image of parts of a cow and some other mysterious figures adorns a cave wall on the Spanish Cantabrian coast, and in February was found to be a whopping 65,000 years old, though this date has been contested. The only people in northern Spain at that time were Homo neanderthalensis, and the continued rehabilitation of our cousins continues: Neanderthals were simply people too.Dr Adam Rutherford, presenter of Inside Science, Radio 4 When my son was younger, he had a duvet cover with animals from around the world. He slept wrapped in colourful images of tigers, elephants, and kangaroos. However, if this duvet represented mammals in terms of their weight, all the world’s wild mammals would cover only a corner of the pillowcase. This shocking fact was the main message I took from a detailed analysis of the biomass of life on Earth published earlier this year. People and our livestock (mostly cattle and pigs) now make up 96% of mammalian biomass on the planet. Similarly, the weight of domestic poultry (mostly chickens) is three times higher than all species of wild birds combined. These stark statistics help us understand the extent to which we humans now dominate ecosystems. While wildlife documentaries still wow us with images of wonderful wildlife in wild places, these places are shrinking. Almost everywhere, the large mammal you are most likely to encounter is a human or a cow. I hope that being reminded of this will help society take actions to ensure that my son’s children don’t live in a world where wild species are only known from images on soft furnishings.Julia Jones, professor of conservation science, Bangor University Gene-editing is a breakthrough in biotechnology, not least in crop improvement. Scientists’ favourite method, Crispr/Cas9, makes precise changes to individual genes, even changing a single “letter” of the genetic code. It’s quick, easy and amazingly versatile. A headline story in 2018 was the European court of justice’s ruling that gene-edited crops must be subject to the same cumbersome regulation as older methods of genetic engineering, even though Crispr mutations are no different to those found throughout the natural world. Plant breeders are pressing for this decision to be overturned so farmers and consumers can benefit from improvements in fruit, vegetables and field crops. Meanwhile, they are seizing the opportunities offered by Crispr to transform food production. In 2018, teams of scientists in India and Australia announced that they had successfully edited the genome of bananas. This could rescue the world’s most popular fruit from the threat of disease. Banana improvement faces two great challenges. One is monoculture: the Cavendish is the supermarkets’ favourite banana, but plantations worldwide are susceptible to the destructive tropical race 4 strain of the Fusarium fungus. In other crops, cross-breeding could produce disease-resistant varieties, but the second challenge is that banana flowers are sterile. Gene-editing offers the exciting prospect that scientists will at last be able to make a disease-resistant banana.James Brown, head of crop genetics at the John Innes Centre, Norwich Any woman who has suffered a miscarriage is likely to worry about what she has done “wrong”; a woman at the end of her pregnancy who is afflicted with the serious condition pre-eclampsia will wonder why it afflicted her in particular. Both situations, common as they are and with all their accompanying distress, are likely to arise from problems with the placenta. But it is difficult to determine this, since the human placenta is hardly available off the shelf for easy study. A team of scientists at the University of Cambridge have made a breakthrough permitting them to create a 3D (that’s important in order to simulate reality) “organoid”, clusters of cells derived from the placentas of aborted foetuses. These have been shown to grow and produce proteins, sufficiently mimicking the real thing that a pregnancy test gives a positive result. This mini-placenta, only a millimetre or less across, offers the promise that the origin of the developmental abnormalities that lead to the embryo not correctly implanting in the womb can finally be understood. For many women, this insight could prove transformative. Clearly, there is a long way to go from creating the first mini-placentas to answering the fundamental questions, but this study appears to provide a critical step forward.Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at the University of Cambridge As much as I love seeing otherworldly pictures beamed back from the surface of Mars, it was a different sort of space landing that grabbed my attention this year. In June, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (Jaxa) Hayabusa2 probe rendezvoused with a near-Earth asteroid called Ryugu, some 280m km away. The first pictures beamed back revealed a strange and beautiful diamond-shaped rock ploughing its way through space. Fascinating in and of itself, but the real treat would come in September, when the probe landed two rovers on Ryugu’s surface. The picture above is one of the first ever transmitted from the surface of an asteroid, and I could stare at it for hours. It’s a reminder that while there’s still so much to learn about the universe, the baby steps we’re already taking reveal an awe-inspiring beauty in the most unexpected of places. Hayabusa2 will also be collecting rock samples that might shed light on the potential origins of water and organic compounds (and maybe even life) on Earth, but the journey will be a long and risky one – it’s not scheduled back until December 2020.Dr Pete Etchells, reader in psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University This year has seen some sobering science stories, not least the increase in cases, sometimes fatal, of preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy and the growing politicisation of the anti-vaccine agenda. My older brother suffered with measles as child and was dangerously ill. He used to describe his fever dreams as the most terrifying experiences of his life. As late as the 1960s, many people still witnessed the potentially catastrophic effects of measles, rubella and whooping cough and there was a huge demand for the development of vaccines to prevent them. The introduction of vaccines dramatically reduced the incidence of infections and fewer people experienced the impact of disease. Now we are seeing a resurgence in preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy. Although there is not one clearly defined anti-vaccine group, six themes emerge: 1. Control: the idea that we can take back control of our own bodies through alternative means. 2. Parenting style: philosophies that shun mainstream medicine, opting for “natural” remedies. 3. The past: previous bad healthcare experiences or a bad experience around vaccination shapes perceptions. 4. Risk: misunderstandings about the risks of vaccination versus the risks of disease. 5. Fear of chemicals: the fear that the vaccine will introduce toxic chemicals. 6. Distrust of government agencies and corporations. By listening to people, it is possible to start to understand what may lie behind their hesitancy. The re-emergence of preventable diseases is a stark reminder of how mistrust, confusion and bad information can spread, and emphasises the importance of experts in the field talking with and listening to the public to enable meaningful dialogue, help reduce propaganda and effect change. Sheena Cruickshank, professor in biomedical sciences and public engagement, University of Manchester Artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to make great strides in 2018. Although the AI of Blade Runner and Ex Machina remains as distant as ever, the power of so-called “deep neural networks” and “reinforcement learning” to solve complex problems has developed rapidly. Two milestones stand out this year: AlphaZero and AlphaFold, both from the London-based AI firm DeepMind. AlphaZero is the latest iteration of AlphaGo, which catapulted DeepMind to public prominence in 2016 when it beat Go champion Lee Sedol in a series of high-profile matches. AlphaGo worked by training a deep neural network to predict the value of board positions, using millions of past games as training data. This was later improved upon by AlphaGo Zero, which learned purely by playing itself, and now AlphaZero takes things further by training a single network, again entirely through self-play and without any game-specific knowledge, to deliver world-beating performances in three different games: Go, chess, and the Japanese game shogi. This remarkable achievement has also provided glimpses into new “machine-like” ways of thinking: as grandmaster Matthew Sadler put it, “it’s like discovering the secret notebooks of a great player from the past”. AlphaFold takes the same approach beyond the rarefied regime of board games to address a practical problem of real importance: predicting the 3D structure of proteins solely from genetic sequences. Here, the DeepMind software has again achieved world-leading results, bringing important implications for biology and medicine, and showcasing how AI can be used for scientific discovery itself.Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience, University of Sussex Atoms emit and absorb light when electrons inside them jump around. This light comes at frequencies characteristic of the type of atom – sort of a unique barcode. Reading these barcodes tells us what elements are present in the stars, galaxies and the sparse gas between them. One thing we don’t know though is why there is not more antimatter around. Antimatter is created in radioactive decays and particle collisions; it is routinely used in medical diagnosis. But equal amounts of antimatter and matter are always created or destroyed together. So if the matter around us was created in the Big Bang, there should presumably be an equal amount of antimatter. So where is it? The ALPHA experiment at CERN this year collected and controlled anti-electrons and anti-protons to make and store enough anti-hydrogen to could start reading its barcode. They read one of the key identifiers used to track intergalactic hydrogen for the first time – the so-called “Lyman alpha” line. The line is in the same place as that for hydrogen, as predicted. This sets our knowledge of the universe on a slightly firmer footing, and, as the programme progresses, they will be on the look out for any subtle differences between matter and antimatter that may help explain where all the antimatter has gone.

"Throughout the COP24 climate summit, Brazil urged all parties to work together to enable greater private-sector climate action. Brazil was constantly involved in negotiations to ensure COP24 delivered a workable toolbox to limit global warming. So we warmly welcome the positive outcome of COP24, including the agreement to keep working on a stronger global market mechanism for emission reductions. Unfortunately, there have been several misrepresentations made about Brazil’s positions (Encouraging signs – but new rifts also exposed by hard-won deal at climate talks, 17 December), which do not help in the work ahead for all countries.  Brazil is absolutely opposed to double counting when it comes to carbon credits, and has consistently supported efforts to prevent double counting. We believe that emissions reductions generated under the sustainable development mechanism must be additional to the emissions-reductions targets made by the country where the reductions are generated. This means that if the private sector develops a project and sells additional emissions reductions to any country, those reductions should be counted only towards the national targets of the purchasing country, with no impact on the targets of the country that hosted the project. If the purchasing country then on-sells those emissions reductions, they should absolutely be required to make an adjustment in respect of their national emissions targets. Otherwise, double counting will occur, which is exactly what Brazil and many other countries have sought to prevent. Accurate representation of all countries’ positions is vital if the world is to make the necessary progress on climate change. Brazil of course has been a leader not just in global discussions on climate change, but also through its actual actions. We are already meeting our pre-2020 targets in 2018, and look forward to all parties who made pre-2020 commitments to deliver on them, as Brazil has done.Thiago de Araujo MendesSecretary for climate change and forests, environment ministry, Brazil • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Population expert Sarah Harper, of the University of Oxford, says falling total fertility rates are to be embraced, and that countries should not worry if their population is not growing (Expert dismisses fears over global fall in fertility, 26 December). Artificial intelligence, migration and a healthier old age mean countries no longer needed booming populations to hold their own, she points out. We would like to emphasise the major benefit, briefly pointed out in your article, that having one fewer child reduces a parent’s carbon footprint by 58 tonnes of CO2 a year. In fact, the most important contribution of a reduced birth is its long-term contribution towards mitigating global warming by reducing CO2 emissions. One major challenge to reducing worldwide CO2 emissions is the large variation between nations: 45 tonnes per capita per year in Qatar, compared with 16.5 in the US, 7.5 in China, 6.5 in the UK, 6.4 in the EU, 1.8 in Indonesia, and 0.3 in least developed countries, according to UN classification. Reducing global carbon emissions while the developing world industrialises will require both convergence toward rates achieved in the most efficient industrialised countries and a global reduction in these rates, a strategy that the IPCC called “converge and contract”. But this strategy, with realistic levels of contraction, appears to fall far short of what is needed, especially with the recent recognition that the previous goal reducing global warming to 2C is insufficient to avoid major adverse impacts. It is here that population decline from falling birthrates can play a key synergistic role with the “converge and contract” strategy, perhaps to the point of making the need for geoengineering for sustainability only temporary.Harold M Hastings, Tai Young-Taft and Chris CogginsBard College at Simon’s Rock, Barrington, Massachusetts, USA  • I am a grandmother, and the last thing I would do is book any flight for my grandchildren (How Gatwick drone saga broke my family’s hearts, Letters, 22 December). I would love to leave my grandchildren the world I grew up in, but given current circumstances that can’t happen. I applaud the people who flew drones over Gatwick, perhaps checking by a tiny amount the advance of global warming.

In truth, no single one of us has any more idea than anyone else of how best to cling, or why to even bother continuing. Our only real choice comes down to whether we boot our fellow travellers into the void, or help them find a firmer grip – until perhaps this ruined planet shifts and rolls and belches its sorry self free of the whole damned lot of us.Laura CloutIvy Hatch, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"After a year in which the climate has been far more naughty than nice, even Father Christmas – in his various guises – is feeling the heat, according to the towns that claim to be his birthplace. From Alaska to Finland, half a dozen Arctic towns have staked a claim to be the home of Santa Claus or whatever other name he is locally known as. And almost without exception, these winter wonderlands are hotting up.  In Sweden, festive tourists flock to Mora, which boasts a Santa headquarters known as Tomteland that follows local traditions dating back to the Viking era. But the effects of global warming are becoming harder to ignore. Reindeers are becoming confused by unseasonal temperatures, according to the indigenous Sami. This spring, there were bad floods, and in summer, nearby woodland was destroyed by wildfires that swept through many areas in Sweden. “I have consulted Mr Santa – or ‘Tomten’ which is his real Swedish name – and he is very concerned about climate change,” Anders Rosén, Mora’s communications manager, told the Guardian. “He has a very strong message to the decision makers of the world: ‘Please take climate change seriously and make decisions in order to save the planet.’“” A more stable climate would also be better for business. Local ski slopes and cross-country tracks sometimes have to be kept in operation by artificial snow machines. A few years ago, there was no snow on 25 December but the temperature this week is –10C and there have been some falls in recent days so hopes are high that this year will deliver a white Christmas. “Even without snow, we are very good at creating the right Christmas atmosphere,” Rosén said. “The tradition of Christmas is very strong in Sweden.” The Finnish city of Rovaniemireceives tens of thousands of letters to Santa from children around the world. Residents of the Lapland capital said the summer was freakishly hot and dry with temperatures above 30C for several weeks in a row. The winter snow arrived so late this year that tourist companies had to improvise with new activities for visitors, including hikes across lakes, where the ice is so crystal clear that fish can be seen near the bottom. “The lakes are normally covered in snow,” said Sanna Kärkkäinen, the managing director of Visit Rovaniemi. “The weather has changed for sure in the past three to five years. It used to be more stable but now it goes from long mild periods to sudden extreme cold.” In recent weeks, the weather has returned to something like its normal pattern and the population of the city – which triples each December with tourists from as far afield as Australia and the US – is once again living in a white landscape. Even so, the locals are worried. Every year, the character of Joulupukki (Old Man Christmas) delivers a festive message – and this year’s was a call for action. “Our friend nature has been in trouble for a while now and now we all can give one gift together: we can help nature. I wish you all a merry Christmas,” he told one reporter. Drøbak – a Norwegian town 25 miles (40km) from Oslo – is home to another Santa Claus post office, as well as a year-round Christmas house. The local tourist manager claims to be the cousin of Santa Claus, who is said to live in the nearby island of Håøya. Compared with other Christmas grottos, this is in a relatively southern location and so the climate is mild with only a 60%-70% chance of a white Christmas. When the seasonal lights were turned on at the start of Advent it was raining, but the snow has finally come. Hans Petter Treider, a local author who has written a book about the life and history of Santa Claus, said Drøbak was doing its bit to fight climate change with an electric ferry service to Santa’s island and a promise to make the town centre car-free by 2030. “We have one earth, and we must take care of it,” he said. The Alaskan city of North Pole, which has its own Santa Claus house complete with a 42ft (13-metre) tall statue of the man in red, is in the middle of its second warmest winter on record. It was only last week that it finally registered freezing temperatures, a delay that one resident described as “unheard of”. Snow used to fall in October but, in recent years, people in the small city close to Fairbanks are more likely to see freezing rain. Last month, the US federal climate assessment said Alaska was warming faster than almost anywhere else in the world and that Alaskans would a hefty bill to pay as the population were forced to adapt. Alaskan senator Lisa Murkowski, however, is pushing for more oil drilling in the state. The Republican also seems to be looking at the melting Arctic as a business prospect. “There are very real opportunities for commerce in the Arctic region. I think Santa figured out that the shortest way to get around the globe was over the pole. He understood the geostrategic position of the Arctic,” she recently tweeted. In Canada, the government has previously granted Santa Claus citizenship rights and established a postal district H0H 0H0 (Ho Ho Ho!) to cover the territory where the old man dressed in the country’s national colours is said to live. The environment ministry was reluctant to comment on a specific individual, but said the broader trends were apparent. “The ice-free area in the North Pole is getting larger and the ice that remains tends to be thinner, younger ice,” wrote spokesperson Mark Johnson. “The Arctic has been warming more than twice as fast as the world as a whole for the past 50 years. The area and duration of snow cover continue to decrease in the Arctic. Over the past 15 years snow has melted from the land surface earlier in the spring (April, May, June) with a shallower snowpack”. Although there has been warm spells over recent years, the weather this winter is expected to be seasonal. Representatives of several other Christmas themed regions including the towns of Santa Claus, Indiana, in the US, Uummannaq in Greenland, and Veliky Ustyug, the putative home of Russia’s Ded Moroz (Father Frost), did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment."

"Pessimism has been the defining political mood of 2018. Pessimism fuelled by fears that young people will be the first generation who find themselves worse off than their parents; that gaping regional inequalities are going to widen post-Brexit; that the world will be overtaken by catastrophic climate change; that we are on the brink of an overwhelming instability in the global order not seen since the cold war. There are certainly reasons to be glum going into 2019. There is not only a growing sense that Britain will be at the mercy of powerful global forces it can do little about. Brexit looms on the horizon, a challenge entirely of our own making that threatens to ensure there is next to no political capacity left for anything else. But the fug of pessimism too easily distracts us from the eminently solvable nature of many of the challenges Britain faces. All it would take is political leadership, courage and ambition. Here are five ideas within the grasp of any government determined to make Britain a kinder, greener, more equitable place to live in the 2020s. Our stretched lifespans are an incredible marker of human progress; a just cause for celebration. But not only are we living longer, we are living longer with frightening and debilitating conditions such as dementia that erode our mental as well as physical capacities. Yet as a society, we have given barely a thought to how we care for older people towards the end of their lives in a way that supports them to live fulfilling, rich lives rather than manages physical decline. This will require profound shifts in how we think about care. But it should begin with a radical reform of entitlements in older age. It is ludicrous and ageist that someone diagnosed with cancer gets free care, whereas most people diagnosed with dementia have to fund their own care. The government should phase in free personal care, funded through progressive taxation. We must also reimagine caring as a high-skill profession, which should start with the government, the biggest buyer of care services, setting higher pay for carers. Just as inventions such as the washing machine have transformed labour markets of the past, so automation and artificial intelligence will continue to transform the labour market of today. We should be wary of dystopian predictions of the end of work; past waves of technological progress have created new jobs to replace the ones displaced. But technology will transform the nature of work, leaving some without the skills they need to adapt, and, left unfettered, will increase inequality. There has been insufficient thinking about how to improve the quality of work today, let alone in the future. We need to prepare by reforming post-18 education funding so that all young people get the sizable state subsidy that those who go to university do, regardless of which route they pick, and by setting up a reskilling fund to offer one-off grants to those who lose their jobs to automation. Unions should be offered new powers contingent on them diversifying their memberships, currently dominated by older, professional, better-paid workers. Climate change poses an increasingly existential threat to mankind and the time available to stave off catastrophic levels of warming is running out. The government must do more to advocate for global net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and set out a plan for the UK to produce net-zero carbon emissions before 2050, including bringing forwards the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030. Always-on technology is changing the way we live our lives, from the way we consume news, interact with friends and buy things. But technology has evolved far faster than government’s willingness to regulate. The government should introduce greater restrictions on the way monolithic tech companies operate. Potential options include establishing a legal “duty of care” towards their users to tackle online abuse, obliging providers to publish the algorithms that determine what people see in their feeds and increasing the digital services tax that will be levied on the UK revenue of large tech companies from 2020. Our majoritarian, two-party system is struggling to cope with a freshly multidimensional political spectrum, in which Brexit has riven both main parties. The quality of political debate has degraded as politicians from both the fringe and the mainstream have grasped at the easy appeal of populism: blaming scapegoats and telling people there are no tough trade-offs. There may be little appetite for the type of institutional reform, such as a more proportional voting system, that the Observer has long supported. But we urgently need to update electoral law for the 21st century, for example by bringing social media campaign spending within national caps and exploring ways to encourage consensus-building and informed debate into our politics, for example through the citizens’ assemblies used in the Irish Republic to empower people to deliberate and issue recommendations on key issues such as abortion. The country indeed faces big societal, technological and climate-related challenges going into 2019. But their scale is far from unprecedented. With political leadership and spirit of the sort we saw in the late 1940s, it’s within the grasp of our leaders to ensure Britain can face the future with optimism."
