"Barack Obama concluded his Alaska trip on Wednesday by visiting a struggling community in the Arctic circle and calling its plight a wake-up call on global warming. The president said climate change was threatening a way of life in the remote village of Kotzebue, on the north-west coast, and pledged clean energy initiatives to help Alaska cut its use of fossil fuels. “I’ve been trying to make the rest of the country more aware of the changing climate but you’re already living it,” he told a crowd of more than 1000 representing about a third of Kotzebue’s population. “What’s happening here is America’s wake-up call.” Obama became the first sitting president to cross the Arctic circle and used the village’s struggles against poverty and the elements to cap a three-day trip focused almost entirely on climate change. “If there’s one thing that threatens opportunity and prosperity for all of us ... it’s the threat of a changing climate,” he told the cheering crowd. “Longer, more dangerous fire seasons. Thawing permafrost that threatens homes and infrastructure. Whether we live in the Arctic circle or the Hawaiian islands, big cities or small towns, we’re one people.” He praised Alaskans’ pioneering spirit, saying for them it was not just a slogan: “It can be harsh. That means that you depend on each other.” He had met communities who faced losing a way of life they had practised for centuries, he said. “For many of those Alaskans it’s no longer a question of if they have to relocate – but when.” Despite progress in reducing greenhouse gases the planet was warming and the US needed to do more to lead the world to a clean energy economy, Obama said. He offered federal help to cope with coastal erosion, high energy costs and, in some cases, relocation. He also vowed to help wean the state off carbon-emitting energy.  “We’re going to deploy more new clean energy projects on native lands and that’s going to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” he said. However, he steered clear of his controversial decision to let Shell drill for oil in the in the Chukchi Sea. Some locals welcome the economic opportunities but critics say it will undermine his climate agenda. Climate change is happening twice as quickly in Alaska as in the continental US. In Kotzebue, which abuts the Bering Strait, melting ice has increased shipping and shipping-related jobs. However, it has also left remote villages exposed to powerful storms. Degrading permafrost has led to sinkholes. On the way to Kotzebue the president directed Air Force One to descend to yield a closer view of the hamlet of Kivalina, which residents have voted to relocate as it sinks into the sea. “Think about it.” Obama said. “If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we’d do everything in our power to protect it.”  Earlier he met fisherman and families in the town of Dillingham, in Bristol bay, home to one of the world’s largest sockeye salmon fisheries. He performed with children in a traditional Yup’ik dance and amid drizzle joined women who had anchored fishing nets by the banks of the Nushagak river. As he lifted a silver salmon it relieved itself on his shoes. “Uh-oh. What happened there?” he asked. “Generally you don’t want fish spawning over your feet.”"

"A petition launched by Desmond Tutu urging global leaders to create a world run 100% on renewables within 35 years has been backed by more than 300,000 people globally. It describes climate change as “one of the greatest moral challenges of our time”.  The petition on Change.org calls upon US president Barack Obama and UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon to set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town and Nobel peace laureate who rose to fame for his anti-apartheid activism, said: “As responsible citizens of the world – sisters and brothers of one family, the human family, God’s family – we have a duty to persuade our leaders to lead us in a new direction: to help us abandon our collective addiction to fossil fuels. We can no longer continue feeding our addiction to fossil fuels as if there were no tomorrow. For there will be no tomorrow.” The petition is one of many in a wider faith-based campaign led by religious leaders designed to increase pressure on politicians around the world to deliver a new global climate change agreement when they gather at a crunch summit at Paris in December. Leaders include the Supreme Patriarch of Cambodia Tep Vong, the former Grand Mufti of Egypt Sheikh Ali Gomaa and Cardinal Damasceno Assis, Archbishop of Aparecida in São Paulo, Brazil. The petition reads: “Climate change is one of the greatest moral challenges of our time ... we need bold action like this to keep global temperature rise below the unacceptably dangerous tipping point of two degrees, to phase out carbon pollution to zero, and to invest resources in sustainable development pathways to build a more flourishing, inclusive and balanced world.” At a summit in Bavaria in June, G7 leaders including Obama and German chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to end the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century. Although some environmental groups heralded it as a “historic” announcement that would send an important signal for faster worldwide action, critics have said that the transition to renewables needs to be quicker if the internationally agreed target to keep global warming within 2C is to be met. The petition has also been backed by US actor Lindsey Shaw.  Barack Obama: Announce a more ambitious renewable energy target before Paris - Sign the Petition! https://t.co/yOkR68GsFS via @Change"
"Around the world, fresh water supplies are drying up: California in the US and São Paulo in Brazil are enduring historic droughts, groundwater sources have been plundered in south Asia, and globally more than 750 million people lack access to safe drinking water. The global fresh water shortage is one of the world’s most pressing challenges, yet the issue is not scheduled to be discussed at Cop21 – the UN’s climate change conference – in Paris this December.  Those working to deliver water to communities or conserve fresh water sources have a duty to demonstrate ways to adapt to climate change and help policymakers understand the importance of water in a warming world. NGOs, businesses and others working in the sector must build alliances to show how to improve the world’s water problems, such as making the transition to solar energy or planting drought-resistant crops. This was the central message of a panel discussion, organised by the Guardian and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), and sponsored by Fundación Femsa, which creates programmes focused on conservation and the sustainable use of water. The panel discussion was held at SIWI’s annual World Water Week conference. Although Cop discussions have been held for the past 20 years, the issue of fresh water has not been part of the official agenda, even though it is so closely linked to climate change. The panellists suggested that the most effective way for water to be incorporated into climate policy would be through an action agenda where those working in the sector could show governments the types of water projects that could help communities mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.  “It’s important to demonstrate initiatives and good examples to drive the process – don’t depend on the decisions being made in Paris,” said Karin Lexén, director of World Water Week, International Process and Prizes. Benedito Braga, president of the World Water Council, agreed: “We need to have interesting proposals of projects on the ground, which means involving not only national governments, but also the private sector and the academic community.” However, there was some debate around whether or not water needs to be included in the resulting climate change agreement from Cop21. “One of the things I’ve seen throughout all these years of Cop talks is that even if the topic is not present [in the text], the water still creeps in,” said Vidal Garza Cantu, director of Fundación Femsa.  The language used to talk about climate change was a key theme throughout the discussion. David Tickner, WWF’s head of fresh water programmes, said that while some people do not understand climate change, they do understand floods and droughts. “If we communicated on floods and droughts and their connection to climate change in some areas, that could help our politics.” Encouraging governments and policymakers to look at how water is essential to their biggest priorities, such as energy supply, could also help, said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum.  Waughray cited India’s pursuit of energy access through coal as an example. While coal may be the cheapest and most reliable source of energy for India, it is crucial to demonstrate that in the long run, it is not the most sustainable option because of the amount of water needed. “How secure is your coal plan when you’ll need an awful lot of water to cool all those power stations?” said Waughray, demonstrating how to present the issue to officials. “In the US, 26% of installed capacity for coal is in water-stressed areas, and look what’s happening to them right now – they are close to blackouts in some states. Is that where you want to be?” This highlighting of the risks of using water so recklessly has encouraged action in the private sector. “We have looked at our business risk and understood how climate change and water issues are going to change how we do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, and impact on our profitability” said Ellen Silva, senior manager of applied sustainability at General Mills.  “I would call out to corporations to be transparent about your risks. Face them and you’ll find partners lining up to work with you and solve those problems.”  Tickner, however, urged caution around using risk terminology, saying that while it resonates with the private sector and governments, opportunities must also be talked about. “What are the opportunities here for governments and business to do things better? Opportunity terminology can also be very powerful,” he said. Waughray agreed: “The risk issue has sunk in. The next stage is opportunity and that’s where this momentum, the alliance-building and the positive engagement about solutions, comes into play.”  Collaboration was frequently proposed as a way to see water included in climate change discussions, with many recognising that, in the past, some of the most effective alliances were formed on the sidelines. Waughray cited the New York declaration on forests, a commitment by world leaders to end natural forest loss by 2030 that grew out of the secretary general’s Climate Summit in 2014, as a successful example in the forestry sector.  Lexén explained that during the various climate conferences and diplomatic processes over the years, SIWI has tried to stay on the sidelines, talking to people about how they can assist the organisation’s work. “What we’ve seen when we’ve been in the corridors of conferences, is that we get more and more requests from the secretariat to feed into their programmes.” Sometimes, Lexén told the audience, it is more important to be there and be ready to respond to the cause than to ask decision makers: “Please could you put a bit about water in [the Cop21] text?”  One alliance the water community could build upon, said Cantu, is with science. “When you get the basics of scientific knowledge and technology in to the discourse on water, you get all the allies that you want,” he said. “It’s important that we pursue knowledge on water to the edge, to share it with other communities and make it available so we can allow other allies to join in a very clear effort.”  The issue of finance, and how to obtain funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, was raised by several of the expert panellists. The water sector must reach out to governments that can make changes, support ideas around adaptation, and put the financial resources in place, said Braga: “You have a beautiful declaration, you commit to this and that, but where is the money going to come from?” The goal, he said, is to motivate governments to contribute to a fund that will support poor countries already facing the effects of climate change to become more resilient.  The chair of the debate, Karl Mathiesen, however, questioned whether or not such a financial mechanism already existed in the form of the Green Climate Fund – a framework established by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – to redistribute money from developed to developing countries, to fund adaptation and mitigation initiatives.  Braga said yes, that is the purpose of the fund, but that until now it has focused on reducing carbon emissions and not measures such as building water infrastructure and supporting water governance.  Lexén added that throughout the World Water Week conference, she had listened to talks by Héla Cheikhrouhou, executive director of the Green Climate Fund: “I think the message she is conveying is that there’s a decision for the fund to give 50% to adaptation projects and 50% to mitigation projects. But so far, they haven’t received high-quality projects on water so we need to deliver on that.”  Tickner stressed the importance of water professionals being involved in the planning and design of any financial mechanisms geared towards funding climate change adaption and mitigation measures.  As for the types of initiatives water professionals show to decision makers, Tickner had a range of ideas: “We could show how you can conserve areas such as peatlands or wetlands, which are important carbon sinks.  “We could help to show how you can zone river basins to get the maximum sustainable hydropower out of them, without screwing up ecosystems.  “We could work on demand management for water. We can show urban spatial planning and its win-wins for water, climate, biodiversity and health. There are 101 things we can do that would be positive, full of great opportunities and will produce mutual benefits. “If bad mitigation or adaptation projects get funded, they can have really negative trade-off effects,” he said. “So we need to get in there and ask how can you design a project where: those trade-offs are transparent; there is an equitable process for making decisions about what gets approved and what doesn’t; and as many win-win projects are funded as possible.” On one viewpoint the panel was unanimous: that Cop21 is not the end of efforts to get water included in climate change talks. “This is just part of a process,” said Braga. “We should not think only of one single event – it’s a process that moves forward.” Karl Mathiesen (Chair) Environmental journalist, the Guardian Benedito Braga President, World Water Council Dominic WaughrayHead of public-private partnerships, World Economic Forum Karin LexénDirector, World Water Week, International Processes and Prizes, SIWI Ellen SilvaSenior manager, applied sustainability, General Mills David TicknerHead of fresh water programmes adviser, WWF Vidal Garza CantuDirector, Fundación Femsa Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"Any day now Arctic sea-ice is going to hit its lowest extent for the year, and once again it’s set to be one of the lowest years on record (the four lowest years have all occurred since 2007). Already a number of ships have glided safely through the fabled northwest passage, unencumbered by sea-ice. Typically the Arctic sea-ice minimum occurs in mid to late September and the signs so far suggest a lean year. Back in August the sea-ice covered 5.61m square kilometres – the fourth lowest August average in the satellite record. And by the end of August the area of sea-ice was already in sixth lowest position.  For polar bears, Arctic seals and sailors, the shrinkage has direct implications, but the great polar melt may also be affecting mid-latitudes, by altering our weather patterns. New climate model simulations, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, indicate that the Arctic’s weakening icy grip will increase the risk of wet extremes over mid-latitude Eurasia and reduce the chances of cold extremes over central and eastern North America in the coming decades. In central Asia, there will be increased chance of cold and wet extremes. These changes are most likely caused partly by sea-ice melt allowing more ocean heat to escape, and partly by decreased reflection of the sun’s heat from bright white areas of sea-ice. This additional Arctic warmth gets spread southwards and can also affect atmospheric circulation, changing the strength and location of major winds such as the jet stream."
"Malcolm Turnbull has defended the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy and having a public vote on marriage equality after the next election, as he came under pressure to explain his U-turns on his first day as prime minister. Turnbull, who was sworn in as Australia’s 29th prime minister shortly before parliamentary question time on Tuesday, thanked the person he had ousted, Tony Abbott, for “his leadership and his service over many, many years” and indicated he would announce a new ministry later this week or early next week.  Abbott, who said earlier that he would not seek to undermine the new leader upon his return to the backbench, was not in the chamber to hear the tributes at the beginning of question time. Turnbull told his colleagues, at a Coalition joint party room meeting, that he would seek to restore an open, consultative model for the prime minister’s office of the type that existed under the long-serving leader John Howard. The new prime minister appointed the former Howard operative Tony Nutt as his director of transition and named the head of the communications department, Drew Clarke, as his acting chief of staff. There were no immediate ministerial resignations, even though there has been intense speculation about the future of Joe Hockey as treasurer. The social services minister, Scott Morrison, has been widely tipped as being in line for the role after Turnbull criticised the government’s performance in selling its economic messages. The defence minister, Kevin Andrews, who was a key supporter of Abbott and is from the party’s conservative wing, signalled he would like to remain in the role given the need for stability at this “very significant time for defence”. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, who was reportedly a contender for the defence portfolio, said he had “always had a keen interest in history and military matters”. Pyne is from the manufacturing state of South Australia, where the government’s popularity has collapsed amid suggestions work on the next fleet of submarines could be done overseas. There is also speculation that women will be promoted in the reshuffle. The attorney general, George Brandis, said his colleagues accepted there would be a reshuffle and he would be happy to continue in his present role “but of course that’s entirely a matter for the prime minister”. Brandis told the ABC’s 7.30 program he had supported Turnbull because the Coalition had been at real risk of losing next year’s election to the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who could “trash the China free trade agreement”. But Shorten sought to reach out to Turnbull to resolve the free trade issue on Tuesday, writing to the new prime minister seeking a meeting to discuss Labor’s proposals for jobs safeguards. Shorten said he believed “complementary safeguards” could be formulated without delaying the agreement’s timely implementation, and it would be best to find a bipartisan approach. Turnbull faced an early embarrassment on Tuesday after three Nationals senators crossed the floor to support a symbolic Greens motion advocating changes to competition laws, and two others abstained from the vote. Labor and the Liberals did not support the motion, which was about the introduction of a so-called “effects test” backed by small business but opposed by big business. The issue had previously divided Abbott’s cabinet, which deferred consideration of the issue two weeks ago. In question time, Labor targeted Turnbull for his previously expressed support for “every single” measure in the poorly received 2014 budget. Turnbull fired back by telling Shorten that the cabinet system of government required ministers to support the decisions. Turnbull left the door open to considering policy changes but said he would not unilaterally disavow measures because he would “lead a traditional cabinet government”. “Policies will change in the light of changed conditions, of course they will,” Turnbull said. “But we stand by every decision we make, the cabinet stands by every decision we make, and as we revise them and improve them in the light of experience we will stand by those, too.” The prime minister made it clear that people should not expect any immediate changes in two policy areas about which he has previously been outspoken: climate policy and marriage equality. This reflects the Coalition agreement the Nationals leader, Warren Truss, negotiated with him on Tuesday. Turnbull, who previously supported emissions trading and said in 2010 that “having the government pick projects for subsidy is a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”, has now locked in behind the use of the government’s emissions reduction fund. Turnbull said the first fund auction in April was “a resounding success” and insisted his remarks were “about different proposals years ago”. He said the budget funding for the policy pursued by the environment minister, Greg Hunt, was capped so “it cannot result in an unlimited amount of fiscal commitment”. “It doesn’t matter how you cut emissions as long as they are cut,” Turnbull said. Turnbull also backed the government’s “very substantial” previously announced target to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions so they are 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Greens MP Adam Bandt accused Turnbull of being “beholden to the hardliners in your ranks” on climate change. Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, also tried to pressure Turnbull to repeat his recently stated support for Coalition MPs to be granted a free vote in the parliament on marriage equality legislation . But Turnbull locked in behind Abbott’s policy of a “people’s vote” some time in the next parliamentary term, fulfilling yet another element of his agreement with the Nationals, despite his earlier suggestions such a vote should be held sooner rather than later. “Historically issues of this type have been resolved in parliament by free vote and the honourable member is correct in referring to that,” he said. “Another way of dealing with this is by vote of the people. And the Coalition, our government, has decided that the resolution of this matter will be determined by a vote of the people, all the people, via a plebiscite, to be held after the next election.” When the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, accused him of selling out, Turnbull rallied the Coalition backbench by denouncing the “utter failure of the opposition to approach issues other than in a thoroughly ideological way”. Turnbull said: “Why is the opposition afraid of the people having a vote? Why don’t they want all Australians having a vote? There is no greater virtue in a free vote here or a plebiscite. They are each means of resolving the matter - one, I grant you is more expensive but, nonetheless, it is a very legitimate and democratic way of dealing with it.” A snap SMS poll by Roy Morgan on Tuesday showed strong early support for Turnbull’s leadership. About 70% of the 1,200 respondents thought Turnbull would make a better prime minister than Shorten, while just 24% backed Shorten. Ministers who publicly supported Abbott before the leadership vote sought to draw a line under the upheaval, insisting the job of government continued. Hockey put on a brave face in parliament amid persistent speculation about Morrison being in line for his job. The treasurer said he would introduce legislation to the parliament on Wednesday “to go after multinationals not paying their fair share of tax”. Referring to Turnbull by his electorate title rather than as the prime minister, Hockey said: “The honourable member for Wentworth is perfectly entitled to make a statement, as he did yesterday, about how we can do better and you know what, we can always do better. We can always do better. But I tell you what, we’re doing a hell of a lot better than the Labor party.” In the Senate, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said he was “looking forward to working with the prime minister in building Australia’s stronger economic and fiscal foundations for the future”. Another Abbott backer and the leader of the government in the Senate, Eric Abetz, said his hands were clean. “Can I indicate that we serve at the pleasure of the leader and we do so on a daily basis irrespective of who might be leader,” Abetz said. “The king is dead, long live the king, and the prime minister has our support.” Labor sources said they would have preferred to face Abbott at the next general election, due in 2016, but had been prepared for the leadership change and that they would attack Turnbull on the basis of arrogance, personal ambition and selling out his principles. The Labor party wasted no time rolling out a television advertisement to air in Western Australia before Saturday’s Canning byelection, highlighting his emphatic support for Abbott’s “unfair” budget measures. In a speech to Labor colleagues on Tuesday, Shorten said the Liberals had “panicked” and elected a new leader but “it’s the same old stuff rebadged as new”. “Australians understand the thing about Malcolm is it’s always about Malcolm,” he said. “We have seen off one bad Liberal prime minister and we will do this again...If you want a new direction in this country you’ve got to vote for a new government: a Shorten Labor government.”"
"The University of California has sold off $200m (£130m) of coal and oil sand investments from its $98bn investment fund less than a year after initially refusing to do so. In September of last year, the university’s board of regents chief investment officer Jagdeep Singh Bachner refused to sell off the holdings, arguing that a more “holistic approach” than divestment was needed. But he said that a drop in global demand and stricter regulations had now made such investments too risky, reports Reuters. The university has not changed its policy though and says it may purchase such coal or oil investments in future if the market changes.  At a board of regents meeting on Wednesday, Bachner said: “For us, this is not just about here’s a set of beliefs and a set of values, we are going to be transparent about it on our website. We’ve gone one step further as part of our house keeping and managing risks over the course of the year, and selling our direct holdings, to reiterate, in coal mining companies, oil sands focused companies.” The board manages a $98bn portfolio made up of its pension, endowment and working capital invesments. Campaigners say that $3bn of this is made up of “fossil fuel related” investments. Bachner said the university will factor a carbon price into its investment approach towards energy utility companies. Despite a three year campaign by students across seven of the university’s 10 campuses, the move took divestment campaigners by surprise. Founder of 350.org, the environmental NGO that has galvanised the global fossil fuel divestment movement tweeted: “Um, developing story: it looks like the Univ of California is divesting its enormous portfolio from coal and tar sands oil. If true – wow.”  Um, developing story: it looks like the Univ of California is divesting its enormous portfolio from coal and tarsands oil. If true--wow The fund is almost triple the size of Harvard’s endowment, where students have been leading a high profile divestment campaign, occupying Massachusetts Hall where the university’s president is based and even taking the university to court.  The university’s decision comes a week after a landmark bill was passed in California to divest the state’s pension funds – the largest in the US – from thermal coal. Newcastle’s city council in Australia, home to the world’s biggest coal port, also recently voted to exit their holdings in major banks if they do not divest.  Known for years as the most successful divestment campaign in history, the movement has now persuaded more than 390 institutions worldwide to divest from pension funds to universities to faith organisations.

"Europe has undergone a severe drought this summer, the worst in over a decade. Temperatures have been high across the continent, and have combined with low rainfalls. This drought, like the one in 2012 in the United States, are a sign of what our future holds in a warming world.  As humans emit greenhouse gases, the world warms. We already know that. But a warming world is also host to other changes. Among the most important changes are those to the water cycle. Scientists refer to this as the hydrological cycle – basically changes to the storage of water in the soil and underground, the evaporation of water into the atmosphere, and the subsequent rainfall and runoff that occurs.   A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, as people know through the personal experience of high humidity in warm months. Changes to humidity have been measured over the past decades and confirm our expectations. These changes lead to increased rainfall.  At the same time, higher temperatures accelerate evaporation, which dries out the soil and plants and can create drought conditions. We see then that competing factors are in play. On the one hand, we expect there to be more intense rainfall. On the other hand, we expect more drying. Which process wins depends on where you live. The prevailing view is that areas which are currently wet will become wetter. Areas that are currently dry will become drier. Finally, rainfall will occur in heavier doses. A recent report has been released about current conditions in Europe and in particular, on the 2015 heat wave and drought. The organization (European Drought Observatory) has an online report which is easy to obtain and read here. They report that very hot weather in Europe during June and July 2015 affected France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy and Spain.  High temperatures combined with low rainfall have created very dry conditions. Not only were temperatures high, but they remained high for a long time, particularly in parts of Spain. The images below show which regions have been hotter than normal (yellow, orange, and red colors) as well as which areas have been drier than normal (yellow, orange, and red). Both regions extend across a wide swath of Europe. Countries are dealing with the water shortage by placing restrictions on water use, especially in the agricultural sector. However, the lack of water is also affecting public water supply, river transportation, natural habitats, plants, animals, and insects, and power supply. But it could get worse. Long-range weather forecasts are for continued warm and dry conditions through September. Future rain is particularly important for vegetation. As the report states,  the effects of weather conditions on vegetation are generally cumulative and delayed in time, weather conditions during August and September will be even more important in determining the further decline or prompt recovery of vegetative growth. I contacted staff at the European Drought Observatory, and Dr. Jürgen Vogt told me,  Extreme temperatures and dry conditions as observed this year are likely to increase in frequency and severity over the coming decades, posing great challenges to our societies."

"The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has defended Peter Dutton a day after the immigration minister was caught joking about the plight of Pacific Island nations facing rising sea levels. Abbott drew attention to Dutton’s work on the refugee crisis, congratulating him during an address at the Nationals federal council meeting on Saturday.  “If there’s one thing that should be remembered about Peter Dutton’s week, it’s that this is the week that he masterminded the plan to bring 12,000 needy people to this country,” Abbott said in Canberra. Abbott said Australia has responded “with decency and with strength to the problems of the wider world”. “Rather than just say it’s none of our business ... we have risen to the challenge,” he said. Dutton has been heavily criticised since making the joke about climate change on Friday. Noting that a meeting in Canberra was running a bit late, Dutton quipped it was running to “Cape York time”, to which Abbott replied: “We had a bit of that up in Port Moresby.” Dutton then said: “Time doesn’t mean anything when you’re about to have water lapping at your door.” The president of Kiribati has since called the joke “vulgar” and “quite unbecoming of leadership”. Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite called on Dutton to apologise for the remark, saying the “distasteful” comments will do “enormous damage” to Australia’s relationship with its neighbours. He said Pacific communities have been pleading with the Abbott government to do more on climate change, and Dutton’s comment made it harder to find a solution."
"It was 20 years after I chose to become a historian that I first saw a photograph of the woman who made my career possible. In the small photograph that my doctoral supervisor, her son, showed me in his Warsaw apartment, Wanda J radiates self-possession, a quality that stood her in good stead during the Nazi occupation. She was a Jewish mother who protected herself and her two sons from the German campaign of mass murder that killed almost all of her fellow Warsaw Jews. When her family was summoned to the ghetto, she refused to go. She moved her children from place to place, relying upon the help of friends, acquaintances and strangers. When first the ghetto and then the rest of the city of Warsaw were burned to the ground, what counted, she thought, was the “faultless moral instinct” of the people who chose to help Jews. Most of us would like to think that we possess a “moral instinct”. Perhaps we imagine that we would be rescuers in some future catastrophe. Yet if states were destroyed, local institutions corrupted and economic incentives directed towards murder, few of us would behave well. There is little reason to think that we are ethically superior to the Europeans of the 1930s and 1940s, or for that matter less vulnerable to the kind of ideas that Hitler so successfully promulgated and realised. A historian must be grateful to Wanda J for her courage and for the trace of herself that she left behind. But a historian must also consider why rescuers were so few. It is all too easy to fantasise that we, too, would have aided Wanda J. Separated from National Socialism by time and luck, we can dismiss Nazi ideas without contemplating how they functioned. It is our very forgetfulness of the circumstances of the Holocaust that convinces us that we are different from Nazis and shrouds the ways that we are the same. We share Hitler’s planet and some of his preoccupations; we have perhaps changed less than we think. The Holocaust began with the idea that no human instinct was moral. Hitler described humans as members of races doomed to eternal and bloody struggle among themselves for finite resources. Hitler denied that any idea, be it religious, philosophical or political, justified seeing the other (or loving the other) as oneself. He claimed that conventional forms of ethics were Jewish inventions, and that conventional states would collapse during the racial struggle. Hitler specifically, and quite wrongly, denied that agricultural technology could alter the relationship between people and nourishment. Hitler’s alternative to science and politics was known as Lebensraum, which meant “habitat” or “ecological niche”. Races needed ever more Lebensraum, “room to live”, in order to feed themselves and propagate their kind. Nature demanded that the higher races overmaster and starve the lower. Since the innate desire of each race was to reproduce and conquer, the struggle was indefinite and eternal. At the same time, Lebensraum also meant “living room”, with the connotations of comfort and plenty in family life. The desire for pleasure and security could never be satisfied, thought Hitler, since Germans “take the circumstances of the American life as the benchmark”. Because standards of living were always subjective and relative, the demand for pleasure was insatiable. Lebensraum thus brought together two claims: that human beings were mindless animals who always needed more, and jealous tribes who always wanted more. It confused lifestyle with life itself, generating survivalist emotions in the name of personal comfort. Hitler was not simply a nationalist or an authoritarian. For him, German politics were only a means to an end of restoring the state of nature. “One must not be diverted from the borders of Eternal Right,” as Hitler put it, “by the existence of political borders.” Likewise, to characterise Hitler as an antisemite or an anti-Slavic racist underestimates the potential of Nazi ideas. His ideas about Jews and Slavs were not prejudices that happened to be extreme, but rather emanations of a coherent worldview that contained the potential to change the world. By presenting Jews as an ecological flaw responsible for the disharmony of the planet, Hitler channelled and personalised the inevitable tensions of globalisation. The only sound ecology was to eliminate a political enemy; the only sound politics was to purify the earth; the means to these ends would be the destruction of states. The state stood at the middle of the story of those who wished to kill Jews, and of those who wished to save them. Its mutation within Germany after Hitler’s rise to power, and then its destruction in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1938 and 1939, transformed Jews from citizens into objects of exploitation. The Final Solution as mass murder began in a zone of double state destruction. Hitler finally got the European war that he wanted by treating his ultimate enemy as his temporary friend. In September 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east just after Germany attacked from the west. The German-Soviet Treaty of Borders and Friendship arranged a final division of Poland and endorsed the Soviet occupation and destruction of the three Baltic states. The USSR then proceeded very quickly to deport or murder the social and political elites in its new western territories. When Hitler betrayed Stalin and Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, German soldiers and then special SS-led task forces known as Einsatzgruppen first encountered populations that had been subject to the Soviet version of state destruction. It was this double assault upon state institutions in the Baltic states and eastern Poland, at first by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi Germany, that created the special field of experimentation where ideas of a Final Solution became the practice of mass murder. The Germans found political allies among antisemites and people who wished to restore statehood or undo the humiliation of national defeat. They found pragmatic allies, and these were likely more numerous, among people who wished to shift the burden of their own prior collaboration with the Soviets upon the Jewish minority. The Germans also found that they themselves, far more than their leaders expected, were capable of shooting Jews in cold blood. Not only the Einsatzgruppen but German police and soldiers killed Jews in huge mass shootings over pits. In the encounter of German with Soviet power, the Nazi idea that Jews were responsible for all evil took on powerful resonance: for local Slavs and Balts seeking revenge for the loss of statehood or an alibi for their own Soviet collaboration or an excuse for stealing from Jews, for Germans themselves who associated Jews with all real or imagined resistance, and then for Hitler after the tide of war turned against him. In December 1941, when the Red Army counterattacked at Moscow and the United States joined the war, Hitler blamed the global alliance on global Jewry and called for their total eradication. By this time, the Holocaust as mass shooting had extended through Soviet Belarus, Soviet Ukraine, and into Soviet Russia. In 1942 the German policy of total killing then spread back west into territories that the Germans controlled before 1941: the subject nations of western Europe, the allies of central and southern Europe and indeed to Germany itself. German Jews were not murdered inside prewar Germany, but deported instead to zones of statelessness in the east, where they could be killed. The Holocaust spread insofar as states were weakened, but no further. Where political structures held, they provided support and means to people who wished to help Jews. Throughout Europe, but to different degrees in different places, German occupation destroyed the institutions that made ideas of reciprocity seem plausible. Where Germans obliterated conventional states, or annihilated Soviet institutions that had just destroyed conventional states, they created the abyss where racism and politics pulled together towards nothingness. In this black hole, Jews were murdered. When Jews were saved, it was often thanks to people who could act on behalf of a state or by institutions that could function like a state. When none of the moral illumination of institutions was present, kindness was all that remained, and the pale light of the individual rescuers shone. As Hitler himself knew, there was a political alternative to ecological panic and state destruction: the pursuit of agricultural technology at home rather than Lebensraum abroad. The scientific approach to dwindling resources, which Hitler insisted was a Jewish lie, in fact held much more promise for Germans (and for everyone else) than an endless race war. Scientists, many of them Germans, were already preparing the way for the improvements in agriculture known as the “green revolution”. Had Hitler not begun a world war that led to his suicide, he would have lived to see the day when Europe’s problem was not food shortage but surpluses. Science provided food so quickly and bountifully that Hitlerian ideas of struggle lost a good deal of their resonance – which has helped us to forget what the second world war was actually about. In 1989, 100 years after Hitler’s birth, world food prices were about half of what they had been in 1939 – despite a huge increase in world population and thus demand. The compression of politics and science into Lebensraum empowered a Führer to define the good of the race, mutate German institutions and oversee the destruction of neighbouring states. His worldview also compressed time. There was no history for Hitler: only a timeless pattern of Jewish deception and the useful models of British and American imperialism. There was also no future as such: just the unending prospect of the double insatiability of need and want. By combining what seemed like the pattern of the past (racial empire) with what seemed like an urgent summons from the future (ecological panic), Nazi thinking closed the safety valves of contemplation and foresight. If past and future contained nothing but struggle and scarcity, all attention fell upon the present. A psychic resolve for relief from a sense of crisis overwhelmed the practical resolve to think about the future. Rather than seeing the ecosystem as open to research and rescue, Hitler imagined that a supernatural factor – the Jews – had perverted it. Once defined as an eternal and immutable threat to the human species and the whole natural order, Jews could be targeted for urgent and extraordinary measures. If we think that we are victims of some planetary conspiracy, we edge towards Hitler The test that was supposed to confirm Hitler’s idea of nature, the campaign that was to rescue Germans from the intolerably claustrophobic present, was the colonial war against the Soviet Union. The 1941 invasion of the USSR threw millions of Germans into a war of extermination on lands inhabited by millions of Jews. This was the war that Hitler wanted; the actions of 1938, 1939 and 1940 were preparation and improvisation, generating experience in the destruction of states. The course of the war on the eastern front created two fundamental political opportunities. At first, the zoological portrayal of Slavs justified the elimination of their polities, creating the zones where the Holocaust could become possible. Then, with time, Germany’s uncertain fortune revealed the deep political logic of Hitler’s thinking – the practical relationship between Lebensraum and planetary antisemitism. It was when these two ideas could be brought together – territorially, politically, and conceptually – that a Holocaust could proceed. In the Nazi mind, war was both colonial (to seize territory from the Slavs) and decolonial (to weaken the global domination of Jews). As the colonial war for Lebensraum faltered, Nazis emphasised instead the struggle to save the planet from Jewish domination. Since Jews were held responsible for the ideas that had supposedly suppressed the stronger races, only their extermination could ensure victory. The SS men who had begun as state destroyers, murdering members of groups thought to be the bastions of enemy polities, became the mass murderers of Jews. Wherever German power undid Soviet power, significant numbers of local people joined in the killing. In occupied Poland in 1942, most Jews were deported from their ghettos and murdered by gassing, as at Treblinka. Yet even at this extreme the colonial, material element never entirely vanished. In Warsaw, hungry Jews were drawn to the deportation point by promises of bread and marmalade. Himmler issued the order to kill them at the moment he decided that the labour they provided was less valuable than the calories they consumed. Ecological panic and state destruction might seem exotic. Most people in Europe and North America live in functional states, taking for granted the sovereignty that preserved the lives of Jews and others during the war. After two generations, the green revolution has removed the fear of hunger from the emotions of electorates and the vocabulary of politicians. The open expression of antisemitic ideas is a taboo in much of the west, if perhaps a receding one. Yet we like our living space, we fantasise about destroying governments, we denigrate science, we dream of catastrophe. If we think that we are victims of some planetary conspiracy, we edge towards Hitler. If we believe that the Holocaust was a result of the inherent characteristics of Jews, Germans, Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, or anyone else, then we are moving in Hitler’s world. Hitler’s programme confused biology with desire. Lebensraum unified need with want, murder with convenience. It implied a plan to restore the planet by mass murder and a promise of a better life for German families. Since 1945, one of the two senses of Lebensraum has spread across most of the world: a living room, the dream of household comfort. The other sense of Lebensraum is habitat, the realm that must be controlled for survival, inhabited perhaps temporarily by people characterised as not quite fully human. Once standard of living is confused with living, a rich society can make war upon those who are poorer in the name of survival. Tens of millions of people died in Hitler’s war not so that Germans could live, but so that Germans could pursue the American dream. Hitler was right to believe that, in an age of global communication, notions of prosperity had become relative and fluid. After his pursuit of Lebensraum failed with the final German defeat in 1945, the green revolution satisfied demand in Europe and much of the world, providing not just the food needed for bare physical survival, but a sense of security and an anticipation of plenitude. Yet no scientific solution is eternal; the political choice to support science buys time, but does not guarantee that future choices will be good ones. Another moment of choice, a bit like the one Germans faced in the 1930s, could be on the way. The green revolution, perhaps the one development that most distinguishes our world from Hitler’s, might be reaching its limits. This is not so much because there are too many people on earth, but because more of the people on earth demand ever larger and more secure supplies of food. World grain production per capita peaked in the 1980s. In 2003, China, the world’s most populous country, became a net importer of grain. In the 21st century, world grain stocks have never exceeded more than a few months’ supply. During the hot summer of 2008, fires in fields led major food suppliers to cease exports altogether, and food riots broke out in Bolivia, Cameroon, Egypt, Haiti, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Yemen. During the drought of 2010, the prices of agricultural commodities spiked again, leading to protests, revolution, ethnic cleansing and revolution in the Middle East. The civil war in Syria began after four consecutive years of drought drove farmers to overcrowded cities. Though the world is not likely to run out of food as such, richer societies may again become concerned about future supplies. Their elites could find themselves once again facing choices about how to define the relationship between politics and science. As Hitler demonstrated, merging the two opens the way to ideology that can seem to both explain and resolve the sense of panic. In a scenario of mass killing that resembled the Holocaust, leaders of a developed country might follow or induce panic about future shortages and act preemptively, specifying a human group as the source of an ecological problem, destroying other states by design or by accident. There need not be any compelling reason for concern about life and death, as the Nazi example shows, only a momentary conviction that dramatic action is needed to preserve a way of life. It seems reasonable to worry that the second sense of the term Lebensraum, seeing other people’s land as habitat, is latent. In much of the world, the dominant sense of time is coming to resemble, in some respects, the catastrophism of Hitler’s era. During the second half of the 20th century, the future appeared as a gift that was on the way. The duelling ideologies of capitalism and communism accepted the future as their realm of competition and promised a coming bounty. In the plans of government agencies, the plotlines of novels, and the drawings of children, the future was resplendent in anticipation. This sensibility seems to have disappeared. In high culture the future now clings to us, heavy with complications and crises, dense with dilemmas and disappointments. In vernacular media – films, video games and graphic novels – the future is presented as post-catastrophic. Nature has taken some revenge that makes conventional politics seem irrelevant, reducing society to struggle and rescue. The earth’s surface grows wild, humans go feral and anything is possible. Hitler the politician was right that a rapturous sense of catastrophic time creates the potential for radical action Hitler the politician was right that a rapturous sense of catastrophic time creates the potential for radical action. When an apocalypse is on the horizon, waiting for scientific solutions seems senseless, struggle seems natural and demagogues of blood and soil come to the fore. The planet is changing in ways that might make Hitlerian descriptions of life, space and time more plausible. The expected increase of average global temperatures by 4C this century would transform human life on much of the globe. Climate change is unpredictable, which exacerbates the problem. Present trends mislead, since feedback effects await. If ice sheets collapse, heat from the sun will be absorbed by seawater rather than reflected back into space. If the Siberian tundra melts, methane will rise from the earth, trapping heat in the atmosphere. If the Amazon basin is stripped of jungle, it will release a massive pulse of carbon dioxide. Global processes are always experienced locally, and local factors can either restrain or amplify them. Perhaps the experience of unprecedented storms, relentless droughts and the associated wars and south-to-north migrations will jar expectations about the security of resources and make Hitlerian politics more resonant. As Hitler demonstrated, humans are able to portray a looming crisis in such a way as to justify drastic measures in the present. Under enough stress, or with enough skill, politicians can effect the conflations Hitler pioneered: between nature and politics, between ecosystem and household, between need and desire. A global problem that seems otherwise insoluble can be blamed upon a specific group of human beings. Hitler was a child of the first globalisation, which arose under imperial auspices at the end of the 19th century. We are the children of the second, that of the late 20th century. Globalisation is neither a problem nor a solution; it is a condition with a history. It brings a specific intellectual danger. Since the world is more complex than a country or a city, the temptation is to seek some master key to understanding everything. When a global order collapses, as was the experience of many Europeans in the second, third and fourth decades of the 20th century, a simplistic diagnosis such as Hitler’s can seem to clarify the global by referring to the ecological, the supernatural or the conspiratorial. When the normal rules seem to have been broken and expectations have been shattered, a suspicion can be burnished that someone (the Jews, for example) has somehow diverted nature from its proper course. A problem that is truly planetary in scale, such as climate change, obviously demands global solutions – and one apparent solution is to define a global enemy. Americans, when they think about the Holocaust at all, take for granted that they could never commit such a crime. The US army, after all, was on the right side of the second world war. The reality is somewhat more complicated. Franklin D Roosevelt sent racially segregated armed forces to liberate Europe. Antisemitism was prominent in the US at the time. The Holocaust was largely over by the time American soldiers landed in Normandy. Although they liberated some concentration camps, American troops reached none of the major killing sites of the Holocaust and saw none of the hundreds of death pits of the east. The American trial of guards at the Mauthausen concentration camp, like the British trial at Bergen-Belsen, reattributed prewar citizenship to the Jewish victims. This helped later generations to overlook the basic fact that denial of citizenship, usually by the destruction of states, permitted the mass murder of Jews. A misunderstanding about the relationship between state authority and mass killing underlay an American myth of the Holocaust that prevailed in the early 21st century: that the US was a country that intentionally rescued people from the genocides caused by overweening states. Following this reasoning, the destruction of a state could be associated with rescue rather than risk. One of the errors of the 2003 invasion of Iraq was the belief that regime change must be creative. The theory was that the destruction of a state and its ruling elite would bring freedom and justice. In fact, the succession of events precipitated by the illegal invasion of a sovereign state confirmed one of the unlearned lessons of the history of the second world war. Mass killings generally take place during civil wars or regime changes. It was the deliberate policy of Nazi Germany to artificially create conditions of state destruction and then steer the consequences towards Jews. Destroying states without such malign intentions produces more conventional disasters. The invasion of Iraq killed at least as many people as did the prior Iraqi regime. It exposed the members of the Iraqi ruling party to religious cleansing and prepared the way for chaos throughout the country. The American invaders eventually sided with the political clan they had initially defeated, so desperate were they to restore order. This permitted a troop withdrawal, which was then followed by Islamist uprisings. The destruction of the Iraqi state in 2003 and the political disturbances brought by the hot summer of 2010 created the space for the terrorists of Islamic State in 2014. A common American error is to believe that freedom is the absence of state authority. The dominant stereotype of Nazi Germany is of an all-powerful state that catalogued, repressed and then exterminated an entire class of its own citizens. This was not how the Nazis achieved the Holocaust, nor how they even thought about it. The enormous majority of the victims of the Holocaust were not German citizens; Jews who were German citizens were in fact far more likely to survive than Jews who were citizens of states that the Germans destroyed. The Nazis knew that they had to go abroad and lay waste to neighbouring societies before they could hope to bring their revolution to their own. Not only the Holocaust, but all major German crimes took place in areas where state institutions had been destroyed, dismantled or seriously compromised. The German murder of five and a half million Jews, more than three million Soviet prisoners of war, and about a million civilians in so-called anti-partisan operations all took place in stateless zones. Since the Holocaust is an axial event of modern history, its misunderstanding turns our minds in the wrong direction. When the Holocaust is blamed on the modern state, the weakening of state authority appears salutary. On the political right, the erosion of state power by international capitalism seems natural; on the political left, rudderless revolutions portray themselves as virtuous. In the 21st century, anarchical protest movements join in a friendly tussle with global oligarchy, in which neither side can be hurt since both see the real enemy as the state. Both the left and the right tend to fear order rather than its destruction or absence. In an era of climate change, the rightwing version of anarchy, economic libertarianism, may pose the more pertinent danger. As all economists know, markets do not function perfectly at either the macro or the micro level. At the macro level, unregulated capitalism is subject to the extremes of the business cycle. In theory, markets always recover from depression; in practice, the human suffering induced by economic collapse can have profound political consequences, including the end of capitalism itself, before any recovery takes place. At the micro level, firms in theory provide goods that are desired and affordable. In practice, companies seeking profits can generate external costs that they do not themselves remediate. The classical example of such an externality is pollution, which costs its producers nothing but harms other people. A government can assign a cost to pollution, which internalises the externality and thus reduces the undesired consequence. It would be simple to internalise the costs of the carbon pollution that causes climate change. It requires a dogma to oppose such an operation – which depends upon markets and in the long run will preserve them – as anticapitalist. Supporters of the unrestrained free market have found that dogma: the claim that science is nothing more than politics. Since the science of climate change is clear, some Americans deny the validity of science itself by presenting its findings as a cover for conniving politicians. In the case of climate change, the denial of science legitimates military action rather than investment in technology Though no American would deny that tanks work in the desert, some Americans do deny that deserts are growing larger. Though no American would deny ballistics, some Americans do deny climate science. Hitler denied that science could solve the basic problem of nutrition, but assumed that technology could win territory. It seemed to follow that waiting for research was pointless and that immediate military action was necessary. In the case of climate change, the denial of science likewise legitimates military action rather than investment in technology. If people do not take responsibility for the climate themselves, they will shift responsibility for the associated calamities to other people. Insofar as climate denial hinders technical progress, it might hasten real disasters, which in their turn can make catastrophic thinking still more credible. A vicious circle can begin in which politics collapses into ecological panic. The direct consequences of climate change will reach America long after Africa, the Near East and China have been transformed. By then, it will be too late to act. The market is not nature; it depends upon nature. The climate is not a commodity that can be traded but rather a precondition to economic activity as such. The claim of a right to destroy the world in the name of profits for a few people reveals an important conceptual problem. Rights mean restraint. Each person is an end in himself or herself; the significance of a person is not exhausted by what someone else wants from him or her. Individuals have the right not to be defined as parts of a planetary conspiracy or a doomed race. They have the right not to have their homelands defined as habitat. They have the right not to have their polities destroyed. The state is for the recognition, endorsement and protection of rights, which means creating the conditions under which rights can be recognised, endorsed, and protected. When states are absent, rights – by any definition – are impossible to sustain. States are not structures to be taken for granted, exploited or discarded, but are fruits of long and quiet effort. It is tempting but dangerous to gleefully fragment the state from the right or knowingly gaze at the shards from the left. Political thought is neither destruction nor critique, but rather the historically informed imagination of plural structures – a labour of the present that can preserve life and decency in the future. One plurality is between politics and science. A recognition of their distinct purposes makes possible thinking about rights and states; their conflation is a step toward a total ideology such as National Socialism. Another plurality is between order and freedom: each depends upon the other, although each is different from the other. The claim that order is freedom or that freedom is order ends in tyranny. The claim that freedom is the lack of order must end in anarchy – which is nothing more than tyranny of a special kind. A final plurality has to do with time. The state endures to create a sense of durability. When we lack a sense of past and future, the present feels like a shaky platform, an uncertain basis for action. The defence of states and rights is impossible to undertake if no one learns from the past or believes in the future. Awareness of history permits recognition of ideological traps and generates scepticism about demands for immediate action because everything has suddenly changed. Confidence in the future can make the world seem like something more than, in Hitler’s words, “the surface area of a precisely measured space”. Time, the fourth dimension, can make the three dimensions of space seem less claustrophobic. Confidence in duration is the antidote to panic and the tonic of demagogy. A sense of the future has to be created in the present from what we know of the past, the fourth dimension built out from the three of daily life. In the case of climate change, we know what the state can do to tame panic. We know that it is easier and less costly to draw nourishment from plants than animals. We know that improvements in agricultural productivity continue and that the desalination of seawater is possible. We know that efficiency of energy use is the simplest way to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. We know that governments can assign prices to carbon pollution and can pledge reductions of future emissions to one another and review one another’s pledges. We also know that governments can stimulate the development of appropriate energy technologies. Solar and wind energy are ever cheaper. Fusion, advanced fission, tidal stream power and non-crop-based biofuels offer real hope for a new energy economy. In the long run, we will need techniques to capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. All of this is not only thinkable but attainable. States should invest in science so that the future can be calmly contemplated. The study of the past suggests why this would be a wise course. Time supports thought, thought supports time; structure supports plurality, and plurality, structure. This line of reasoning is less glamorous than waiting for general disaster and dreaming of personal redemption. Effective prevention of mass killings is incremental and its heroes are invisible. No conception of a durable state can compete with visions of totality. No green politics will ever be as exciting as red blood on black earth. But opposing evil requires inspiration by what is sound rather than by what is resonant. The pluralities of nature and politics, order and freedom, past and future, are not as intoxicating as the totalitarian utopias of the last century. Every unity is beautiful as image but circular as logic and tyrannical as politics. The answer to those who seek totality is not anarchy, which is not totality’s enemy but its handmaiden. The answer is thoughtful, plural institutions: an unending labour of differentiated creation. This is a matter of imagination, maturity and survival. • Timothy Snyder is the Housum professor of history at Yale University and the author of Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning, published this week by Bodley Head, from which this essay is adapted.

"Actress and Greenpeace activist Emma Thompson was interviewed on BBC Newsnight about Shell’s drilling in the Arctic and associated climate change threats. In the interview, Thompson made some inaccurate statements about the timescales associated with those climate threats. However, her concerns are generally justified.  Many critics have latched onto the following inaccurate statement, if they take out of the earth all the oil they want to take out, you look at the science – our temperature will rise 4 degrees Celsius by 2030, and that’s not sustainable. This is incorrect. According to the latest IPCC report, by 2030, global surface temperatures probably won’t be more than 2°C hotter than pre-industrial levels. A 2010 study led by Met Office climate scientist Richard Betts called “When could global warming reach 4°C?” answered the titular question as follows, …our best estimate is that the [fossil fuel intensive] emissions scenario would lead to a warming of 4°C relative to pre-industrial during the 2070s. If carbon-cycle feedbacks are stronger, which appears less likely but still credible, then 4°C warming could be reached by the early 2060s So, Thompson was off by three to four decades. However, because of the lag between the time when we emit greenhouse gases and when their full warming influence in realized, the highest emissions scenario considered in the latest IPCC report suggests we would commit ourselves to 4°C warming by 2050.  That day could arrive even earlier because as the Betts study noted, carbon-cycle feedbacks may be stronger than currently simulated in climate models. Moreover, it takes time to transition our infrastructure away from fossil fuels. If we haven’t taken major steps in that direction in the coming years, we’ll commit ourselves to a very hot planet. Additionally, 4°C represents a potentially catastrophic scenario. At 3–4°C warming, 40–70% of global species would be at risk as we continue on the path toward the Earth’s sixth mass extinction. Glacier retreats would threaten water supplies in Central Asia and South America. The possibility of significant releases of carbon dioxide and methane from ocean hydrates and permafrost could amplify global warming even further beyond our control.  Even 2°C is considered a point beyond which international negotiators have agreed we should not pass because of the potentially dangerous consequences. At 2°C warming, coastal flooding will impact millions of people, coral bleaching will be widespread (exacerbated by ocean acidification), global food crop production will decline, and up to 30% of global species will be at increasing risk for extinction.  If we continue on the fossil fuel intensive pathway that Emma Thompson was talking about, we would commit the planet to 2°C warming by 2020–2030, and 3°C by 2030–2040. Hence while her numbers were wrong, the case she was making for the urgency of action is generally both correct and important. Thompson also expressed concern about the potential of increased migration due to climate change making some areas uninhabitable for humans. Our refugee crisis – which, let me tell you, if we allow climate change to go on as it’s going, the refugee crisis we have at the moment will look like a tea party, compared to what’s going to happen in a few years’ time. Because if we allow climate change to continue, there are going to be entire swathes of the Earth that will become uninhabitable, and where are those people going to go? Where do we think they’re going to go? We’re looking at a humanitarian disaster of proportions we simply can’t imagine. Thompson again exaggerated the timescales by saying “in a few years’ time.” However, the concern she expresses is a valid one. Unchecked sea level rise would eventually make many low-lying island nations and coastal cities uninhabitable, for example. Intensified extreme weather events such as droughts could significantly reduce agricultural productivity in other areas, as some research has suggested happened in Syria. Too much warming could even make some regions unbearably hot, although likely not until next century. Ultimately, as Richard Betts noted, while Ms Thompson’s concerns are valid in the longer term, her timing isn’t supported by the science. While catastrophe isn’t imminent by 2030, the coming decade will be critical in transitioning away from our current high fossil fuel, high risk scenario. It’s also worthwhile to note, as one blogger pointed out, When someone like Emma Thompson gets something wrong, you won’t easily find people promoting it. Typically – as has happened here – people point out the errors and accept that those who speak publicly about this should make sure that they’re sufficiently informed. When someone like Booker, or Ridley, gets something wrong, it gets promoted on various denialist blogs as highlighting problems with climate science. Climate scientists want to make sure people are accurately informed, while climate contrarians seem to care more about promoting their worldview than getting the facts right. Nevertheless, we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that while Emma Thompson got the timescales involved wrong, she’s right about the urgency of the problem, some of the potential ultimate consequences, and our failure thus far to take the steps needed to prevent them."
"Climate change is exerting “really scary” impacts on the Arctic with far-reaching consequences for the rest of the world, Barack Obama’s envoy for the region said on Friday. Those changes, from melting sea ice to thawing permafrost and more frequent and severe storms, were leading the US and other countries to step up their presence in the remote and mineral-rich region, said Admiral Robert Papp, the State Department special representative for the Arctic.  Obama drew attention to a climate-changed Arctic during a visit to Alaska this week, hiking glaciers, cuddling husky puppies and visiting a remote indigenous community. “It is really kind of scary to see some of the things that are happening – whether it’s damage to villages, the changes in the Arctic we have been talking about earlier, but also when we are talking about some of the significant weather events and the unpredictability of things happening around the world,” Papp told a conference call with reporters on Friday. “Those two ice caps, in the Arctic and the Antarctic, provide cooling, affect ocean currents, winds and the atmosphere, and as we begin to lose those things I think we should all be concerned.” The admiral’s comments come as US scientists said that the extent of sea ice in the Arctic – which is falling as climate change takes hold – is likely to be the fourth-lowest on record this year. The US sought to use Obama’s visit, and a foreign ministers’ meeting in Anchorage, to press for stronger action on climate change, shepherding a declaration in support of a global warming deal to be negotiated at Paris later this year. The joint statement from the foreign ministers also urged measures to reduce black carbon, or soot, one of the most powerful drivers of climate change. However, China, which was an observer at the meeting, did not sign. Some fear a melting Arctic – opening up vast reserves of oil and gas, and potential shipping lanes – could set off a scramble for resources between the US, Canada, Russia and other countries seeking a greater stake in the region. Obama this week came under criticism for allowing Shell to hunt for oil in Arctic waters. John Kerry, the secretary of state, defended the decision, arguing the leases were granted before Obama became president. “So the leases existed, and Shell and other companies are going to be drilling somewhere over the course of these next years, because we’re not going to suddenly be weaned from oil,” he told Huffington Post. The US also moved to step up its own foothold in the Arctic, with Obama bringing forward the commissioning of a new icebreaker. About half of the Arctic coastline is controlled by Russia. Papp acknowledged that Russia had been building up its presence in the region but said that so far its efforts seemed “reasonable”. “The military buildup that I have seen does not seem to be at the level of the time of the Soviet Union but there are some activities that occurred at the time of the former Soviet Union that seem to be restored, whether it’s bases, or airfield capability, etc,” he said. “But once again those things can be used for dual purposes. They can be used for military operations, or they can be used for search and rescue.” He went on: “I am not alarmed by anything that I have seen.”"

"It is not easy to look in the mirror and value your reflection if you are not absolutely horrified by the images of a dead, innocent Syrian boy face down on a beach (The shocking cruel reality of Europe’s refugee crisis, 3 September). That boy was someone’s son, someone’s grandson – he was one of us. To state that we should all be ashamed to bear witness is an understatement. To state that we have every right to expect our leaders to stand up and lead, to show leadership, statesmanship even, is almost trite now. The image crystallises the time we live in. Rather a dead child than the humanity and leadership required to afford people, just like us, a home. Today, I am ashamed to be British.Thomas BennettBirmingham • I was shocked and dismayed to see the images of a dead refugee child published on your website today. John Berger wrote about the depoliticising effect of publishing graphic images of war and violence, arguing that they had two effects: either to heighten the reader’s sense of impotence and futility in the face of unimaginable tragedy; or to prompt an act of individual penance, such as donating to a charity. “The picture becomes evidence of the general human condition. It accuses everybody and nobody.”  In the case of the refugees struggling to reach Europe, publishing graphic photos of deaths by drowning distracts us from the terrible origins of the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan (for which the UK shares responsibility) and normalises their dangerous journeys in boats across the Mediterranean. Were it not for the inhumane asylum policies of the UK and other European countries, they could instead claim asylum in or near their countries of origin and travel here safely by plane.Josephine GrahlLondon • Just what has happened to this country’s compassion and humanity? Are people so really in hock to Tory and Ukip values or reading the Telegraph, Mail, Express, Sun etc that they have completely lost their sense of perspective? The little boy washed up on the shore was from Kobani, the border town in northern Syria caught up in trying to escape Isis. Just what were he and he his family supposed to do? Come on people, rise up against this iniquity – we are all Syrians now!John StrongmanManchester • You quote the prime minister (Cameron: we can’t take any more people fleeing from war, 3 September) as claiming: “We have taken ‘a number’ of genuine asylum seekers” (or displaced people as a less judgmental world once termed them), yet when comparing our government’s response to the Syrian crisis to that of Germany’s, a stark contrast is revealed. The “number” referred to is 216 over the past year, compared to between 800,000 and 1 million for Germany. Britain’s quota would fill just three doubledecker buses whereas Germany’s would fill Wembley stadium 10 times over.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire • I agree with David Cameron that “to bring peace and stability” to Syria and other beleaguered regions would, eventually, solve the refugee crisis. So how, exactly, is refusing to offer succour to any more refugees going to contribute to this end? Both are allowed.Tim LargeReading • Those countries taking the lowest number of refugees must be named and shamed every day until they change their policies.Peter HughesBurnham, Buckinghamshire • I remember, when I was a little boy, giving my favourite toy to an appeal for Hungarian refugee children who had fled from the Russian reaction to the uprising. It makes me so sad to see the headline: Hungarian TV ‘told not to broadcast images of refugee children’ (theguardian.com, 1 September). I wonder what our reaction would be to the victims of the Nazis if they were refugees now? Would we say they were someone else’s responsibility and turn them away? As we do to those fleeing Syria and Eritrea.Martin CooperBromley, Kent • While Mr Cameron may indeed have something to answer for, let’s not forget the main causes of this crisis. I refer not only to the barrel-bomber Assad, but also to his supporters, the Russian and Chinese governments. I believe the Chinese leader is due in London soon for a state visit. Maybe he should be shown the picture displayed so prominently on Thursday’s front pages.Michael WhartonDarsham, Suffolk  • In your editorial on the refugee crisis (Merkel has given a lead that the whole of Europe must follow, 2 September) you state that “hundreds of thousands are fleeing war zones and persecution”. Unless action is taken now to stem climate change, this refugee crisis will seem small beer, as many millions of people leave their homelands to seek safe havens across the world. The reaction in parts of Europe to the present crisis presages the next, and likely last, war. My children and yours will bear witness.Bob NicholsonFrodsham, Cheshire"

"Ed Davey, the former energy and climate change secretary, has accused George Osborne of putting tens of billions of pounds’ worth of private sector investment at risk with an assault on the green agenda he pioneered. The Liberal Democrat said the chancellor was pursuing “bonkers economics” and an ill-advised and ideologically driven campaign against renewable energy that risked leaving the UK hopelessly dependent in the longer term on fossil fuels such as gas.   Phasing out aid for zero-carbon homes, onshore windfarms and solar arrays are among a raft of measures introduced by the Tories which represented “disastrous” economics, said Davey in his first interview since losing his seat in parliament. “What is frightening is that, despite all that success in low-carbon energy infrastructure, [Osborne] is prepared to send those disastrous signals. It was bad enough in the coalition when they were sending mixed signals but now there is no mixed about it.  “It is ‘we don’t want it’ and [renewable energy investors] will go elsewhere and we will lose out on tens of billions of pounds of private sector investment. “Canals and railways would not have been built if people had taken this kind of short-term, unimaginative, inward approach. [Osborne] is the opposite of an entrepreneur when it comes to green energy.” Davey, who lost his parliamentary seat at the last election, revealed that he had been engaged in an almost permanent struggle against leading Tories when he was energy secretary. “We battled every day. There were some Conservatives who were supportive like Greg Barker and Charles Hendry but they were a minority and the push was against the green agenda.  “Onshore wind was the one everyone knew about where we were having daily battles sometimes with Eric Pickles and the Treasury, but it was not just onshore wind – it was everything. “I had to fight like a tiger to stop him [Osborne] slashing the budget on fuel poverty and on renewable energy. We succeeded although he still took a chunk out of the ECO [Energy Company Obligation] energy efficiency programme. It was much less than he originally wanted and that fight went on for two months. It was huge.” Davey, who was tipped as a potential future Lib Dem leader until his election defeat in May, said the Treasury was endlessly trying to underplay the major advances achieved in the energy field because the department was being run by a Lib Dem who was convinced that energy security and climate change were vital issues.  “It’s frustrating because we [the UK] were doing so well and also alarming for the economy. It was an inconvenient truth for George Osborne that the green economy was doing extraordinarily well and the investment in energy infrastructure – primarily low-carbon energy infrastructure – that happened under the coalition government and is in the pipeline to continue was the infrastructure success story of the government.  “Not transport that he used to go on about, not telecoms, not water – it was energy.”  A Treasury spokesman said: “The government is committed to cutting carbon emissions while also controlling energy bills and saving consumers money. That’s why we’ve taken urgent action on spending to protect households and businesses from higher than expected costs. “Government support has already driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly, but it is important that this support is affordable and offers good value for money.” Amber Rudd, Davey’s successor as energy and climate change secretary, has previously insisted that the government takes global warming seriously and subsidies have only been cut where they are not needed any more. Davey said he had to battle with some of the top bosses from the big six energy suppliers. A couple of them were happy to lobby the Conservatives against him, he said. He denied, as the Labour party charged, that he was soft on the big six and said the proposals by Labour leadership contender, Jeremy Corbyn, for nationalising energy companies had no merit.  “Regulate yes, oblige and pressurise yes, but do we really believe that nationalising the whole industry would be the answer. Does anyone think the Central Electricity Generating Board was efficient?” Davey is now in talks with various private sector and other employers about potential work and admits it was a major, and relatively unexpected, blow to lose his Kingston and Surbiton seat to the Conservatives. He said he had not lost his enthusiasm for politics and did not rule out standing for parliament again.  Davey said he missed “the privilege” of being able to exercise power as a minister but claims to be uninterested in any trappings of high office and was proud of his ministerial legacy.  He said his only regrets were that he carried on a “woefully inadequate” green deal energy efficiency programme that he received from his predecessors. Davey said he had major fears about Osborne becoming prime minister. “I am not convinced he is a climate change sceptic but he is driven by [short-term] economics and I think if he became leader of the Conservative party he would want to scrap the Climate Change Act. Someone ought to ask him that question.” Davey said the investment already agreed would take renewable energy on the right course until the end of the decade, but the picture would change after that.  With a new dependency on gas, and power prices likely to be low, the former energy secretary said the Conservatives could end up having to subside gas-fired power stations to keep them working.  But Davey’s main complaint is that the government is happy to build roads or rail with taxpayer money – but will attack subsidies for renewables.  “This is another thing I don’t get about Osborne’s economics. They are really bonkers. The vast majority of this investment is private sector. Compare that with roads or railways or flood defences where it’s always the taxpayer. “Forget climate change, this is disastrous economics. This is not statesmanship. This is not a good chancellor; this is an ideological, ill-advised chancellor.” "
"The world’s biggest public relations company has decided it will no longer work with coal producers and climate change deniers. Edelman said it believes such clients pose a threat to the company’s legitimacy and its bottom line. The exclusion of coal and climate denial, as well as fake front groups that oppose action on global warming, is outlined in internal communications obtained by the Guardian and confirmed by company executives. It signals an important shift in a company that reported earnings of $833m (£540m) and has played a critical role in shaping public opinion in the US and globally about climate change.  The new approach follows a two-year review of Edelman’s operations aimed at protecting what the company calls its “licence to lead”, following negative publicity about its work on behalf of the oil lobby and pipeline companies. The conclusion was that coal producers and climate denial, as well as tactics such as greenwashing, were high-risk. “On climate denial and coal those are where we just said this is absolutely a no-go area,” Michael Stewart, the president and chief executive for Europe, who led the review, told the Guardian. The company was also taking a stand against spreading doubt about climate change, and the use of fake front groups to influence elected officials, Stewart said.  “When you are trying in some way to obfuscate the truth or use misinformation and half-truths that is what we would consider getting into the work of greenwashing, and that is something we would never propose or work we would support our client doing,” he went on. “Greenwashing, fake front groups, anything like that is completely inappropriate.” The company made no promises on representing companies that have fought against regulations cutting carbon pollution. However, clients involved in Arctic drilling and the Alberta tar sands will not be excluded, and there was no discussion about dropping other oil and gas producers, Stewart said.  “To simply try and carve out carbon production from the overall energy mix in one fell swoop is just not part of the mainstream discourse, and not something we considered,” he said. “Right now the only categorical exclusion we have is on climate denial and coal.” The company would not say how much of its work currently remained in the energy sector, after Edelman ended its work for a number of high-profile energy clients, or whether falling oil prices were a factor in the decision. Edelman was one of the first big PR companies to adopt an internal carbon accounting system, and has worked on several high-profile global environmental campaigns.  But the company lost a number of big clients and key executives earlier this year, in part because of its position on climate change. Edelman was caught flat-footed last year when other major PR firms took a stand against climate denial, and was also criticised for setting up front groups in support of a Canadian pipeline project. In Britain anti-fracking activists accused Edelman of using front groups to influence parliamentary debate. Campaigners said Edelman’s stated policies on climate change were at odds with such campaign tactics and a client roster that included the powerful oil industry lobby, the American Petroleum Institute, as well as conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council that oppose Barack Obama’s environmental agenda and have disputed the existence of climate change. Some of those same critics have now praised Edelman for dropping coal. “It’s a very big deal for the biggest PR company in the world to be shunning coal. It shows that coal’s social licence has been degraded, and that it is affecting industries that do business with big coal,” said Kert Davies, the director of the Climate Investigations Centre, which last year put Edelman on the spot for its policies on climate change.  Robert Cox, professor emeritus of communications at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a former president of the Sierra Club, said the new strategy signalled a shift in public perceptions of fossil fuels.  “If Edelman is now declining to work for climate change denialists or fossil fuel, particularly coal, I think it is yet another signal that the fossil fuel industry is losing its credibility and that climate change denial its losing its appeal,” Cox said. “The refusal of companies like Edelman to work for coal companies is now putting them in the same category of delegitimisation as tobacco.” Lisa Manley, one of the departing Edelman executives, said: “I think the world needs more companies to take positions around the changes that are going to be needed so that we can live within a 2C boundary [the amount of global warming governments have set out to hold temperature rises to], and one of the things that needs to be phased out with all due haste is our reliance on coal. So for a large multinational communications company to take a public stance is a positive thing.” Henk Campher, who also left Edelman’s sustainability practice, said the company could still do more. “If you want the licence to lead then you have to use your services in a way that promotes a better world. It is not good enough to say: I won’t work on campaigns that deny climate change. That is not the problem. How are your services used to actually fight climate change? That’s leadership.” The changes at Edelman follow an extensive review described by Stewart as “soul-searching” after the company itself had a run of bad PR for its business practices.   “Clearly in 2014 we were becoming part of the headlines and not in a helpful way,” Stewart said. “We are there to help our clients tell their story and not be a part of the story.” He said the company no longer represented some of the clients that had attracted the negative publicity, and was no longer working for API, Alec, or the Keystone XL pipeline.  Edelman is also no longer working with the Alliance for Northwest Jobs and Exports, a coalition of coal, mining and rail interests that is lobbying for coal-expert terminals in the Pacific Northwest. In a 30 July memo, Matthew Harrington, Edelman’s chief operating officer, told the company’s global management team that the firm had determined that climate deniers and coal producers were a threat to its reputation and potentially its business. “When it comes to determining our client assignments, the only issue that experts repeatedly advised Edelman to stay away from was climate change deniers/denial and related activities,” Harrington wrote. Edelman was also reviewing other potentially high-risk clients, such as coal producers. “Certain types of energy/topics surfaced as potentially higher-risk areas – eg coal production – as well as certain tactics (eg greenwashing),” the memo went on. Richard Edelman, the chief executive and the son of the company’s founder, personally intervened to see that the company dropped coal – the dirtiest of fossil fuels – because it is the biggest contributor to climate change. “In the past few weeks, the decision has been made not to work with clients in the coal production industry,” the memo said. “Given that coal emits the most C02 of any fossil fuel per unit of energy obtained, Richard has made the category decision that we will not work for coal producers going forward.”  In those deliberations, Harrington said the company had come to some important conclusions about energy and climate change. “Climate change is not a dichotomy between energy and climate interests. It is a multi-facted issue that touches nearly all sectors and will affect most industries and, more importantly, economies,” he wrote."
"Tony Abbott has predicted the Coalition will win the Canning byelection, dismissing suggestions that his leadership is in trouble.  Asked whether he would step down as leader if the Coalition lost Canning, Abbott said “well we’re not going to lose the Canning byelection”. “We’ve got an outstanding candidate, we have run a strong campaign and I think that the people of Canning are going to ask themselves who is going to look after them.” On Sunday, Abbott was opening the final section of the grand gateway road project in Perth as reports persisted that his leadership was in trouble. A Galaxy poll reported in the Sunday Telegraph suggested a 10% swing away from the Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie. The Coalition currently holds the seat by 11.8%. Unsourced reports regarding leadership tensions have persisted from late last week with the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as the leading candidate but the prime minister would not countenance what he described as “Canberra insider gossip”.  “I just want us to have a very strong result [in Canning],” Abbott said, when asked about it on Sunday. “I’m just not going to get into this kind of what would be a good result, what would not.” Abbott would not say whether he would go back to the electorate before the vote. “I’m not going to get into travel schedule predictions, if you’ll excuse me, but certainly you can be confident that over the next few days I will be beaming as much goodwill and support that I can this way.”  The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, also predicted the government would build momentum to beat Labor at the next general election off the back of a win in Canning.  “It will be a tight race all the way up to election day but I do believe very strongly that we can defeat the Labor party and I believe that we will,” Dutton said Sky News. “And we start to focus on that after the Canning byelection, once we are successful there. As I say byelections are always difficult. There will be a swing but we will win Canning with a very good candidate, we will continue to build momentum from there until the next election. If we do that, then we can defeat Labor. Dutton refused to answer questions about Abbott’s support in the Coalition party room. “The only thing I would say is the prime minister has the strong support of the party,” said Dutton on Sky News. “He does that because he is a better man than Bill Shorten. As parliament resumes this week, Australian government officials will travel to the Middle East to begin the process of taking 12,000 Syrian refugees from “persecuted minorities”. Officials will meet the UN high commissioner for refugees as part of that process. Dutton was forced to apologise for joking about the effects of climate change on Pacific island nations in a week when Tony Abbott was urged to back stronger targets to address climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum. Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, said Dutton’s explanation that it was a private conversation was not good enough. “What he should have to account for is that the prime minister is just back from the Pacific Islands Forum where Pacific leaders were saying they face an existential threat right now,” Plibersek told the ABC. “They’re not worried about what climate change will do to their nations in the future, they’re worried about the fact that the storm surges are eating away at their nations, that they can’t grow crops, that they can’t get fresh water, that we’re seeing climate change refugees leave their homelands. That’s what’s worrying about these comments.  “Peter Dutton thinks that’s a joke and Tony Abbott laughs along with it. Not the fact that they were caught, that’s not the problem. The problem is that they don’t care that these Pacific island nations are facing an existential threat.”"
"Bernie Fraser has quit as chairman of the independent Climate Change Authority, a body the government has previously sought to abolish. The authority issued a brief statement late on Tuesday saying it “regrets to announce” the resignation of Fraser, who is a former Reserve Bank governor.  “The authority members thank Mr Fraser for his enormously valuable contribution to the authority’s work in providing independent expert advice to the Australian government and parliament on climate change policy,” the statement said. “Arrangements have been made to ensure the authority’s work will continue uninterrupted.” The government has previously attempted but failed to abolish the authority, which is a statutory body that provides independent advice on climate policy including emission reduction targets.  In an explanatory memorandum attached to the Coalition’s 2013 bill to abolish the body, the government argued “it is not needed” and the step would “make a significant contribution to delivering a smaller climate change bureaucracy”. But in 2014 the Palmer United party leader, Clive Palmer, made his support for the Coalition’s direct action legislation conditional on retaining the authority and requiring it to prepare a report on emissions trading policy. The authority is still working on that project. Fraser was recently involved in a public dispute with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, over the government’s assertion that “Labor’s climate policy” would impose a “$600bn carbon bill”. In August, Fraser told Guardian Australia the claim was “weird” and “misleading” and he also raised concern about the adequacy of the Coalition’s goal of reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030. On Tuesday Hunt thanked Fraser for his work with the authority. “He has had an outstanding career in public service, which I deeply respect and acknowledge,” Hunt said in a statement. “In particular, I thank Mr Fraser for his assistance with the crossbench in the passage of the emissions reduction fund.” Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, noted Fraser had been appointed by Julia Gillard and his five-year term was not due to expire until July 2017. “His resignation is a sad reflection on the state of climate action in Australia and of the appalling approach of the Abbott government,” Butler said. “Mr Fraser has shown extreme strength of character in remaining in post throughout a period of unconscionable government distain for climate change.” The departure of Fraser means only four board members remain: Professor Ian Chubb, Professor David Karoly, Professor Clive Hamilton and Professor John Quiggin. The authority also has an acting chief executive, Shayleen Thompson."

"As countries make final preparations for this month’s UN summit in New York to agree the post-2015 development agenda, there is a growing need for policies that take an integrated approach to climate change and urban crises. Ground zero is Asia, where 60% of the world’s population live. Asia’s conurbations are transforming faster than ever, with their geographies and populations doubling in less than 10 years. As the continent consumes ever-greater natural resources and discharges more waste, cities are generally not able to keep air pollution levels within international health standards. There is now a greater incidence of illness and death among the elderly and vulnerable, including young children.  Furthermore, many Asian – and also African – cities are losing the vital contribution that green spaces make to public health, despite studies showing that parks and roadside trees are cost-effective measures against high temperatures, pollution and flooding. In Nigeria, Lagos has lost most of its central green areas, but in China, Beijing is now planting huge tree belts alongside major arteries.  As urban areas expand, data and computer models confirm how their environmental effects, including rainfall and air pollution, extend hundreds of kilometres further away. Moreover, with energy use by transport, housing and industry in urban areas responsible for more than half the global consumption of carbon-based fuels, large cities are driving greenhouse gas emissions and consequent rises in global average temperatures.  Asia’s growing urban areas are increasingly affecting the climate and environment of the whole world, with serious consequences for the long-term wellbeing of populations everywhere.  Within Asian cities near the equator, wind speeds are generally low, and they are steadily decreasing as urban areas expand, so that as global temperatures rise, they do so even faster in high-rise city developments, as studied in Hong Kong. However, climate change and urbanisation also increase the risk of very cold weather, as well as more extended periods of great heat. Extraordinary phenomena are already being observed in inland urban areas in winter months. For instance, high concentrations of urban and rural aerosols are increasingly preventing the sun’s rays reaching the ground, even causing small rivers to freeze in Delhi last year. This is affecting the economy as winter transport is sometimes severely disrupted – not only aircraft, but even trains and road traffic.  These urban crises are coinciding with natural disasters. Already, more than 90% of people affected by natural disasters – floods, cyclones, earthquakes, drought, storm surges and tsunamis – are in Asia.  This is a particular problem in south-east Asia, especially the Philippines capital, Manila, which has a worsening atmospheric environment and suffers from heavy rain, mudslides, high winds and flooding in coastal areas and inland. These problems are magnified by the growing number of people living in vulnerable locations, for example next to streams, or on hillsides.  Future planning has to factor in trends showing how 100-year peak rainfall rates have doubled, while their frequency has also increased. In Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has unique, dual-use vehicle tunnels, which are converted to huge drains when floods occur. With global warming making the atmosphere more humid, the severity and frequency of these floods is only likely to increase.  Technology is helping people to prepare for intense urban rainfall, with radar systems tracking clouds and forecasting hours in advance. Some communities are also evacuating flood-prone areas and moving populations to public refuge buildings, which are being repositioned using models of how floods build up in these areas. Similar public sheltering facilities are being used during warm temperatures, or periods of high pollution. Although many lives have been saved, unless infrastructure is improved the impact of extreme hazards will keep growing.  Various relevant policies were discussed two months ago at a meeting of the Asian Network of Climate Science and Technology and the Beijing Association of Science and Technology.  Some far-sighted planning policies also aim to reduce the growth of large cities by creating separate new towns from between 50km and 100km away. China has just commenced its plan for integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area (the so-called Jing-Jin-Ji region of 130 million people), and neighbouring areas will take over many administrative functions from Beijing. These, and other planning policies, could reduce emissions and pollution in these satellite cities as commuting distances for car drivers are reduced. Limiting mega-city growth should also moderate the rise of peak urban temperatures.  The take-up of practical policies across Asia depends on high-level advocacy for integrated policies tackling urban crises and climate change. This needs to be combined with “bottom-up” advocacy for mitigating measures such as the preservation of green areas; greener construction with less concrete; and enhanced public transport. Coordinating global and regional policies should be a major theme not only at the New York conference on development issues, but at the UN’s landmark climate change summit in Paris in December. Specifically, the critical issues in cities have to be dealt with through regional collaboration so that effective energy and environmental measures are implemented in both urban areas and the surrounding regions.  Collaboration and joined-up thinking are critical to ensure that Asia is able to reduce carbon emissions, raise standards of global health and achieve economic sustainability."

"On the final day of his trip to Alaska, President Obama was set to announce a slate of initiatives to help remote Arctic communities beset by the effects of climate change.   The announcement also included measures to fight climate change, which is happening twice as quickly in Alaska as in the continental US.  In a visit to the small north-west Alaskan village of Kotzebue, Obama was set to announce a federal coordinator for response efforts in the region, myriad grants to increase community resources and systems to address the regional impact of climate change.  A fact sheet outlining the plans did not address the role or impact of oil drilling or shipping in the Arctic. This is particularly important for villages like Kotzebue, which is proximate to the Bering Strait, where melting ice has increased shipping and resulting jobs for Arctic residents.  Melting ice, however, has also left remote villages exposed to powerful storms; degrading permafrost has led to sinkholes.  “The Arctic is at the leading edge of climate change, a leading indicator of what the entire planet faces,” Obama said on Tuesday.  He was set to meet local fisherman and families on Wednesday before returning to Washington.  Part of Obama’s plans for rural communities include charging the Denali Commission with coordinating projects in the region to improve resilience against climate change. The independent federal agency was established in 1998; Obama has requested $14m for it in next year’s budget.  Government agencies including the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are providing grants to improve water systems and quality, based on recommendations by Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.  Other plans include increasing access to housing, improving mapping programs and developing plans for climate-related relocation. "
"Fracking for shale gas in the UK should be pursued as an alternative to the use of coal, a taskforce on the controversial technology has concluded, in order to provide a bridge to a low-carbon future.  But shale gas should not receive public subsidy or tax breaks, and the tax revenues arising from its exploitation should be redeployed to develop renewable energy and other low-carbon innovations, according to the chairman of the taskforce, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Smith.  “I can’t see any reason why the shale industry needs tax breaks,” he said. “If the gas is there and is recoverable – and that’s still a big ‘if’ – the industry can derive revenue from extracting it. “Shale gas is not the answer to climate change. That is a mixture of renewables, nuclear and energy efficiency and other low-carbon sources of energy. But we can’t simply wave a magic wand and say that will happen tomorrow. Shale gas provides a bridge.” The Task Force on Shale Gas, which is funded by the UK’s shale gas industry but operates independently, found that climate change targets could still be met even with an increase in the use of gas, which is less carbon-intensive than coal. When technologies known as “green completion” are used, which means stopping the leaks of methane from shale wells, the fuel is no more carbon-intensive than conventional gas, and less so than imports of liquefied natural gas from countries such as Qatar, according to the report. But the report also found that if gas is to be used for another four decades, as envisaged by the group, then much more effort must be put into carbon capture and storage technologies. These have been problematic, as repeated attempts to set up UK pilot projects over the past decade have yet to produce a result. “The government must get a move on,” said Lord Smith. “I don’t think the reason for the slowness lies in problems with the technology. It is a lack of political will.” Green campaigners warned, however, that if the UK were to pursue fracking, it would lead to an increase in net fossil fuel use. Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. Fracking in the UK would just add to this unburnable carbon, while also bringing risks for the environment and health of local communities. The taskforce doesn’t say if or how we will get others to produce less gas if we start fracking.” Chris Redston of Frack Free Ryedale, one of many local protest groups, said: “We are not surprised the taskforce recommends a future that depends on gas production from fracking, given that this consultation is being funded by the shale gas industry. It would be impossible for anyone to conclude that this report is in any way independent or impartial.” The report also casts doubt on the ability of renewable sources of energy to be increased sufficiently to avoid an increasing dependence on importing gas into the UK. Lord Smith told the Guardian he was saddened by the government’s recent decisions to reduce support for renewable energy, but that shale gas could thrive alongside renewables if tax revenues from the new energy source were redeployed towards renewables and other low-carbon energy. While wind energy alone now makes up about a fifth of electricity generation, the share of renewables in the UK’s total energy use – including energy for heating – was only about 7% in 2014. As a result, gas is likely to be relied upon for heating for 30 to 40 years to come, according to the report, and is likely to remain a major source of electricity generation. The Conservative government has also increased the uncertainty surrounding the future of renewable energy in the UK, with an early end to onshore wind farm support and cuts to subsidies for solar and other renewables. However, the government has signalled strong support for shale gas drilling, with tax breaks aimed at kickstarting the shale industry, removal of some planning regulations and support for “sweeteners” to communities that accept shale gas wells. Shale gas drilling involves the blasting of dense rocks with a pressurised mixture of water, sand and chemicals in order to open up tiny fissures that release microscopic bubbles of trapped natural gas. Technological advances in the past decade or so have enabled the exploitation of shale gas and oil resources in the US on a massive scale, resulting in a dramatic fall in the gas price there, but as yet this has not been replicated elsewhere. Wednesday’s report from the taskforce is the third in a series of four. The first two dealt with the potential environmental impacts of the technology, such as the effects on water supplies. Those reports concluded that the impacts would not be damaging if carefully controlled, and recommended that government regulation and oversight should be strengthened, in particular by the setting up of a new regulator dedicated to shale in place of the current regulatory system in which responsibilities are divided among government agencies and local authorities. The final report will be an examination of the economics of shale gas extraction in the UK. Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, which represents the fracking industry, said: “The benefits of using domestic shale gas warrant UK-wide policies that will encourage and help markets prioritise the use of indigenous resources and technology in the pursuit of carbon reduction. This will also add to the UK’s energy resilience.” Lord Smith also said he was against drilling for shale oil in the UK, as it would have far greater adverse environmental impacts. Geographical surveys of the UK have found regions in the north rich in shale gas, but in the south-east of England the shale resources appear to be made up mainly of oil, which is harder to extract."

"The South Australian government is launching a new strategy to decarbonise its economy and has set a goal for Adelaide to become the first carbon neutral city in the world. A low-carbon economy experts panel has been appointed, including former Liberal leader John Hewson, professor Frank Jotzo and Anna Skarbek, chief executive of ClimateWorks. The panel will provide advice on climate policy and how to create jobs in clean energy technology and other low-carbon opportunities.   A new strategy paper, which will be open for public consultation, sets a goal of attracting $10bn in low-carbon investment in South Australia. Ian Hunter, South Australia’s climate change and environment minister, said the strategy was needed due to the federal Coalition’s “woeful” approach to climate change and renewables. “The federal government’s emissions targets are appallingly low, it means they are giving up on the world staying below a 2C temperature rise,” Hunter told Guardian Australia. “Investors have been spooked a bit by pronouncements from Canberra on renewable energy, especially by Tony Abbott on wind energy, but we can have a bipartisan approach here. I think Liberals in the states are a little bemused and even embarrassed by their federal counterparts.” Hunter said South Australia is a domestic leader on climate change and is looking to enhance its international credentials by attending crunch UN climate talks in Paris later this year. The federal government has yet to approve a request for Jay Weatherill, South Australia’s premier, to attend talks with other regional and state leaders.  South Australia has a goal of cutting emissions by 60% by 2050. Hunter wouldn’t commit to subsidies or tax breaks to help low carbon ventures but said the state government had already relaxed development rules to make it easier for renewable energy projects. “We need a next step because the jobs and industries of the future is renewables and clean tech,” he said. “We know we need to decarbonise our economy and we know there is $4bn already in the pipeline for low carbon economic activity. We can’t rest on our laurels.” The state government hopes that Adelaide will be the world’s first carbon neutral city – meaning its net emissions output will be zero. Melbourne and Vancouver have the same goal by 2020, while Copenhagen hopes to achieve this by 2025. Hunter said Adelaide will go carbon neutral by focusing on the efficiency of transport and buildings, with help for property owners that want to save energy or install solar panels. A trial of driverless cars is to be held in Adelaide, while improved waste management and recycling is also on the agenda. “We will do everything it takes to be first,” Hunter said. “I’ve been to Copenhagen to spy on what they are doing. If we are first by day one, that will be fine. We like beating Melbourne.” Nuclear energy may be part of South Australia’s future too. A royal commission looking at the state’s involvement in the nuclear energy process started its public sessions on Wednesday. Economist Ross Garnaut and climate scientist David Karoly are among those providing input to the sessions."

"The Sierra Nevada snowpack that is a critical water source for California fell to a 500-year low last winter – far worse than scientists had estimated and underlining the severity of the current drought, according to new research. The snow accumulation in the mountains was just 5% of what is normal, inflating the risk of wildfires, drying up wells and orchards, and pushing communities into water rationing.  Scientists had earlier thought that the snow pack was the lowest in 100 years, after a winter that was the warmest on record. Now it turns out it was actually the lowest in five centuries, according to research published in Nature Climate Change on Monday. “It was definitely a 500-year low. In the 500-year reconstruction, it was unprecedented,” said Valerie Trouet of the University of Arizona, who led the study. “When you are a climate scientist, first you get excited by the result. Then you realise the extreme level of the snowpack is not something to get excited about.” Snow surveyors have been trekking into the Sierra Nevada since the 1930s using gauges to measure the accumulation of snow pack, which provides almost a third of California’s surface water, at 108 observation stations. Trouet’s team studied two independent sets of records of tree rings, whose patterns reflect annual rainfall and temperatures. They found in the study of the 3,500 samples that 2015 was indeed the worst snowpack in 500 years – a situation that is unlikely to return for 1,000 years at lower elevations. California gets almost all of its precipitation in the winter months, and the Sierra Nevadas are the state’s most important natural water storage system. Come April, when the snow melts, the water flows into streams and reservoirs to be captured for the hot, dry months ahead. When the snowpack does not materialise, California faces shortfalls in water supply. Two factors aligned for the extreme low in the snow pack last year: winter temperatures too warm to allow formation of snow in the Sierras, especially at lower elevations, and a phenomenon known as the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”, the high pressure atmospheric formation over the north Pacific that blew storm tracks off course, preventing rains from reaching California. Last year was the hottest year on record. The warm temperatures, which prevented winter rains from turning to snow, were the bigger factor in the failure of the snow pack, Trouet said. The blasting temperatures also intensified the impact of the drought. But both high temperatures and a lack of rain would need to come into play for a recurrence of 2015’s dismal snow pack, and this year’s. “You need to have the coincidence of high temperature and low precipitation,” she said. At the moment, there is only a tiny chance of a recurrence of such extreme conditions in the coming centuries. But with winters continuing to warm under climate change, the likelihood of future low snow packs – and future punishing droughts – increase, she said."

"If your house was slowly falling down, in serious danger of catching fire or getting repossessed you’d know something was wrong and needed changing. Yet, tens of millions of homes are at risk globally according to Nasa’s latest research on sea level change, because of ice loss from Greenland and the Antarctic, melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of the warming oceans.  Oikos, meaning household, and nomos, meaning roughly a set of rules, are the generally accepted Greek roots for the word economics. Hence, stripped of its own wilful obfuscations as a discipline, economics is the art of good housekeeping. But, as the Nasa research shows, economics is failing lamentably at the level of planetary housekeeping, just as it is in the UK at the more prosaic but also important level of the housing market.  How we live in the world at the individual, family and collective level is the greatest challenge of economics. Yet attempts to address a failed economic orthodoxy get oddly stifled, while the same orthodoxy tightens its tenacious grip more generally.  Hence, while the government intends an 87% reduction in incentives for households to install solar power, it proposes £500m in funding to the base of the Trident nuclear missile programme at Faslane in Scotland.  Yet, while solar power can help us on a daily basis to live more convivially and securely in terms of planetary housekeeping, and creates a large number of jobs for every pound invested, the latter can never be used, is not part of any clear security strategy, and is very capital intensive.  Somewhat ironically, the notion of household budgeting has been used by politicians on the economic right, from Margaret Thatcher to Angela Merkel and US Republicans, to undermine the role of an active state. The analogy doesn’t hold in reality, of course, because households don’t print their own currency and typically can’t raise funds by issuing low-interest bonds.  In the UK, the mere suggestion by Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn of the government introducing a new economic instrument dubbed ‘people’s quantitative easing (QE)’ - creating money, as was done to support the banks in the 2007-8 financial crisis, but this time for productive economic purposes such as house building – triggered howls of derision from the mainstream of the Labour party. Former Labour grandees, from Tony Blair to Jack Straw and Charles Clarke, and most of the other leadership contenders lined-up to say that such suggestions would destroy the party’s economic credibility. Almost comically, Jack Straw accused Corbyn of ‘economic illiteracy’ by saying that his QE-funded housing programme would be wildly inflationary, perhaps forgetting that inflation results, in fact, from too much money chasing too few goods, and that the point of Corbyn’s proposal was to increase the housing supply thus reducing inflationary pressures. Invoking the need for ‘credibility’ is, though, too often simply code for the imperative they feel to keep within the current, failed economic paradigm, which has no answers to either the planetary nor domestic housing crisis. Larry Elliott, writing in this paper, was rather more open-minded. He said that while Corbyn’s numbers didn’t add up, people’s QE had a role to play when public infrastructure investment is needed to make up for a failure of private sector demand. But, the other circumstance for people’s QE where there is an urgent need, opportunity and little obvious downside, is to pay for a Green New Deal to deliver the low-carbon modernisation of the UK. And, it could start by tackling the planetary and domestic housing crisis simultaneously.  We could go further and rescue the original meaning of economics from its misappropriation by opponents of public investment, and build an entire vision of a new economy centred on re-imagining the home.  Bringing our household-based livelihoods into balance with the biosphere touches on every key economic sector, and is ultimately non-negotiable if we wish our civilisation to continue. Different strains of new economic thinking have proposals for every field. There are ideas about how to pay for and improve our homes with QE, and to insulate housing from excessive speculation by looking at different models of home and land ownership.  There’s a different vision for a more decentralised, renewably-sourced and locally-owned energy system to power our homes and a more localised food system to feed them. Transport taking us to and from them would shift to clean, efficient, affordable mass transit. In a green and more circular economy where product maintenance and recycling replace disposability – the things that fill our homes would create more work. But in a green economy it would be better shared. More would therefore enjoy the benefits of employment but potentially work fewer hours. In that way the neighbourhoods in which our homes sit would see a revival of the living streets that produce community. It is often said in answer to the question of ‘what would you do?’ that ‘I wouldn’t start from here.’ But what if starting from exactly here, our homes where we return to each night, is the very best place to start? New Labour’s apparent horror at the prospect of any new and radical economic ideas is testimony to the degree by which they were dazzled by, and in thrall to, an economics to which they theoretically opposed.  The failure of old economic ideas, and the intellectual bankruptcy of neoliberalism in the face of real world problems, leaves those who held them exposed and defensive. But, to keep a roof over all our heads, it is time to open our front doors to fresh economic thinking."

"The Institute of Public Affairs is in the running to win an international prize for its role in repealing the carbon tax. The rightwing thinktank is a finalist for the $US100,000 (A$142,000) Templeton Freedom award, granted by American non-profit organisation the Atlas Network.  A glowing description of the IPA’s campaign strategy against the carbon tax – which was passed under the Gillard government in 2011 and repealed by the Abbott government in 2014 – is detailed on the Atlas Network website. The report lauded the IPA’s influence in the Australian media landscape. “Starting from the day the tax was announced, the IPA took an active role in the mainstream media to counter the misinformation that advocates of the carbon tax were peddling,” the report reads. “The IPA’s research and analysis of the economics underpinning the case for the carbon tax appeared in print media outlets 209 times between Jan 1, 2010, and July 31, 2014. “IPA research scholars also featured on radio and television stations around Australia, with 363 radio appearances between 2008 and 2013 and 261 television appearances in the same time frame.” The report praised the effectiveness of the then IPA policy director Tim Wilson’s efforts in representing a “contrarian perspective”. IPA’s deputy executive director, James Paterson, is quoted in the report saying revenue raised by the carbon tax was used to “grow the welfare state, subsidise politically favoured industries and engage in economy-wide welfare distribution”. The report concludes: “The carbon tax repeal has signalled that Australia is more open for business by eliminating costly compliance measures that served as a significant financial and time burden on Australian businesses and provided a significant barrier to entry for the energy market, especially for potential large investors.” The IPA will find out if it has won the prize at a New York event in November."
"The greenhouse gas emission cuts being pledged by the world’s nations will fall short of restricting global warming to 2C, the UN’s climate chief and UK government sources have warned. A rise beyond 2C, the internationally agreed safety limit, may push the climate beyond tipping points and into dangerous instability. The expected pledges are likely to limit temperature rises to about 3C.   But those negotiating towards a global agreement due to be settled in Paris in December remain upbeat. The current pledges would avoid a catastrophic rise of 5C that would ensue if no emissions cuts were made, and the agreement is expected to contain measures to ratchet up emissions cuts in future years.  Nonetheless, significant disagreements remain to be overcome, including how much money poor nations will receive to cope with warming and how any deal is policed. The UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said that so far 62 countries had submitted promises of emissions cuts ahead of the Paris meeting, covering about 70% of global emissions. UK government sources told the Guardian that pledges, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), were expected from India, Brazil, Indonesia and other nations before Paris.  In total, all these pledges would cover 85% of global emissions, according to the source, but the cuts would fall short of those needed to restrict warming to 2C. Figueres said pledged cuts would only limit warming to 3C, while the UK source said about 2.5C, but stressed that these numbers are hard to predict precisely.  “What the INDCs will do is mark a very substantial departure from business as usual,” Figueres said. But she added: “Is 3C acceptable? No.”  Achieving the further carbon cuts needed to curb warming from 3C to 2C will depend on agreeing a deal in Paris that includes tough five-yearly reviews. That will be challenging but the prospects for a deal are good, according to the UK source. “The political conditions are there to do a deal, so we should do a deal,” he said. “It will not be a perfect deal, but it will be a big step.” A key difference from the perceived failure of the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 is that the proposed Paris deal takes commitments made by each country and then feeds them into the global deal, rather than attempting the near impossible task of agreeing a strict global deal that then dictates what individual nations can do. But this “bottom-up” approach means ambitious nations have to put political pressure on laggards. “If countries ‘lowball’ and put in something very weak, they have to justify that to their own public opinion and world opinion,” said the UK source. “In the end, you are not going to invade countries, you want to expose them to public scrutiny.” The debate on one crucial aspect, climate aid, will move a step forward on 9 October at a meeting of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund in Lima, Peru.  Developed nations have promised to “mobilise” $100bn a year to poorer nations by 2020 and the meeting will release an analysis of how much of that is already flowing via existing overseas aid programmes. The UK gave £930m in 2014, according to the UK source.  “We are going to get an agreement and it will have all the major countries in it, which did not look likely a few years ago,” said Nick Mabey, an expert on climate change negotiations and chief executive of green non-profit organisation E3G. “It is not going to deliver 2C overnight, but it will put in place immediate action and reduce warming.” He said the world had changed a great deal since the Copenhagen summit in 2009, with many nations including China and the US now having concrete climate policies in place and with a thriving green economy worth trillions of dollars and driving down costs. “Everybody has more to lose from climate change than from a low carbon economy,” he said."
"The desperate and the displaced of Syria’s war should not be cast as climate refugees, observers have told the Guardian, as this overstates the role of global warming in setting off the conflict. Many agree that the collapse began in March 2011, when a group of Syrian teenagers sprayed the words “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam” on a wall in the southwest Syrian town of Dara’a.  The words, which translate to ‘the people want to topple the regime’, were a rallying call of the Arab Spring in Tunis and Cairo. The boys were caught, beaten and tortured by president Bashar al-Assad’s secret police. Their powerful parents were enraged. Protests and repression spread and spiralled into the disaster that has sent hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing toward Europe’s uncertain reception. The narrative has since been fleshed out by journalists and observers to incorporate the impact climate change was having on the lives of those youths.  “... drought, in addition to its mismanagement by the Assad regime, contributed to the displacement of two million in Syria. That internal displacement may have contributed to the social unrest that precipitated the civil war,” Francesco Femia director of the Center for Climate and Security told Time on Monday. After four years of the worst drought on record, the boys and those around them had simply had enough. This is one story of how the Syrian crisis began. But the story is apocryphal – useful only as a way of identifying how things may have transpired. Global climatic events influence the lives of individual actors, before being diluted again in the beginnings of a complicated civil war that has many regional players. Along the way, a lot of nuance gets lost. “This is what a climate refugee looks like,” read a headline in the National Observer over a picture of a policeman carrying the body of three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi up a beach in Turkey. But David Butter, an associate fellow with Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programme said such a conflict “could have happened at any time in Syria, irrespective of the drought”. “The fact that this did escalate nationally is all to do with the structure of the regime as a brutalising kleptocracy that has for years and years taken people off to jails and tortured them,” he said. In the case of the protests in Dara’a “there could be dozens of different local factors at play”. This likely included the appropriation of a large swathe of nearby land for a wealthy cousin of Assad, Rami Makhluf, to create a large duty free zone along the Jordanian border. Some elements of the story can be verified. While climate scientists shy away from linking any single extreme event to climate change, they are able to say how much more likely those events are today than before humans began warming the atmosphere. In the case of the 2007-2010 Syrian drought, one study found that such an abnormally long and severe drought is now two to three times more likely to happen.  Testing these probabilities was possible using climate models, said Andrew Solow, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. But extrapolating these findings to Syria’s human maelstrom was beyond the reach of science. “You have a story. And I think that could be true,” he said. “But to pretend that you could make a real accurate model of how human beings respond to complex changes in the physical environment and the political environment, I don’t think that’s probably possible.” Climate change is by nature ubiquitous, affecting every life on the planet to some degree. In this regard, its fingerprint on Syria’s war is hard to argue against. In May this year, US president Barack Obama recognised the contribution of the drought in Syria’s fall.  “I understand climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world, yet ... It’s now believed that drought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria, which descended into civil war in the heart of the Middle East,” said the president in a commencement address to the US Coast Guard Academy in New London Connecticut. But Doris Carrion, a colleague of Butter’s at Chatham House, said it was “one factor amongst many”. “You can see a link between drought-induced displacement and the actions of a couple of children and the government’s response to that. But it’s a little bit too deterministic to assume that all of that is what lead to the war in Syria as we see it today,” she said. The Guardian’s migration correspondent Patrick Kingsley said Syrians arriving on Europe’s borders did not consider themselves, even tangentially, to be climate refugees. “In all my time interviewing people in the Middle East, no one has ever linked their struggle or flight to climate change,” he said, while noting that climate change would inevitably drive future mass migrations.  “I think [overstating the link between climate change and the Arab Spring] is a bit patronising to the political movements that focussed purely on political change and fighting political injustice, that were built up steadily over time as a response to the political situation in their countries, and that were ultimately the main engines of unrest in the Arab uprisings.” And the president of the London-based Syrian Human Rights Committee Walid Saffour said he did not believe the drought was a factor in the uprising.  “Oppression, corruption and regional involvement (namely Iran) which enhanced the sectarian feelings and reaction, influenced by the Arab Spring movement encouraged the Syrian people to dash to streets calling for freedom and the collapse of Assad’s dictatorship,” he said. But Carrion said studying the effects of climate change in Syria was far from redundant. “When we think about what is it going to take for Syria to eventually recover from war and to create the conditions for refugees to have something to return to, then climate change and the impact that that has on Syria’s potential for an agricultural industry that’s going to have to be addressed,” she said. Globally, it is clear that the impacts of climate change are tipping the scales in favour of strife. The Pentagon was warning President Bush as much over a decade ago. And in 2010, the US military ranked global warming as a destabilising force that was fuelling conflict. “While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.” Last year one of the UK’s most senior military figures, Rear Admiral Neil Morisetti expressed similar concerns. “Climate change will require more deployment of British military in conflict prevention, conflict resolution or responding to increased humanitarian requirements due to extreme weather impacts,” he said. A 2014 analysis of climate-conflict research found that drought and rising temperatures “systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially”.  On Monday in the Guardian, Friends of the Earth chief executive Craig Bennett raised the prospect that more climate change will mean more refugees. The impossibility of joining the dots in Syria does not undermine his concern. Note: An amendment was made to the age of the Syrian boy Alan Kurdi. The article originally said he was five, he is three. His body was found in Turkey, not Greece."
"The former leader of one of the UK’s main political parties says the world will undergo more resource wars and huge movements of desperate people unless it tackles climate change effectively. Lord Ashdown, who was leader of Britain’s Liberal Democrats for 11 years, describes the present flight of refugees from Syria and other conflict areas as a “rehearsal” for the vast humanitarian disaster he believes will soon unfold.  In a recent BBC interview on the Syrian refugee crisis, he said: “This is the beginnings of the future. It’s not going to go away. “The numbers we now have of refugees fleeing battle zones are going to be diminished into almost nothing when we see the mass movement of populations caused by global warming.” Ashdown, a former marine and diplomat, known popularly as Paddy, told Climate News Network: “I raised the issue of climate refugees then because I’ve been trying for a very long time to get the international community to take some notice of them. “I raised it to make the problem more obvious – though I do not know why politicians continue to be so blind to it.” He said evidence of the impacts of climate change was plain to see: “You need only to fly over some of the areas that are being affected – like the Naga Hills on the border of India and Burma, or vast areas of the Ganges delta – to see clearly what’s happening.” Tahmima Anam, a Bangladeshi writer and novelist, says that 50,000 people migrate every month to Dhaka, the capital city, because rising sea levels are making their villages uninhabitable and their arable land impossible to cultivate.In both the UK and the US, military leaders are aware of the growing threat from climate change and expect to be ordered to react to its effects. Ashdown said: “If governments do not act, then wars over land and resources − which is what the second Iraq war was − will become more common.” As long ago as 2003, a report prepared for the US Department of Defense warned that global climate change is more likely to result in sudden, cataclysmic environmental events than a gradual and manageable rise in average temperatures. Such events, the report said, could include a substantial increase in global sea levels, intense storms and hurricanes, and continent-wide “dustbowl” effects, which could lead to wars for access to food, water, habitable land and energy supplies. “Violence and disruption stemming from the stresses created by abrupt changes in the climate pose a different type of threat to national security than we are accustomed to today,” the report said. Ashdown foresees a direct and controversial role for military forces in the near future − not simply in fighting these wars, but also in controlling refugee flows. Asked whether he thought the UK’s armed forces would be ordered to defend the country’s borders, or to stop refugees leaving their countries of origin, or simply to play a humanitarian role, he replied: “All of those.” He went on: “The idea of Open Europe is now under threat. We have to discuss how we can manage the future. Can you imagine what is going to happen? “The Syrian crisis is simply a dress rehearsal for an immense climate-fuelled disaster, which I think will begin to be felt within the next decade, perhaps within five or six years from now.” Asked what his priorities would be for a government facing mass migration of this sort, Lord Ashdown replied: “Once the crisis is upon you, it’s too late to start working out your priorities. “This is about forethought, the need to look ahead. And you can’t approach it on a purely British basis. It has to be an international effort consistent with our principles.” "
"As I looked in on my own children sleeping safely last Thursday night before I went to bed, I did so with added poignancy as I reflected that this was something Abdullah Kurdi was not able to do. I’m sure millions of parents of young children right across Europe have felt similar emotions these last few days.  We’re all human, and so it’s perhaps not surprising that it takes a single photograph and an individual’s story to shake a society, all too belatedly, into glimpsing at one horrific aspect of Europe’s refugee crisis and demanding action.   But if we really want to reduce the future suffering of millions of refugees, and politicians want to avoid more shameful paralysis in the years ahead, we also need to look at the bigger picture.  Armed conflict will always be a risk in a world with oppressive dictators, terrorist groups, ideological extremism, the militarisation of sensitive regions by world powers, and an arms trade on the constant look out for new business. All of these factors, and more, are behind the appalling conflict in Syria, and the reason Europe is now struggling to cope with tens of thousands of refugees.  But it would seem that one of the key triggers for the 2011 Syrian uprising was the 2006 to 2010 drought, the most severe on record in this fertile region, itself probably caused or exacerbated by climate change.  As the abstract of an academic paper published this March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences puts it: “There is evidence that the 2007−2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria. It was the worst drought in the instrumental record, causing widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centres. “Century-long observed trends … strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has increased the probability of severe and persistent droughts in this region. We conclude that human influences on the climate system are implicated in the current Syrian conflict”.  Scientists have similarly suggested that climate change may have played a role in the drought in north Africa that fuelled food price rises ahead of the Arab Spring, while back in 2007, a UN report concluded that climate change and environmental degradation was a key trigger in the conflict in Darfur a few years earlier.  To be clear; there will always be a multitude of drivers behind of social unrest and armed conflict. It would be wrong to say climate change “caused” these conflicts, but equally the evidence suggests it would be wrong to say it didn’t play a contributing role. And, if this is what is possible when average global temperatures have risen less than 1C, then goodness help future generations if/when it reaches 2C, 4C or even 6C.  In these circumstances, mass migration will be occurring in many regions of the world, with or without armed conflict. In 2014, the World Bank reported that climate change is going to lead to far more heat-waves and drought, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, exacerbating crop failure, food and water shortages, conflict and dislocation of people. Right now, Baghdad has eight extreme heat days a year. With 2C global warming they say there will be 90 extreme heat days. With 4C warming, over 115. It is a similar story for Amman, Damascus, Beirut, Riyadh.  The failure of the global community, and principally the rich countries, to tackle climate change means we are still on trajectory to these sort of temperatures.  This is why climate adaptation – action to reduce the vulnerability of ecological, social and economic systems to adverse effects of climate change – is now such a hot topic in the international climate talks. This is also why the countries that will suffer the worst impacts of climate change (predominantly the poorer countries) are quite rightly demanding at least $200bn a year in new and additional public finance from richer countries to help adapt.  But with or without climate adaption schemes, it would be naïve in the extreme to assume millions of people suffering the worst effects of climate change aren’t going to want to move, and morally bankrupt to deny them this possibility if they’ve contributed next to nothing to the causes. Throw armed conflict back into the mix, and the problems currently being experienced in Budapest or Calais are far from the full extent of the problem.  There are no simple solutions, but rich countries should be providing the financing and other assistance right now to help vulnerable countries and communities adapt to climate change while doing much more to cut greenhouse emissions, by investing in energy efficiency and clean energy, and leaving fossil fuels in the ground.  Sadly, in the past few months, the UK government has moved in the wrong direction as it’s torn up a long list of climate policies that have been put in place over many years, while at the same time championing brand new fossil fuel infrastructure in the form of fracking.  People from across the political spectrum have come together in the last week to demand a much stronger response from David Cameron to the refugee crisis, and rightly so.  But if the government continues to move backwards on climate change, then we should get ready for a much bigger refugee crisis before very long. "
"The dangers posed by global warming to the world’s oceans must be a key part of any future international climate change agreement, a group of marine research scientists are insisting, as up to now the role of the planet’s biggest ecosystem has been largely ignored at the long-running UN climate talks. The scientists are attached to the French research vessel Tara, which is completing a three-and-a-half year trip gathering information from across the globe for the world’s largest ever study of plankton. They plan to make their appeal at the crunch UN climate change conference in Paris this December.  Among their discoveries have been many thousands of new species of plankton, by sampling seas at a depth of up to about 500 metres in oceans from the poles to the tropics, east to west, and using DNA analysis on the 35,000 samples. The next step will be to study the samples more closely using powerful microscopes. “Above 90% of what we found were new [to science] and we don’t yet know what they are. What we need to do in the future is to try to understand what they are,” explained Chris Bowler, one of the scientists leading the expedition. Plankton represents about 95% of the biomass in the oceans, and is vital in the marine food chain, but much of what makes up this soup of microscopic organisms is still a mystery. One of the surprises for the team was that the greatest diversity they found among the specimens was in the middle-sized creatures. Another of the key findings has been how great an effect the marine temperature has on the organisms under study. “Temperature shapes which species are present, which is very relevant in the context of climate change,” said Bowler. The planet’s oceans act as enormous carbon and heat sinks, playing an important role by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – which is slowly turning the saltwater from alkaline to acidic, with severe implications for marine life – and churning heat out of the atmosphere in a long-term cycle that runs over decades. For the ocean ecosystems, the warming we are inducing could be a huge change, said Eric Karsenti, director of Tara Oceans, a French environmental NGO. One of the discoveries that struck the researchers was how interconnected the organisms they found were. “Only 20% of the organisms exclude each other,” Karsenti said. The rest are tied in a complex web of prey/predator, parasitic and mutually dependent relationships. That means that disruptions in one part of the ecosystem could have vast repercussions across the food chain. Tara, a schooner powered by sail, is currently moored on the Thames in London, and will be taken back to France in time for the Paris meeting, which starts in late November. The scientists are hoping to collect at least 100,000 signatures for a petition they are presenting at the conference, calling for more attention to the oceans. They acknowledge that it is unlikely that the text of any Paris climate agreement will include more than a glancing reference to the oceans, but are hopeful that future revisions will remedy this. They have been encouraged by the willingness of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of world experts on the climate convened by the UN, to include much more detail on oceanic science in its future reports."

"Malcolm Turnbull once said he didn’t want to lead a party that wasn’t as committed to climate action as he was. Now he does. Climate policy cost Turnbull the Liberal leadership in 2009 when he backed Kevin Rudd’s emissions trading scheme. He had to promise not to try to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme to gather the support he needed to win it back.   Back then he described the Coalition’s current climate policy as “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and “a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead”. That’s his policy now, even though most experts think it has no chance of meeting new 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets Australia has promised in the lead up to the UN meeting in Paris.  But the solution to his dilemma is hidden in the details of the Direct Action policy, details which allow the policy to be “dialled up” into a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme that has a better chance of actually reducing Australia’s output of greenhouse gases. The key lies in the “safeguards” the government is finalising to make sure businesses that are not seeking money from the “Direct Action” fund don’t increase their emissions and undo all the reductions the government is buying. The idea is to set baselines that emitters are not allowed to exceed. The tougher the baselines, the bigger reductions in emissions. At the moment they are so lax that the Reputex analytics firm has calculated Australia’s 20 biggest emitters would be able to significantly increase emissions and almost no big emitters would be required to reduce them. The policy also says that companies that promise a certain quantity of reductions in return for money from the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, but then don’t manage to live up to their promises, could buy credits from companies that reduce emissions by more than they had envisaged. Both those scenarios involve trading – and a carbon price. And depending on how the baselines were drawn, they would give Australia a good chance of deeper, cost-effective emission reductions within the existing Direct Action legislation. The scheme would be more credible still if some of the emissions reduction fund was set aside to buy cheaper international carbon permits if Australia looked like missing its target – something that business wants but Abbott at first vetoed and then said he might consider in the future. (He once described buying international permits as being like sending “money … offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”.) Business is already factoring in that this will have to happen. Most major business groups support some kind of carbon price. Their main concern has been the lack of certainty that was created by the previous untenable policy settings. Business groups recently joined with welfare and environment groups to plead for some kind of policy certainty. Done carefully, “dialling up” Direct Action would not meet significant business resistance. Abbott dragged down Turnbull’s leadership because of his support for emissions trading. Abbott’s alternative policy could help Turnbull restore some semblance of credibility to its policy on climate change and still keep his party happy."
"Deaths related to emissions from coal cost the UK economy between £2.47bn and £7.15bn in 2013, according to a comprehensive overview of coal production in Europe.  The figure, which includes mortality costs from coal-related respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, such as heart disease and lung cancer is linked to the 395 kilotons of pollutants emitted by UK coal plants. Europe as a whole had equivalent mortality costs of between €21bn and €60.6bn, according to the authors. The report, from the NGO umbrella group Climate Action Network Europe (Cane), also found that the UK was the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide from coal burning after Germany and Poland. “The British government has not caught up with reality,” Kathrin Gutmann, Cane’s coal policy coordinator told the Guardian. “It urgently needs a proactive strategy to manage a coal phase out. Energy utilities are already starting to spend billions of euros to shed some of their coal plants but governments like the UK are just hiding behind this power sector transformation.” Last month, Germany began a process of mothballing its largest coal plants. The new survey says that it is still Europe’s biggest coal subsidiser though, coughing up €30bn between 1999 and 2011. In the UK, coal was responsible for some 87 million tonnes of CO2 emissions last year – 16% of all the country’s greenhouse gas output – a figure eight times higher than in France. Cane calculated the health costs by mapping Europe’s 280 coal power plants and then multiplying their polluting emissions by the European Environment Agency’s estimate of the cost of mortality associated with those emissions. The range of figures reflects different estimates of the cost to the economy of individual deaths.  Julia Huscher, the coal officer for Health and Environment Alliance said that the new overview provided the first snapshot of how individual countries were contributing to Europe’s trans-boundary air pollution problem. “We can now see that British power plants are responsible for very substantial emissions of classic air pollutants – nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides – and for the average European, that translates into more chronic illnesses like bronchitis, heart disease and asthma, and more premature deaths,” she said. UK air quality has been in breach of EU standards for years and an estimated 29,000 Britons die prematurely each year from long-term exposure to air pollution. That figure includes emissions from vehicles. In April the supreme court ordered the government to produce a plan for tackling the air pollution problem. That plan is due to be presented this month, but environmental lawyers say that the roll-back of green policies could delay the clean up of Britain’s skies. Since the election, the UK has cut renewable energy subsidy schemes. Alan Andrews, a lawyer for Client Earth said: “While the Department of Food and Rural Affairs is furiously working away on their air quality plans, there seems to be a clear disconnect and lack of joined up thinking with other government departments going in the opposite direction and rolling back policies that will have a negative effect towards this toxic soup of pollution, which is harming the health of people in the UK.”  Coal emits more CO2 for the amount of energy produced than gas and oil but it still makes up over a third of the country’s energy supply, although its percentage of the UK’s generation mix was slightly down last year. Because the vast majority of British pits were closed down in the 1980s and 90s, this coal has to be imported. In 2013, Russia supplied around a third of the UK’s stockpile, with the US, Colombia and other countries also contributing. "

"Glance at a lawn in East Porterville, California, and you’ll instantly know something about the people who live in the house adjacent to it. If a lawn is green, the home has running water. If it’s brown, or if the yard contains plastic tanks or crates of bottled water, then the well has gone dry. Residents of these homes rely on deliveries of bottled water, or perhaps a hose connected to a working well of a friendly neighbor. They take “showers” from a bucket, use paper plates to avoid washing dishes, eat sandwiches instead of spaghetti so there’s no need to boil water, and collect water used for cooking and showers to pour in the toilet or on the trees outside. East Porterville is in Tulare County, a region in the middle of California’s agriculture-heavy Central Valley that’s been especially hard hit by the state’s historic drought. More than 7,000 people in the the county lack running water; three quarters of them live in East Porterville. The community doesn’t have a public water system; instead, residents rely on private wells. But after years of drought, the nearby Tule River has diminished to a trickle and the underground water table has sunk as more and more farmers rely on groundwater. Last week, I spent a few days interviewing residents in the town, also known as “ground zero” of the drought. Like many small towns in the Central Valley, East Porterville is home to the pickers and packers of the fruits, veggies, and nuts grown nearby and distributed across the country. Many are poor; more than half of kids growing up in East Porterville fall below the poverty line. Throughout the town are the telltale signs of rural poverty: Dogs guard run-down trailers and homes, and roads of uneven pavement devolve into dirt without warning. The air is hazy with dust from the fields and roads. It clings to the tables and chairs and boxes of bottled water left outside; it collects between fingers and toes, turning the shower water a cloudy brown. Everyone coughs. Asthmatics end up in the emergency room. Among the first to report a dry well was Donna Johnson, a 72-year-old retired recreational therapist who lives in East Porterville with her husband, Howard, and a handful of rescue dogs. In the spring of 2014, she turned on the tap to find that it had reduced to a dribble, then no water at all. Howard tried to extend the pump further into the well, but where there should have been a splash of water, there was simply a “thud” of solid against solid. When Johnson called a well-driller and learned the company had a long waiting list, she started wondering just how many wells had gone dry. After a couple of weeks of knocking on the doors of strangers in her neighborhood, Johnson had a list of more than 100 homes. Over the past 18 months, Johnson has become known as East Porterville’s “water lady,” as she spends her days collecting donations of water and paper goods and delivering them in a pickup truck to a list of homes with dry wells – a list that’s expanded to hundreds of addresses. “There’s always somebody calling, saying, ‘I don’t have water!’” she said. The county, in part prompted by Johnson’s discovery, has also stepped in. Locals can now bathe in portable showers outside the Drought Resource Center (a trailer set up in a church parking lot) and sign up for bottled-water deliveries (half a gallon per person per day). Tanks of nonpotable water sit outside the fire station; in the evenings, residents fill up barrels for things like laundry and bathing. As an interim solution, the county is installing large plastic tanks of water connected to some dry homes. But progress has been slow. So far, 320 tanks have been installed; more than 1,300 remain dry.  It doesn’t help matters that homes in the directly adjacent, slightly wealthier town of Porterville have running water from the town’s municipal water system. Perhaps the most glaring example of this is on the city boundary: Locals take showers at Igelsia Emmanuel in East Porterville; directly across the street, in Porterville, is a patchy but green golf course. East Porterville residents without running water have fallen into a tedious routine. Juana Garcia, a 49-year-old mother of five, lost water two years ago – in some ways, her living conditions remind her of those she left behind in Mexico when she moved to East Porterville in 1988. The change has been particularly challenging because she suffers from Lupus and arthritis, making it difficult to haul water to her home or make the trek to the public showers. Garcia doesn’t speak much English, so her daughter, a talkative 11-year-old named Noemi, walked me through the daily routine. Dishes are washed in two buckets: one for soaking, the other for rinsing. Afterward, water is dumped into the toilet so it will flush. For showers, Garcia boils water that Johnson hauled in from the gas station (Garcia doesn’t have a car), or she takes her kids to the portable shower in front of the church. Teeth are brushed with bottled water; clothes are hand washed and air-dried unless a friend has time to take the family to the laundromat. The trees in the backyard used to yield pears, lemons, and pomegranates, but they’re all dead now; any extra water is used to fuel the swamp cooler, which, Noemi explained, uses five gallons of water an hour – and it’s a necessity as temperatures routinely top 100 degrees. For dinner, Garcia makes things that require minimal water and won’t heat up the house, like microwave meals or sandwiches. An impressive coalition of local supporters have stepped up to help residents like the Garcias. At Iglesia Emmanuel, Pastor Roman Hernandez has been distributing crates of bottled water for months, and organizes services around the Central Valley to pray for rain. Local nonprofit FoodLink doles out “Drought Relief” food boxes several times per week, targeted toward farmhands who have lost jobs as farmers let their fields fallow. Granite Hills High School, which serves East Porterville students, opens its showers early so that students without water can use them. Many students come from families who are struggling financially because of lack of work; the number of students who eat free breakfast and lunch at school has skyrocketed over the past year. It’s tempting to blame agriculture for the disaster in East Porterville; after all, farmers’ increased reliance on groundwater is largely responsible for lowering the underground water table to begin with. But the reality, dairy farmer Eric Borba told me, is that “people wouldn’t be living here if it weren’t for ag.” Many residents I spoke with said that while performing daily tasks without running water is challenging, the sentimental losses are the toughest to face: favorite trees that died, pets and farm animals that had to be let out into the streets. When Vicky Yorba, a 95-year-old, moved to East Porterville in the 1960s, she and her husband planted a garden of geraniums and roses together. “My favorite was geraniums,” she remembered. “I had all kinds of them.” Yorba’s husband died more than 20 years ago, but the plants lived until last year, when her well went dry. Now, they’ve been replaced by a plot of dirt."
"  The US and other countries need to pay up their $5.8bn of outstanding pledges to help developing countries to cope with climate change or risk derailing already fragile climate talks, the head of the UN’s Green Climate Fund has said.  Dozens of NGOs, governments and development agencies were queuing up to put to work a total $10.2bn in promised finance, said GCF executive director Hela Cheikhrouhou. Already 20 organisations have passed through the fund’s accreditation process, meaning they will be able to pitch for funding for projects, such as transitions to solar energy or drought-resistant crops that would help the developing world adapt to climate change or reduce emissions. She said she expected the number of accredited organisations to hit 100 and for the first tranche of projects to be funded before the Paris climate talks in December. Cheikhrouhou said leaving 43% of pledges unfulfilled would damage developing countries’ trust that the rich world is serious about helping them adjust to the changing climate.  “It certainly would erode the confidence because climate finance is one of the most difficult negotiation themes,” she said. “We need a stronger push from a high level.” The GCF is often considered the sole shining light from the dismal climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009. It was set up as the main mechanism to raise $100bn a year in climate finance from rich countries by 2020 to assist poor nations that contributed little to global emissions to move to greener economies and build resilience to the effects of climate change. The fund would not run the projects itself, but accredit NGOs, development banks and the governments of developing nations to receive the money. However governments have been reluctant to contribute money into the fund. During the lead-up to last year’s climate talks in Lima $10.2bn was eventually pledged, but even that is now proving difficult to secure. US president Barack Obama pledged $3bn, but it is unclear whether he will be able to pass the funding through a Republican congress France, Italy and Canada are also among the tardy. The governments of Sweden and the Marshall Islands and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) joined Cheikhrouhou in urging those countries to fulfil financial promises they made before the Lima climate talks in 2014. Sweden is currently the largest per capita donor to the fund at $60.50 per person – six times more for each citizen than the US has pledged. The Swedish minister for international development cooperation, Isabella Lövin, said: “I hope that the US will also live up to its commitments because the US and the entire world will be affected by climate change.”   Marshall Islands foreign minister Tony de Brum said: “No issue is more central to trust in Paris than finance. Nobody should underestimate how critical it is for the most vulnerable to know that the $100bn a year by 2020 promised at the 11th hour in Copenhagen will be delivered. And right now, we have no understanding or assurance that even a fraction of that will be delivered. This is a big, gaping trust gap that needs to be filled before Paris.” “The fact that the United States – which originally put the $100bn target on the table – is yet to make its own initial contribution to the GCF is a cause for concern. We all know the difficulties President Obama faces, but hope the US will make good on its own $3bn promise as soon as the new fiscal year ticks over next month.” Cheikhrouhou described a “creeping sense of disappointment” because instead of building momentum for the GCF after a flurry of pledges in the lead-up to last year’s Lima talks, impetus appeared to be drifting away. “I’m disappointed that no more new contributors have come forward in 2015,” she said, adding that she felt the fund needed to reach $15bn by 2018 in order to remain on track for the 2020 target. “My worry is, when I see the text of the Paris Accord, and see that references to the future of the Green Climate Fund are dwindling and weakening over the months.” Fulfilling the pledges is also critical for the impetus for the climate talks in Paris, said Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development. “The UN talks on climate change have a history of financing pledges from developed countries which then are either not delivered or fudged. This seems to be happening again with the green climate fund pledges of $100bn a year from 2020 onwards, with current pledges only an insignificant fraction of that figure,” he said. A spokesman for the UNDP said it was important all countries converted their pledges as “vast amounts of capital” would eventually be needed to tackle climate change. However, the fund has achieved the 50% level of financing it needs to begin actively lending and Astrid Manroth, head of sustainable investment Europe at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (another of the GCF’s accredited entities), said she thought the level of finance would increase once the fund began investing in projects. This is set to happen at the next board meeting of the fund in November. “If there’s no change to the current status it will of course impact speed and scale of implementation. On the other hand, for me the binding constraint is project development capacity and project preparation. We need to get that right, and then I am convinced that there will be sufficient financing,” she said.  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"China’s mega-cities and major US metropolitan areas will pledge swifter and deeper cuts in carbon pollution on Tuesday, shoring up an historic agreement between presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping. Beijing and 10 other Chinese cities will agree to peak greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2020 – a decade ahead of the existing target for the world’s biggest emitter, under a deal to be unveiled at a summit in Los Angeles on Tuesday.  Seattle will commit to go carbon neutral by 2050, with more than a dozen other major metropolitan areas in the US, and the entire state of California, pledging an 80% cut in emissions by mid-century. Atlanta, Houston, New York, Phoenix and Salt Lake City also put forward new climate commitments. “This is a big deal,” Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles told the Guardian. “It is the heavy hitters. It is the biggest emitters, and it is the folks who are coming ready to act.” The new, more ambitious goals from local governments in the world’s two biggest carbon polluting countries boosted hopes for critical climate change talks in Paris at the end of the year, and the prospects of avoiding a global temperature rise above 2C, which would tip the world into dangerous and irreversible warming. United Nations officials have acknowledged the pledges from countries to date will not cap warming at 2C. The announcement on Tuesday ratchets up a deal reached by presidents Obama and Xi last November to cut their carbon pollution. Xi promised at the time that China would reach peak emissions by 2030 – or earlier. China on its own was responsible for about 29% of the world’s carbon pollution in 2013, because of its heavy reliance on coal, about twice as much as the US. At Tuesday’s summit, Chinese cities and provinces in the Alliance of Peaking Pioneer Cities will bring forward their date of peaking emissions. Beijing, Guangzhou, and Zhenjiang will pledge to peak emissions by the end of 2020. Shenzhen and Wuhan will pledge to peak emissions by 2022, and Guiyang by 2025. “The commitment of so many of its largest cities to early peaking highlights China’s resolve to take comprehensive action across all levels of government to achieve its national target,” the White House said in a fact sheet. Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Obama, said the cities and provinces between them represented about 25% of China’s total urban emissions.  “This is important because the commitment to peaking mega-cities highlights that they are moving to achieve their national target as early as possible,” he told reporters on a conference call. “The two largest emitters in the world are taking seriously our commitment to meet the ambitious goals set last year.” However, some of the most polluted cities in China, and the ones most dependent on coal, were not on that list. Among other deals to be announced at the summit, Los Angeles will help clean up the choking air in Chinese cities. Since the start of this year, Obama has set a blistering pace on climate change, with the administration rolling out new initiatives every few days. The intense activity is intended in part to reassure the international community that Obama is committed to fighting climate change, despite the opposition from Republicans in Congress. The commitments from China neutralise one of the Republicans’ main arguments against a climate change deal – that America on its own can achieve little, and that China is willing to act. “The agreement between presidents Obama and Xi broke new ground and showed that in the developing world it is possible to make commitments to climate change – that you can go beyond saying we can’t make a commitment. We are still growing,” Garcetti said. “This new alliance of peaking pioneer cities will be able to push national goals aggressively.”"
"What is the best way to get action on the problem of the global freshwater shortage - one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today? The global water crisis has already made itself felt in a number of ways, and the problem will only worsen. But what direct action can we take to deal with the problem? And how do we make sure that the problem is at the top of the policy agenda?   Water professionals discussing this issue at a panel at World Water Week last week talked of the need to demonstrate what is actually possible. “It’s important for water professionals to demonstrate initiatives, good examples and to drive the process,” says Karin Lexen of the Stockholm International Water Institute.  There is also a need to build networks; “As a community of water professionals we need to get in there and show action [as well as] build alliances to show what can be done, ” said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum. So how can the water sector present its message effectively to policy makers? What are the best ways to demonstrate climate adaption and mitigation measures to leaders?

"Indigenous stories of dramatic sea level rises across Australia date back more than 7,000 years in a continuous oral tradition without parallel anywhere in the world, according to new research.  Sunshine Coast University marine geographer Patrick Nunn and University of New England linguist Nicholas Reid believe that 21 Indigenous stories from across the continent faithfully record events between 18,000 and 7000 years ago, when the sea rose 120m. Reid said a key feature of Indigenous storytelling culture – a distinctive “cross-generational cross-checking” process – might explain the remarkable consistency in accounts passed down by preliterate people which researchers previously believed could not persist for more than 800 years. “The idea that 300 generations could faithfully tell a story that didn’t degenerate into Chinese whispers, that was passing on factual information that we know happened from independent chronology, that just seems too good to be true, right?” Reid told Guardian Australia. “It’s an extraordinary thing. We don’t find this in other places around the world. The sea being 120 metres lower and then coming up over the continental shelf, that happened in Africa, America, Asia and everywhere else. But it’s only in Australia that we’re finding this large canon of stories that are all faithfully telling the same thing.” Scholars of oral traditions have previously been sceptical of how accurately they reflect real events. However, Nunn and Reid’s paper, “Aboriginal memories of inundation of the Australian coast dating from more than 7000 years ago”, published in Australian Geographer, argues the stories provide empirical corroboration of a postglacial sea level rise documented by marine geographers. Some of the stories are straight factual accounts, such as those around Port Phillip Bay near Melbourne, which tell of the loss of kangaroo hunting grounds. Others, especially older stories such as those from around Spencer Gulf in South Australia, are allegorical: an ancestral being angered by the misbehaviour of a clan punishes them by taking their country, gouging a groove with a magical kangaroo bone for the sea to swallow up the land. “Our sense originally is that the sea level must have been creeping up very slowly and not been noticeable in an individual’s lifetime,” Reid said.  “But we’ve come to realise through conducting this research that Australia must in fact have been abuzz with news about this. “There must have been constant inland movement, reestablishing relationships with country, negotiating with inland neighbours about encroaching onto their territory,” Reid said. “There would have been massive ramifications of this.”  The fortunes of those faced with the decision to retreat as camps, tracks and dreaming places were slowly swallowed up – especially on islands – were mixed. Those on Rottnest and Kangaroo Islands cut and run up to 7000 years ago. Others, such as those at Flinders Island in Bass Strait, made the fateful decision to stay, and died out as the land grew arid and fresh water became scarce. Reid said while it was impossible to prove that Indigenous oral traditions had continued unbroken over time, its contemporary features gave a clue as to why it may be the world’s most faithful and durable.  “Say I’m a man from central Australia, my father teaches me stories about my country,” Reid said.  “My sister’s children, my nephews and nieces, are explicitly tasked with the kin-based responsibility for ensuring I know those stories properly. They take those responsibilities seriously. At any given point in time my father is telling the stories to me and his grandkids are checking. Three generations are hearing the story at once … that’s a kind of scaffolding that can keep stories true. “When you have three generations constantly in the know, and tasked with checking as a cultural responsibility, that creates the kind of mechanism that could explain why [Indigenous Australians] seem to have done something that hasn’t been achieved elsewhere in the world: telling stories for 10,000 years.”"
"Breaking the Ice: it’s the perfect title for a show at the Unicorn, where children are so visibly at ease with their surroundings and where the productions usually connect so directly with audiences. It’s also a pleasingly rich title for Filskit theatre company’s show for children aged two to five. For the younger ones – including my daughter Hildy, who is very nearly two – this is the story of an amiable encounter between a polar bear and a husky. For the older kids, there’s an environmental message about climate change and what will happen if all that Arctic ice continues to melt. Before it all begins, there’s time for a quick tumble in the Unicorn foyer’s colourful play area. Then we head into the theatre and settle down on cushions before a sort of glacier-shaped playing space. And immediately there’s that gold-dust sound for the opening minutes of children’s productions: a hush of wonder broken only by inquisitive whispering. Who can we see silhouetted in the tent at the stage’s edge? And why are there all of these animal pictures pegged to the guy ropes?   This is a wordless show so there are no introductions, but it turns out we’re watching a nature photographer – and very jolly she is too. Katy Costigan channels her inner child as she cheerfully pulls on a red snowsuit, adds boots and gloves, and plays around in the snow. She’s joined by an irrepressible husky played with wagging glee by Victoria Dyson, who wins screams of joy when she goes sniffing around the kids in the front row. Then along comes the polar bear, and Sarah Shephard cleverly captures the stately yet playful nature of the animal as it sizes up its new acquaintances. They could perhaps be a bit more fierce, but all of this is a great laugh thanks partly to the fun costumes and make-up (fur-trimmed cuffs and dark eye makeup for the husky; white fingerless gloves and bang-on-trend fringing for the polar bear). The animals have masks that are alternately worn and held by the performers and, like the costumes, they have a homemade quality that will appeal to young children.  The older boy next to us happily joins in a ball game with the photographer and the husky, and Hildy has her first giggle when the polar bear makes its entrance. This is done through a digital projection before Shephard’s arrival. Projection and shadow play are key components of the Filskit style and are smartly integrated into the narrative. They are, however, experiencing technical difficulties at our performance – on one occasion, for example, the photographer motions to create a snow angel on the ice but no pattern appears. Her older sister would probably have picked up on this but the difficulties don’t spoil Hildy’s enjoyment. She laughs when paw prints appear on the ice, and enjoys the contrast between darkness and light representing night and day. The original music by Torgeir Vassvik, a Sami vocalist and composer from the Arctic region in Norway, is used to particularly good effect during the sequence in which the animals get to know each other and experience emotions – curiosity, fear, joy and affection – that are all familiar to very young children. During their play, the animals are separated by a growing crack in the ice that isolates the polar bear – an image that recalls all of those photos of them clinging to shrinking icebergs. It’s a striking moment and the show could perhaps have ended its main story more powerfully here rather than simply continuing the frisky fun.  Nevertheless, the performance ends with a glorious bit of audience participation. The children are given a choice of polar bear or husky ears to try on and are invited on to the stage to hop along the icebergs and generally frolic with the performers.  At 50 minutes, this is the longest show Hildy has seen. She sits firmly in my lap, adamant that she does not want to be a little polar bear or husky. But she happily watches the others play and, in her own time, gets up to pad around the stage with the others. The actors are excellent with the children, gently encouraging them to stroke their costumes and stomp their feet as bits of the show are re-enacted by the audience.  Soon, Hildy is having fun with all the older children. When a final projection tells us it is night time she curls up happily on the stage, squeezed in between all the others. The sky is dark, the room grows calm and the ice is broken."
"Campaigners against oil firms sponsoring UK arts groups are to stage an all-day protest festival at the British Museum in what they claim will be their most ambitious intervention to date. More than a dozen campaign groups are expected to converge on the museum on 13 September for “stunts, performances and creative interventions”.  Arts organisations have become used to protests over recent years but these normally arrive unannounced, without prior publicity. This time there is notice. Danny Chivers, from the group BP or not BP, part of the Art Not Oil coalition, said: “The idea is to reach out beyond the immediate coalition and get a lot of different groups on board. We are going to show the breadth of the opposition.” The British Museum has been chosen as the venue as it was there, in December 2011, that directors of four of the biggest arts organisations – the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Tate and Royal Opera House – held a press conference announcing a five-year sponsorship deal worth £10m. It was meant as a show of solidarity with BP and a stand against campaigners who argued that oil companies should be dropped as sponsors. The sponsorship deal, hailed by BP as “one of the most significant long-term corporate investments in UK arts and culture,” is due to end in 2017, one reason for the ratcheting up of the campaign. Chivers said: “Can you imagine? If the institutions did renew, they would be sponsored by fossil fuel companies into the 2020s when climate scientists are telling us that we need to be transitioning away from fossil fuels. The idea that they would still be having these kind of partnership deals in the 2020s is pretty extraordinary, especially when you see how little money BP gives.” All four institutions vigorously defend the sponsorship and reject claims that the figures are small. Freedom of information requests last year showed that the Tate, between 1990-2006, received amounts from BP of between £150,000 and £330,000 – with an average of £224,000 a year. This year Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, asked: “What would you want companies to do with their profits? Do you want them to spend them in a way that benefits the public or not?”  Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, said BP’s money represented about 20% of Tate Britain’s sponsorship income. The Art Not Oil coalition includes groups such as BP Out of Opera, and Liberate Tate, which in June occupied Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall overnight, writing words of protest on the floor in charcoal. BP or not BP, a kind of rebel theatre group, have focused mainly on the British Museum, staging a number of protests, the most recent being a three-hour “performance occupation” at the museum’s Indigenous Australia exhibition in July. The plan on the 13 September is to have a number of stunts and performances culminating in a flashmob performance at 3pm, for which they need participation by the public. One reason for going public early is to encourage more people to turn up and lend support. Chivers said they did not expect any security issues. “It is space open to the public and yes, of course, we can be searched as we go in. But we are not going to bring anything to cause any harm or damage, we’re quite happy to be searched. We are people who are gallery goers and museum visitors, we care about arts and culture. We will be visitors, but visitors with something to say.” He also said that galleries found it difficult to intervene in the protests because of the number of visitors agreeing with the demonstrations.  Chivers said climate action groups and faith groups were also expected to take part. Some of the other confirmed participants were Dharma Action Network for Climate Engagement, Platform, Divest London, Stop the Arms Fair, the London Quakers, and London Rising Tide. In a statement the British Museum said income generated through corporate sponsorships was vital. “‪BP has, for many years, made a significant contribution to the arts and cultural life of this country including support for the Royal Opera House since 1988, the BP Portrait Award since 1990, Tate since 1990, the British Museum since 1996 and the Royal Shakespeare Company since 2012.  “‪We are grateful to BP for their long-term commitment, sharing the vision that our artistic programmes should be made available to the widest possible audience. The British Museum respects the right to peaceful protest on site, providing there is no risk to visitors or the collection.”"

"As Politico recently reported in a news story that seems better suited for bad a Hollywood movie script, Republican Party leaders are actively trying to sabotage the critical international climate negotiations that will happen in Paris at the end of this year.  Top Republican lawmakers are planning a wide-ranging offensive — including outreach to foreign officials by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office — to undermine President Barack Obama’s hopes of reaching an international climate change agreement that would cement his environmental legacy.  Republican Party leaders have often argued that the United States shouldn’t take action to curb its carbon pollution unless China and other countries do as well.   Now these countries are working to reach an international agreement in which all cut their carbon pollution, and Republican leaders are trying to undermine it. It’s as though they’re just looking for excuses to prevent the United States from reducing its fossil fuel consumption. As Jonathan Chait wrote, In any case, the old conservative line, with its explicit or implicit promise that international agreement to reduce emissions might justify domestic emissions cuts, has suddenly become inoperative. The speed at which Republicans have changed from insisting other countries would never reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions to warning other countries not to do so — without a peep of protest from within the party or the conservative movement — says everything you need to know about the party’s stance on climate change. It doesn’t have to be this way. Conservative political parties in nearly every country in the world acknowledge that human-caused global warming is real, a problem, and propose to do at least something about it. Australia’s climate-dubious prime minister Tony Abbott was the closest analogue to Republicans, but he’s just been replaced by the science-accepting Malcolm Turnbull. Many conservative politicians used to accept climate science an risks even in the United States. In 2007, Senator John McCain (who became the Republican Party’s 2008 presidential nominee) co-authored the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act to introduce a carbon cap and trade system. In 2010, Senator Lindsay Graham likewise co-authored a bipartisan cap and trade bill. Sadly, although a majority of Republican voters support regulating carbon as a pollutant, and a plurality even support President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the party’s leaders have now taken an extreme stance on the issue. Many of the party’s presidential candidates deny that the planet is even warming (e.g. Ted Cruz), or that humans are responsible (e.g. Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich). Among those few who accept the scientific consensus, most oppose all practical efforts to address the problem (e.g. Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina). The two Republican presidential candidates who support taking action to address the problem (Lindsey Graham and George Pataki) are polling at a combined 0.2%. Republican Party leaders are trying hard to obstruct President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, and have not offered any alternatives. The easiest way to eliminate those government regulations would involve replacing them with a small government, free market alternative carbon pricing system via the type of climate legislation introduced years ago by McCain and Graham. This approach is supported by a consensus of economists, and was introduced by Republican presidents Reagan and Bush to successfully address past environmental problems, but has virtually no support among today’s Republican Party leaders. Lindsay Abrams at Salon recently wrote, “Marco Rubio is trying to distinguish himself as a full-on climate villain.” With these efforts by the party leaders to sabotage all domestic and international climate policy efforts, Rubio will no longer be able to distinguish himself on this front. The Republican Party seems to be crafting itself as the party of climate supervillains, hell-bent on destroying the world. It’s an extremely short-sighted position, because as astrophysicist Neal deGrasse Tyson put it, That’s the good thing about science: It’s true whether or not you believe in it. Human-caused climate change and the associated risks and consequences are real, and they’ll only become more apparent to voters as the planet continues to heat up. Becoming the party that makes every effort to obstruct and undermine all national and international attempts to address these tremendous climate threats is a recipe for long-term disaster. At the same time, the Republican Party is alienating growing minority groups who, in a few decades, are poised to become the American majority. The point being, Republican leaders don’t seem to have any interest in the long-term health of the planet, human society, or even their own political party. They noted the latter problem in a 2013 Growth and Opportunity Project report, in the wake of their unsuccessful performance in the 2012 elections. However, party leaders seem to be largely ignoring the findings of their own report, just as they ignore the findings of the many reports on the scientific realities and threats of climate change. Past Republican presidents like Reagan and Bush have implemented successful policies that have solved hazardous environmental problems like acid rain, ozone depletion, and air pollution, with economic benefits far exceeding their costs. Republicans invented free market cap and trade systems as an economically preferable alternative to government regulations of pollutants, to great success. Today it’s Democratic policymakers who favor these policies and Republican leaders who oppose them. Thus, President Obama and his administration’s Environmental Protection Agency have been forced to act unilaterally, imposing government regulations on carbon pollution. By opposing all climate policies, including small government, free market, economically beneficial solutions, Republican leaders are bringing about the very government regulations that they oppose at their core. It’s the job of leaders to lead. When President Obama changed his stance in favor of marriage equality, public opinion quickly followed. In the Supreme Court case affirming marriage equality rights to same-sex couples, the majority decision cited that rapidly changing public opinion. In this case, not only are Republican policymakers failing to lead, they’re not even following the lead of their party’s voters, the majority of whom support cutting carbon pollution. It’s also the job of policymakers to address the risks facing our society. Instead of mitigating the immense risks posed by human-caused global warming, Republican leaders are actively trying to increase those risks by sabotaging efforts to mitigate them. Modeling the Republican Party after characters like Lex Luthor and Captain Pollution seems like a bad strategy; supervillains always lose."
"Environmental author and activist Naomi Klein doesn’t fly much these days on principle, but she’s come to Australia for the first time in 14 years because now is a crucial moment for climate change.   The weird thing is that Klein and the prime minister, Tony Abbott, are in complete agreement on one fundamental thing: both believe that seriously tackling climate change is incompatible with capitalism as we know it. Of course, Klein starts with that and goes on to argue that our economic system must be upended if we are to have any chance to save the planet from the worst impacts of climate change. Abbott makes clear that he will protect the way things are at almost any cost. Yet their starting point is the same: you can have perpetual economic growth, with all that goes with it, or you can have an approach to climate change that treats it as the most serious issue the planet faces, but you can’t have both. As the critical Paris climate summit in December looms – the last realistic chance for an international accord that could limit warming to 2C – it’s that tension that seems to lie at the heart of what we confront. It was Klein’s book, This Changes Everything, that pushed the discussion out into the open.  Not that it’s accepted by everyone. There are many people arguing that it is still possible to contain global warming without making systemic change to market capitalism. Yet even many of those agree that we’re running out of time. Abbott, in rhetoric and deed, has not embraced the pro-market view of climate change. He mentions global warming grudgingly and rarely enthuses about the economic opportunities for a sun soaked Australia.  He appoints sceptics to key government positions. He has cut Australia’s renewable energy target, speaks of coal in reverential terms and has done much to discourage “visually awful” wind farms. Climate change is to Abbott just another political problem to be managed. Labor’s policies, he says with relish, would “hit our economy with massive and unmanageable costs, massive increases in power prices, massive increase in the hit on families’ cost of living”. Klein understands people like Abbott. Global warming threatens what they hold most dear: free markets, limited government regulation and unending material progress. So it makes sense, as Klein said on the ABC’s Q&A this week, that the political right is often so resistant to climate change.  “The reason for that is that if the science is true, then their world view collapses,” she said. It may be true that Klein was anti-capitalist before she became concerned with climate change, but her ideas have become central to this argument, the questions she raises impossible to ignore. She helped advise the Vatican before Pope Francis’ extraordinary June encyclical, Laudato Si. It was imbued with ideas that Klein would recognise – that unending material progress had a disastrous and destructive side, especially for the poor. That what was needed was a radical transformation of how our politics and our economy work.   “The time has come to accept decreased growth in some parts of the world,” the Pope said. He drew links between climate change, poverty, corporate greed, materialism, vested interests and political inertia. It was a moral call to action, infused with an activist’s rage.  It is stirring all this, but the critique of Klein’s work is that there is little detail about would replace neo-liberal capitalism. Her strength is that she lays out the problem so well and lets nobody off the hook.  She is scathing about some environmental groups, accusing them of pretending that global warming can be solved by fiddling a bit here and a bit there. It is deceptive, she argues, to suggest a solution wouldn’t inconvenience the west by redistributing resources to poorer countries that contributed little to global warming. Most of her points are indisputable: there has been a huge mismatch between the problem of climate change and the response by governments; endless international meetings have been full of hot air; pledges to reduce emissions have turned out to lead to big increases of emissions; faith in technological solutions is often naïve; and given our tardiness, there is now a need to reduce emissions drastically and quickly. To hold the earth’s warming to 2C will still mean a rise in deadly heatwaves, extreme weather and life-threatening sea rises. But at the moment, scientists say we’re on track for a 4C rise by the end of the century, which would be catastrophic for life on earth.  Little of that is seriously disputed, yet Klein’s key thesis remains contentious. The most prominent to dismiss it is UK economist Nicholas Stern, who rejects the economic growth versus climate action dichotomy.  He’s really countering governments that are fearful of the economic cost of climate action, but his points apply to Klein, too. There is now “much greater understanding of how economic growth and climate responsibility can come together and, indeed, how their complementarity can help drive both forward,” he said recently. In Australia, too, the government’s rhetoric about the potentially disastrous economic cost of climate action is at odds with several studies. Even long-time environmentalists in Australia question Klein’s key contention. Erwin Jackson, a “principled pragmatist”, is deputy CEO of the Climate Institute and he hasn’t read Klein’s book.  “All the analysis that’s been done at a macro level presuming we get along with it is that you can have a strongly growing economy and reduce emissions at the same time,” he says.  “The key barrier is political will, it’s not capitalism,” he says. Mark Wakeham is the CEO of Environment Victoria. He and 80 others spent a full day with Klein in Melbourne this week workshopping how to put her book’s ideas into practice.  The big lesson, he says, is that green groups need to work much more closely with other organisations, such as unions. Yet Wakeham, too, is more optimistic than Klein about the role of capital. “Where I see a divergence [from Klein] is that I see we’ll need a civilised capital to actually solve the problem,” he says. “The scale of investment that we’re going to need in clean energy is going to require all levels of government and organised capital to provide the capital for a solution”.  Both Jackson and Wakeham agree with Klein that dealing with climate change will have to mean a stronger role for government regulation. As for Klein, she and such figures as Desmond Tutu and the founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben, are calling for mass action ahead of the Paris conference. They see a “great historical shift” on the way, as momentous as the anti-slavery and anti-apartheid movements. Only a public uprising will force governments to treat climate change as the crisis it is, she argues. With that kind of movement, everything else will be shaken up, too. Which is, of course, Tony Abbott’s worst nightmare. Naomi Klein will speak at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas, Sydney on 5 September. "

"An ambitious environmental bill in California that attempted to legislate up to a 50% reduction in gasoline use by 2030 had been derailed by the oil industry in the final week of the legislative session. Senate president pro tempore Kevin de Leon announced on Wednesday that he would amend the bill, SB350, to drop the petroleum provisions. It will be changed in the assembly’s natural resources committee as soon as Thursday to deal only with increasing the state’s renewable electricity supply and boosting energy efficiency in buildings through retrofits and upgrades.   With only two days left in the legislative session, “we could not cut through the million-dollar smokescreen created by a single special-interest with a singular motive and a bottomless war chest”, he said in a statement.  The Western States Petroleum Association – a trade organization representing petroleum companies including Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil, said in a statement that the fuel provisions were “arbitrary and infeasible”, but with that portion of the bill deleted, “we can move forward and work together on other climate change efforts”.  SB350 has been the focus of an intense media and lobbying campaign by petroleum interests in recent weeks.  Oil industry groups took out full-page newspaper ads as well as television and radio spots warning that the bill would lead to gas rationing, restrictions on driving and government monitoring of driving habits via vehicle computers.  In the legislature, the oil industry targeted moderate Democrats, lobbying them to question if the measures provided proper oversight, would negatively impact business in California or unfairly targeted a single industry. Senator De Leon, along with allies, staged their own effort, calling in Catholic leaders, Nobel prize winners, celebrities and average citizens to testify to media and lawmakers about the statewide and even global importance of the measure. But the swing votes within their own party remained unconvinced. The defeat is also a setback for Governor Jerry Brown, who initiated the environmental focus of this legislative season during his inaugural address for his fourth and final term.  Both he and De Leon are planning on attending the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December. "
"I am resigning as a shadow minister in the Lords in a few weeks. Not because Jeremy Corbyn is Labour’s new leader but because I decided, after the general election, that I could have a bigger impact reducing the growing risk of climate change in a different, more internationally-focused role.  Judging from my Twitter feed and inbox this will delight many who have made it their mission to oppose fracking in the UK.  I have never supported a big push for fracking in the UK. I am neither pro- nor anti-fracking on principle and I agree there are legitimate concerns about the technology’s potential environmental and social impacts that must be addressed. This is why, during the Infrastructure Act debate last year, I spent many hours persuading the government to think again about their ill-judged enthusiasm for the technology, emanating from far too simplistic an analysis of energy markets in the US. I am very proud that Labour successfully forced the government to introduce much needed new environmental protections and am saddened to see the government now trying to row back on these hard won commitments. There is also the incontrovertible truth that the economics of fracking now look poor. Even without steeply falling oil and gas prices, fracking was going to be a risky venture, since the process of extracting gas from tight shale rock involves more effort than the conventional tapping of natural gas from reservoirs. It is definitely not going to be the magic cure the Treasury is seeking to bolster tax receipts, as our conventional sources of hydrocarbons run out. That will require far deeper understanding of future energy and clarity of vision than they have shown hitherto.  My concern with the current debate about fracking stems not from any love of the technology but from the fact that it is currently absorbing people’s time and energy fighting potential future impacts, when all around us are far worse existing activities, such as burning Russian coal in 1960s’ power stations. It seems some in the green movement work on the basis that their best chances of making a difference lie in stopping threats that have yet to happen, rather than the impacts that are already with us. Anti new road protests, anti GM, anti incinerators, anti biofuel, anti new nuclear, even stopping the building of the new Kingsnorth coal fired power station – all are examples of this brand of campaigning. Done well they can penetrate the political discourse and change the debate.  The problem, however, with whipping up fear of future threats is that it can also lead to fixed ideological positions being adopted in the absence of any actual evidence of harm, and, unless we start blocking the things that are already happening, we risk locking ourselves into the flawed and damaging system we have today. This is of particular concern because it is not just the green movement that has learned the game of how to stop new things from happening. Stoking nimbyism can carry risks for all who seek action on global issues. The campaigns I admire, the anti-slavery, anti-apartheid movements, the campaigns to phase out ozone destroying chemicals, stop whaling, restrict harmful pesticides, to name just a few, all took on existing activities and sought to remove the social and legal license that allowed them to continue. This is what we should be focusing on today in relation to climate change. We know addressing this meta-threat is the mother of all challenges and the status quo cannot safely be allowed to continue. The world is already extracting and burning too many fossil fuels from conventional sources and this provides more than enough of a challenge to set our minds to addressing.  The last few weeks of my time on the front bench in the Lords will be taken up with scrutinising the government’s woefully inappropriate and poorly thought-through Energy Bill. We finished our third day of committee on Monday. The Bill was first introduced in the Lords and timed to attract minimum attention. Despite this, it is being effectively challenged by Lords from all parties.  When we get to report stage in October, we have a very good chance of amending it. And yet there has been almost no involvement from the green movement thus far. Despite the fact that it creates a new public body that will take over responsibility for maximising the economic recovery of carbon fuels on and offshore in the UK.  The one green Lord, Baroness Jenny Jones, has not taken part in Committee and I haven’t received a singly briefing from a green NGO so far. Why is this? Has the green movement forgotten that policies and laws are what drive change? Of course you can change things at a local level and, sometimes, local interventions acquire a symbolism that helps to win a national level change of heart, but only if and when those changes are encoded into policy or law. I invite anyone, who on the basis of an interview on the Today programme, believes I have abandoned my green principles or am necessarily in the pay of the fracking industry, to pause before spending time on their emails or tweets and to read my contributions on TheyWorkForYou.com.   Tackling climate change and leaving the natural world in a state fit for future generations to enjoy has and always be my guiding passion. I try to base my positions on evidence rather than ideology and am not afraid of challenging the status quo or changing my mind if the evidence changes. If more adopted this approach I believe we’d make faster progress in the fight to clean up the planet.  As I step off the front bench in a few weeks I hope that whoever succeeds me will keep a cool head and keep up the fight holding this government to account. I also hope that the green movement will assist them in directing their energies towards the things that matter most. Those for whom fracking has lit a climate activism touch paper can achieve great change, but only if well targeted. "
"Sarah Palin has made a pitch to be named energy secretary under a Donald Trump presidency, saying: “If I were head of that, I’d get rid of it.” The former governor of Alaska and 2008 vice-presidential candidate gave a wide-ranging interview to CNN on Sunday. Now an influential voice in the rightwing media, she has been a vocal supporter of Trump, the billionaire business mogul who leads the 17-strong Republican field for the 2016 presidential nomination. Asked if she would consider a cabinet position under Trump should he be elected to the White House, Palin said that as “energy is my baby”, she would. She added that her time at the Energy Department would be “a short-term job”. She also rejected President Obama’s focus on the threat posed by climate change, particularly to her state, saying: “I’m not going to blame … changes in the weather on man’s footprint.” Asked about her hopes for a job under Trump, Palin said: “I think a lot about the Department of Energy because energy is my baby.  “Oil, gas, minerals, those things God has dumped on this part of the earth for mankind’s use instead of us relying on unfriendly foreign nations for us to import their resources. “I think a lot about the Department of Energy and if I were head of that I’d get rid of it. I’d let the states start having more control over the lands that are within their boundaries and the people that are affected by the developments within their states.  “If I were in charge of that it would be a short-term job, but it would be really great to have someone who knows energy and is pro-responsible development to be in charge.” Speaking from Wasilla, Alaska, Palin criticised Obama’s visit to her state this week, in which he spoke at length about the threat posed to its inhabitants by climate change. She did not address criticism of Obama for treating climate change as a central issue of his presidency while allowing drilling for oil in the Arctic circle. In one speech in Alaska, Obama said “any so-called leader who does not take this issue seriously, or treats it like a joke, is not fit to lead”. Palin was asked if she took climate change seriously. “I take changes in the weather, the cyclical changes that the globe has undergone since the beginning of time, I take it seriously,” she said. “But I’m not going to blame those changes in the weather on man’s footprint. “Obama was up here looking at the glaciers, and pointing out a glacier that was receding. Well, there are other glaciers though that are growing up here. He didn’t highlight that.” Palin added: “These blames on man’s activity, some of that I know is bogus.” Palin said Obama’s visit to her state was “a tourism jaunt, really”, and criticised the president for his attitude to Russia and China, both of which have increased their military presence near Alaska. “What if he’d carried a big stick instead of a selfie stick?” she said, referring to some of Obama’s activities during his visit. Palin also rejected criticism of Trump regarding his answers to questions on middle-eastern policy on a conservative radio show this week, saying she didn’t think the public “gave a flying flip” if a presidential candidate could not tell the difference between Iran’s Quds force and the Kurds. On immigration, Palin responded to a spat between Trump and Jeb Bush over the former Florida governor’s ability to speak Spanish by saying immigrants to the US should speak English first. “When you’re here, let’s speak American,” she said."

"Australians who have just experienced their coldest winters in decades shouldn’t be fooled, scientists say, with new research showing that new heat records are outnumbering new cold records at an accelerating rate. An analysis of 100 years of Australian temperature data has found that in the past 15 years, new records for heat outnumber those for cold by 12 to one, with human-induced climate change the primary factor.  The study by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science found that heat records roughly matched cold records between 1910 and 1960, before new highs of heat began to gain dominance.  Scientists found that natural variations such as solar radiation, the periodic El Nino climate event and volcanoes would continue to deliver an equal split between hot and cold extremes in recent years.  Only the added factor of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, caused by human activity such as burning fossil fuels, has tipped Australia towards hotter extremes. Warm weather has not been top of mind for most Australians living in the southern states this year, with Melbourne experiencing its coldest winter in 26 years and Tasmanians enduring the lowest temperatures in nearly 50 years. Meanwhile, Canberra has had its coldest winter since 2000. However, Sophie Lewis, lead author of the climate study, said that people have simply become used to warmer temperatures being the norm. “It’s been the coldest winter compared to a warm period, which means it’s just been cold in the context of recent warmth,” she said. “What we perceive as cold isn’t cold in a long-term context. We will still get cold records in the future, they will just be less likely. “This trend is consistent with the increase in greenhouse gases and the warming trend of the last century in Australia. As greenhouse gases increase, we should expect to see even more hot records in the future.” The study looked at the monthly and seasonal temperature records set in each state and nationally since 1910 to see work out the trend of how records were being broken. In 2013, Australia experienced its warmest year on record, including its warmest summer. Last year was Australia’s third warmest year on record, with scientists attributing a climate change “fingerprint” upon these recent warm years. Australia has warmed by around 1C over the past century, with the possibility of up to 5.1C warming by the end of this century without radical cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Any temperature rise above 2C is likely to have major implications for Australia in terms of severe heatwaves, loss of agriculture due to drought and ocean acidification that will damage coral ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef. Lewis’ study found that nighttime temperatures have risen more sharply than daytime temperatures, with autumn warming more than summer."

"An Apollo-style research programme to make renewable energy cheaper than fossil fuels has won the backing of Sir David Attenborough, who says this alone would be enough to halt climate change. The renowned naturalist joins a group of eminent scientists, business executives and politicians backing a 10-year public research and development plan to cut the costs of clean energy and deliver affordable technologies to store and transport solar and wind power. In a letter to the Guardian, the group argue that the approach, mirroring the intense Apollo programme that put men on the moon, “will not only pay for itself but provide economic benefits to the nations of the world”. “I have been lucky enough to spend my life exploring the world’s oceans, forests and deserts. But the Earth, with its spectacular variety of creatures and landscapes, is now in danger,” said Attenborough. “Just one thing, however, would be enough to halt climate change. If clean energy became cheaper than coal, gas or oil, fossil fuel would simply stay in the ground.”  Scientists estimate that about 80% of fossil fuel reserves must remain buried if global warming is to be limited to 2C, a rise seen as the safety limit. “In the 1960s, scientists overcame immense odds to achieve something extraordinary - the Apollo missions to the Moon,” Attenborough said. “Now some of the finest minds must again unite in the face of an even greater challenge.” “Most of the great advances of the last 100 years have come from publicly-funded research – computers, satellites, the internet, smart phones,” he said. The letter, whose signatories include oil executive Lord John Browne, former energy secretary Ed Davey and climate scientist Sir Brian Hoskins, says: “The plan requires leading governments to invest a total of $15bn (£10bn) a year in research, development and demonstration of clean energy. That compares to the $100bn currently invested in defence R&D globally each year.” “Public investment now will save governments huge sums in the future. What is more, a coordinated R&D plan can help bring energy bills down for billions of consumers,” they say, noting that renewable energy currently gets less than 2% of publicly funded R&D. The backers of the Global Apollo Programme, who also include Unilever CEO Paul Polman, economist Lord Nicholas Stern, MP Zac Goldsmith, former chair of the Financial Services Authority Lord Adair Turner and former cabinet secretary Lord Gus O’Donnell, urge the world’s nations to back the plan ahead of a crunch climate summit in Paris in December. The plan has already been discussed by G7 energy ministers and Sir David King, currently the UK’s climate change envoy, has said Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister and solar energy enthusiast, is keen. Some experts argue that fossil fuels are far more expensive than they appear, when subsidies and the costs of the damage their pollution causes is included. The IMF recently estimated that state support for coal, oil and gas, and the costs to countries of air pollution and climate change was $5.3tn a year."

"The Southern Ocean has started to absorb more greenhouse gases after a period when the vast ocean’s uptake had slumped by about a half, a study has found. The ocean’s role as a crucial carbon “sink” appeared to be waning throughout the 1990s, but after 2002 it began to rebound to its previous level, absorbing 1.2bn tonnes of carbon in 2011.  This enormous uptake, double that of its lowest point in the 1990s, is roughly equivalent to the European Union’s annual carbon output. The huge Southern Ocean, which encircles Antarctica, accounts for 40% of all the carbon soaked up by the world’s oceans. In turn, all the oceans suck up a quarter of all the carbon emitted through human activity, including burning fuels such as coal, gas and oil. Research by scientists based in Switzerland, France, the US and Australia, published in Science, found the Southern Ocean had “regained its expected strength”. Changes in winds and temperatures were given as a reason. Its gargantuan carbon intake is due to its pattern of seawater circulation, which effectively takes carbon from the surface and buries it deep underwater. “The evidence that the sink efficiency was decreasing was a concern, because it means that carbon dioxide accumulates more heavily in the atmosphere,” said a co-author, Bronte Tilbrook, who is a research scientist at CSIRO and the Antarctic and Climate Systems CRC. “That sink has now re-established itself due to a change in weather patterns around an Antarctica. Long term, we don’t know how the sink will respond but we are getting an idea that its variability is much greater than we previously thought. It’s possible it may reduce again.” A Swiss scientist, Nicolas Gruber, who led the research, said: “We were surprised to see such large variations in this ocean’s net carbon uptake.” While the world’s oceans are considered a crucial “handbrake” on the escalating amount of greenhouse gases spewed out by power stations and vehicles, the absorption of large quantities of carbon is changing the make-up of oceans. While heat-trapping gases are causing the oceans to warm and expand, causing sea levels to rise, carbon is also making the oceans more acidic. The oceans are about 30% more acidic than they were a century ago. This has severe implications for a variety of marine creatures, including corals and shellfish, which are likely to shrink as they struggle to form carbonate shells in acidic water.  A recent study found that acidifying oceans were to blame for a mass extinction event 250m years ago that killed 90% of all marine species. “We are likely to see a big impact on marine species, which is a concern,” Tilbrook said. “We are potentially tinkering with these ecosystems and the end result isn’t something we fully understand at the moment. The rate of acidification is quite fast at the moment and the increased absorption of carbon will increase that.”"

"This week, Labour shadow energy minister and environmentalist Bryony Worthington dismayed green groups by backing fracking as a way to reduce carbon emissions. Following a speech on the Energy Bill in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Baroness Worthington told the Today Programme: “There are legitimate concerns, absolutely correct, that we need to do this safely, but we shouldn’t take an in-principle objection to the technology and nor should we do that for any other of the low carbon technologies. Because [climate change] is the big challenge we face.” She said that the “common enemy” is very cheap coal which entails much higher carbon emissions.  Her former Friends of the Earth colleague, now the organisation’s CEO, Craig Bennett who was also a guest on Today said: “No one thinks it’s low carbon. It’s equivalent to saying if you’re addicted to cigarettes, shall we move from high tar, to medium tar. We actually have to kick the habit. We have to end the addiction. The problem with shale gas is that it binds us into yet more fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come.” Worthington’s enthusiasm for a well-managed, home-grown shale gas industry – as opposed to other sources of gas – is due to the extra emissions generated by the process of compressing and transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Middle East. The MacKay report, published by the UK government in 2013, found that from its extraction to its use shale gas generated 200 to 253g CO2 equivalent for every unit of energy. LNG (which accounts for roughly a quarter of UK gas supply today) emissions range from 233 - 270g.  @KarlMathiesen @guardianeco @bryworthington getting into a carbon debate deflects from the more tangible immediate risks of geology These estimates include what are known as fugitive emissions – methane that escapes during the extraction process. Although some uncertainty surrounds the industry’s ability to control these leaks in practice.  “[We] still don’t know how big or if this will be an issue,” said Worthington, because the government had stymied Labour’s efforts to monitor emissions. Environmental groups also argue that other impacts, such as seismic tremors and contaminated water sources, will be impossible to guard against in a full-scale dash for shale gas. But energy experts told the Guardian that the dismissal of fracking on this basis would be a mistake and a properly regulated industry could deliver cost and carbon savings. “I think her stance is perfectly sensible,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director for the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and oftentimes fierce critic of the fossil fuel industry.  “As long as you manage the local environmental risks – which are serious – then there’s no objection. And indeed as Bryony said if you are looking at it from a climate change point of view it produces far more emissions if you have to go through the process of compressing gas and then transporting it all the way from Qatar.” Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, was more cautious about the potential carbon savings of using shale instead of LNG. “Those differences are at the margin,” he said. “I think the debate is about what role gas plays rather than starting to talk about particular sources of gas. We shouldn’t worry about that too much unless there’s really strong evidence that that carbon footprint is really high.” However he agreed that there was no reason to rule out a well-regulated fracking industry “a priori”, especially as conventional gas production in Britain’s North Sea fields is expected to decline rapidly in coming years. Worthington said the necessity to switch off coal power stations as soon as possible meant that building new gas power stations, which generate roughly half the emissions of coal plants, represented the best available option for a quick transition of the electricity sector. Gas would also be important for home heating and transport for decades to come, she said. @KarlMathiesen @bryworthington @guardianeco It's the wrong area of focus. Priority has got to be developing renewables. Ward said Britain’s best decarbonisation pathway was to phase out coal power “as soon as possible” and replace the power stations with new gas plants. “The sooner we do that the better,” he said, because gas generators built now can deliver 15 years return on investment before 2030. This date is important as the government has powers under the Energy Act to set a decarbonisation target for the power sector. By that time any fossil fuel power station may have to be fitted with a carbon capture and storage system, which remains an uncertain technological prospect. “Without shale gas, the price for consumers is likely to be almost entirely dependent on imports, which could be a lot more expensive than today,” he said. Although he said claims from the industry that shale gas would make the price of energy lower than today were unlikely to be correct. Estimates of just when the shale industry might be contributing meaningful amounts of gas to the economy range between five and 15 years, depending on whether you ask the industry or environmentalists. In its most shale friendly scenario, the National Grid predicts that by 2025 shale could be supplying 15-20% of the UK’s gas. One thing is clear, using shale instead of LNG will be no extra help for meeting the UK’s own carbon targets. That is because these targets regulate emissions generated within the country. Under the international climate regime, carbon generated at a compression facility in Qatar is that country’s own business. The bulk of the extra emissions from LNG are generated by the tankers that bring it to the UK – these and all other shipping emissions remain the responsibility of no one in particular. @KarlMathiesen basically comes down to UK carbon budgets then global supplies & price impacts. Carbon Brief editor Leo Hickman pointed out that those who use the MacKay report as justification for fracking forget that it concludes that shale gas’s contribution to the climate fight depends on it keeping British coal in the ground. The report concluded that without a global emissions deal the coal displaced by shale gas in the UK will simply be burnt elsewhere. This has happened in the US, which remains one of the world’s biggest exporters of coal despite the crunching decline of its domestic coal power industry. UN negotiations continue to provide weak assurance that such a deal will be achieved in Paris in December. Worthington’s position is commensurate with Labour’s current, cautious support for the industry. However two of Labour’s leadership candidates, including frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn, have said they would follow Scotland and Wales and ban fracking. The winner of that contest will be announced on Saturday. Worthington’s characterisation of gas as “low carbon” echoes similar comments by Conservative energy secretary Amber Rudd in July. Ward and Watson said this was misguided as gas remained a significant producer of greenhouse gases. “[It] did raise my eyebrows slightly. I don’t think I’d normally class it as that,” said Watson.  “I think that was a mistake,” said Ward. “It’s not low carbon. It’s a high carbon source of energy.” Worthington told the Guardian that it was not a slip of the tongue. “I think terms like renewables are outdated. [I] prefer high, low and zero carbon. Gas is low carbon especially when used for heating.” Watson said the argument expounded by environmental groups and renewable advocates that the country should bypass gas and skip straight to a dramatically expanded renewable energy sector ignored the technological gaps in transport and home heating and the need for some flexible power generation to balance out the fluctuations of renewable sources. “I think we probably do both at the same time,” said Watson. “Gas is going to be around for some time to come, our analysis shows at least a few decades yet.”"
"Even though it started over a hen harrier – and there will be those of us, shamingly, who don’t know what one of those looks like – there was something quintessential about the row that broke out this week between Chris Packham, hero of Springwatch, and the Countryside Alliance, champions of blood sports. Packham wrote a column in the BBC’s Wildlife magazine in which he criticised wildlife charities for being too meek. Frankly, it could have been said by anybody, of whatever political stamp, about any charity; they’re all way too meek about everything. But he was making a specific point, which he elaborated to me, on his garden bench near Southampton, looking out on to a view so perfect that I had the sense of imminent disaster. “The way the wildlife NGOs evolved is that they were instigated by people who had split interests. They were interested in country pursuits – shooting, hunting, fishing, farming – and also natural history. And they were brilliant natural historians with a genuine desire to protect that legacy. We should no longer be sleeping with these people, but we should be in constructive dialogue with them. We need to move on.”  Or, if I can precis that: “Conservationists might sometimes – and ought to – disagree with people who go around killing things.” It’s just about as uncontroversial as an opinion gets (in my opinion). The Countryside Alliance responded that he should be fired by the BBC, on the basis that, said chief executive Tim Bonner: “This is the clearest possible abuse of the position the BBC has given Chris Packham, and as it is an ongoing behaviour, rather than an isolated incident, it is difficult to see how the situation can change.” This is textbook modern politics: person on the progressive side says a plausible, not particularly controversial thing; person of a more authoritarian bent responds hysterically, with ad hominem attack and wild exaggeration of the original position; anybody not intricately connected to the argument, or without the time and inclination to become so, just assumes both sides are mad and slopes off; the entire conversation has been debased, enough mud slung that nobody’s features are distinguishable. Packham is not angry; he is very insistent on this point. He is very open in an endearing, nerdy way, and describes himself the way he describes badger poo or the mighty goshawk, with precision and care, as a kind of respectful observer. It’s just not in his nature: “If I’m angry personally, say with my stepdaughter, or my partner – there’s always friction in human relationships – I never speak about it. I wait until the anger has passed, and then I’ll speak about it.” And yet, you could forgive him for sounding a little bit … erm … frustrated. “What’s insidious and what’s contrived, and potentially dangerous, is the attempt to brand me as someone who’s spouting blatantly political propaganda, and someone who’s an animal rights extremist. When I’m accused of spreading propaganda on the BBC, that simply isn’t true, for two reasons. One, I wouldn’t compromise its values when I believe in them so strongly myself, and two, because I don’t need to use propaganda. I will use scientifically researched fact as the basis for proper argument. People who use propaganda are people who need to pervert the truth. I don’t need to. And they’ve called me this week an animal rights extremist, which is very clearly not true, either. These tags, if they can get them to stick …” He tails off; everybody knows what happens if these tags stick to you. One minute you have a TV career, the next you can’t get arrested. He’s already had his wilderness years – between 1995, when The Really Wild Show ended, and 2009, when he was brought back to the BBC to present Springwatch. I don’t know if you’d call it “wilderness” exactly, but he spent long enough as an independent film-maker, only appearing intermittently himself, to have a sense of purpose unconnected to his public profile. It would be the most almighty triumph for the voices of unreason, were the BBC ever to succumb to the pressure of sacking a conservationist because a pressure group had made him sound like an 1980s renegade who breaks into mink farms and hates respectability. In fact, there is little danger of that: the BBC has a body called Editorial Policy, which has agreed with Packham already what he can say without compromising its impartiality. While he will notify them if he’s doing a hen harrier campaign event – to draw attention to their illegal killing – it’s not as though he is constantly on eggshells. “There’s a constant dialogue between us, which means we’re sticking to the rules that we’ve evolved over time. As long as I don’t break them, I’ve no reason to suspect that I’ve done anything wrong. I’m embarrassed that they have to do work on my behalf to defend what I do. I feel guilty that they’re being forced to waste their time. But it isn’t a lot of time, because basically, as long as I behave myself, they can send out the same statement they sent out before, which is that I’m behaving myself.” I wonder if he ever feels constrained by the BBC’s own interpretation of impartiality, which in my view is often not so much impartial as just making sure that, whenever anyone says anything sensible, there’s some idiot in the opposite corner to contradict them. I was thinking specifically of climate change, but there, Packham says, the policy has changed. “Once we were, whatever it is, 97.524% happy that we are responsible for exacerbating climate change, we no longer had to have a voice of opposition. It’s interesting, when you have a debate, how far to the wrong end do you get before you don’t have to listen?” But he is much more patient than me about the need for the sceptics in the first place. “Better over-cautious than not. I would rather sit and curse at someone who is very clearly wrong, and have the opportunity to do that, than feel that I was being blindfolded by some doctrine where there was no voice of opposition. I prefer the comfort of that.” At this point in our conversation, Packham’s 12-year-old poodle leapt off the bench, banging his head on the way, objecting pointlessly to some sheep he’s lived next to every day of his life. There are horses at the back of Packham’s property and badgers, too, that he feeds every night. He showed me one of their poos, elegantly replacing the word “poo” with “stuff”, and said he could tell it came from a badger, not a dog, because of the rosehip in it. He once rigged up a night-time camera to watch fox cubs playing without disturbing them. Before he even went to university – he graduated in 1983 from Southampton, with a degree in zoology – he had been commissioned by the Natural Conservancy Council to conduct a study of badgers in the New Forest, and how they were affected by foxhunting. In a way, the caricature that would offend me, if I were him, is the one where he’s just a TV presenter, so by definition his views are quite shallow. Plenty of people love animals, but you don’t meet very many who see them as equals, whose interest in mammals and their habits is so profound. And if you think that’s intense, you should get him on birds. “If you were to ask me on a superficial level, I prefer birds to mammals. I like feathers better than fur, I think eggs are neater than placental matter, I like things that fly rather than things that walk, and for me – this is a subjective thing – they’re a more beautiful organism. But what you get to the point of understanding is that no species exists in isolation, and the true beauty is the way that it interacts with all of the other species in its community.” He gestures to his ridiculously beautiful view, over a rectangle of carefully planted wild flowers, in muted mauves, to attract the bees. “The beauty of this is not those oak trees or the goshawk that’s probably in there hunting something at the moment, which is an extraordinary bird, and a powerful, gripping presence, a real enigma. It’s the relationship between the goshawk and the oak tree that is more beautiful. And that’s what switches you on to conservation, the fragility of this system. It’s not all about the rarity or abundance of these species, it’s about how the rarity is impacting on the community and its health.” It is strange, once you upturn one rock in conservationism, to see how many fights there are in the landscape, new and old. A new one is the badger cull, incompetently executed on poor advice. I almost don’t want to bring it up, once I’ve heard his long history with the badger, but I do, and he describes the situation soberly. “There are economic reasons against it – it costs £7,000 to kill a badger. There are welfare reasons – we know that they suffer. But I stick to the fact that the scientific data we have [says] that culling is ineffective in dealing with bovine TB. I don’t need to stray from that. This is the wrong thing to do because the science says it’s the wrong thing to do. Whatever party is in government, that’s not going to affect the science.” Foxhunting, incredibly, has resurfaced as an issue, and here, Packham looks genuinely pained. “I don’t understand it, I suppose. That’s the bottom line. To me, it has to have a psychopathic element, if you’re taking pleasure from killing things, just for that pleasure. If you’re going to eat it, if you’re culling an animal that is otherwise damaging the environment because it’s too abundant, I have no problem with killing animals. But if you have no reason but pleasure, then that surely is psychopathic.” But he is adamant that the list of things he doesn’t object to is a lot longer than people give him credit for. He only minds some forms of shooting: driven grouse shooting; woodcocks, which are on a very fast decline; hen harriers, which are a protected species. He is an ally, not an enemy, of British farming. “I’ve always stood up for British farmers. They govern 86% of this land surface. I want to be working with the farming fraternity all of my life – to brand me as anti-farming is the most ludicrous thing.” Perhaps most surprising is his take on climate change. “Of course, I fear the impacts of climate change, but I know that life and humans are hugely adaptable. It’s a process that we are forcing unnaturally, but the tenacity of life means we will adapt to it. Human population is more immediately dangerous, because that’s a question of resources running out. You can’t adapt to a lack of food, a lack of water. There’s nothing you can do to get round that.” In fact, he doesn’t go for big, named threats, doom-calling, dread-provoking, but two things trouble him: “The biggest handicap that conservation faces is that we humans still consider ourselves to be separate from the rest of life, and the rest of life is merely there to support us. It is infantile arrogance. How can anyone think we’re in some way abiotic? It’s nonsense. If I were to say, for instance, there was a parity of importance between myself and something living out in the woods, people wouldn’t understand that because we’re conditioned culturally and socially to think that we are the most important thing.” And on a personal note: “Look, on my watch, most of the habitats and species in the UK have gone through considerable decline. I’m embarrassed and I feel dejected and impotent on that account. I’ve failed to achieve what I wanted to do.” You can see the dejection momentarily on his lively, weirdly young-looking face (he’s 52, looks 39), but it passes. “So obviously I’m going to try harder while I still have the time.”"
"In this state of only 700,000 people that American presidents tend to visit most often only to refuel, the three-day tour by Barack Obama this week gave everybody something to talk about. Alaska is conservative and backed Obama’s opponents in 2008 and 2012, but the president’s celebrity appeal overshadowed the political misgivings of many as he travelled the vast state. Everywhere he went, residents made signs, crowded into restaurants and pulled over on roadsides to catch a glimpse. Social networks were ablaze with reports of security helicopters overhead, and observations about Obama’s gelato preferences (coffee and coconut), his treadmill routine (he runs “slow and smooth”, according to someone a few machines down), and his opinion of fish jerky in the rural community of Dillingham (“Outstanding!”). Videos of the passing motorcade were an epidemic. Presidential motorcade watchers #2, Jewel Lake Rd. #ObamaAK pic.twitter.com/E7cwb6WjjU Right before President Obama waved at me. #omg pic.twitter.com/JPkjJzUGwF The political implications of the visit weren’t lost on Alaskans either. At the US State Department conference on Arctic issues held in Anchorage, the president promoted renewable energy, called out climate change deniers, and warned that inaction on the issue could have grave consequences.  He did not discuss offshore oil drilling in the Arctic, which was recently approved by his administration over opposition by environmental groups.  Representatives of Alaska’s oil industry and the oil-producing North Slope region of the state were mostly absent from the conference, said Kara Moriarty, president and CEO of Alaska Oil and Gas Association, a trade group that represents oil and gas producers in the state. She called that “a missed opportunity”. The president also did not visit any oil industry sites, even though Alaska has one third of the nation’s oil and gas reserves, she said.  “Alaska is not just America’s playground, we are a very vital, important component in providing resources for the world and the country,” she said.  Obama’s next stops after the conference were a visit to Seward, several hours outside of Anchorage, where he viewed diminishing glaciers by boat. He continued on to the rural communities of Dillingham, in south-western Alaska, and then north to Kotzebue. It was the first time a sitting president had travelled above the Arctic Circle.  In rural Alaska, Obama talked with fishermen, danced Alaska Native dances with schoolchildren, discussed the impacts of climate change with Alaska Native leaders, and flew over the community of Kivalina, which is being eaten away by climate change-related coastal erosion.  #POTUSAK Dances with the children in Dillingham! pic.twitter.com/HhrGGIwSj5 At one point, in Dillingham, salmon milt wound up on his shoe.  Margaret Williams, director of conservation group World Wildlife Fund’s US Arctic program, attended the State Department conference and followed Obama’s remarks as he travelled the state.  She said taking the focus off oil development was fair because it usually dominates the discussion in Alaska. She was pleased with Obama’s Alaska message. That said, World Wildlife Fund is critical of the president’s position on offshore drilling. Williams said she had deep concerns about a spill in Arctic waters, which she said was “a matter of if, not when”. “This is a problem, it is a disconnect; at the same time, the president is doing other important things,” she said.  In Anchorage on Tuesday, architect Melanie Mangione got word that Obama might be getting coffee at Snow City Cafe, a restaurant near her office. She and co-workers decided to take a coffee break as well.  “I had co-workers with me who are completely opposed to his politics, they ran down there with us,” she said. “They were like, ‘This is the president and this is exciting. Period.’” They got their coffee, she said, and “just hovered”. Pretty soon Obama came in the door.  The crowded restaurant went quiet. Obama ordered his coffee and some sticky buns, and proceeded to walk through the restaurant, chatting and shaking hands.  PHOTOS: @POTUS grabs breakfast to-go at Anchorage’s @SnowCityCafe. #ObamaAK #POTUSAK pic.twitter.com/EmKsWwAvC0 “The impression I got from him is he is a gracious, kind human being,” said Mangione, who declined to discuss her opinion of his policies. “Politics and opinions aside, he didn’t have to interact with us the way he did.”  Next up for @POTUS: Kotzebue - Where the welcome-wagon is actually an ATV: pic.twitter.com/M5TIUiTqCP In the community of Kotzebue, Joshua Melton, tribal president from the community of Noorvik, waited for Obama’s arrival on Wednesday. Noorvik, a village far from the state road system on the Kobuk river east of Kotzebue (roughly 550 miles north of Anchorage) has a population of around 600. In his town, people’s feelings about the president are mixed, he said. Many rely on hunting to supplement expensive store-bought food, and some worry about the president’s position on gun control. “Firearms are our lifeline out here,” he said. But he said many people were concerned about the changes in weather, ice and animal behaviors that have been linked to a warming climate. It was good for Obama to see it, he said. There was anxiety in the region, too, about offshore drilling. “That big oil spill on the Gulf Coast that they couldn’t handle that well, how can they handle a spill in our Chukchi sea?” he said. “There’s a lot of risk. Our ecosystem can be damaged real fast.”  Millie Hawley, president of the Native Village of Kivalina, waited with Melton, wearing a purple blazer decorated with Alaska Native designs that she had sewn herself. Kivalina, a coastal community north of Kotzebue, is predicted to be totally uninhabitable because of coastal erosion within the next few decades.  “I think Obama’s gotten the world’s attention, internationally and nationally,” she said “He confirmed that climate change is happening and needs to be addressed.” And then he was gone.

"The Liberal senator Ian Macdonald has said children are being “brainwashed” by education campaigns urging Australians to take action on climate change, describing the political debate about how to tackle it as “puerile”. “The children of Australia have been brainwashed into thinking if you turn off a light in Australia, somehow that is going to stop climate change,” the Queensland senator told parliament on Wednesday.  “This is a puerile debate in its extreme. We have to bring some sense into the debate.” Because Australia emits less than 1.2% of the world’s carbon, considering an emissions trading scheme was “nonsensical,” he said, adding that “few serious countries” outside of the EU were implementing such schemes. The Australian Bureau of Statistics places the country’s emissions as closer to 1.5%. According to the Climate Institute, Australia is the largest per capita emitter in the industrialised world.  Macdonald said he did not deny the climate was changing. “As I repeatedly say, Australia was once covered in ice,” he said. “Of course the climate changes.” But he challenged the theory that humans were contributing to this. “This new theory, I refer to it often as a fad or a farce or a hoax, that suddenly since man started the industrial age, a change of climate has happened is just farcical and fanciful.” He added that “stupid proposals” for a carbon tax would lead to jobs being sent offshore, accusing the Greens of “denigrating and belittling” people with alternative views. Macdonald has frequently questioned taking action of climate change before other countries moved to do the same, and in 2013 said too many research grants were being allocated towards climate research."

"The vast majority of the world’s biggest food, beverage and tobacco companies are ignoring their largest climate impacts by failing to disclose emissions from agricultural production, according to a new CDP analysis.  When talking about the impacts of climate change, few risks are more visceral or tangible than those it poses to future food supply. From spikes in food prices to threats to the coffee industry, consumers are increasingly aware of the effects of rising global average temperatures.  For companies in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors, climate change presents a two-fold challenge: the industry is highly exposed to climate-related impacts, but is at the same time a major contributor to increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels – particularly from agricultural production, which according to the IPCC causes 10-14% of global GHG emissions. These challenges are significant. KPMG has warned that inaction on climate change could threaten the financial viability of the food industry. The increase in unpredictable extreme weather events is already effecting agricultural productivity and food companies’ supply chains are being hit: the ongoing drought in California is estimated to have cost the agricultural sector more than $2bn to date. A growing number of companies are realising the risks. This year 92% of brands reporting to CDP – the global non-profit organisation that gathers data on environmental risk – noted risks from the physical impacts of climate change, up from 84% in 2012. Some companies are relating this to future financial outputs: Diageo projects that changes in temperature could have negative financial implications on its agricultural supply chain. This could force the company to spend up to $77m more in increased commodity costs and production disruption. But, despite these clear business risks, many companies are not yet investigating where their largest climate impacts may lie. The biggest source of food-related GHG emissions occurs before produce leaves the farm gate, in the agricultural production portion of producer’s supply chains. Yet only 22 of the 97 major food, beverage and tobacco brands that disclosed to CDP this year reported their indirect GHG emissions from agricultural production. In addition, the majority of emissions-reduction activities companies report carrying out are focused on their direct operations, rather than their supply chain, where the bigger opportunities and risks lie, confirming that companies should be moving their attention from their own operations to their agricultural supply chain. These risks are increasingly being realised by investors. Following a shareholder proposal set out by Green Century Capital Management and Oxfam America, one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies, General Mills, recently became the first in its sector to adopt long-term, ambitious targets to cut GHG emissions.  General Mills’ strategy includes carbon emissions from its own operations but also from its supply chain, including those from agricultural production. The company is ahead of its peers in recognising agricultural production as producing the largest amount of GHG’s of all its operations, bringing competitive advantage. Data disclosed to CDP shows that major food producers that do take steps to address climate change through activities such as nutrient or manure management see multiple benefits, including financial savings. Over a third of food, beverage and tobacco companies report lower costs as a result of carrying out agricultural management practices with climate change benefit, either in their own farms or with suppliers.  Companies are also realising that they cannot do it alone. General Mills states that there is much to be achieved in pre-competitive collaboration across the industry when tackling emissions in agriculture. Supply chain collaboration is also providing positive feedback, with firms like SABMiller and Dairy Crest group undertaking knowledge sharing to improve fertiliser use. To truly ensure future resilience, food, beverage and tobacco companies must shift their focus from in-house emissions to those from agricultural production. While there are clear barriers to action, including the complexity of working with huge, global agricultural supply chains, signs of change are becoming more frequent.     "

"The environment minister of Alberta – the province where the tar sands industry is Canada’s fastest growing source of carbon emissions – says the days of denying climate change are over.   The minister, Shannon Phillips, told a conference on Wednesday that the New Democratic party provincial government elected in May was taking action after the targeting of Alberta’s climate change record by North American environmental groups in recent years.  Alberta, the biggest source of US oil imports, has also faced international criticism for what has been perceived as lax oversight of extraction and production of fossil fuels.  “There is a great appetite for action on climate change in our province,” Phillips said at a conference hosted in Edmonton, the provincial capital, by the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based environmental group. “The days of denial are over.”  Phillips, whose party ended 44 consecutive years of Conservative rule in the western Canadian province, said at a news conference that Alberta needed to consider new action including the possibility of tougher vehicle emissions standards to avoid having the worst air quality in Canada.  While she noted that 30% of Alberta’s economy was based on fossil fuels such as the tar sands, she said it must also remain competitive as the rest of the world was looking to transition to a lower-carbon economy. In June Phillips increased the cost of greenhouse gas emissions for large industrial plants and boosted targets for cutting heat-trapping emissions that warm the atmosphere. She later appointed a panel to advise the government about a long-term climate change plan.  Alberta released new data on Wednesday showing air pollution was increasing in several regions of the province and was close to exceeding new national air quality standards adopted in recent years across Canada."
