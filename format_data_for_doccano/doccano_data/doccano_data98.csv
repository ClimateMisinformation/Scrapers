"The UK is in the perverse situation of having no coherent foreign policy on the eve of completing an international negotiation that has consumed all of the government’s energy. The situation is less paradoxical than it sounds, because Brexit is a project based on an assertion of what the country does not want to be – a member of the EU – without a clear articulation of what it should be instead. That omission will be felt keenly, but not discussed, at Sunday’s extraordinary summit, where Theresa May and the 27 other European heads of government are expected to agree the broad outlines of a future partnership. But this “deal” will not answer the existential question that Brexit raises: if Britain’s influence in the world is no longer to be deployed as part of a European project, how will it be felt? The leave campaign did not recognise that as a legitimate question because Eurosceptics always saw “Brussels” as a hostile force and a drain on the sovereign power of a nation state. Brexit, in that view, offered enhanced status as “Global Britain”. That fantasy, like so many of the leaver pledges, has been dismantled by events. The dynamics of a 27-to-one negotiation have demonstrated how a continental bloc asserts power greater than the sum of its parts and greater than any one European country can wield alone. Power in the world is not simply a matter of autonomy to sign trade deals. EU membership has been an axiom of British foreign and security policy well beyond the arena of economic cooperation. To jettison that arrangement would have been risky at any point in recent decades. With Donald Trump in the White House, the timing is exquisitely poor. Mr Trump has started a trade war with China that looks like the prologue to a long confrontation between superpowers. Traditionally, a US president would look to Europe for strategic alliance under such circumstances, but Mr Trump has also picked trade fights with Brussels and heaped scorn on the EU.  Britain does not have to pick a side in this volatile environment but it will have to express priorities. The national interest will often demand alignment with our continental neighbours. That is a fact of culture, history, geography and realpolitik. Historians will look back and wonder how it was that Britain could make such consequential decisions about its role in the world without them featuring in domestic debate. The parochialism of cabinet rows has crowded out strategic challenges. Urgent, global issues are scarcely discussed: climate change; the potential uses and abuses of artificial intelligence and genomics; large-scale population migrations. These are forces that will reshape human society, and it is hard to see how a medium-sized, albeit rich, nation can grapple with them alone. The most influential actors will be those that can operate on continental scale – China, the US, India, the EU. Such gigantism requires political deftness and skill to navigate. There will be questions about how much freedom ought to be devolved within such superpowers. Once a key player in such debates, we will be a bystander. Britain is recusing itself from that level of influence, downgrading its clout in the world. That might be what many voters want, or at least a price they are willing to pay for Brexit. It is difficult to know, when the question has never been put in those terms. This weekend’s meeting in Brussels is all about Britain and what Mrs May has negotiated. There needs to be more focus on the question of what future British prime ministers will be able to achieve after Mrs May has surrendered the UK’s seat at the summit table."

"A leading business group has expressed significant concern with the Morrison government’s controversial plan to underwrite new power generation, noting it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities “with a net present value of billions of dollars”. The Ai Group has used its submission to flag major problems with the proposal, ranging from its “extremely aggressive” administrative timetable, with projects being drummed up before the next federal election; a lack of obvious “strong independent governance” arrangements, and the lack of an overarching climate and energy policy.  The criticism joins significant pushback from Australia’s power companies, and from lobby groups representing renewable energy, reflecting profound frustration in the business community about the way the Coalition has conducted itself on climate and energy policy. Only the lobby group representing Australia’s resources giants, the Minerals Council of Australia has, thus far, lent public support to the initiative. The Ai Group says an underwriting program to encourage new generation is reasonable in theory, but if it is not well designed then taxpayers are exposed to significant risks, generators can be shielded from market pressures, and special treatment for some generators can deter investment outside the program. It notes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission proposed an underwriting program with a low price floor of $45-50 per megawatt hour “that would be unlikely to expose the Commonwealth to much financial risk” – but the Morrison government has ignored those parameters and is pursuing options that “carry much greater risks”. The submission notes the underwriting program is being carried out in a policy vacuum. The government has indicated generation projects supported through the new underwriting mechanism would need to conform with an objective to reduce electricity emissions by 26% below its 2005 levels by 2030. But Ai Group says this is an “inadequate approach to integrating emissions and energy policy”. It says generation assets operate for decades “and emissions targets for 2030 – 12 years away – are not an adequate basis for consideration”. It says Australia has signed up to the Paris targets, and there is “no reason to think that applying a pro-rata – 26% target to the electricity sector is sufficient or efficient”. “There are strong arguments that deeper reductions in electricity emissions are cheaper and more practical than pro rata reductions across more challenging sectors,” the submission says. It calls on the Morrison government – which has abandoned emissions reduction after the internal furore over the national energy guarantee – to set a sectoral or economy-wide emissions policy framework to help guide future investment decisions. “Our strongly preferred solution to this uncertainty is for all sides of politics across the commonwealth and the states to agree an efficient, pro-competitive, stable and scalable framework for integrating climate and energy policy”. “In the absence of such a framework, government can try to support investment by guaranteeing it against policy risks. But this support may be very expensive, difficult to sustain and insufficiently credible to attract investment”. Ai Group says the governance arrangements for the scheme are completely unclear, and a process where proposals are considered by the Department of the Environment and Energy, “with possible ad hoc appointment of outside experts on certain matters, and decided on by the minister for energy with, presumably, Cabinet consideration” raises several concerns. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has flagged underwriting new coal projects under the scheme, and the possible indemnification of projects from the future risk of a carbon price. Speculation is rife around the energy sector that the government underwriting proposal will ultimately centre on an extension of the Vales Point power station near Lake Macquarie in New South Wales. It is owned by Trevor St Baker, who was vocal during a recent stakeholder session convened to discuss the underwriting program. The Ai Group says: “Given that an underwriting program could result in long-term Commonwealth liabilities with a net present value of billions of dollars, a strong governance arrangement is essential for the actual and perceived integrity of the process”. It points out, for example, that the net present value of fully offsetting the lifetime emissions of a new 2GW high efficiency low emissions (HELE) power plant could be $17.5bn, and more than $1.3bn annually by 2030, depending on what carbon policies are ultimately adopted. The business group says the Morrison government needs to take a breath and stop attempting to finalise contracts prior to the federal election expected in May 2019. “Given the low level of detail currently available, the wide scope of possible design options, and the severe risks of poor design to the public purse and the integrity of the electricity market, we strongly recommend that the government slow down”."
"“It was like something out of a science fiction movie,” says Barbara Hall from the office of the beachside hotel she runs in Placencia, southern Belize. “I woke up at 6am, looked out my window and realised we had a big problem. It was absolutely overwhelming.” The sight that greeted her that morning was a gargantuan tide of sargassum – a type of ocean seaweed that had swept in overnight. At sea, sargassum is an essential habitat for some marine life, but when it reaches land it rots, sucking up oxygen from the water and emitting hydrogen sulphide gas, which smells like rotten eggs. It has washed up in the Caribbean in unusually large amounts since 2011, but this year the largest volumes ever have appeared on shores from Barbados to Mexico, with piles several feet deep stretching for miles, and dozens of metres out to sea. It has had a significant effect on the tourism on which much of the region depends – the sight and smell left beaches highly unattractive, and swimming was impossible. On land, the gas rapidly destroyed nearby electric units, such as TVs; eroded metals and even affected human health, with people living near inundated areas complaining of headaches, nausea and skin irritation. Marine life was also affected; across the region, there have been reports of fish, turtles, dolphins and other creatures succumbing to the piles of rotting algae. While oceanographers are uncertain of its causes, they think global warming could be a factor, and coastal communities could be due even worse sargassum inundations in the future. “This is a major issue for many island countries,” says James Franks, senior research scientist at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory at the University of Southern Mississippi. “We don’t fully understand it … there are many unknowns.” It is believed the sargassum has benefited from increased nutrients in the sea – perhaps from mineral-rich dust blown from Africa, Franks says. Others believe fertiliser runoff from industrial farming in the Americas may be to blame. Warmer waters would also encourage plant growth. “I imagine global warming is part of the problem,” says Amy Siuda, a sargassum specialist at Eckerd College, Florida. “We’re experiencing changes in currents that certainly can be related to warming of the atmosphere.” Changes in wind patterns – potentially caused by a warming climate – mean sargassum might have been moved from areas where it has usually stayed, with winds and currents bringing it further south than normal, Siuda says. She adds: “Ocean currents are the results of winds, changes in winds are the results of solar heating and changes in atmosphere and circulation. Ultimately, we can change circulation patterns by warming our atmosphere.” Regardless of the causes, sargassum is being taken so seriously that governments across the Caribbean have initiated emergency programmes to deal with the issue. Belize, a tiny nation in Central America, is highly dependent on tourism, and sargassum is the “biggest concern” of all to the trade, says Hall. Hall says the authorities are “doing a good job” and are preparing the funding needed for expensive and complicated clear-up operations. Nonetheless, some hotels have reported cancellations during the slow season. The impact during high season could be devastating, say numerous locals employed in tourism. Hall stresses that hotels are taking firm steps to deal with the issue – such as preparing booms to keep the tides of sargassum out at sea – and they remain optimistic for the region’s future. But she admits some sargassum control methods employed in the nearby Yucatan peninsula of Mexico – which is much better-resourced – have not worked. In the northern Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, there was a mass fish die-out. The sargassum is “wiping out a generation” of the area’s young sea creatures, says Kirah Castillo, technical manager of the Hol Chan marine reserve just off the island. Months-old juvenile creatures such as lobster and conch migrate to nursery areas of mangrove and seagrass and are believed to have been suffocated by sargassum. “Whatever juveniles came in will have died,” Castillo says. The effects are likely to be felt in two to three years’ time, when the creatures would be due to enter the fishery, she says. These creatures are hard to see and the phenomenon has not been measured, Castillo says, but “we know from the biology of these animals that it is happening and will have an effect on the ecosystem. That’s a major concern for us.” The complex suspected causes of the sargassum problem mean it could worsen, with little prospect of a preventive solution. “Everyone now recognises this is a critical issue and may be long-term,” says Franks. Siuda agrees: “If the inundations increase in frequency, they could potentially last all year long without a break, maybe in larger amounts.” It represents a new challenge coastal communities will have to adapt to. “You couldn’t stop the waves. You could just see it coming and coming,” says Hall in her hotel office. “It’s a difficult thing, to feel powerless.”"
"Climate change is already harming Americans’ lives with “substantial damages” set to occur as global temperatures threaten to surge beyond internationally agreed limits, a major US government report has warned.  The influence of climate change is being felt across the US with increases in disastrous wildfires in the west, flooding on the east coast, soil loss in the midwest and coastal erosion in Alaska, according to the US National Climate Assessment. The Guardian saw a draft of the report before publication on Friday. The draft outlined that “impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic wellbeing are rising”. Climate change-related risks “will continue to grow without additional action”, it added. The quadrennial report, the combined work of 13 federal agencies, was released by the Trump administration on the day after Thanksgiving. Scientists who worked on the report said their research was not watered down but claimed the release was timed to bury the findings during the holiday season. Global temperatures could be limited to 2C above pre-industrial era if greenhouse gas emissions are slashed but “without significant reductions, annual average global temperatures could increase by 9F (5C) or more by the end of this century”, a previously released chapter states. Even 2C warming is likely to have major ramifications for societies, as the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report spelled out. Heating the planet well beyond this would create a “totally different world”, said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. “It would be indescribable, it would turn the world upside down in terms of its climate. There would be nothing like it in the history of civilization.” Oppenheimer, with many other scientists, has said warming of around 3C is more likely given the advance of renewable energy and expected emissions reductions in the future. “That is more of an economic, political and technology question,” a report author who wished to remain unnamed told the Guardian. “It’s hard to say what we are on track for right now.” The draft report warned that the current response was insufficient to stave off the worst impacts, stating that “neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades”. Another report author said: “Climate change is loading the dice against us, it’s going to affect our water, food and ecosystems. This report is important because it shows it’s already happening where we live, not on far off islands or at the poles.” Included in the dozens of draft report chapters: The summary states the “earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future.” Average sea levels along the US coast have increased by around 9in since the early 20th century as the oceans have warmed and land ice has melted. If emissions are not constrained, “many coastal communities will be transformed by the latter part of this century”. Fisheries, tourism, human health and public safety are being “transformed, degraded or lost due in part to climate change impacts, particularly sea level rise and higher numbers of extreme weather events”. Wildfires have burned at least 3.7m acres in the US in all but three years from 2000 to 2016. “More frequent and larger wildfires, combined with increasing development at the wildland-urban interface portend increasing risks to property and human life,” the report states. More than 100m people in the US live in places with poor air quality and climate change will “worsen existing air pollution levels”. Increased wildfire smoke risks heightening respiratory and cardiovascular problems, while the prevalence of asthma and hay fever is also likely to rise. Major groundwater supplies have declined over the last century, with this decrease accelerating since 2001. “Significant changes in water quantity and quality are evident across the country,” the report finds. Climate change will “disrupt many areas of life” by hurting the US economy, affecting trade and exacerbating overseas conflicts. Low-income and marginalized communities will be worst hit. The national climate assessment is mandated by Congress to compile the latest research on climate change. The last report came out in 2014. Donald Trump has since announced the US will withdraw from the Paris climate deal, with his administration working to dismantle every major policy designed at lowering emissions. The release of the report comes as California is racked by its most deadly wildfire on record, the so-called Camp fire, which razed the town of Paradise. At least 84 people have died and tens of thousands of people have had to flee the fire, which has occurred at the same time as a smaller blaze further south, near Los Angeles. Trump has downplayed assertions by scientists and firefighters that climate change is making California more wildfire-prone, instead pointing to “gross mismanagement” of forest areas. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, has said conservationist lawsuits by “radical environmental groups” were to blame. While visiting devastated parts of California last weekend Trump was asked if what he had seen and heard had changed his mind about climate change, which he has previously called a “hoax”. Trump responded to the question with a firm: “No.” “When there are daily images of California burning up it’s hard for the administration to argue climate change isn’t happening,” said Oppenheimer. “The strategy seems to be let sleeping dogs lie and hope the public doesn’t pay much attention to it.”"
"The Trump administration attempted to downplay the stark findings of its own climate change assessment, as Democrats sought to pressure the White House to avert looming economic and public health disaster. The US National Climate change assessment, the work of 300 scientists and 13 federal agencies, was released on Friday afternoon. It found that wildfires, storms and heatwaves are already taking a major toll on Americans’ wellbeing, with climate change set to “disrupt many areas of life” in the future.  The voluminous report, which warns of hundreds of billions of dollars lost, crop failures, expanding wildfires, altered coastlines and multiplying health problems, represents the most comprehensive and sobering analysis yet of the dangers posed to the US by rising temperatures. Climate change could slash up to a tenth of US GDP by the end of the century, the report found, with $1tn in coastal real estate threatened by rising sea levels and storms. Heatwaves are set to cause thousands of extra deaths and worsen conditions such as asthma and pulmonary disease through increased air pollution. A White House spokeswoman, however, said the assessment was “largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population”. The spokeswoman added the next report, due in four years’ time, will “provide for a more transparent and data-driven process”. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and a report co-author, said the White House’s statement was “demonstrably false”. She added on Twitter: “I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise.” The climate assessment galvanized Democrats, who will control the House of Representatives next year. “The days of denial and inaction in the House are over,” said Frank Pallone, a New Jersey congressman set to chair the energy and commerce committee. “House Democrats plan to aggressively address climate change and hold the administration accountable for its backward policies that only make it worse.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected representative from New York City who has become a standard-bearer for the left, tweeted: “People are going to die if we don’t start addressing climate change ASAP. It’s not enough to think it’s ‘important’. We must make it urgent.” Authors of the report, which is mandated by Congress, echoed the sense of urgency and lamented the timing of its release on the day after Thanksgiving, which is usually the busiest shopping day of the year. “This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future – it’s happening right now in every part of the country,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, a co-author and director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a statement. “When people say the wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves they’re experiencing are unlike anything they’ve seen before, there’s a reason for that and it’s called climate change.” Ekwurzel added that the report “makes a convincing case the White House should stop rolling back climate policies and recognize that a much larger scale response is required to keep people safe”. Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the report, although on Wednesday he responded to a cold snap on the east coast by tweeting: “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS – Whatever happened to Global Warming?” The president took a trip last week to see the aftermath of California’s deadliest ever wildfires, a phenomenon experts say is worsened by warming temperatures. During a visit to the town of Paradise, which was wiped out by the so-called Camp fire, Trump said he wanted “a great climate”. But he has largely blamed forest management for the blaze. He has repeatedly disparaged or dismissed climate science in the past. In a statement in response to the release of the climate assessment, the former vice-president and environmental campaigner Al Gore said: “The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.”"

"Brazil’s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro has chosen a new foreign minister who believes climate change is part of a plot by “cultural Marxists” to stifle western economies and promote the growth of China. Ernesto Araújo – until recently a mid-ranking official who blogs about the “criminalisation” of red meat, oil and heterosexual sex – will become the top diplomat of South America’s biggest nation, representing 200 million people and the greatest and most biodiverse forest on Earth, the Amazon. His appointment, confirmed by Bolsonaro on Wednesday, is likely to send a chill through the global climate movement. Brazil was where the international community first came together in 1992 to discuss reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Its diplomats have played a crucial role in bridging the gap between rich and poor nations, particularly during the forging of the Paris agreement in 2015. But when the new government takes power in January, the foreign ministry that leads that work will be headed by a man who claims climate science is merely “dogma”. In his blog, Araújo states his goal is to “help Brazil and the world liberate themselves from globalist ideology”, which he sees as anti-Christian. The 51-year-old diplomat – who has never served as an overseas ambassador – claims unnamed leftist politicians have hijacked environmentalism to serve as a tool for global domination. “This dogma has been used to justify increasing the regulatory power of states over the economy and the power of international institutions on the nation states and their populations, as well as to stifle economic growth in democratic capitalist countries and to promote the growth of China,” he wrote in a post last month. In another, he claimed the centre-left Workers party in Brazil was “criminalising sex and reproduction, saying that all heterosexual intercourse is rape and every baby is a risk to the planet as it will increase carbon emissions”. He then went on to accuse the party of criminalising red meat, oil, air conditioners and Disney movies. The incendiary rhetoric echoes that of Bolsonaro, who won last month’s presidential election with about 57.7m votes. The former army captain has since moved to put in place one of the world’s most far-right administrations and promised to align Brazil more closely to Trump and the US. Climate negotiation experts said the appointment was sad for Brazil and the world – though they held out hope that the new foreign minister will be more pragmatic when he comes to represent his country. “Brazil has played a very significant role for the Paris agreement. It would be really bad for the country’s image if he brings with him his ideology,” said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory. He said climate was the one area where Brazil could proudly boast to be a global leader, and urged the new foreign minister and president not to isolate the country in this field. “Bolsonaro is not Trump. Brazil is not the United States. We don’t have the same cards,” he said. “If Brazil becomes a pariah on the global climate agenda, it would be extremely bad for our business, especially agribusiness. When they go to Europe to negotiate a deal, climate safeguards will be on the table. ” The risk of losing soya and beef sales in Europe is thought to be why Bolsonaro has backtracked on threats to quit the Paris agreement and merge the agriculture and environment ministries. But he remains intent on opening up the Amazon to the farmers, miners and construction companies that supported his campaign. His pick as agriculture minister is the head of the farming lobby, Tereza Cristina Dias, who conservationists have nicknamed the “Muse of Poison” due to her enthusiastic support for relaxing controls on agro-toxins. She and her colleagues are said to be gutting the responsibilities of the environment ministry before its new head is appointed. The environment institution is likely to be so subservient that insiders joke there will soon be two agriculture ministries in Brazil. The slim hope now for climate advocates is that the powerful agribusiness lobby will come to realise that the rain for their crops depends on a healthy Amazon and stable global environment. More than 80% of Brazil’s municipalities have experienced drought in the past five years, which scientists have linked to deforestation. But loggers are not waiting. The latest deforestation figures showed a sharp rise in deforestation during the election campaign, suggesting protections for nature and indigenous land are already weakening."
"The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says a “constituency” of Coalition MPs believes climate change is a fraud, and that the issue has become a “third rail” for the Liberal party. Speaking at the Australia Bar Association’s annual conference in Sydney on Friday night, Turnbull, the guest of honour at the event, said a climate-sceptic group within his own party held the line that “if you don’t do what we want, we will blow the show up,” the Australian reported.  “And that is essentially what you’ve seen — and so the problem is that everybody loses”. Turnbull, who was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison in August and subsequently retired from politics, was asked at the event about his personal commitment to act on climate change. He famously crossed the floor in opposition to vote with Labor in support of an emissions trading scheme, but as prime minister led a government with little resolve to reduce emissions. “The truth is … the Liberal Party and the Coalition is not capable of dealing with climate change,” Turnbull told the conference. “It is just a fact I regret to say. It is like a third rail. We have at the present time in the Coalition, a group of, a constituency, that is the best way to describe it, who believe we should get out of [the Paris Agreement], that climate change is a fraud, the more you have the better, and are literally on another plane. “They are not prepared to play ball with everybody else.” Turnbull has previously conceded that any policy on climate change would be extremely difficult for the Liberal-National Coalition because it was treated as an ideological matter within the party. “The emissions issue and climate policy issues have the same problem within the Coalition of ... bitterly entrenched views that are actually sort of more ideological views than views based,” he had said while being forced out as prime minister. During an appearance on the ABC’s Q&A program this month, he described his removal from the prime ministership as an act of unexplained madness, and accused leading conservatives of “blowing up” the government."
"The Republic of Vanuatu says it will explore whether it can take legal action against fossil fuel companies and countries for their role in causing climate change. The Pacific nation says it is growing desperate for financial assistance to deal with the loss and damage it is increasingly experiencing due to extreme weather and global warming.  In a statement on Thursday to the Climate Vulnerable Forum, an international summit focused on those most at risk to the effects of climate change, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said he was putting the fossil fuel industry “and the states that sponsor it on notice that the climate loss and damages ravaging Vanuatu will not go unchallenged”. “My government is now exploring all avenues to utilise the judicial system in various jurisdictions – including under international law – to shift the costs of climate protection back onto the fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country,” he said. No such case brought by a country has been tested but there have been cases brought by citizens in domestic jurisdictions. Small island countries such as Vanuatu are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Under the Paris agreement, countries have agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2C. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent special report warned the planet had only 12 years in which to meet the 1.5C goal and that the damage of even half a degree warmer than that would be far more significant. Regenvanu told the forum that Cyclone Pam, the tropical cyclone that hit Vanuatu in 2015, wiped out 64.1% of its GDP, or $US449.4m. He told Guardian Australia that Vanuatu was facing huge costs in trying to adapt to and prevent the impacts of climate change. “The mechanism that has been but in place by the Paris agreement to assist least developed countries like Vanuatu to adapt and take measures to deal with loss and damage is the Green Climate Fund,” he said. “Unfortunately countries like Australia who are the big polluters have just announced they will not contribute. “There is a moral argument to say that to address our loss and damage bill we should be getting that from the people who are profiting off it.” He said Vanuatu was looking for other countries to join it and would be discussing this at the next conference of parties on climate change in Poland next month. Vanuatu is home to 260,000 residents and is made up of 82 volcanic islands dispersed across 1,280km of sea. Many of its islands sit less than a metre above sea level. Greenpeace said the country was on the front lines of climate change. “Vanuatu’s brave announcement today is part of a global wave of legal action against oil, gas, and coal companies and laggard governments,” Jennifer Morgan, the executive director at Greenpeace International, said. Richie Merzian is the climate and energy program director at yhe Australia Institute and a former Australian government negotiator to the UN on loss and damage from climate change. He said Vanuatu’s announcement was a sign of growing frustration among countries vulnerable to climate change over the loss and damage mechanisms within UN climate forum. “These countries are desperate and they’re looking for support and instead of finding a friend they’re finding a closed door,” he said. “It’s great Vanuatu is looking for every option available to make their case and there are a number of test cases around the world that they can learn from.” "

"Europe faces even deeper political turmoil and the possibility of mass migration from Africa unless the world urgently addresses the threat of climate change, the former US secretary of state John Kerry said on Thursday. Speaking at a Guardian Live event, at Central Hall in London, he said he was deeply disturbed at how issues such as climate change, cyber wars and the future of the oceans were not ballot box issues, admitting it was hard to translate these issues into an acceptable set of choices for voters. In the discussion with the Observer’s chief political commentator, Andrew Rawnsley, Kerry said: “We are heading for catastrophe unless we respond to some life-threatening challenges very rapidly. We have a climate-denying president that pulls us out of the the Paris climate change agreement at a time when literally every day matters. “Europe is already crushed under this transformation that is taking place due to migration. In Germany Angela Merkel is weakened. Italian politics is significantly impacted. “Well, imagine what happens if water dries up and you cannot produce food in northern Africa. Imagine what happens if Nigeria hits its alleged 500 million people by the middle of the century … you are going to have hordes of people in the northern part of the Mediterranean knocking on the door. I am telling you. If you don’t believe me, just go read the literature.” The former secretary of state for the Obama administration reminded his audience that climate change scientists had just warned that historically unprecedented steps were needed to prevent an extra 0.5C (0.9F) increase. He pointed to the fires in California and the repeated intensive storms – Harvey, Irma and Maria – that cost the US $265bn last year. Kerry said Harvey dropped as much water on the Houston, Texas, area in five days as goes over Niagara Falls in an entire year. Irma, he said, had the first recorded, sustained winds of over 185 mph for 24 hours. He said the Green Climate Fund set up in Paris was supposed to have $100bn, but it only had $6bn, making it very difficult for poorer countries to make the right energy decisions. China and India, he said, were still on course to build a wave of coal-fired stations. “We should not be building a single coal fired plant anywhere on the planet,” he added. Kerry insisted the doors to the G20 summit in Argentina later this year should be locked until the fund was replenished. At the same time, he said, the private sector had to come up with the transformative breakthroughs but all voters have to make “damn sure” that politicians will take the issue seriously. He also made an impassioned defence for the EU, saying the institution had been set up initially to prevent war, but Europe was now seeing old demons return in the form of antisemitism and racism. Kerry, insisting he did not want to interfere in the UK elections, reminded his audience that before the 2016 referendum he and president Obama had called for the UK to stay in the EU. “To the best of my knowledge [Obama] has not changed view,” he said. He added: “I do not think this is the moment for the EU to start falling apart.” Kerry also defended the Iran nuclear deal that he signed in 2015, but that has been torn up by Donald Trump. He said the “deal is the tightest, most stringent, most accountable, transparent nuclear arms agreement on the planet”. Under the deal, if the Iranians had tried to make a bomb “we would know immediately because we have radio transmission seals on centrifuges and stockpiles. We have a right to trace, from cradle to grave, every piece of uranium”. He described the US midterm election results as encouraging and said the Democrats should be preparing for the 2020 election. He refused to identify his chosen presidential candidate, saying he was not convinced he had identified that person yet. But he said the essential element of any ideal successful candidate “will above all be authenticity”. • This article was amended on 19 November 2018 to correct the fahrenheit conversion of a difference in temperature of 0.5C.

"On climate and energy policy, Labor never learns from its mistakes, Scott Morrison told us on Thursday, apparently limbering up for another heart-warming election season of who can be the biggest numpty. The prime minister is wrong about that. The evidence tells us Labor does learn from its mistakes, and in climate and energy the ALP have become shape shifters in order to keep doggedly pursuing policies reducing emissions in an environment when that activity is construed, ever more bizarrely in reactionary circles, as some kind of hostile action. Again, with our eyes fixed firmly on the evidence, we can note Morrison is brave to be talking about mistakes and a lack of learning in climate and energy policy, given the Coalition has been a rolling botch-up in this area, lurching from bouts of hyperpartisan self-interest to desperate scrambling to produce a policy that Tony Abbott wouldn’t veto (oops he vetoed it anyway), ending at a point that can only be described as outright clustercuss. Just consider one small counterpoint from Thursday. Bill Shorten went to Bloomberg and laid out an energy policy that defined the pressing challenge of transforming Australia’s energy market from top to bottom, and then he rolled out some detailed policy options for dealing with it. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, by way of riposte, bunged on a high-vis vest, stood in front of a smelter in Tomago, and talked about Shorten having to nominate which burping cows he would cull, which, for a person of Taylor’s intelligence and technical expertise, must feel about as close as it comes to End Times. We’ve been here before: the hyperbolic carry on, it’s all pretty tired. It was stupid then and it’s even more stupid now, with the clock ticking, the grid creaking, power prices rising and emissions rising in sectors of the economy outside electricity. We don’t have time for more nonsense, and there’s already been far too much of it. When it comes to climate and energy policy, voters desperately need someone to be a grown-up and, on Thursday, Shorten told them, in his most important speech as opposition leader, that it would be him. He would be the grown-up because, God knows, someone had to be. Now, to the merits of Shorten’s policy offering. It’s a bit depressing, frankly, where we find ourselves, at the tail end of the dumbest decade, because the only options to achieve progress are third-order options, where governments are back to rolling out industry policies as the solution to problems. A number of business groups on Thursday pointed out the downside risks of energy policy by picking winners but frankly some of those business groups were also on the front line of campaigning against a carbon price, a market mechanism, only a couple of years ago – so, chaps, what goes around comes around. You reap what you sow. So, we are where we are. Wishing it were otherwise is a waste of energy and a waste of time and, in the context of where we are, Labor’s offering is sensible enough. The plan looks like this. Give the Liberals one more chance not to be wreckers on the taxpayer dime, give them an opportunity to wake up for themselves and vote for their own mechanism, the national energy guarantee. And in the event that fails, then drive the required transformation by a combination of measures: a 45% economy-wide emissions reduction target, funding the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to drive new investments in large-scale generation and storage, upgrading sub-optimal transmission infrastructure and preparing coal communities for the inevitable transition. Conceptually, that’s not a bad mud map. Of course there will be detailed questions to answer, and there’s an obvious one sitting right at the heart of Labor’s package. If the economy-wide emissions reduction target is 45% (and that’s the plan) then shouldn’t the emissions reduction target for the electricity sector be higher than that given abatement is cheaper in electricity than in other sectors of the economy? It’s cheaper to reduce emissions in electricity than it is, say, in transport. The reality is the electricity target should be higher than 45% to try and contain the costs of the transition. It’s a question that needs an answer but that’s a tangle Labor won’t want to get into, particularly given Taylor and others are already thundering apocalyptically about “wrecking balls” through the economy."
"Cooling the Earth by injecting sun-blocking particles into the stratosphere could be “remarkably inexpensive”, according to the most detailed engineering analysis to date. The fear of a rogue nation or military force unilaterally taking control of the global climate is unfounded, the researchers added, as the many thousands of high-altitude flights needed to affect global temperatures could not escape detection.  The new research estimated the technology costs of putting millions of tonnes of sulphate particles high into the atmosphere. This form of geoengineering mimics major volcanic eruptions, which have significantly reduced global temperatures in the past. “We show that a hypothetical deployment programme, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would be technically possible,” said Gernot Wagner from Harvard University. “It would also be remarkably inexpensive, at an average of around $2bn to $2.5bn per year.” About $500bn (£388bn) a year is currently invested in green technologies. The idea of geoengineering is controversial, with opponents arguing it could seem like an easy solution to global warming and weaken efforts to cut the root cause of emissions. Others warn it risks serious unintended consequences, such as droughts and damage to crops. In October, more than 100 civil society groups condemned geoengineering as “dangerous, unnecessary and unjust”. However, many scientists say not conducting geoengineering research would be even more dangerous, because climate change may become so bad that governments feel compelled to deploy it despite not knowing its full consequences. “Unfortunately, climate change is dire enough for us to have to consider drastic action,” said Dr Matthew Watson at the University of Bristol. “Some argue against researching these ideas but personally I think that is a mistake. There may come a time, in a future not so far away, where it would be immoral not to intervene.” The new study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that the most cost-effective way to deliver the particles requires the development of a new type of aircraft. If the sulphates were released from commercial jets, the particles would fall out of the sky in days. No aircraft exists that could carry tonnes of particles to the 12-mile (20km) altitude needed in order for them to remain aloft for a year or more, and rockets would be far too expensive. The new plane would need much larger wings and four engines rather than two, as the air at 12 miles is just 7% as dense as at sea level. “It would be an unusual design, but one does not need technological breakthroughs,” said Wake Smith, an aviation engineer who worked with Wagner. The researchers calculated the cost of a 15-year programme in which six to eight new planes are added each year, including crew costs, maintenance, insurance, fuel, landing charges, spares and training. The programme would begin with 4,000 flights a year and end with 60,000 flights a year by almost 100 aircraft. “The amount of flights happening would be so big it could not be done secretly,” said Smith. “This is not like the German naval buildup before the second world war. If people were doing this, we would know about it.” The impact of the programme would be to reduce warming by 0.1C per year, with a total reduction of 1.5C, said Wagner. This is based on emissions being curbed from today’s levels but still rising and leading to 3C of warming, a level considered catastrophic by scientists. A major recent report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) cited 1.5C of warming as a far safer limit. The researchers said they were not advocating the deployment of solar engineering, but believed it must be assessed. “It can only be part of an overall climate policy portfolio that first includes [emission cuts], adaptation and carbon removal from the atmosphere,” said Wagner. The IPCC report said geoengineering might be adopted as a temporary “remedial measure” in extreme circumstances. “If the world runs through the door with its hair on fire, we need to understand what the options are,” said Smith. Prof Joanna Haigh at Imperial College London said: “This plan is a distraction that may well encourage weaker action on emissions reduction.” She said the money would be better spent on helping nations cut emissions and protect themselves from extreme weather. The costs of compensating for droughts, floods and food shortages that geoengineering might cause would be much larger than the engineering costs, said Phil Williamson at the University of East Anglia. “International agreement to go ahead would seem near-impossible. Rapid reductions in emissions remain the best way to avoid climate catastrophe.” Blocking sunlight does not address other problems caused by global warming, such as the acidification of the oceans. However, Prof Peter Cox at the University of Exeter said: “The fact that researchers at one of the world’s top universities are costing the deployment of such a radical [geoengineering] scheme shows how urgent the climate change problem has become.”"

"At a recent green innovation event at Imperial College, London, PhD candidate Naomi Pratt and several other students handed out flyers. They were holding elephants on sticks, or “oilophants”, to represent the elephant in the room at the discussion: Imperial’s links with the fossil fuel industry. “Within two minutes we had security guards coming round saying ‘you can’t hand out flyers here, you can’t have this sign. Move along, you’ve made your point,’” Pratt says. Pratt is the leader of Divest Imperial, a group set up to pressure the university to eliminate financial investments in fossil fuel companies from its endowment fund, and reduce its reliance on research funding from the fossil fuel industry. Although their protests are not always shut down, the recent event wasn’t her only experience of being asked to stop flyering in a public part of campus. “It’s a stark example of how Imperial is run as a business, and how it’s trying to control its image,” she says.  Imperial ranks in the bottom tier of People & Planet’s annual sustainability ranking for universities. In response to the poor performance, it produced a report aimed at understanding what had gone wrong. Of the staff and students surveyed for their views, 98% felt the university should be doing more on sustainability and climate change. Pratt sees any concern about the links as window dressing, given that in reality the university “is almost like an extension of the [fossil fuel] industry”. Imperial is proud of its relationships with fossil fuel companies, from which it receives valuable research funding and funded professorships, as well as input into degree programmes that produce the next generation of oil and gas engineers. In addition to questioning Imperial’s relationships with the industry, Pratt is troubled by their access to students and the campus. Fossil fuel companies make regular appearances at careers fairs, and some courses have mandatory field trips sponsored by the oil and gas sector. “They have an almost ubiquitous presence on campus,” she says. “You hear students repeating industry lines back to you: ‘we’re going to need fossil fuels for x amount of years, it’s important to have an energy mix.’” Imperial is not alone, though its strength in science means it’s considered to have some of the deepest links with the industry. Cambridge University received an estimated £1.9m – or 0.4% of its total funding – from oil and gas companies in 2016, according to research by the Zero Carbon Cambridge campaign group. Other universities, including Aberdeen, Oxford, Warwick and Sheffield, are known to have similar ties. Can universities justify these relationships? Imperial says it works with industrial partners to find “solutions to the world’s need for energy”, alongside research aimed at reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels – through carbon capture and storage, for example, or battery technology and solar cells. It defends its investments as enabling its endowment to better invest in research and education. But the fossil fuel industry is under increasing pressure following a recent UN report, which criticised its efforts to limit climate breakdown. The report warns that the world needs a 45% cut to carbon pollution by 2030 to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. Recent protests by climate activists in London have ramped up in its wake. Chris Saltmarsh, a co-director at People & Planet, says that although fossil fuel divestment has been the most successful student environmental campaign, there is growing concern about universities’ wider links with the fossil fuel industry. “Students are saying these companies need to be challenged – do they deserve any space on our campuses at all?” he says. “We don’t think it’s right for universities to be profiting from or investing in companies driving the climate crisis.” Part of the reason the movement hasn’t gained the same traction as divestment, in Saltmarsh’s view, is that fossil fuel relationships can be hard to map, and are in some cases “deliberately opaque”.  “It would take a policy shift on a governmental or supra-governmental level to outlaw fossil fuel companies from research partnerships,” he says. “We would argue that all public research institutions and any other companies investing in research for the public good shouldn’t be associating themselves with fossil fuel. Any relationship is either profiting them directly or bulking up their reputation so that they can continue to extract.” The picture is similar in the US, where Ben Franta, a PhD student at Stanford University, is working on a study mapping how much research is funded by the oil and gas industry. He believes there has been an “invisible colonisation of academia” by fossil fuel companies. “I think that most people are still largely unaware of the pervasiveness of oil industry funding in academia, especially for climate and energy research,” he says. “The full picture of the ubiquity of this funding is not really known yet.” Like Pratt, Franta cut his teeth in the divestment movement. It was only when he observed that professors who were vocal against divestment often received funding from the oil and gas industry that he realised how insidious these relationships can be. He sees it as only a matter of time before campaigns start to target research funding and the visibility of oil and gas companies on campus. “One of the amazing things about this whole story is that all this has happened without anyone really knowing about it,” Franta says. “When most people hear about this situation they’re pretty shocked by it. They think: ‘this doesn’t make sense – it’s like tobacco funding health research, there’s a clear conflict of interest here.’” Among academics, attitudes are conflicted. James Dyke, a visiting environmental sciences academic at Southampton University, is a staunch advocate of the need for radical action to slow down climate change. Yet he acknowledges the defences of fossil fuel relationships that some colleagues offer. These companies are aware of the significance of climate change, but the global economy would collapse if they stopped producing overnight. Equally, they plug serious gaps in research funding, without which some departments would be forced to close. “Universities should ideally be places to work with those companies to allow them to transform,” Dyke says. “Walking away and taking the moral high ground – ‘we won’t take your money’ - means cutting off what could be a critical player in the required transition.” The problem is that fossil fuel companies aren’t working towards the transition to a lower carbon economy in any meaningful way. According to Mat Hope, editor of environmental investigative journalism website DeSmog, much of the money from the oil and gas industry goes towards funding research that will help companies continue to operate in the North Sea region for many more years – by drilling in deeper and more treacherous waters, for example. “This is despite climate scientists explicitly stating that the industry will have to be rapidly shut down,” he says. Hope sees the support for universities from fossil fuel companies as part of a deliberate strategy to soften their image. “They are trying to become an integral part of the economics of higher education as a means to encourage a favourable tax environment, and ensure ongoing local and national government support for the industry,” he says. “All despite the UK’s climate commitments.”"
"George Monbiot’s observations (The Earth is in a death spiral. The only hope is radical action, 14 November) are well worth reading and thought-provoking. At one point he writes: “Academics, afraid to upset their funders, have bitten their lips.” There are exceptions. Keith Kahn-Harris’s book Denial: The Unspeakable Truth ought be compulsory reading for every university student of English, history and moral philosophy. He seems an academic who has definitely not bitten his lip, but sought to penetrate a fog of lies perpetuated by denialists: those who shout down and treat with contempt the historians and scientists who have sought the truth and presented us with their findings.  Climate change denialists dredge up countless explanations for floods and fires. Donald Trump blames “poor forest management” for the conflagrations in California that have killed many people.  Monbiot and Kahn-Harris ought to be on the reading lists of all of us who seek to understand truths about the planet that we share with fellow human beings, animals and plants.Penelope MaclachlanLondon • We applaud the Committee on Climate Change’s recommendations to shift land use from inefficient food production towards restoring forests and other climate-critical landscapes (Tree planting in UK ‘must double to tackle climate change’, 15 November).

"Eighty-five people have been arrested as thousands of demonstrators occupied five bridges in central London to voice their concern over the looming climate crisis. Protesters, including families and pensioners, began massing on five of London’s main bridges from 10am on Saturday. An hour later, all the crossings had been blocked in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the UK in decades. Some people locked themselves together, while others linked arms and sang songs. By 2pm the blockade of Southwark Bridge had been abandoned and protesters moved from there to Blackfriars Bridge, where organisers said they were soon to move west towards Westminster Bridge. Demonstrators occupied Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges. The Metropolitan police said all the bridges had since reopened  and that most of the arrests had been for obstruction under the Highways Act. Afterwards, demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square to hear speeches. Roger Hallam, one of the strategists behind the actions, told the Guardian he felt the protest had been fantastic. “This is total prediction stuff, mass participation civil disobedience,” he said. “They can’t do anything about it unless they start shooting people, and presumably they won’t do that.”  The day was due to end with an interfaith ceremony outside Westminster Abbey. The move is part of a campaign of mass civil disobedience organised by a new group, Extinction Rebellion, which wants to force governments to treat the threats of climate breakdown and extinction as a crisis. “The ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty and to rebel to defend life itself,” said Gail Bradbrook, one of the organisers. Alice, 19, from Bristol was one of those blocking Westminster Bridge. “I took the coach at 3am to make sure I didn’t miss it,” she said, “and I’m so glad that I did. It’s a tiny personal inconvenience and, having made it, I get to be part of a rebellion. “This moment will be remembered in the history books, when we finally stopped allowing our leaders to take us over the cliff.” Jenny Jones, the Green party peer, joined the protest on Westminster Bridge. She backed the nonviolent direct action taken by demonstrators. “We are at the point where if we don’t start acting and acting fast we are just going to wipe out our life support system,” she said. “It’s fine to think we are a rich country, the sixth biggest economy in the world, but actually we won’t do any better than anywhere else because climate change will massively affect us too. “Basically, conventional politics has failed us – it’s even failed me and I’m part of the system – so people have no other choice.”  Father Martin Newell said on Blackfriars Bridge: “What brought me here is the climate emergency, the extinction emergency and my faith in God who created all this and whose creation we’re destroying and crucifying … I’m called as a Christian to protect our neighbour who’s being abused.” In the past two weeks more than 60 people have been arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking major roads in the capital. However, those disruptions were eclipsed on Saturday, when organisers say 6,000 people took part in protests. “It is not a step we take lightly,” said Tiana Jacout, one of those involved. “If things continue as is, we face an extinction greater than the one that killed the dinosaurs. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a worthy ancestor.” Extinction Rebellion, which cites the civil rights movement, suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi as inspirations, said smaller events took place in other UK cities as well as overseas on Saturday. Organisers say they are planning to escalate the campaigns from Wednesday, when small teams of activists will “swarm” around central London blocking roads and bridges, bringing widespread disruption to the capital. “Given the scale of the ecological crisis we are facing this is the appropriate scale of expansion,” said Bradbrook. “Occupying the streets to bring about change as our ancestors have done before us. Only this kind of large-scale economic disruption can rapidly bring the government to the table to discuss our demands. We are prepared to risk it all for our futures.” The group is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. On top of the specific demands, organisers say they hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster. The group, which was established only a couple of months ago, has raised around £50k in small-scale donations in the past weeks. It now has offices in central London and over the past few months has been holding meetings across the country, outlining the scale of the climate crisis and urging people to get involved in direct action this weekend. “Local groups are setting up across the country and even new groups are seeing around 100 people come to meetings, and we have coaches coming, from Newcastle to Plymouth,” said Rupert Read, a philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia. The campaign hit the headlines a couple of weeks ago when the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was one of almost 100 academics to come out in favour of it. In a letter published in the Guardian they said: “While our academic perspectives and expertise may differ, we are united on this one point: we will not tolerate the failure of this or any other government to take robust and emergency action in respect of the worsening ecological crisis. The science is clear, the facts are incontrovertible, and it is unconscionable to us that our children and grandchildren should have to bear the terrifying brunt of an unprecedented disaster of our own making.” The civil disobedience comes amid growing evidence of looming climate breakdown and follows warnings from the UN that there are only 12 years left to prevent global ecological disaster. The group is also making international contacts, with 11 events planned in seven countries so far, including the US, Canada, Germany, Australia and France. “To properly challenge the system that is sending us to an early grave we have to be bold and ambitious,” said Read. “Forging new connections across the world and learning from each other.”"

"Fifty Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to adopt an ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions to net zero before 2050, to show international leadership on climate change and protect British jobs. Former ministers Damian Green, Oliver Letwin and Anna Soubry are among the signatories of the letter to the prime minister, which said that a stronger long-term goal would cut energy bills and improve air quality. The UK is committed to cut emissions by 80% by 2050. But the government recently asked its climate advisers to consider whether a deeper cut is needed in the light of a landmark UN report on the risks posed by global warming. Simon Clarke, the Brexiter Tory MP who organised the letter, said: “By setting a net-zero target before 2050 we can ensure the UK is at the forefront of the zero-carbon technological revolution whilst cementing our status as a global climate leader.” More than 160 MPs have signed the plea to May, including from Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party. Organisers hope to get 100 Tory MPs signed up by the time the government’s advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, reports back next spring. Meeting a goal of net-zero emissions before 2050 would require far-reaching changes beyond those already under way in energy, buildings and transport. But the letter’s signatories argue it would put the UK “at the forefront of the race for investment in clean industries”, and build on a history of “British ingenuity” in science and engineering. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, used his conference speech in September to commit the party to a target of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. The letter calls for the goal to be met before 2050 but there is no agreed date – WWF said this week that 2045 was possible. The intervention comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the Climate Change Act receiving royal assent on Monday, the same day the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is due to publish a major report on how global warming will affect the UK."
"Bill Shorten has unveiled a $15bn program for driving the transformation in Australia’s energy system to low-emissions sources, declaring climate change is no longer an emergency, “it’s a disaster”. The Labor leader unveiled the energy policy reboot on Thursday, repeating an invitation for the Coalition to embrace the national energy guarantee it ditched during the August leadership implosion but also outlining a detailed alternative in the event the pitch for bipartisanship is ultimately rebuffed. Shorten committed to topping up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the tune of $10bn and unveiled a new $5bn fund to modernise ageing transmission infrastructure – the ramparts of a 10-year plan to boost the share of renewable energy in the grid and retire coal generation. The funding is off-budget and does not hit the bottom line. The Labor leader said he would use the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan as the basis for transforming the energy system, with a Shorten government playing a hands-on role creating renewable energy zones, investing in new generation and transmission infrastructure and also in firming technologies, like batteries and gas peaking plants. Shorten said if he wins the next federal election, the government will fund the transformation through concessional loans, equity and contract-for-difference auction schemes that are already used in some Australian states, and internationally. The Labor leader said potential projects to be underwritten or funded included upgrades to interconnectors, a second connection across Bass Strait assisting Tasmania’s “battery of the nation” project and Snowy 2.0. He said he was also interested in new gas pipeline networks for northern Australia. Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target across the economy of 45% and aims to have renewables achieve a 50% share of the electricity market by 2030. Eight coal-fired power stations are set to close over the next two decades because they have reached the end of their operating life, and Labor’s higher emissions reduction target will drive a faster rationalisation. Shorten unveiled a coal transition plan on Thursday, including a $10m training fund to skill workers in the coal-fired power sector to work in renewable energy, overseen by a Just Transition Authority coordinating the eventual plant closures. There will also be enhanced industrial relations arrangements for displaced coal workers. Labor will insist that power plant operators and coalmine operators participate in pooled redundancy schemes to ensure workers are given offers of employment at a nearby power station or coalmine, subject to enough positions being created. Shorten said the objective of the plan was to build the essential energy infrastructure to power industry and manufacturing, while helping households cut their power bills with more renewables and storage. He said too much time had been lost in the climate and energy wars of the past decade and governments needed to act, not only to safeguard communities against the impact of global warming but also create the industries of the future. “We will only achieve this if we move now,” Shorten said. “You only get one chance to get in on the ground floor. If the politics of the nation gets bogged down for another three or four years of infighting, of inertia … the moment will be missed. “The world is very unforgiving for nations who do not take the opportunities that are presented to them.” Shorten said plans for direct investment in the energy network could “not be hostage to the climate sceptics in the parliament”. “We will act to bring down power prices and to boost these new blue-collar and green-collar industries. And, in a time of rapid economic and industrial change and disruption, only Labor will make it a priority to help workers and communities affected adapt to the transition.” The Coalition on Thursday rebuffed the overture on bipartisanship and limbered up for another election fight over climate and energy policy. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, declared the government would never adopt an emissions reduction target of 45% “and we would never adopt the targets”. Taylor said Labor needed to explain the practical effect of a 45% emissions reduction target in an energy intensive economy like Australia. “If Labor is committed to those targets, they need to explain which businesses are going out of business in Australia,” he said. “They need to explain which cattle, how many cattle are going to go. They need to explain which aluminium smelters and refineries are going to shut. They need to explain which fertiliser factories, which cement factories are going to shut. “The truth is that these targets, these reckless targets, will be a wrecking ball through the economy. We won’t stand for it.”"

"A record slow freeze of many regions of the Arctic this winter is making it harder for pregnant polar bears to find birthing dens. The delayed formation of sea ice during autumn has worried biologists, who fear a first “extirpation event” – the local extinction of a species – may be approaching faster than forecast for the most affected populations. The waters around Svalbard, an archipelago between Norway and the North Pole, have a little over half the average area of ice for this time of year. According to the Norwegian Ice Service, the 172,291 sq km (66,522 sq m) of ice on 14 November was the lowest for this time of year since records began in 1967. October also saw a huge departure from previous trends, particularly in the Barents Sea, which had freakishly warm weather in February and August. Scientists say these shifts, which are caused by the manmade heating of the globe, are disrupting the behaviour of species that depend on thick winter ice, such as narwhals, seals, belugas and polar bears. “We’re restructuring a whole ecosystem. Sea ice is to the Arctic what soil is to the forest. Without sea ice we’ll still have an ecosystem but it won’t include polar bears & many other species,” tweeted the scientist Andrew Derocher, who has studied the bears for 35 years. “It’s sounds like a broken record, reporting record-breaking low sea ice cover in Svalbard. This area has warmed dramatically in recent years. Polar bears here may be the first extirpation event,” he wrote, though he noted that so far the problem was restricted to habitat loss. One of 19 polar bear populations in the Arctic, Svalbard has close to 2,500 individual bears. This number has been stable for the past 15 years, but pressures are growing. Because of the delay in ice formation, bears have to wait longer to hunt for seals, which means they are missing out on an autumn feeding season that is important for them to build up fat. A recent study showed bears survived previous warm periods by gorging on beached whales, but this was unlikely to be enough to cope with the current pace of climate change. Although there has been some ice formation in recent days, it was still the second lowest on record on Thursday. The most immediate concern is for pregnant females, who normally travel across the ice at this time to make maternity dens on Hopen and other islands that are important for reproduction, said Jon Aars of the Norwegian Polar Institute. “Unless sea ice forms within the next few weeks, pregnant females will have to swim,” he said, noting this uses five times as much energy and runs down fat reserves that are important for producing milk and raising cubs. Previous research in other Arctic regions have shown that pregnant females declined in weight and litter sizes went down from 1.8 to 1.6 between 1993 and 2017. Aars said if current climate trends continued bears would struggle, although it was hard to say when the tipping point would be. “In 2000, we didn’t foresee that Svalbard would be ice-free at this time of the year,” he said. “If this continues, there’ll be a threshold where it will be hard for the bears to reproduce. Things can happen fast. I’m not optimistic about whether the bears will survive. If the sea ice disappears, then so will the bears.” An ice-free Arctic is forecast by about 2040."

"Millions of gas boilers will need to be replaced with hydrogen alternatives and coupled with electric heating devices if Britain is to hit its carbon targets at the lowest cost, according to the government’s climate advisers. In a report on the role hydrogen could play in the energy system, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) spelt out the huge but necessary cost the country faces to switch to green heating.  The cheapest scenario, it said, is a mix of electrifying heating and fitting hydrogen boilers, and will cost the UK £28bn a year, or 0.7% of GDP, by 2050. While electricity supplies are rapidly switching to low-carbon sources, almost all homes today rely on fossil fuels – predominantly natural gas – for heating and cooking. The public is largely unaware of the alternatives, said the report, and consumer understanding is “far from where it would need to be” before decisions on decarbonising heating are made in the 2020s. While householders can keep their radiators, the CCC envisages that in future they will need to live in much more energy efficient homes with heat pumps that use electricity to draw heat from the ground or air, running alongside gas boilers. Air-source heat pumps cost about £6,000-£7,000 but are expected to become cheaper as they become more mainstream. To meet the long-term goal of cutting carbon emissions 80% by 2050, gas boilers would eventually need to be replaced by hydrogen ones that provide backup heating at times. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said the committee had previously been a “bit suspicious” of heat pumps but was now confident enough to recommend their rollout as a hybrid heating measure running alongside gas boilers, before a later move to hydrogen too. “I’ve been cautious about the hydrogen story, because it’s often portrayed as a panacea. [But] I’ve been surprised how well it’s come out of our modelling when it’s accompanied by energy efficiency and electrification from heat pumps,” he said. Stark urged the government to set out its plan for decarbonising heat in the next three years. The report said while ministers may have “a strong temptation politically to ‘kick the can down the road’ by sticking with natural gas for longer”, it would be cheaper and better to act sooner. Despite the high costs of decarbonising heating, the CCC believes the total consumers spend on energy bills could stay similar to today, as it expects electricity prices to fall as more is sourced from wind, solar and nuclear, and costs of running a car to become cheaper owing to the switch to electric vehicles. Stark said he was now more optimistic about hydrogen, and that it offered “something in the long-term that we need”. But the CCC said producing hydrogen in a low-carbon way would be a big challenge. Today the vast majority is made from natural gas and is high carbon, but in the future that production would need to involve carbon capture and storage. Producing the hydrogen in bulk using renewable electricity generation and electrolysis was considered “unnecessarily expensive”, said the CCC. It added that evidence showed the use of hydrogen would be increasingly important to cut carbon emissions from industrial processes, such as in furnaces and kilns."
"The main greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change have all reached record levels, the UN’s meteorology experts have reported. Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are now far above pre-industrial levels, with no sign of a reversal of the upward trend, a World Meteorological Organization report says.  “The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5m years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,” said the WMO secretary general, Petteri Taalas. “The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed.” Levels of CO2 rose to a global average of 405.5 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2017 – almost 50% higher than before the industrial revolution. Levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 17% of global warming are now 2.5 times higher than pre-industrial times owing to emissions from cattle, rice paddies and leaks from oil and gas wells. Nitrous oxide, which also warms the planet and destroys the Earth’s protective ozone layer, is now over 20% higher than pre-industrial levels. About 40% of N2O comes from human activities including soil degradation, fertiliser use and industry. The WMO also highlighted the discovery of illicit production of CFC-11, a banned chemical that also both warms the planet and destroys ozone. Investigations indicate that at least some of the production is in China. In October the world’s scientists said global warming of even 1.5C would have severe consequences for humanity. International climate agreements had for two decades set 2C as a limit. “Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,” said the WMO deputy secretary general, Elena Manaenkova. “CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.” Prof Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, said she was not surprised by the new record levels of greenhouse gases. “But I am very concerned that all three gases most responsible for climate change are rising upwards unabated. It seems the urgency and extent of the actions needed to address climate change have not sunk in. “Low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric transport need to become mainstream, with old-fashioned polluting fossils pushed out rapidly.” Efforts to cut emissions are increasing and on Wednesday the UN’s climate change body published a report on the commitments made in 2018. It found 9,000 cities in 128 countries were taking action, along with 240 states and regions in 40 countries and more than 6,000 businesses in 120 countries. Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “On one hand, greenhouse gas emissions have yet to peak and countries struggle to maintain the concentrated attention and effort needed for a successful response to climate change. On the other hand, climate action is occurring, it is increasing and there is a will to do more. I highlight this because falling into despair and hopelessness is a danger equal to complacency, none of which we can afford.”• This article was corrected on 22 November 2018. An earlier version said that at an average of 405.5 parts per million CO2 levels in recent times were two-and-a-half times higher than before the industrial revolution, and that methane levels were 3.5 times higher. Nitrous oxide levels were said to be at more than double pre-industrial levels."

"The National Trust has invested tens of millions of pounds in oil, gas and mining firms – despite the conservation charity pledging to cut down its own use of fossil fuels and warning about the impact of climate change. An investigation by the Guardian has found that the trust – which aims to “nurse the environment back to health” – has more than £30m of investments in oil, gas and mining companies, including BP and Shell, held indirectly via a portfolio fund.  The trust has vowed to decrease its own use of fossil fuels across its estates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in response to climate change, aiming to generate 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Hilary McGrady, the director-general of the trust, which has more than five million members and 61,000 volunteers, has previously said: “We are playing our part by ensuring we reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and at every property we are constantly looking at ways to seek out energy efficiencies.” A 2015 report by the trust warned: “It is abundantly clear to us from across the breadth of places we look after that the impacts of climate change are already increasing, and are a worrying threat to the fragile and venerable places of natural and historic importance that we care for.” The trust also opposes fracking, not allowing it on its 248,000 hectares of land, “because natural gas is a fossil gas”. However, it has millions of pounds invested through the fund in BP and Shell, both of which have fracking operations. In July, BP invested $10.5bn buying US shale assets from the mining company BHP Billiton. Fracking, which involves drilling into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is used to break shale rock and release oil or gas, is highly controversial because of concerns over its environmental impact. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, has urged the trust to divest from fossil fuels. She said: “It’s disappointing to see a charity so dedicated to protecting our natural heritage undermining its good work with significant support for dirty fossil fuels. We are living through climate breakdown and ecological collapse – every organisation with money to invest must stop funding environmental destruction. “I’ve been working to persuade parliament to stop investing MPs’ pensions in fossil fuels for years, so I understand this is an uphill battle – but environmental charities should be leading the way. The National Trust must urgently set out a clear path to divesting these funds and supporting firms that make a positive contribution to society instead.” Mary Creagh, the Labour MP for Wakefield who chairs the environmental audit select committee, said: “Members of the National Trust will be shocked to learn about the scale of the charity’s investments in fossil fuels. My committee has highlighted the financial risks from climate change, and called on large companies to report on their exposure to climate risk. “National Trust must ‘green check’ its investments, and invest in the low-carbon and sustainable technologies of tomorrow.” The trust’s 2018 accounts show that it has £166.7m invested in Legal & General Investment Management’s CAF UK Equitrack Fund, up from £164.9m in 2017. As of July, the fund invested 8.89% of its portfolio in Royal Dutch Shell shares and 4.47% in BP. In addition, the fund has holdings in mining firms including 1.93% of the portfolio in Rio Tinto, 1.53% in Glencore and 1.44% in BHP Billiton. With at least 18.2% of the fund’s portfolio invested in oil, gas and mining firms, it means the trust indirectly invests in them to the tune of £30.3m. In 2010, BP was responsible for the worst environmental disaster in US history when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, killing 11 people. A US judge ruled that BP was “grossly negligent” in the lead-up to the spill, in which an estimated 4.9m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf. Earlier this year it was reported that BP was nearing the end of paying out $65bn (£50.6bn) in compensation. The trust looks after 780 miles of coastline, and more than 500 historic sites including houses, castles, ancient monuments, gardens, parks and nature reserves, as well as the land. It has an investment pool of £1.3bn, meaning the Legal & General fund accounts for roughly 13% of the total. In 2015, the charity said it was reviewing its investments in fossil fuels. A National Trust spokesman said: “It’s important to clarify we do not invest in the ‘fossil fuels and mining’ companies, but in the CAF UK Equitrack Fund, which is a UK equity index tracking fund run for charities. “We adopt a policy of not investing directly in companies which derive more than 10% of their turnover from the extraction of thermal coal or oil from oil sands. We also engage with companies to improve their environmental performance and see our role as one of actively influencing behaviour and driving environmental improvements.” • The headline on this article was amended on 19 November 2018 to more accurately reflect the story."
"Climate activists have caused serious disruption to rush-hour traffic in London with a series of “swarming” roadblocks at several different locations around the capital as police warned motorists that more protests were expected. From 8am on Wednesday groups of protesters coordinated by the group Extinction Rebellion walked on to roads in Westminster, Tower Bridge, Elephant and Castle, and Earl’s Court, blocking traffic for several minutes at a time in a plan to bring gridlock to the city. The Metropolitan police said that protests could continue until Saturday and advised against driving into the city. The Met also warned people that attempting to drive through the demonstrations was “very dangerous and illegal”. On the 22-24 Nov, there will be protests across London that may result in delays to your journey. We advise not to travel by car or motorbike. If you do drive into London please note attempting to drive through protestors in the road is very dangerous and illegal A spokesperson for Transport for London said Wednesday’s protests had caused serious disruption to traffic and buses. The action was met by an ambivalent response from some members of the public on their way to work, but others said they backed the demonstrations. The protests are part of a campaign of mass civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion, which wants to force governments to treat the threats of climate change and species extinction as a crisis. As traffic began to back up around London, the group sent a letter to the business secretary, Greg Clark, outlining their demands. “We are writing to let you know that we intend to continue our support for rebellion against the UK government,” their letter said. “We would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience to work out ways in which you can exercise your responsibility as secretary of state to protect the ecosystems and people of this country.” Ronan McNern, a protest organiser and a signatory to the letter, said the plan was to cause as much disruption as possible with the smallest numbers. “The lights go red, they go into and sit down in the road, wait seven minutes,” he said. “If anybody needs to get past, we’ll let them through. Come off after seven minutes, take a break, let the angry drivers at the front go, then the light goes red and you go on again. “This is about causing economic disruption by slowing things down, bringing things to a gridlock. This is an experiment, really. I think that’s the most important word.” The Guardian met one group of about 35 protesters by the statue of Nelson Mandela at Parliament Square at 7am, then followed the group as they walked to the south end of Lambeth Bridge, the site of one of central London’s busiest junctions. Just before 8am they walked out into the road, chanting and carrying banners and placards. Traffic was soon backed up far down Albert Embankment, Lambeth Palace Road and Lambeth Road, as motorists found the way over the Thames blocked. Cars sounded their horns and one driver got out to remonstrate with police monitoring the protesters. Officers told him to be patient. Another passerby, who asked police why they could not clear the roadblock, was told the activists had a right to protest. “You’re part of the problem and all,” he shouted back at them. Demonstrators then moved on to Vauxhall Bridge and then Victoria Street, where they continued their rolling blockades. They allowed cyclists and emergency vehicles with blue lights to go past. At one point the comedian Jim Davidson became caught up in the demonstration and got out of his car to remonstrate with police for not forcing the protesters to move. Jim Davidson was stuck at the front - got out of his car shouted at the Police “Why aren’t you moving them?” - when a protestor tried to talk to him he said he didn’t talk to lefties. One gag: “Climate change ? Don’t they like being warmer!!” . pic.twitter.com/tOyNikdcvG James Page, 46, a decorator who stopped to watch a blockade close to Victoria, said he “couldn’t give a damn” about climate change. “It [the climate] all balances out,” he said. “It’s shown from time it balances itself out. It’s not something I would be bothered about anyway.” At Elephant and Castle, a major junction linking south London to the City financial district, protesters’ numbers were bolstered after lunch by the arrival of several dozen students from the nearby London College of Communication. With the #extinctionrebellion #Swarming protest in Elephant and Castle now, where numbers have been bolstered by students from South Bank Uni pic.twitter.com/Y0ZlmJJhb9 One student, Renee, 18, who declined to give her surname, said the protest was “incredibly impactful”. “It’s supporting issues that are very prevalent nowadays that people should know about. I don’t know if it’s the right way to do protest, but at the end of the day it has an effect.” Her friend, Ekene, 18, worried that the methods might alienate people, “so then obviously when they see the cause, they are going to associate it with anger. So I’m not sure if it’s the best way.” Nonetheless, both said they would join the next Extinction Rebellion protest, planned for Saturday. ""I don't know if it's the best way to do protest, but at the end of the day it has an effect."" Ekene, left, and Renee, right, students at London College of Communication, say they will attend #ExtinctionRebellion's next big protest on Saturday after #Swarming in Elephant pic.twitter.com/iQCB7MhvjZ Dr Larch Maxey, who was helping to coordinate the Elephant and Castle protest, said: “These students have just heard about it and jumped in, and this is what our movement is doing. “I’ve been on marches for decades about this. We’ve had massive marches and they’ve just been ignored. But you cannot ignore people shutting down the city.” As in Westminster, police facilitated the protest and tried to assuage the anger of motorists. Howard Rees, an organiser, said the actions had been a success. “Quite a lot of extra people have joined over the course of the day, because they’ve seen what’s going on on social media. We’ve got more people on board, and hopefully they will come along tomorrow.” A spokesperson for Transport for London initially said there had been significant disruption during rush hour, but later retreated from that assessment. “The demonstrators were blocking traffic, causing delays to roads and buses in the areas of protest,” the spokesperson said. “The delays are now clearing.” McNern added: “Three weeks ago no one knew the name Extinction Rebellion, then there was the declaration [of rebellion], there was the week of action, there was 6,000 people [on the bridges through central London on Saturday].” On Saturday, 82 protesters were arrested after occupying Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges, in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience seen in the UK in decades. In the previous two weeks, police arrested more than 60 activists for taking part in acts of civil disobedience, ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking roads. Many activists were arrested more than once. McNern said all the activists were willing to be arrested. “So it’s very different from when you are dealing with people who are scared of being arrested.” He said the group had told the police of their plans and they were willing to abandon any blockade that hampered the movement of emergency vehicles. Organisers say they hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate change and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster."
"Twenty years ago politicians who spoke about climate change talked about their duty to solve the problem for the sake of our grandchildren. With too little action since, Europe’s previously benign weather is getting less predictable and more dangerous. Europeans expecting to live another 30 years will see life get a lot more uncomfortable as a result. On current projections the global temperature will have risen to about 2C over pre-industrial levels by about 2050. The latest research from the European Commission predicts that unchecked carbon emissions will cause an extra 132,000 heat fatalities a year, a loss in food production, water shortages and droughts, particularly in southern Europe.  For the UK the warnings are about serious coastal flooding, with a five-fold increase in damage. Heavier rain will cause three times as many people to be affected by river flooding. Apart from the obvious disruption caused by floods, fires and other extreme events the economic consequences are also severe, with a 10 to 15% loss in productivity as it is impossible to work in extreme heat. The scientists say their predictions are probably underestimates and that politicians seem unprepared for the consequences. At this rate our current politicians’ grandchildren will be lucky to survive to old age. "
"In February last year, a week after Donald Trump had signed an anti-abortion executive order surrounded by seven men, Isabella Lövin posted a photograph of herself on Twitter signing a climate change bill alongside seven other women. Sweden’s then deputy prime minister remained enigmatic as the picture went viral and she was asked whether she had been “trolling” the US president. “It is up to the observer to interpret the photo,” she was quoted as saying. “We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo.”  The image made headlines around the world and, nearly two years on, is still what Lövin is best known for internationally. But the Swedish Green party leader and minister for international development is no mere social media politician. During her party’s historic first period in government she relentlessly pushed through an exhausting list of more than 50 policies, including a flight tax, the so-called Swedish Proposal, which tripled the price of EU emissions credits, and the carbon law she was signing in the picture that went viral. Lövin is one of the leading figures in what she says is a resurgence in environmentally conscious politics across the continent. “There is a green wave going on in Europe, in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, and in Finland as well,” she says. “I’m convinced that green parties offer a positive vision, and also the willingness to take on the huge challenges that we see in the world right now.” The slogan on her Twitter profile, “The climate can’t wait”, sums up the Lövin approach. “We’ve been very focused on results, and many of these issues have beenfundamental, long-term policies,” she says, sitting in her office in Sweden’s foreign ministry. “To work seriously on changing policies and setting long-term targets, and forming majorities and doing agreements with other parties, those things don’t pay off very easily in PR strategies.” It’s the same single-mindedness she as shown ever since bursting into public life 10 years ago following the 2007 publication of Silent Seas – The Fish Race to the Bottom, a rigorously researched, dramatic exposé of the crisis in global fisheries. “It totally changed my life,” she says of the book, published when she was 44. “But what really changed my life was the decision to write the book. I felt such a huge anxiety and anger about what we’re doing to our planet, and specifically when I understood the issue of overfishing – because we’re actually destroying our oceans with our eyes open.” I decided ... I will try to write about this topic, and then at least I’ve tried’.” The book was a sensation, winning Sweden’s two main journalism prizes, and launching a process which saw Lövin sent to Brussels as an MEP by the Green party with a single mission: to push through reform of fisheries policies. When I ask if she succeeded, she laughs. “Quite modestly I have to say ‘yes’. I was there for five years and we managed to get a majority in the European parliament to ban shark finning, overfishing and discarding fish, and to bring in a new common fisheries policy that sets the target that we must have sustainable fish stocks by 2020.” There’s a section in the book when she considers rescuing a dogfish, still alive at a fish auction, and releasing it into the sea. But she bristles when I ask if she sees herself as an eco-warrior. “No, no, no. Never. For me, it was extremely important to really do the research and see the facts,” she says. “I see the environmental challenges that we have now, they are existential. It’s that serious. It’s not just being like an image, that you’re an eco-warrior or whatever. This is really happening now.” That is why, when the Swedish Green party formed a coalition with the Social Democrats in 2014, Lövin took the next step and joined the national government, first as minister for international development cooperation, then, when her colleague Åsa Romson resigned, as deputy prime minister and climate minister. “It was tough for me personally,” she says. “But I felt if I don’t do this, I might regret for the rest of my life I didn’t try to do something about the problems I saw.” Government has also been a bruising experience for the party, particularly at the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, when a dramatic tightening of immigration policy was followed by a failure to stop Vattenfall, the state power company,selling, rather than shutting down, its German coal mines. “One of the mistakes we made … was maybe to say that we would succeed in certain issues where it wasn’t possible, and that has haunted us,” she says, of the coal debacle. As a result, the party lost roughly half of its 20,000 members, and then, in September’s election, a third of its seats. The party says, however, it always knew that power would come at a heavy price, and had aimed only to stay above the 4% threshold needed to keep its place in parliament. “It’s been a long-term strategy for the Swedish Greens to come into government and really take responsibility,” says Lövin. “We managed to do that and not be destroyed in the process.” The Greens may yet have a role in the future Swedish government. Coalition talks have failed to lead anywhere and, last week, Annie Lööf, the leader of the minority Centre party, failed to form a government, the second such doomed attempt. Lövin believes her party is now in a strong position and could find a place in coalitions dominated by the centre-right Alliance bloc or the Social Democrats, whose leader, Stefan Löfven, was on Friday announced as the next person to be put forward to parliament as prime minister. “It’s difficult to exclude any possibility at this point,” she says. “The Green party has been mentioned now as a very interesting partner for the more liberal rightwing parties, and of course we’re also included in what most people think would be a Social Democratic or more centre government.” While some other party leaders have spent the last two months locked in coalition talks, Lövin has instead been busy serving as a minister in the transitional government, leading preparations for next month’s Katowice Climate Change Conference. “I hope to be there,” she says. “I’m very concerned, actually, because with the Paris Agreement, everyone was very happy that we got to get an agreement, but now the logic of the climate negotiations is back to where it was before Paris, with the poor counties, including China and India, blaming the richer countries for what’s happening.” Lövin’s press secretary then chips in to warn her that it’s time for her next appointment, but she has one more thing she wants to say. “I think one of the most important things for all democracies around the world to contemplate is how we are going to develop and protect democracy when voters are so impatient and learn their news from social media, which can be very biased.” A viral tweet such as hers may get through to hundreds of thousands of people with a simple message about how wrong it is for a White House full of men to sign orders that affect women’s bodies and lives. It cannot, however, communicate more complicated, nuanced information. “The understanding of long processes, which is, very necessary if you are going to have a democracy, not a dictatorship, is very low,” she says. “I think just staying on very superficial messages and going with a populist movement is totally the opposite of what a green party should be.”"
"Controversial plans to import liquefied natural gas into Australia to fill a shortfall as domestic gas is exported to Asia would significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions, AGL has conceded. Energy companies have proposed four LNG import terminals for the east coast to ensure gas supply and ease high prices. The imported natural gas would effectively replace the two-thirds of gas sold overseas from export plants in Queensland. One of the most advanced is proposed by AGL Energy, which wants to park a floating plant in Victoria’s Western Port Bay and connect it to the state’s gas network via a high-pressure pipeline. In an email to conservation group Environment Victoria seen by Guardian Australia, AGL said it could lead to a 20% increase in emissions compared with the same amount of gas extracted and used in Australia due to additional production, processing and transport of the LNG. Some of that increase would be counted as part of Australia’s emissions, and some in the country where the gas originated.  AGL said the project was critical to cutting emissions from the energy system as it would lead to coal plants, with higher emissions, being replaced by new renewable energy projects firmed by flexible gas plants that could be called on when required. “A marginal increase in the carbon intensity of the gas used to firm up new renewable energy projects does not materially impact the significant carbon savings achieved by replacing retiring coal plants in this way,” AGL senior manager for project engagement, Kelly Parkinson, said. There’s no scenario where [importing gas is] in the public interest or a good outcome for the environment. But Environment Victoria chief executive, Mark Wakeham, said the idea Australia needed to import gas to have a clean energy transition was ridiculous and outdated. He said the rise of renewable energy meant the country was already burning eight terawatt hours’ less gas to generate electricity than five years ago. Several coal-fired power plants having closed in that time. “There’s no doubt companies like AGL might be able to make some money importing gas, but there’s no scenario where that’s in the public interest or a good outcome for the environment,” Wakeham said. The dispute calls into question the idea that gas should be considered “cleaner” energy, the descriptor used by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), which represents the LNG industry. In a recent submission to the Climate Change Authority, Appea said emissions from LNG were on average about half those from coal across its full life cycle, which includes extraction, processing, shipping, piping and burning for energy. An accompanying graphic suggested they were 39% lower. Opponents to gas industry expansion, including Environment Victoria, said further investment in the fossil fuel made little sense on environmental or economic grounds as it was more expensive than genuinely clean alternatives – solar or wind energy backed by batteries or pumped hydroelectricity. They said Australia could meet current domestic gas needs at electricity plants, for heating and cooking and as a feedstock for some industrial processes from existing developments, if there was a domestic reservation policy that limited the proportion sold to Japan and China. AGL’s proposal for a floating storage and regasification plant at Crib Point to operate from 2021 is before the Victorian government, which last month said it would have to undergo a full environmental effects inquiry. Some ministers have expressed support for the project. The company said it would make gas supply more certain, reduce the urgency to open more gas fields and put downward pressure on wholesale prices by increasing competition.  Analysts at Macquarie Bank disagree on the last point, finding importing LNG would not lower prices in Victoria and NSW due to the additional cost of processing and new infrastructure. But they said it seemed inevitable at least one terminal would be built to meet demand. The other relatively advanced proposal for an LNG import terminal is by Australian Industrial Energy at Port Kembla. Proposals by ExxonMobil in Gippsland and Venice Energy in Port Adelaide are at an earlier stage. Australia’s LNG industry has expanded rapidly since 2012 to be the world’s second largest. It is expected its value will reach $48bn and it will be responsible for 7% of national emissions by 2020, effectively wiping out the emissions saved from the renewable energy target. Gas bills on Australia’s east coast have skyrocketed as the export industry sucked up most of the available gas to sell at higher prices on international markets. Victoria uses 36% of the gas on the east coast, more than any other state. The state government is considering AGL’s proposal to import gas but has blocked further onshore gas exploration and development. It has a moratorium on conventional onshore gas exploration until 2020 and an outright ban on unconventional gas projects that involve fracking. With the state facing an election on Saturday, premier Daniel Andrews last week pledged to put the fracking ban in the state’s constitution if re-elected. Most analysts said there was no evidence Victoria has a significant onshore gas resource."
"On Saturday, at about 12.30pm, I was arrested for obstructing (thoughtfully sitting on) a public highway, namely Lambeth Bridge. I wasn’t alone. In fact, Lambeth wasn’t the only obstructed London bridge: thousands of people of diverse backgrounds and ages occupied five central London bridges for most of 17 November: Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth. I believe that at least 80 other people were arrested. Climate is increasingly becoming one of the key subjects for artists as they hold their mirror up to society I am adding my support to Extinction Rebellion – a relatively new activist movement aimed at waking up the political system to the truth about the way that humans are responsible for a dramatic change in the world’s ecosystem. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) published its latest reports in October, which state that human activity is “likely” to push the average global surface temperature above 1.5C between the years 2030 and 2052. I’m planning on being around for both of these dates, but the problem seems to be that the warmer the planet gets, the faster the pace of climatic changes such as melting ice caps. This changes sea levels and currents, and results in less heat reflection from the lovely white caps – so the temperature goes up. This new heat releases the proverbial “methane dragon” currently partially trapped under the (melting) tundra ice. More frequent climate disasters are already happening across the globe, and these seem set to only increase. The international art world, to which I’m attached, requires the traffic of heavy art objects all over the globe – the cultural ebb and flow of images and ideas certainly has a huge carbon footprint. So I guess direct action is needed in this area too. And climate is increasingly becoming one of the key subjects for artists as they hold their mirrors up to society. We can get together to solve this, and every person has a moral imperative to be a part of the movement. Having myself arrested was like laying down a marker; an action that enables a quiet but resonant solidarity with those who want to see our government and the media wake up to the incontrovertible evidence that humans do have to deal with the issue of their effect on the climate … and can this start to happen ASAP, please? • Gavin Turk is an artist"
"Dozens of campaigners blocked the roads around Parliament Square to highlight concerns about the environment on Saturday. About 50 activists from Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has been coordinating a campaign of civil disobedience which has brought areas of the capital to a standstill in recent weeks, risked arrest by standing defiantly in roads in front of queueing traffic. An estimated 1,000 more demonstrators, many clad in black clothing, massed on the green in Parliament Square for what organisers labelled a “memorial service” to mourn the loss of life on the planet. Many waved banners emblazoned with slogans including “System change, not climate change” and “Rebel for life” as they listened to speeches. One older woman superglued her hands to a railing outside Buckingham Palace in protest. Scotland Yard confirmed that 14 protesters had been arrested for criminal damage during the day. Campaigners said the protest, named “Rebellion Day 2”, aimed to highlight “the government’s failure to recognise and act on the ecological and climate emergency”. It follows similar events last weekend, when 82 people were arrested following staged sit-ins on five bridges crossing the Thames. Among the campaigners blocking four roads entering Parliament Square on Saturday was Nicki Myers, 45, from Cambridge. Myers, who uses a wheelchair and suffers from the lung condition pulmonary fibrosis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, said she was prepared to be arrested in the attempt to raise awareness about the environment. Sitting in front of traffic and clutching a banner with the slogan “Rebel for life cos we can’t breathe”, she said: “I’m mostly here for my granddaughter, Isabel. I’m terrified about of the prospect of society breakdown in her lifetime. I want the government to tell the truth and do something.” She said she was ready to be arrested to bring about a change in policy “if that’s what it takes”, adding: “I’ve never done anything like this before. It’s quite scary.” Lying down in the road nearby with his head resting on a backpack, 82-year-old protester Phil Kingston said he too was prepared to be arrested in the name of raising awareness for the environment. The pensioner, a retired university lecturer, said he had been arrested three times during Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in the past fortnight. “I have four grandchildren and nothing is more important to me than their security,” he said. “And that security is being eroded all the time by an economy that is pumping fossil fuels in the air when already we are heading for disaster. I’m not accepting it. I don’t mind going to prison.” A young woman called Zappi, who did not wish to give her second name, also said she was willing to be arrested despite acknowledging the potential for it to harm her future prospects. The student, holding one end of a large sign reading, “Tell the truth”, said: “I feel like getting arrested is very small compared to the fact that potentially we could destroy our planet.” Helen, 43, travelled from Ipswich with her four-year-old daughter, Lucy, to join the demonstration for the day. Sitting on a blanket in Parliament Square, the court transcriber said: “The truth is that the world is collapsing environmentally. The state of the world has become serious. The government seem almost insane in the way they are completely ignoring it. I’d like to see them treating it like it’s an emergency.” A second world war memorial in Whitehall, honouring the work of women during the conflict, was graffitied during the protest. Other campaigners later rubbed off the spray-painted message, which read “MOTHER”. Scotland Yard confirmed that a suspect had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage in relation to the graffiti. The 6.7-metre (22ft) bronze sculpture, which cost £1.3m, was unveiled by the Queen in 2005 to pay tribute to the millions of women who contributed to the war effort. After spotting the graffitied war memorial, campaigner Catherine Jones rushed to a local shop to buy nail polish remover and cotton pads to clean it off. The hospital worker, who helps run arts activities for patients, told the Guardian she did not want the graffiti to detract from the message of the day. Jones, who brought her one-year-old daughter, Louise, to the demonstration, added that she did not agree with the graffiti. “I just don’t like it. It’s not helpful,” she said. “I think the day should be remembered by the performing element of it, which I thought was phenomenal. The message is strong. Yes, we are going to disrupt the traffic and yes, we are meant to get people a little bit annoyed at it.” Activists were also spotted daubing graffiti on the road outside Downing Street. During the protest, campaigners carried a mock coffin in a funeral-style procession and took part in a mass sit-down protest for around 10 minutes outside the gates of Downing Street, chanting: “Climate justice, when do we want it? Now.” Several protesters also lay down in front of the gates."
"France is pushing the UK to incorporate future European climate change directives into law automatically in return for an ambitious trade deal with the EU. A large number of member states fear that the UK could enjoy an economic advantage after Brexit if it were able to diverge from European laws and regulations, and they want to use their leverage now to force a commitment from future British governments. The demand by Emmanuel Macron for the UK to be tied into the EU’s Paris 2030 targets was just one of a series of interventions made by member states during recent meetings with Michel Barnier and his negotiating team. While a UK withdrawal agreement dealing with citizens’ rights, the £39bn financial settlement and the Irish border have been agreed in principle, the political declaration on the future relationship is yet to be finalised. A seven-page declaration published last week is set to become a much heavier document after member states made a series of interventions in meetings with the European commission for additional text. One EU diplomat said: “It’s a Christmas tree and all the member states are putting their baubles on it.” Olly Robbins, Downing Street’s Brexit adviser, was in Brussels this weekend for meetings with the commission. On Sunday, ambassadors for the 27 member states are to meet Barnier to discuss the text. Negotiations will have to be completed when ministers for the 27 meet on Monday, with a draft due to be made public on Tuesday. Downing Street is hopeful that the political declaration can be a “sweetener” to the withdrawal agreement, which has faced a storm of protest in Britain. On Saturday, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted there was “more to be done” before a special European council meeting on Sunday 25 November to get “the best possible deal for the UK”. But the extra demands on the UK are likely to be unwelcome to Brexiters, who fear that the government is allowing the UK to be permanently sucked into the EU’s regulatory orbit. While the UK is a leading light among the EU member states on climate change, the French government is concerned that in a post-Brexit world there will be calls within Britain to undercut the rest of the continent. The EU has been steadily ratcheting up its targets as part of the 2015 Paris climate change accord, and France wants the UK to be bound to them. Last week the European parliament adopted energy-savings targets of 32.5% and a renewable energy uplift of 32% by 2030. That will put the bloc on course to cut emissions by 45% from 1990 levels by 2030. The most politically sensitive demand from the EU is likely, however, to concern the trade-off the bloc wants to make between access for the European fishing fleet to British waters and the wider trade deal. It is understood that a clause will be included in the political declaration making a link between British companies having access to the European market, and maintaining the “existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources”. The EU wants a deal on access to UK waters by July 2020, with the UK being tied to making its “best endeavour” to get an agreement, or British exporters will face a loss of access to its market for their own goods. A number of member states are also championing more positive language in the political declaration on the future trading relationship. One diplomat from a European country on the western fringe of the EU said: “The relationship as sketched out in the political declaration doesn’t do enough for us. It doesn’t protect the supply lines and we should aim higher, and lock ourselves in to achieve more.” Andrew Duff, a former MEP, and visiting fellow at the European Policy Centre thinktank, said: “The political declaration needs to do two things – corral the 27 behind a settled course of action leading to an unprecedented association agreement with the UK, and secondly to commit the British prime minister – and if possible her successor – in that same direction. “It can’t be too loose, therefore, but also can’t be so tightly drafted that it pre-empts the association agreement negotiations. It’s the first chance for the EU 27 to plot the future of Europe without the Brits – an important moment, therefore.”"

"Earlier this year the government announced plans for a new northern forest. Under the auspices of the Woodland Trust, an area that stretches 120 miles from Hull to Liverpool will be planted with 50 million trees over the next 25 years. In March, the first trees were put in the ground on hills above Bolton, in Greater Manchester, by an “army of planters” composed of local community members, volunteers, funding bodies and MPs. There is, certainly, an urgent environmental need to get trees back in our landscape. We lost more ancient woods – tens of thousands of them – in the 40 years after the second world war than in the previous 400 years. The UK has only 13% woodland cover, compared with the European average of 37%. Quite apart from being beautiful things, trees – like all vegetation – absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and the northern forest is intended to help the UK government meet its carbon emissions target by 2050.  But there’s a much more effective way of re-establishing trees in the wider countryside than putting a spade in the ground – and one that has far greater benefits for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and the trees’ health, and that would save us a fortune in financial and environmental costs. And that is natural regeneration – let the trees plant themselves. The reason this doesn’t happen nowadays is our demonisation of thorny scrub. Hawthorn, blackthorn, dog-rose, gorse and bramble are nature’s barbed wire. These species provide saplings with protection from browsing by deer and rabbits; shelter from the wind; a buffer against drought and excessive rain; and nutrients via mutual mycorrhizal connections underground. Thorny scrub is also one of the most biodiverse habitats – providing a rich source of berries, seeds, nectar, pollen and nuts for small mammals, insects and birds, as well as protection from predators. But we’ve forgotten about this precious resource in recent times. In the days before plastics and mass manufacture, thorny scrub provided us with charcoal, medicines, dyes, food, fodder, thatching, furniture, gunpowder and tools. Above all, it was valued as a nursery for trees. “The thorn is the mother of the oak” is an ancient forestry saying. Thorny scrub was considered so valuable that a 1768 statute in the New Forest imposed three months’ forced labour and lashes of the whip on anyone found extracting it. Now, however, we consider scrub “wasteland” and eradicate it wherever it appears, and even on nature reserves, volunteers spend weekends“scrub-bashing”. The modern system of establishing trees relies entirely on humans, and saplings produced in nurseries. Even with a volunteer workforce this is expensive. Ultimately the northern forest is expected to cost £500m. And it is manifestly inefficient. Commercial saplings – bare-root “whips” – are vulnerable, and can easily dry out and die before, or even after, they’re planted. They are not as well connected to the soil as naturally established seedlings, and often lack the appropriate fungal associates. They need to be individually protected by tree guards, almost invariably carbon-intensive polypropylene cylinders tied with plastic ties to treated wooden stakes. Even if the areas to be planted are protected from deer by a perimeter fence, tree guards are poor protection against burrowing rabbits and voles, which cannot be fenced out. Humidity inside the tubes can induce rot and mildews. Using saplings from commercial nurseries also carries a risk of importing disease. Chalara, or ash dieback, was spread into the UK this way. And anyway, is one enormous plantation what we want for our northern forest? Closed-canopy woodland is remarkably species-poor. Even ancient woodland is not the biodiverse wonderland it is often held to be. Species monitoring in Lady Park Wood in the Forest of Dean and the Mens Nature Reserve in Sussex – considered to be some of our oldest surviving stands of trees – shows a downward trajectory for biodiversity. There may be saproxylic (dead-wood-specialising) fungi and beetles in these densely shaded woods, but there is precious little else. With no sunlight, there’s no birdsong, no thrum of pollinating insects, no wildflowers. Herein lies the great “forest” misconception. Underpinning the northern forest project is the idea that Britain was originally ubiquitous closed-canopy woodland. Before human impact, it’s said, a squirrel could have run from John o’Groats to Land’s End on the tops of trees. Dense forest tends to be the state we aspire to when aiming for nature restoration. But this is the stuff of fairytales. Many of our shrubs and trees – including hazel, wild apple, wild pear, wild cherry, rowan, dogwood, common privet, Scots pine and oak (that quintessentially English tree) – are light-demanding species that cannot regenerate in closed-canopy conditions. They point to a much more open landscape – a wood-pasture system driven by free-roaming herds of grazing and browsing animals, where trees regenerated out in the open, within thorny scrub. This is the landscape described by Oliver Rackham, our late, great woodland expert, as the “wildwood”. It is the landscape of the New Forest and all the other hunting forests of medieval England – a dynamic mosaic of gigantic open-grown trees and groves of all species and ages, grazing “lawns”, water meadows and thorny scrub. Paradise for wildlife. Far better for biodiversity and the taxpayer would be to allow small mammals, the wind and birds to do the tree planting for us. A single jay can plant 7,500 acorns in four weeks. Carrying these highly calorific oak nuts in its gullet, six at a time, the jay flies away to bury them a commodious distance from the parent oak tree, often in, or near, protective thorny scrub, as a store for feeding itself through the winter and its young in spring. The acorns that are not recovered by the jay end up developing into saplings. Rewilding – enabling natural processes to function as they are meant to – allows the jay and all the other seed dispersers to do their job. But this is not something that organisations like the Woodland Trust have embraced with any real enthusiasm. Their fundraising model depends on grant aid, and the messy, competitive, variable responses of nature do not fit within a grant system that requires precise costs, targets and predictability. The appeal of physically digging a hole and planting a tree is also a powerful way of recruiting donors and volunteers. If charities simply left it to nature, a major means of forging those relationships would vanish. It’s encouraging that in June the government appointed its first “tree champion”, William Worsley, the former president of the Country Landowners Association. As well as protecting existing trees he will spearhead the planting of millions of new ones. But I urge him to rethink how we do this – and to consider areas where we could return to the richer forest systems of old, to the wildwood, a landscape naturally imbued with spirit of place, where the thorn can once again be the “mother of the oak”. • Isabella Tree is the author of Wilding: The Return of Nature to a British Farm"
"Waste fish parts will be used to power ships in a new initiative to use green energy for polluting cruise liners. The leftovers of fish processed for food and mixed with other organic waste will be used to generate biogas, which will then be liquefied and used in place of fossil fuels by the expedition cruise line Hurtigruten.  Heavy fossil fuels used by ocean-going transport are an increasing problem as they are even more polluting than fuels for land-based vehicles, emitting sulphur and other contaminants. The fuels contribute to air pollution as well as to climate change. Converting vessels to use biogas will cut down on pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hurtigruten operates a fleet of 17 ships, and by 2021 aims to have converted at least six of its vessels to use biogas, liquefied natural gas – a fossil fuel, but cleaner than many alternatives – and large battery packs, capable of storing energy produced from renewable sources. The 125-year-old company, based in Norway, is also banning single-use plastics in an effort to be more environmentally sustainable. It operates cruises in the Arctic and Antarctic, both highly sensitive environments. Biogas can be generated from most forms of organic waste by speeding up and harnessing the natural decomposition process to capture the methane produced. Organic waste is produced by all food industries but is frequently disposed of in landfill, where it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions as it decomposes. Shipping has come under increasing scrutiny as many vessels use heavy fuel oil, which is cheap but would be banned on land for its polluting qualities. The daily greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s largest cruise liners can be as great as those of a million cars on the road. Battery power is also a promising technology for ocean-going transport, but building batteries powerful enough has been a problem to date. Advances in battery manufacture are making it possible to install batteries big enough to last a voyage. Hurtigruten is currently building three new hybrid-powered cruise ships in Norway, to be delivered in the next three years. Daniel Skjeldam, the chief executive of Hurtigruten, said: “Norway is a large shipping nation, but fishery and forestry are also large sectors. They create jobs and produce income, but they also produce a lot of waste products. The steady access to high volumes of organic waste gives the Nordic countries a unique position on the biogas market. We are pushing for more innovation, more investment. I believe we have just seen the beginning of what in a few years will be a huge sector.”"
"China, Russia and Canada’s current climate policies would drive the world above a catastrophic 5C of warming by the end of the century, according to a study that ranks the climate goals of different countries. The US and Australia are only slightly behind with both pushing the global temperature rise dangerously over 4C above pre-industrial levels says the paper, while even the EU, which is usually seen as a climate leader, is on course to more than double the 1.5C that scientists say is a moderately safe level of heating. The study, published on Friday in the journal Nature Communications, assesses the relationship between each nation’s ambition to cut emissions and the temperature rise that would result if the world followed their example. The aim of the paper is to inform climate negotiators as they begin a two-year process of ratcheting up climate commitments, which currently fall far short of the 1.5-to-2C goal set in France three years ago. The related website also serves as a guide to how nations are sharing the burden of responding to the greatest environmental threat humankind has ever faced. Among the major economies, the study shows India is leading the way with a target that is only slightly off course for 2C. Less developed countries are generally more ambitious, in part because they have fewer factories, power plants and cars, which means they have lower emissions to rein in. On the opposite side of the spectrum are the industrial powerhouse China and major energy exporters who are doing almost nothing to limit carbon dioxide emissions. These include Saudi Arabia (oil), Russia (gas) and Canada, which is drawing vast quantities of dirty oil from tar sands. Fossil fuel lobbies in these countries are so powerful that government climate pledges are very weak, setting the world on course for more than 5C of heating by the end of the century. Only slightly better are the group of countries that are pushing the planet beyond 4C. Among them are the US, which has huge emissions from energy, industry and agriculture somewhat offset by promises of modest cuts and more renewables. Australia, which remains heavily dependent on coal exports, is also in this category. The wealthy shopping societies of Europe fare slightly better – largely because emissions on products are calculated at the source of manufacture rather than the point of consumption – but the authors of the paper say their actions lag behind their promises to set a positive example. “It is interesting is to see how far out some countries are, even those that are considered leaders in the climate mitigation narrative,” said the study’s author, Yann Robiou du Pont of Melbourne University. The study is likely to be controversial. Under the Paris agreement, there is no top-down consensus on what is a fair share of responsibility. Instead each nation sets its own bottom-up targets according to a number of different factors, including political will, level of industrialisation, ability to pay, population size, historical responsibility for emissions. Almost every government, the authors say, selects an interpretation of equity that serves their own interests and allows them to achieve a relative gain on other nations. To get around these differing concepts of fairness, the paper assesses each nation by the least stringent standards they set themselves and then extrapolates this to the world. In doing so, the authors say they can “operationalise disagreements”. Taking account of the different interpretations, they say the world needs to commit to a virtual 1.4C target in order to achieve a 2C goal. They hope their equity metric can be used in next month’s UN climate talks in Katowice and in climate litigation cases. The authors said the study could in future be extended to the subnational level, such as individual US states. They also note that a few key sectors are currently omitted, including land-use change (which is fundamental in rapidly deforesting nations such as Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia), international shipping and aviation. Although the study highlights the huge gap between political will and scientific alarm, Robiou du Pont said it should inspire rather than dispirit people. “The positive outcome of this study is that we have a metric to assess the ratcheting up of ambition. Civil society, experts and decision-makers can use this to hold their governments accountable, and possibly undertake climate litigation cases as happened recently in the Netherlands,” he said. “This metric translates the lack of ambition on a global scale to a national scale. If we look at the goal of trying to avoid damage to the Earth, then I am pessimistic as this is already happening. But this should be a motivation to ratchet up ambition and avoid global warming as much and as rapidly as possible. Every fraction of a degree will have a big impact.” Commenting on the study, other academics said it could be used by anyone to show how climate action can be navigated in a world in which each country ranks itself based on what they consider to be fair. “This paper provides a means for countries to check how their contribution might be perceived by other countries and thus judge whether they are perceived as a climate leader or laggard,” said Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London."

"The UN agency responsible for cutting shipping emissions to combat climate change has been accused of operating like a secretive closed shop. The charity Transparency International has condemned six countries, including the UK and the US, for opposing moves to open the International Maritime Organization to public scrutiny and hampering moves to combat climate change.  The IMO regulates global shipping and is coordinating a ban on high-sulphur shipping fuel by 2020. The Guardian reported this month that the IMO has allowed what critics call an “emissions cheat” system to be installed onboard ships to dodge the clean fuel regulations. But the system is likely to lead to pollutants being dumped at sea instead of stored in facilities on land, according to critics. The IMO set up a working group to tackle accusations earlier this year from Transparency International that it is secretive and disproportionately influenced by the private shipping industry and an unequal influence of certain member states. Transparency International said it was concerned that moves by the UK, the US, the Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Panama and the United Arab Emirates could hamper reform at the UN agency and damage moves to tackle climate change and clean up the shipping industry. Last month these countries criticised moves to make the UN agency more transparent. They said “further expansion of access to information” about the agency “could lead to outside influence”, according to Transparency International. Rueben Lifuka, the vice-chair of Transparency International, said: “Unfortunately the IMO is far too susceptible to disproportionate influence from private interests and certain member states, meaning that there could be obstacles to meeting the targets for emissions reduction set earlier this year. “The agency needs to move towards a more open and transparent way of operating, with greater opportunities for public scrutiny and civil society engagement. The stakes are too high for the entire planet for the IMO to continue to operate as a closed shop.” A spokesperson for the IMO said it would decide the terms of reference for the working group on Monday. The working group would then meet and discuss the issues referred to it, reporting back to the IMO council by Friday. In April 2018, the IMO’s parine environment protection committee set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared with 2008, consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. The global shipping fleet is rushing to meet the 2020 IMO deadline to reduce air pollution by forcing vessels to use cleaner fuel with a lower sulphur content of 0.5%, compared with 3.5% as currently used. The move comes after growing concerns about the health impacts of shipping emissions. A report in Nature this year said 400,000 premature deaths a year are caused by emissions from dirty shipping fuel, which also account for 14m childhood asthma cases per year."

"The British artist Gavin Turk has said every member of the public will feel the impact of the climate emergency sooner rather than later, after he was arrested during mass civil disobedience in central London. Turk, who was among 82 people arrested during a coordinated occupation of five bridges in the capital, said the pressure to force governments to act to reduce climate change was “the new future”. He was among scores of people arrested for the obstruction of a public highway on Lambeth Bridge on Saturday in a mass protest to force governments to take action on climate change. He was held for several hours and released later the same day. Turk, one of the generation of young British artists who became art superstars in the mid-90s, said he had no regrets about taking part in one of the biggest acts of mass civil disobedience for decades, organised by activists known as Extinction Rebellion.  “It seems like everyone is in an odd sense of denial about climate change,” said Turk. “I was in a quandary about what I could do. I felt taking part was a way of putting my name down and doing something for the environment. It was an incredibly peaceful demonstration and I think we put down some kind of marker. The message is really very slow to get through to people, but it will come to us all, we will all have to deal with the impact of this climate emergency. “I hope this kind of action has caught the public imagination. It is the new future.” The civil disobedience in London was matched by other demonstrations elsewhere in the UK, including in Cambridge. The organisers, Extinction Rebellion, want to force governments to treat the threats of climate breakdown and extinction as a crisis. Five bridges in London, Waterloo, Westminster, Lambeth, Southwark and Blackfriars were occupied for several hours. Organisers said between 4,000 to 6,000 people attended the demonstration. Extinction Rebellion went public with its message at the end of October. Its growth is a sign that it has caught the public imagination and is offering people the chance to make their voices heard about the need to act to stop global warming, said Tiana Jacout, one of the organisers. “To get 4,000 plus people on the streets after such a short time is extraordinary,” said Jacout. “We are saying we don’t need to sit back and watch the slow car crash of humanity. We can do something about it. That has sparked something in people.” The Metropolitan Police said 85 people were arrested on Saturday across the demonstration. That figure was later reduced due to duplicating reports made by officers. In the past two weeks more than 60 people have been arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion, ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking major roads in the capital.  Extinction Rebellion cites the civil rights movement, suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi as inspirations for its campaigns. The group is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens’ assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. Organisers say they also hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power the present course of action will lead to disaster. The world’s leading climate change scientists have warned there is only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released last month said urgent and unprecedented changes were needed to reach the target."
"Young Australians are frustrated about inaction on climate change – more so when the older generations don’t appear to be doing much about it. From the death of the national energy guarantee to the news the world is “nowhere near on track” to limit warming to less than 1.5C, the concerns of our youngest Australians often find it hard to be heard.

"Longer bushfire seasons in Australia and the US threaten to disrupt the sharing of vital personnel and equipment between the two countries, fire experts and coordinators have revealed. At least 50 people have lost their lives in California’s deadliest wildfires, which continue to rage. Fire authorities and scientists say climate change has made the conditions worse.  In July the US requested help from Australia and New Zealand, which sent 188 personnel to help fight the blazes. That group has now returned. For about 20 years, Australia and the US have exchanged personnel and equipment during major fires. But there are fears that, as climate change drives more severe blazes and lengthens fire seasons, those arrangements could be strained.  A fleet of aircraft, including six adapted helicopters and two Hercules water bombers, are also shared – spending the Australian winter fighting fires in the northern hemisphere before being contracted to fight bushfires in Australia’s summer months. “It’s an issue for us,” said Stuart Ellis, the chief executive at the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council – the group responsible for coordinating with other countries to share firefighting personnel and equipment. The problem had “arisen in discussions between ourselves and the US”, he said. “In the US there’s less and less talk of a ‘fire season’ and more a consideration that fire impacts them all through the year.” The arrangement to contract and share the specialist aircraft, which supplement a fleet owned by Australian authorities, had “worked well for many years”. “There’s no question [the aircraft] make a very positive contribution [to fighting fires],” Ellis said. But he said the arrangement “could be challenged in the future and we are considering alternatives – whether that’s using more local aircraft or sourcing others”. This year’s deployment of 188 Australian and New Zealand firefighters followed a group of 240 who crossed the Pacific in 2017. Most of the Australian team is made up of “incident management specialists” – staff trained in a common system used to coordinate and deploy firefighting units.  “In California there are about 4,500 firefighters deployed or available and, at the height of the fires in the western US, there were about 29,000,” Ellis said. “Where we can help is that they tend to have large numbers of firefighters but they run out of incident management specialists.” Ellis has been in the US and Canada during recent deployments and said the intensity of this year’s fires and the conditions that fed them were “unprecedented”. “I think there’s no other plausible explanation than climate change,” he said. “It’s not up to the fire services to say what the cause of that is, but the issue of climate change is one we are applying our minds to because it can have an impact on our resources.” Dr Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Melbourne-based Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said there was already an overlap in the times spent fighting major fires in the US and Australia. “We are now seeing regular fires in the United States – and in California – running into November, and there were fires last year in December that led to mudslides and deaths. In Australia, it appears there’s more fires occurring outside of what we would call the fire season. Clearly then, there’s already an overlap.” The Bureau of Meteorology says Australia’s bushfire season has lengthened, and increasing temperatures and drier conditions have increased the risk of blazes. Thornton said the sorts of conditions that led to catastrophic fire events such as the 2009 Black Saturday fires were “becoming more likely due to climate change”. The lengthening of fire seasons also meant there was less time to carry out controlled burning, he said. He called the loss of life in the California fires “truly tragic” and said there were important lessons to be learned for other parts of the world, including Australia. “We have a lot of people living in that rural-urban interface,” he said. “Some people have lived there for a long time and others have moved there, and we see urban planning schemes that open up those areas for new dwellings. “Then we see very high fuel loads close to those populated areas and changes in demographics, with more vulnerable people there, or getting older there. “Combined with all that, we see conditions for fires occurring more frequently. There’s an increase in the risk, an increase in the exposure to the risk and all that leads to a challenge that countries need to grapple with.”"
