Many people believe that global population growth leads to greater poverty and more famines, but evidence suggests otherwise. Between 1960 and 2016, the world’s population increased by 145 percent. 1 Over the same time period, real average annual per capita income in the world rose by 183 percent. 2



Instead of a rise in poverty rates, the world saw the greatest poverty reduction in human history. In 1981, the World Bank estimated, 42.2 percent of humanity lived on less than $1.90 per person per day (adjusted for purchasing power). In 2013, that figure stood at 10.7 percent .3 That’s a reduction of 75 percent. According to the Bank’s more recent estimates, absolute poverty fell to less than 10 percent in 2015. 4



Rising incomes helped lower the infant mortality rate from 64.8 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 30.5 in 2016. That’s a 53 percent reduction. 5 Over the same time period, the mortality rate for children under five years of age declined from 93.4 per 1,000 to 40.8. That’s a reduction of 56 percent. 6 The number of maternal deaths declined from 532,000 in 1990 to 303,000 in 2015 — a 43 percent decrease. 7



Famine has all but disappeared outside of war zones. In 1961, food supply in 54 out of 183 countries was less than 2,000 calories per person per day. 8 That was true of only two countries in 2013. 9 In 1960, average life expectancy in the world was 52.6 years. In 2015, it was 71.9 years — a 37 percent increase. 10



In 1960, American workers worked, on average, 1,930 hours per year. In 2017, they worked 1,758 hours per year — a reduction of 9 percent. 11The data for the world are patchy. That said, a personal calculation based on the available data for 31 rich and middle‐​income countries suggests a 14 percent decline in hours worked per worker per year. 12



Enrollment at all education levels is up. For example, the primary school completion rate rose from 74 percent in 1970 to 90 percent in 2015 — a 20 percent increase. 13 The lower secondary school completion rate rose from 53 percent in 1986 to 77 percent in 2015 — a 45 percent increase. 14 Tertiary school enrollment rose from 10 percent in 1970 to 36 percent in 2015 — a 260 percent increase. 15



Even our air is getting cleaner. In the United States, for example, aggregate emissions of six common pollutants (i.e., carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, fine and coarse particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide) fell by 67 percent between 1980 and 2016. 16



And, in spite of a recent increase in terrorist killings and the number of civil wars, the world is still much safer than it was at the height of the Cold War. 17 Last but not least, an ordinary person has greater access to information than ever before. All in all, we live on a safer, cleaner, and more prosperous planet than was the case in 1960.



How can one explain this unprecedented improvement in global well-being? Some of it must be attributed to technological and scientific progress. Also, specialization and trade played a vital role in improving the state of the world. Globalization ensured that an increase in the world’s population translated to an increase in the world’s productivity.



Of course, growth required the use of massive amounts of natural resources. How much of our natural wealth remains? Although we do not know the size of most reserves of natural resources, we can ascertain their scarcity or abundance by looking at prices. As this paper shows, after 56 years of human use and exploration, the vast majority of the commodities tracked by the World Bank are cheaper than they used to be — either absolutely or relative to income.



These findings would come as no surprise to the late Julian Simon (1932–1998), who years ago explained and predicted the happy confluence of growing population, increasing wealth, and falling commodity prices. In his 1981 book _The Ultimate Resource_ , Simon noted that humans are _intelligent_ animals who innovate their way out of scarcity through greater efficiency, increased supply, or development of substitutes. Human ingenuity, in other words, is “the ultimate resource” that makes other resources more plentiful. 18



An aluminum can, for example, weighed about 3 ounces in 1959. Today, it weighs less than half an ounce. 19 In other cases, we have replaced scarce resources with those that are more plentiful. Instead of killing whales for lamp oil, for instance, we burn coal, oil, and gas. In fact, humanity is yet to run out of a single nonrenewable resource.



Although past performance does not guarantee future results, constant predictions of doom and gloom should be put in perspective. Humanity has solved many challenges in the past, and there is no reason to believe that we will not be able to solve problems in the future. Put differently, there is no compelling evidence to support calls for mandatory curbs on human reproduction and consumption.



To see what has been happening to world commodity prices, I looked at the World Bank’s Commodity Price Data, which include prices for 72 commodities (see Appendix). The data set needed some consolidation because some data sets started very late (e.g., 1996) or were repetitive (e.g., there were four different tea price data sets). As a consequence, I was left with 42 distinct data sets.



More specifically, I eliminated three crude oil data sets (Brent, Dubai, and WTI) because the data contained therein were already reflected in “Crude oil, average.” Because no measure of the price of coal goes back to 1960, I kept “Coal, Australian,” which goes back to 1970 and contains the most data. (Incidentally, “Crude oil, average” and “Coal, Australian,” have both appreciated more than was the case with prices in the eliminated data sets.)



In the case of natural gas, prices in the United States and Europe diverged significantly. 20 However, since I am trying to compare global prices and global income, I created an average price of natural gas consisting of both the American and European prices. To simplify matters further, I created a single average for the prices of coffee (combining Arabica and Robusta) and retained just one measure of the price of tea, which is, in any case, the average of the prices in Colombo, Kolkata, and Mombasa.



I also combined coconut oil and copra (from which coconut oil is derived). I eliminated groundnuts, for which price tracking did not start until 1980, with groundnut oil serving as a proximate measure of the price of groundnuts. I eliminated palm kernel oil because its price tracking doesn’t start until 1996, and I combined all soybean price measures into one. I eliminated all prices for rice except for the one measure that actually starts in 1960, “Rice, Thai 5 percent.”



Similarly, I retained the only measure of wheat (Wheat, U.S. HRW) that goes back to 1960. I eliminated “Banana, Europe” because it didn’t start until 1997. I eliminated sugar prices in the United States and Europe, retaining “Sugar, world” instead. I eliminated “Logs” and “Sawn wood” from Cameroon because both data sets start in 1970. “Rubber, TSR20” was eliminated because of its start in 1999. I also eliminated “DAP” (i.e., diammonium phosphate) because it started in 1967, and I combined the other four fertilizers (phosphate rock, triple superphosphate, urea, and potassium chloride) into one price measure called “Fertilizer.”



Between 1960 and 2016, world population increased by 145 percent and average income per capita adjusted for inflation increased by 183 percent. Out of the 42 distinct commodity prices measured by the World Bank, 19 have declined in absolute terms. In other words, adjusted for inflation, those commodities were cheaper in 2016 than in 1960. Twenty-three commodities have increased in price over the past 56 years. However, of those 23 commodities, only 3 (crude oil, gold, and silver) appreciated more than income. In a vast majority of cases, therefore, commodities became cheaper either absolutely or relatively (see Table 1 and Figure 1).



 **Table 1:** Commodity Prices, 1960–2016 (2010 U.S. dollars)

It is often posited that population growth must inevitably result in the exhaustion of natural resources, environmental destruction, and even mass starvation. Take, for example, the report _The Limits to Growth_ , which was published by the Club of Rome in 1972. 21 The report, which was based on Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer projections, looked at the interplay between industrial development, population growth, malnutrition, the availability of nonrenewable resources, and the quality of the environment. It concluded that “If present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. . . . The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity. . . . Given present resource consumption rates and the projected increase in these rates, the great majority of currently nonrenewable resources will be extremely expensive 100 years from now.” 22



That kind of alarmism is not ancient history. A recent article in the journal _Nature Sustainability_ argued that 



Humanity faces the challenge of how to achieve a high quality of life for over 7 billion people without destabilizing critical planetary processes. Using indicators designed to measure a “safe and just” development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2–6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships.… [O]ur findings suggest that the pursuit of universal human development … has the potential to undermine the Earth‐​system processes upon which development ultimately depends.… [I]f all people are to lead a good life within planetary boundaries, then the level of resource use associated with meeting basic needs must be dramatically reduced.23



The above arguments are strikingly similar to those made in _The Limits to Growth_ report 46 years ago. Yet none of the dire predictions made by the authors of the latter publication have come to pass. On the contrary, we have seen an overall decline of commodity prices relative to income — in spite of a growing global population. Can this happy trend continue? To get a glimpse of the future, we must first understand the concept of scarcity.



Scarcity, or “the gap between limited — that is, scarce — resources and theoretically limitless wants,” is best ascertained by looking at prices. 24A scarce commodity goes up in price, whereas a plentiful commodity becomes cheaper. That was the premise of a famous bet between Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich and University of Maryland professor Julian Simon. Ehrlich shared the gloomy predictions of the Club of Rome. In his best‐​selling 1968 book, _The_ _Population_ _Bomb_ , Ehrlich reasoned that overpopulation would lead to exhaustion of natural resources and mega‐​famines. “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate,” he wrote. 25



Simon, in contrast, was much more optimistic. In his 1981 book _The Ultimate Resource_ , Simon used empirical data to show that humanity has always gotten around the problem of scarcity by increasing the supply of natural resources or developing substitutes for overused resources. Human ingenuity, he argued, was “the ultimate resource” that would make all other resources more plentiful. In 1980, the two thinkers agreed to put their ideas to a test.



As Ronald Bailey wrote in his 2015 book _The End of Doom: Environmental Renewal in the 21st Century:_



In October 1980, Ehrlich and Simon drew up a futures contract obligating Simon to sell Ehrlich the same quantities that could be purchased for $1,000 of five metals (copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten) ten years later at inflation‐​adjusted 1980 prices. If the combined prices rose above $1,000, Simon would pay the difference. If they fell below $1,000, Ehrlich would pay Simon the difference. Ehrlich mailed Simon a check for $576.07 in October 1990. There was no note in the letter. The price of the basket of metals chosen by Ehrlich and his cohorts had fallen by more than 50 percent. The cornucopian Simon won. 26



Simon’s critics, Ehrlich included, have since argued that Simon got lucky. Had his bet with Ehrlich taken place over a different decade, the outcome might have been different. Between 2001 and 2008, for example, the world had experienced an unprecedented economic expansion that dramatically increased the price of commodities. But Simon’s larger point concerning the long-term decline in the price of commodities still stands. According to Simon, when a particular resource becomes scarcer, its price increases, and that change incentivizes people to discover more of the resource, ration it, recycle it, or develop a substitute for it. As such, population growth and resource use do not automatically lead to higher commodity prices in the long run.



Let’s look at a concrete example. Research suggests that commodity prices move in so-called super-cycles that last between 30 and 40 years. 27During periods of high economic growth, demand for commodities increases. When that happens, commodities go up in price. It is during this period that high commodity prices encourage the discovery of new supplies and the invention of new technologies. Once new supplies come online, prices of “now copiously supplied commodities” fall. 28



Accordingly, the current commodity cycle seems to have peaked in 2008. In June 2008, for example, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil reached $154 per barrel (2016 U.S. dollars). By January 2016, it stood at $29. 29 However, the high price of oil has led to fracking (hydraulic fracturing), which has revolutionized the oil industry. In late 2017, with the global economy on the mend, the price of oil hovered around $60 per barrel. Fracking, which enables people to gain access to previously inaccessible oil reserves in record volumes, seems to be keeping a lid on massive price increases. The so-called shale band refers to “a price level at which most North American deposits . . . can be accessed with hydraulic fracturing technology [and] become profitable.” 30Currently, the shale band moves in a range of between $40 and $60. When the price of oil moves much below $40, U.S. oil rigs shut down. As it moves close to $60, U.S. oil rigs go back to work, thus lowering the price of oil. 31



In fact, humanity has yet to run out of a single nonrenewable resource. Unfortunately, many people still believe that the answer to scarcity is to limit consumption of natural resources. This group includes Paul Ehrlich and his wife, Anne, who revisited the Stanford University professor’s dire warnings in a 2013 _Proceedings of the Royal Society_ article titled “Can a Collapse of Global Civilization Be Avoided?” Undeterred by a half-century of evidence to the contrary, they came to conclusions similar to those that Paul Ehrlich had originally proposed in the 1960s. 32The Club of Rome is still around and publishing. In 2017, it published a new report titled _Come On! Capitalism, Short-termism, Population and the Destruction of the Planet_ , which insisted that “the Club of Rome’s warnings published in the book _Limits to Growth_ are still valid” and warned that the “current worldwide trends are not sustainable.” 33



To these warnings about humanity’s future, a veritable smorgasbord of similar publications may be added. They include Naomi Klein’s 2015 book _This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate_ , in which the Canadian author argues that “our economy is at war with many forms of life on earth, including human life. What the climate needs in order to avoid collapse is a contraction in humanity’s use of resources,” and Rob Dietz and Dan O’Neill’s 2013 offering, _Enough Is Enough: Building a Sustainable Economy in a World of Finite Resources_. According to the American and Canadian economists, “We’re overusing the earth’s finite resources, and yet excessive consumption is failing to improve our lives.” 34



But consumption limits are unpopular and difficult to enforce. More often than not, their effects fall hardest on the most vulnerable. A switch from fossil fuels to “renewable” sources of energy, for example, has increased the price of gas and electricity in many European countries to such an extent that a new term, _energy poverty_ , was coined. 35 According to the German magazine _Der Spiegel_ , “Germany’s aggressive and reckless expansion of wind and solar power has come with a hefty price tag for consumers, and the costs often fall disproportionately on the poor.” 36In democracies, such policies are, in the long run, unsustainable. More important, they are unnecessary, because real solutions to future scarcity are more likely to come from innovation and technological change.



As previously noted, three commodities are outliers and rose in price more than income. Between 1960 and 2016, gold rose by 530 percent, silver by 234 percent, and oil by 367 percent. Does that disprove Simon’s thesis? Far from it. For many decades, the oil market was partly shielded from competitive forces by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a cartel of oil-producing countries. The OPEC nations frequently colluded to restrict production of oil in order to keep its price artificially high. The extent to which OPEC was able to achieve its goal in the past is subject to much debate, but many experts have come to believe that OPEC’s ability to affect the future price of oil is in decline. 37 That’s partly because of fracking of previously inaccessible oil reserves in non-OPEC countries, such as the United States, and partly because of technological developments, such as the accelerating move away from combustion engine vehicles. 38 In expectation of permanently low oil prices, oil companies, such as Shell, and oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, are slowly diversifying to reduce their dependence on oil production. 39 Put differently, people with a stake in oil now assume that oil prices will follow Simon’s prediction in the future.



Gold and silver have more unusual characteristics. In addition to their commercial uses, such as serving as conductors of electricity in switches and cell phones, gold and silver are also “stores of value” or assets that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time. Historically, people of all income groups used gold and silver to hide their wealth from rapacious government officials and in the time of war. More recently, both metals rose in price during the inflationary 1970s, when many of the world’s most important currencies, including the U.S. dollar, were rapidly losing their value because of monetary mismanagement. They spiked again after the outbreak of the Great Recession and the subsequent uncertainty about the soundness of the financial system.



The discussion in this paper is not meant to trivialize the challenges that humanity faces or imply that we will be able to solve all of the problems ahead. Instead, it is meant to show that the human brain, the ultimate resource, is capable of solving complex challenges. We have been doing so with disease, hunger, and extreme poverty, and we can do so with respect to the use of natural resources.



Thomas Babington Macaulay, a 19th-century British historian and politician, once asked, “On what principle is it that when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?” 40In 1830, when Macaulay penned those words, the world was just beginning to industrialize. One hundred eighty-eight years later, humanity is not only still here, but it is flourishing like never before. Few people today would forgo the life expectancy, nutrition, health care, and education they now enjoy in exchange for those experienced by Macaulay’s contemporaries.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks in large part to wind and solar energy, not only have German electricity prices paid by consumers skyrocketed over the past years, thus casting a large number of homes into home fuel poverty, but also the supply itself is rapidly becoming precarious and unreliable.
One problem is the stabilization of the power grid in the face of wildly fluctuating wind and solar energy feed-in. The other problem is the mechanical integrity associated the wind turbines themselves. Hat-tip: Gerti Brunthaler at Facebook.
Catastrophic wind turbine failures
Increasingly it is becoming apparent that wind turbines have a way of just collapsing – often without notice – due to mysterious causes. One might suspect mechanical fatigue due to the complex cyclic loading that wind turbines are subjected to. Consequently wind parks are becoming hazardous zones for persons and property in the vicinity – never mind the proven detrimental health effects of infrasound.
One example (of many) of a recent catastrophic turbine failure is reported by the North German Ostesee Zeitung here. According to the article, just 2 days ago, the blade of a wind turbine snapped off unexpectedly, boring itself into the ground. The Ostsee Zeitung writes that local residents were “shocked” and the reason for the collapse is unknown. The online news site writes:
At the time of the accident there was neither a storm nor unusual weather conditions. ‘We are baffled as well,’ says Carlo Schmidt, Managing Director of Windprojekt company, which operates the turbine in question.”
Luckily no one was injured, or killed.
Wind turbine in Sweden fails with “incredible bang”.
Another recent catastrophic failure occurred in Sweden, so reports the Swedish online svt.se news site here.
Forestry machinery operator Erik Karlsson of the Vetlanda municipality heard an “incredible bang” while working on Christmas Eve, but thought nothing of it. Later as went home he discovered that a nearby wind turbine had fallen to the ground across the road. The huge turbine mast had snapped some 15 meters up and the unit came crashing down, the SVT writes. Authorities quickly cordoned off the wind park area. Here as well the cause of the failure is unknown. The wind park has since been designated as a hazardous area: “The public has been asked to keep away.”
These are just two recent examples of many of wind turbine collapses.

Blackouts to prevent blackouts
In addition to catastrophic mechanical failures, wind and solar energy are wreaking havoc on power grid stability, so writes the German online mittelhessen.de here.
The online newssite reports that the future for the residents of Wetzlar may be looking bleak. Why?
If in the future the power goes out, the reason maybe rooted in the energy management act. In order to eliminate the possibility of widespread blackouts, grid operators such as Enwag are obligated to switch off consumers or even entire parts of the city.
These targeted blackouts are necessary, mittelhessen.de writes, because it is the only way left to keep the power grid from over or under-loading. The site tells readers:
The probability of large blackouts is increasing with the strongly growing power generation from wind and sun. Experts have long seen the power grid threatened by this.”
Unfortunately grid operators will have to react very quickly to the power grid fluctuations. The mittelhessen.de reports that “there won’t be any time for operators to make long calculations” and that “there will be only an hour to react”. Just how vulnerable is the power grid in the Wetzlar region? Mittelhessen.de writes:
A chain of seemingly harmless single incidents can in the worst case lead to a domino effect and lead to outages in all connected power networks.”
In plain English: one small problem could lead to a widespread blackout. To keep this from happening, the solution is now to conduct targeted blackouts in an attempt to keep the grid balanced. If you are running a company, or merely working on an important document at your PC, then it’ll just be tough luck. Just use paper and pen, and light up a candle.
Junk energy at a high price. Other countries may wish to think twice before copying the model.
Happy New Year!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite all the big talk by German political leaders on cutting back CO2 and fighting climate change, the country’s actions speak far greater volumes.
Germany’s CO2 reductions over the past few years have not gone anywhere – except up – despite two consecutive much warmer than normal weather years. These are the results coming from Germany’s leading alarmist climate site klimaretter.de here.
Rising CO2 emissions, energy consumption
At klimaretter.de, alarmist (and fashion trendsetter) Nick Reimer is so disappointed by Germany’s failed CO2 reductions that he was compelled to lash out in an angry post at German climate policy, calling it: “a first class political fraud“. According to the German AGEB here, which Reimer cites, in 2015 German CO2 emissions actually rose slightly as energy consumption rose 1.3%.
So far most of Germany’s reductions have come from the shut down of old dilapidated East German industry in 1990 and the outsourcing of labor-intensive industry to China and abroad. Future CO2 emissions reductions are going to be almost impossible, that is unless the country puts itself on the path of economic suicide.
The dream of 40% CO2 reduction (compared to 1990 levels) by 2020 is a totally wet one, and even the German government officials know it. Reimer moans that German Economics Minister and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel promised Germany would reach its 40% CO2 reductions target by 2020, but it is in fact nowhere near on track to do so. Reimer writes that the country would have to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 3.25 percent every year in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 – a monumental amount.
GERMANY IS NOT GOING TO REACH ITS TARGET
There are a number of reasons why future cuts in CO2 aren’t going to happen easily.

Firstly, fossil fuels prices are at rock bottom and show no signs of rising soon. People, especially the poor, are rejoicing and no longer worry as much when making that extra trip with the car.
Another reason is that the country will have at least 2 or more million new immigrants by 2020, and they are going to need housing, heat, electricity, cars, refrigeration etc.. It is expected that they will boost the German economy further. Moreover, energy efficiency is not their culture. For example one gas heating specialist told me that many immigrants heat their housing at full blast, with the windows open, with the children running around on tile floors bare foot. It goes without saying that these people have much greater concerns than saving energy, which for them is free anyway. They don’t worry hysterically about every GHG molecule that gets emitted into the atmosphere – like the neurotic environmental westerners do.
A third reason why Germany reaching its CO2 target will be almost impossible is that the mild winter weather we’ve seen the last two years isn’t going to last. This is because the current solar cycle is winding down and the next La Nina is in the pipeline. Despite what some will insist, the cold winters aren’t going to vanish over the next few years. Even the alarmist Potsdam Institute warns that Europe will be seeing cold winters.
The fourth reason Germany will not meet its 2020 CO2 reduction target is because the country is set to shut down its remaining nuclear power plants, meaning more coal power is going to have to come online. Meanwhile subsidies for sun and wind and biogas are still getting scaled back.
2015 “a lost year”
The klimaretter.de alarmist Reimer now calls 2015 “a lost year in the struggle against global warming“, writing that it’s the second year in a row that the country will completely miss its annual reduction target.
In summary, expect to keep hearing lots of lofty climate-protection talk from German politicians, but don’t expect any real action from them. The Paris Agreement, after all, is just a piece of paper, and everybody knows it.

"Throughout the Democratic party presidential primary, candidate Joe Biden was variously chastised for his preference for incrementalism, for declining to fully endorse the Green New Deal, and for his perceived unwillingness to take on fossil fuel interests. Last December, the Sunrise Movement, an influential youth-led activist group that backed Bernie Sanders, graded his primary-season climate plan an F-. Yet even this group had to offer Biden cautious praise last month after he unveiled a plan to invest $2tn in clean energy, jobs and infrastructure in the four years of his first term, should he beat Donald Trump in November’s election. The chances of the plan making it through the US Congress without modification may be low but the boldness of the proposals it sets out is still instructive. The Democratic nominee has committed to eliminating carbon emissions from the power sector of the world’s second-largest polluter within 15 years.  In the process, he intends to create millions of well-paying, unionised jobs making wind turbines, building sustainable homes and manufacturing electric vehicles; to construct a new national high-speed rail network and zero-emissions mass transit in every large US city; and to establish a civilian climate corps to plant trees and protect and restore vulnerable ecosystems. And all of this while seeking to tackle racial and economic inequality by directing 40% of the earmarked $2tn to those communities who are disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate breakdown. That the former vice-president has chosen to put bold climate action at the heart of his presidential bid suggests not only an awareness that prioritising the issue is good politics, but also that the need to rebuild after the coronavirus crisis presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity that can and must be seized for progressive ends. As he argued when launching his plan: “We can live up to our responsibilities, meet the challenges of a world at risk of climate catastrophe, build more climate-resilient communities, put millions of skilled workers on the job and make life markedly better and safer for the American people all at once.” The plan is also a clear indication that a man viewed by many as the consummate centrist Democrat now accepts that averting runaway global heating requires a fundamental reshaping of the US economy rather than mere tinkering around the edges, and that both the speed and scale of climate action matter. By comparison, the climate proposals that formed part of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, considered “ambitious” just four years ago, amounted to just $90bn of investment – about a 20th of what Biden is now promising. That his commitment to a $2tn programme – approximately one-eighth of US federal spending – delivered over the course of a single presidential term, is now viewed as a moderate response to the climate crisis illustrates just how far the centre ground has shifted on this issue. In the emphasis it places on the opportunities presented by the green transition, Biden’s plan is also rooted in a recognition that forging a broad consensus for transformative change requires climate action to be as much about retaining and creating decent jobs and addressing economic, racial, generational and regional inequalities as it is about cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Biden does not shy away from the hard truth that climate breakdown represents an “existential threat”, but his agenda remains relentlessly optimistic, clothed in the language of the labour movement and progressive politics: innovation, technological progress, job creation and the pursuit of equality. Biden’s plan – and the fact it has won praise from environmentalist groups and trade unions alike – has not come from nowhere. It is the product of years of painstaking work within the Democratic party and beyond: of listening to communities’ hopes and fears, building coalitions and establishing trust, and developing and testing policies. And it points to the task ahead for the labour and environmental movements here at home. It is also far from perfect, not least in that it conspicuously avoids confronting many of the more difficult trade-offs that lie ahead and fails to engage with the obvious need to rapidly divest from fossil fuels. Yet for all its flaws, Biden’s plan serves to highlight the UK government’s lack of climate ambition. As the host of next year’s critical COP26 climate summit, Britain’s ministers need to raise their game. The fact that the candidate currently favourite to be the next US president is determined to seize this historic moment, has committed himself to a dramatic acceleration in the pace and scale of climate action, and is advocating rapid decarbonisation as the means to achieve social justice, national renewal and international leadership, illustrates that a bold climate agenda is now basic common sense. • Matthew Pennycook MP is the shadow minister for climate change"

Based on the BS we’ve seen in the House of Commons for the past three years and the never-ending demands for another referendum because …”we were misled about the referendum” (which was just adding more BS on top of BS), the only appropriate outcome for the UK now has to be another election because this time, THE WRONG PARTY WON.



Of course it’s not going to happen, because thankfully the majority was so overwhelming that even the whimpering luvvies won’t be able to raise a whimper. With the greatest respect that I have for democracy and free speech, I won’t miss the posturing, endless whining and obstruction from opposition MP’s in the UK who will no longer be the tail that wagged the dog. I also won’t miss the arrogant, obnoxious, uppity, pompous ass of a man who in many ways was bigger than the house itself: Good riddance to John Bercow (who will no doubt be suffering apoplexy over this result).



The UK election result is a complete rejection of the leftist agenda after the electorate watched just how obstructive and destructive they can be, and it was a complete rejection of [one of the most dislikeable politicians on the planet.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/jeremy-corbyn-is-a-damning-indictment-on-his-party-and-voters/)



In another BFD post, SB called it “[A WARNING for the National Party](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/a-warning-for-the-national-party/)”. 



Average, everyday, garden variety people in the UK have joined Australia and the USA in their millions giving them their marching orders. Despite the influence of academics and a compliant, even propagandising media, everyday citizens, the middle classes if you like, gave them the heave-ho.



What does it mean for the National Party? They’ve not taken the hint so far despite the writing being on the wall. John Key was popular but spent more time remaining so than doing anything memorable. Bill English was steady and performed much better than expected in the last election, but Simon Bridges has clearly not managed to resonate with the average New Zealander. Worse, many see the party under his leadership as even more Labour lite than ever.



As everybody here knows (and as several writers and commenters have repeatedly said), **you can’t win an election without a liked and likeable leader** (oh – and it helps to have a really dislikeable “other/s” leader).



Ardern will slip in popularity and part of the electorate will wake up to the lack of performance eventually, but “the great unwashed” will still love her.



If Simon was to step down tomorrow, who would they replace him with that would have **20%** higher poll results than him? Because that’s what they’ll need.



There’s nobody in their line-up, including [Judith Collins](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/judith-collins-on-climate-change/) (though she’d probably come closest despite some negatives), that would get the 30% plus needed.

Since President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord there has been talk of other countries imposing “carbon tariffs” in response. The politics of this are hard to predict. I think (and hope) that such tariffs are unlikely, although if the United States starts imposing tariffs for “national security” reasons, the chances of other countries imposing carbon tariffs on us may go up.   
  
  
But there is also an international legal question here: Wouldn’t carbon tariffs violate international trade obligations under the World Trade Organization or other trade agreements? There is some dense legal analysis of this question out there already (back when it was people in the U.S. talking about imposing these measures on others, Cato’s Sallie James published a good Policy Analysis of the issue). What I’m going to offer here is a short, non‐​legalistic explanation, which basically amounts to: It depends on how exactly the other countries go about formulating these “tariffs.”   
  
  
At one extreme, you can imagine some government somewhere being so angry with the U.S. withdrawal that it imposes an across‐​the‐​board import tariff on all U.S. imported products as a response. This blunt approach would almost certainly violate trade agreement rules.   
  
  
At the other extreme, you can also imagine a more measured approach, under which a government comes up with objective criteria to assess each country’s climate policies and carbon emissions. Carbon _taxes_ would then be imposed on products, both domestic and foreign, in a way that corresponds to these measurable criteria. This non‐​discriminatory approach might not violate trade rules, especially if its focus is on environmental impact, rather than “competitiveness.”   
  
  
The actual approach is likely to be somewhere in between, and is hard to assess in the abstract. But in general terms, here is my view: In theory, some form of “carbon tariff” could be done consistently with trade rules. However, in practice such a measure is likely to violate, as governments generally aren’t very good at being precise, objective, and non‐​discriminatory in their laws and regulations. But hopefully everyone will decide not to impose such measures, and the subject will remain an obscure academic one.

"Perhaps I was naive, but when I discovered the extent of the chemical soup applied to typical fields I was astonished. As part of our ongoing investigations into the impact of pesticides on bees, we looked at 25 fields containing winter rapeseed or winter wheat during the 2012-13 growing season. For any particular field, the list of pesticides applied is worryingly long. These are perfectly normal farms; not especially intensive, situated on the edge of the South Downs in East Sussex, an area of gentle hills, hedgerows and wooded valleys. Beautiful, rural England – Constable would have liked it here. But let’s look at it with a bee’s perspective rather than a painter’s eye. Let’s look at one fairly typical field. The rapeseed crop, whose flowers the bees will feed on in season, is sown in late summer with a seed dressing containing the insecticide thiamethoxam. This is a systemic neonicotinoid, with exceedingly high toxicity to bees. Taken up into the plant, detectable levels will be in the nectar and pollen the bees gather. In November, despite the protection supposedly offered by the neonicotinoid seed dressing the crop is sprayed with another insecticide, the endearingly named Gandalf. What harm could the wise old wizard possibly do? Gandalf contains beta-cyfluthrin, a pyrethroid. Pyrethroids are highly toxic to bees and other insects – killing insects is their job, after all – but as there should be no bees about in November that shouldn’t be a problem. The following May, while flowering, the crop is sprayed with another pyrethroid, alpha-cypermethrin. Only weeks later the crop is blitzed with three more pyrethroids just for good measure – a real belt-and-braces approach. Why use one when three will do? The crop is still flowering at this point (it was a late year), and will be crawling with foraging bumblebees, hoverflies and other pollinators. Between winter and summer, the crop is also treated with a barrage of herbicides, fungicides, molluscicides and fertilisers – 22 different chemicals in total. Most may have little toxicity to bees in themselves, but some, such as a group of fungicides (demethylation inhibiting or DMI fungicides), are known to interact with both neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, increasing their toxicity to bees. So, when the fungicide prothioconazole is added to the mix tank that includes the year’s final application of chemicals, any feeding bee will be simultaneously exposed to a barrage of three pyrethroids, the thiamethoxam from the seed casing now in the nectar and pollen, and a fungicide that amplifies the toxicity of all these chemicals. We don’t really know what impact this has. Safety tests generally expose test insects to one chemical at a time, usually for just two days, while in reality they are chronically exposed to multiple pesticides throughout their lives. The fact that bees still live in farmland suggests they’re pretty tough, but we don’t know the effects on other pollinators or wildlife. The agrochemical industry tell us all is well, but they also tell us, and the farmers they advise, that all these applications are necessary for growing crops, and that without them food production would collapse. I have my doubts. Is this really how we want the countryside managed? Do we really want to eat food produced this way? Fifty one years ago, Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring highlighted the environmental damage leading from a dependence on pesticides, including poisoning farm workers with the pesticide DDT, now banned in much of the developed world. A new approach was developed, Integrated Pest Management, or IPM. More of a philosophy than a technique, IPM’s aim is to tackle pest problems using many methods, for example using pest resistant varieties, crop rotation, sacrificial trap crops, and encouraging pests’ natural enemies. Only if all else fails and pests are in sufficient number to cause significant economic damage are pesticides applied. Everyone agreed then, and still agrees, that this is the best, most sustainable method. But while IPM of sorts is still used in some small-scale horticultural crops, mainstream arable farming has forgotten about it. Why have we gone back to prophylactic applications of dozens of different toxic chemicals? A lot of the blame lies with government. We used to have a number of state-funded experimental farms in the UK, where crop research was conducted, and there used to be an independent agricultural advisory service – almost all have been sold off. IPM research is not funded; instead the agrochemical industry has been allowed to fill the gap. Now, 75% of agronomists who provide advice to farmers work for agrochemical companies. Small wonder that farmers use lots of pesticides. One major reason not to use pesticides prophylactically – that is, “in case” of pests, rather than as a response to pests – is that pests quickly grow resistant, and eventually the pesticides become useless. Overuse would seem to be a dumb strategy for the agrochemical industry. But perhaps not. Each new compound is exclusively manufactured and sold by the company that developed it, but this exclusive right expires after a number of years, at which point anyone can manufacture it. The price drops, as do profits for the parent company – so it’s not so important if the pesticide has become ineffective. In fact if in the meantime they’ve developed a new product, then it is to their benefit. Not so good for farmers, on the other hand, who must pay the premium price for each new chemical generation. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that current farming practices are not designed to benefit farmers, who pay through the nose for expensive pesticides, or consumers, who are offered expensive, pesticide-drenched food, or the environment, which is continually contaminated with a cocktail of chemicals. It is hard to see how they are arranged for any benefit other than maximising agrochemical company profits. I think I might head home early today and finish digging over my veggie plot. At least I can control what goes into that."
"Over the past decade, Christians in the United States have grown increasingly alarmed about the persecution of other Christians overseas, especially in the Middle East. With each priest kidnapped in Syria, each Christian family attacked in Iraq or each Coptic church bombed in Egypt, the clamor for action rose. During the campaign, Donald J. Trump picked up on these fears, speaking frequently of Christians who were refused entry to the United States and beheaded by terrorists of the Islamic State: “If you’re a Christian, you have no chance,” he said in Ohio in November. Now, President Trump has followed through on his campaign promise to rescue Christians who are suffering. The executive order he signed on Friday gives preference to refugees who belong to a religious minority in their country, and have been persecuted for their religion. The president detailed his intentions during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, saying his administration is giving priority to Christians because they had suffered “more so” than others, “so we are going to help them. ” But if Mr. Trump had hoped for Christian leaders to break out in cheers, that is, for the most part, not what he has heard so far. A broad array of clergy members has strongly denounced Mr. Trump’s order as discriminatory, misguided and inhumane. Outrage has also come from some of the evangelical, Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant leaders who represent the churches most active in trying to aid persecuted Christians. By giving preference to Christians over Muslims, religious leaders have said the executive order pits one faith against another. By barring any refugees from entering the United States for nearly four months, it leaves people to suffer longer in camps, and prevents families from reuniting. Also, many religious leaders have said that putting an indefinite freeze on refugees from Syria, and cutting the total number of refugees admitted this year by 60, 000, shuts the door to those most in need. “We believe in assisting all, regardless of their religious beliefs,” said Bishop Joe S. Vásquez, the chairman of the committee on migration for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, a ministry affiliated with dozens of Christian denominations, called Friday a “shameful day” in United States history. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump’s executive order will find more support in the pews. During the campaign, Mr. Trump successfully mined many voters’ concern about national security and fear of Muslims. He earned the votes of four out of every five white evangelical Christians, and a majority of white Catholics, exit polls showed. In interviews on Sunday, churchgoers in several cities were sharply divided on the issue, including on whether Christian teachings supported giving priority to Christians. “Love thy neighbor” was cited more than once, and by both sides: It was seen as both a commandment to embrace all peoples and to defend one’s actual neighbors from harm. “You look at a city like Mosul, which is one of the oldest Christian populations in the world,” said Mark Tanner, 52, a worshiper at Buckhead Church, an evangelical church in Atlanta, referring to the besieged Iraqi city. “There’s a remnant there that want to stay there to be a Christian witness. ” “So yeah,” he continued. “We should reach out to everyone, but we have to be real about it and as far as who you let come into the country. ” Nmachi Abengowe, 62, a native of Nigeria who attends Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, cited    violence in Africa in defending Mr. Trump’s preference for Christian refugees. “They believe in jihad,” he said of Muslims. “They don’t have peace. Peace comes from Jesus Christ. ” That was not the view of Makeisha Robey, 39, who was at the Atlanta church. “I think that is just completely opposite what it means to be a Christian,” she said. “God’s love was not for you specifically. It’s actually for everyone, and it’s our job as Christians to kind of enforce that on this planet, to bring God’s love to everyone. ” John and Noreen Yarwood, who attended Mass at the   of St. Joseph, a Catholic church in Brooklyn, said they feared that a policy of preference for Christians could in practice become a preference for certain denominations of Christianity over others. “What does this administration mean by Christian?” Mr. Yarwood, 37, asked. He said that refugees are deserving of help and mercy “because of desperation and poverty,” not because of their religion. “This is not grace,” he said of the president’s order. “It doesn’t follow Christian teachings. ” Christian leaders who defended Mr. Trump’s executive order were rare this weekend. One of the few was the Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of the evangelist Billy Graham and the president of Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical aid organization. Mr. Graham has long denounced Islam as “evil,” and in July 2015 proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States as a solution to domestic terrorism, months before Mr. Trump made his first call for the same. In a statement on Saturday, Mr. Graham said of refugees, “We need to be sure their philosophies related to freedom and liberty are in line with ours. ” He added that those who followed Sharia law  —   a set of beliefs at the core of Islam  —   hold notions “ultimately incompatible with the Constitution of this nation. ” Jim Jacobson, the president of Christian Freedom International, which advocates for persecuted Christians, applauded the executive order and said, “The Trump administration has given hope to persecuted Christians that their cases will finally be considered. ” Among the claims Mr. Trump made at his campaign rallies was that the Obama administration had denied refugee status to Christians, and had given preference to Muslims. “How unfair is that? How bad is that?” he told supporters at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, interlaced with boasts about his “tremendous evangelical support. ” The contention was consistent with the conspiracy theories held by some conservative Christians that Mr. Obama was secretly a Muslim, and that he was turning a blind eye to the suffering of Christians while using the reins of government to increase the Muslim population of the United States. But the claim is simply untrue. In 2016, the United States admitted almost as many Christian refugees (37, 521) as Muslim refugees (38, 901) according to the Pew Research Center. While only about one percent of the refugees from Syria resettled in the United States last year were Christian, the population of that country is 93 percent Muslim and only 5 percent Christian, according to Pew. And leaders of several refugee resettlement organizations said during interviews that it took 18 months to three years for most refugees to go through the vetting process to get into the United States. Many Syrian Christians got into the pipeline more recently. “We have no evidence that would support a belief that the Obama administration was discriminating against Christian populations,” said the Rev. Scott Arbeiter, the president of World Relief, the humanitarian arm of National Association of Evangelicals. His organization has resettled thousands of Muslim refugees, with the help of a network of 1, 200 evangelical churches. Mr. Arbeiter said that World Relief is opposed to “any measure that would discriminate against the most vulnerable people in the world based on ethnicity, country of origin, religion, gender or gender identity. Our commitment is to serve vulnerable people without regard to those factors, or any others. ” He said that World Relief had already gathered 12, 000 signatures from evangelical Christians for a petition opposing Mr. Trump’s executive order. “We’re going to call out to our network, the 1, 200 churches that are actively involved,” he said, “and ask them to use their voices to change the narrative, to challenge the facts that drive the fear so high that people would accept this executive order. ”"
"

At the weekend’s Labour Party conference, all of their top outstanding performers got to give a speech including the Deputy Leader.



His speech is posted on their website so if you want a laugh and have masochistic tendencies you can read it in its entirety. I’ve taken one for the team and here are some of the highlights (?).



Maori are natural storytellers.



On the marae we use stories to tell our history, to teach the next generation life lessons and to let people know, in our most creative of ways, who we are and where we have come from. 



We have legends and myths about the creation of the world, that talk about Maui fishing up the North Island and creating fire for the first time. 



Everyone has a story. And right now, our party, our government is writing its own story.



Well, you’d have to say this is an admission that pretty much all evidence of Maori history is just hearsay as interpreted by various storytellers as they pass their stories on. As Kelvin points out with no ambiguity, they told their stories in “our most creative ways” with the level of creativity unlimited, along with poetic license, exaggeration and whatever other “creative ways” the storyteller might choose to use. He freely admits: “We have legends and myths about the creation of the world…” and few among us would dispute that. They do, and their myths and legends are captivating and fascinating but we already know that many of them are tall tales. How does one determine where legend and myth end and fact begins?



As he so rightly points out, “Everyone has a story and right now our party is writing its own story”. We couldn’t in all conscience disagree with that now could we? We do all have a story and there’s no doubt that Labour is writing its own as Kelvin continues:



A story that will last the ages. A story that starts something like this. 



In the beginning, before there was light – there were 9 long years of darkness. It wasn’t like a black darkness, more a dark shade of blue kinda darkness – the worst kind. Anyway, without light, people in the blue darkness struggled. Different groups tried, every 3 years, to bring light to the world. But alone, they weren’t strong enough against the dark blue nothingness. Until 2017, when Whaea Jacinda, Winitana Peters and the Kakarikis joined forces, pushing apart the darkness to let light in. 



And over 50% of the world rejoiced in their achievements. 



Yeah right! Well, he did preface his speech by admitting they’re storytellers and will tell their stories in their “most creative ways” but “50% of the world rejoiced” is bordering on insanity and suggesting they have some achievements to rejoice about is beyond fairy tales don’t you think?



But wait, there’s more



They called their caucuses together in a large round building and asked a question: Now we have light – who will help make the world a better place? Who will help usher in the age of Wellbeing? 



One man, fresh from the North came to the front of the crowd. “I, Maui, will take up this tremendous challenge. I will catch a one billion dollar fish every year for 3 years and distribute it amongst the regions so people can prosper and economic development can flourish. The leaders – Whaea Jacinda, Winitana Peters and the Kakarikis – huddled together to consider this man’s proposal. Whaea Jacinda said “I’m sure that guy is Shane Jones, not Maui” Winitana said “It’s definitely Jonesy” The Kakarikis said “one fish a year sounds like sustainable fishing to us” And Shane Jones, I mean Maui, was sent off to help the regions thrive with his PGF – his ‘pretty ginormous fish’ fund.



Sometimes, things said in jest are just simply … well …true and if it looks like a joke, maybe it’s turning out to be one? He then turns to his own achievement



Now I can see in the light, I have found that too many people are languishing in the dungeons, terrible dungeons, across this fair land. 



I would like to safely reduce the number of incarcerated people by 30% over 15 years. 



I can do this safely by taking a Maori approach, investing in rehabilitation and mental health services and treating people and not just their crimes.”



And no doubt we will soon see the results of that decision.



Kelvin then talks about Hemi (James) Shaw stepping up 



“Are you guys feeling hot?” Said Hemi from the house of Kakarikis.



“Have you noticed that the climate around us has been warming up?” “



How did those in the darkness sit around and do nothing about this warming of the globe for 9 long years?” 



Hemi then announced “I will take action against one of this generation’s most pressing issues. 



I will change the climate. I will lead climate change.”



I doubt that even Shaw ever believed or said he could change the climate but remember, this is history being taught in “our most creative of ways” (which I’m sure their conference delegates absolutely lapped up). But again wait – creative gets even better as Kelvin lists even more of their outstanding achievements



Historic investments in mental health, extending doctors’ visits, tackling climate change, we have done more in housing, the economy, in transport, infrastructure, regional development, Maori development, in trade, in wellbeing, across the board – We have done a lot – which is more than heaps. But there is still more work to do! The 9 years in darkness did more damage to our world than we could ever imagine.”



Talk is indeed cheap. I wonder if this gives you the same level of faith as it does me?

"The European Commission has presented a new climate and energy policy framework for 2030 that focuses heavily on emissions reductions. Currently the EU implements “20-20-20” targets, which require a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, an 20% increase in the share of renewables in electricity generation, and a 20% improvement in energy efficiency.  But the European Commission now intends to scrap the energy efficiency target and weaken the renewable energy target. Though the proposal includes a “binding” EU-wide renewable energy target of 27%, this would not be translated into national targets through EU legislation, leaving “flexibility” for member states.  It is questionable, however, whether flexible targets are targets at all. Of course such a move has been lobbied for by business and industry groups, such as Businesseurope, and is supported by some EU member states including the UK and the Czech Republic who argue it should be for individual nations to decide. But some economists also approve of the idea, such as Harvard’s Robert Stavins, who claims that a single emissions target “would be good news for the economy and the environment”. We should all rejoice, then? At first glance, the argument for a single greenhouse gas emissions target alone is appealing. The EU emissions trading scheme, the EU’s main instrument for driving down emissions, uses market forces. Stavins argues that adding further targets and policies for renewables and energy efficiency only distort these incentives, making them more expensive, and in turn raising the cost of reducing emissions. But this line of argument presupposes that the transition to renewables and energy efficiency improvements are seen only as means to mitigate climate change. In fact, the process of generating and distributing energy inevitably creates environmental problems, besides climate change. These occur throughout the chain of production, from extraction (for example, open pit coal mining), transport (leaking gas pipelines), combustion (local air pollution) and by-products (such as disposal of nuclear waste).  So if nuclear power is really considered an answer to climate change then we are replacing climate impacts by other kinds of environmental harm. So the idea that completely free choice of technology is only restricted by carbon pricing – an argument usually favoured by economists – could be misleading. And if producing energy means producing these environmental problems along the way, it makes sense to not only use cleaner, renewable energy sources, but also less energy in the first place. There are also economic justifications for maintaining targets for renewable energy, even if climate change was the only environmental aspect that mattered. Renewable technologies are trying to break into imperfect markets, which tend to benefit established sources such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy. This leads to low adoption of renewables. But substituting fossil fuels imported from politically unstable regions for renewables can improve energy security, reducing the costs associated with relying on others: sudden blackouts, diplomatic failures, even military interventions. (The ease with which Russia’s state-owned gas and oil firms can “turn off the taps” of supply to clients, for example, has hastened several Eastern European states’ efforts to diversify their energy mix.) But these effects are typically not fully reflected in the market price paid for energy. This represents a distorting influence of its own on the mix of energy sources and the level of energy consumption. In other words, climate change is not the only market failure to be considered. Ideally, all these matters would be addressed directly. Local air pollution would be dealt with efficiently on-site, nuclear power plant operators would provide for their own waste disposal, and imported energy such as oil and gas would be taxed to account for the environmental costs of transporting them. Of course, such a direct approach may not always be feasible. In the case of the European Commissioners’ decision, some elements may fall outside the EU’s jurisdiction – or indeed beyond the political willingness required. Under these conditions, maintaining separate targets for renewables and energy efficiency could be practical contributions. They indirectly contribute, through the effects they have on choice of energy source and level of energy consumption, to reducing many associated environmental problems. That said, large-scale renewables entail some negative effects of their own, such as increased land consumption and the ecological and aesthetic problems which that brings. There are additional obstacles that need to be tackled in order to reach a level playing field for energy. The current low carbon price of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme at only €5 per tonne implies that industry is not taking its environmental damage into account in long-term investment decisions. The financial incentive – that is, the expense of a higher carbon price – is not there to force their hand. Political support, such as the recent UK deal with French nuclear giant EDF also disadvantages renewables, to the point that supporting renewable energy sources could be seen, not as an unreasonable “subsidy”, but as an effort to level the playing field. Compared to an idealised setting from an economic textbook, this may be considered a second- or third-best choice. But then the real world hardly ever corresponds to the textbook. Finally, the way in which EU member states promote renewables can be criticised for failing to make best use of the potential for cooperation between them – a credible EU-wide target for renewables may provide a boost to cooperation, and the chance to achieve cost savings. So the European Commission needs to take a long-term perspective. This needs to look beyond just climate change, and take other real-life constraints into account. And enforceable targets and policies are the way to make that happen."

Economic reforms that began 25 years ago have transformed India. What used to be a poor, slow‐​growing country now has the third‐​largest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world with regard to purchasing power parity and is projected to be the fastest‐​growing major economy in the world in 2016 (with 7.6 percent growth in GDP). Once an object of pity, India has become an object of envy. It has been called a potential superpower and the only credible check on Chinese power in Asia in the 21st century. Hence, the United States has backed India for a permanent seat in the United Nations and has persuaded the Nuclear Suppliers Group to exempt India from the usual nuclear nonproliferation rules.



Yet India’s success has been tarnished in several areas. The past 25 years can be largely summed up as a story of private‐​sector success and government failure, of successful economic reform tainted by institutional erosion. Although many old controls have been abolished, many still continue, and a plethora of new controls have been created in areas relating to the environment, health, tribal areas, and land. What leftist critics have denounced as an era of neoliberalism is better called neo‐​illiberalism. India remains in the bottom half of countries measured by indicators of economic freedom. Social indicators of education, health, and nutrition have improved much too slowly, and India has been overtaken in some indicators by poorer Bangladesh and Nepal. The delivery of all government services remains substandard. Political interference has eroded the independence and quality of institutions ranging from the police and courts to educational and cultural institutions. India’s economic reforms over 25 years have transformed it from a low‐​income country to a middle‐​income one. But to become a high‐​income country, India must liberalize the economy much further, improve governance, and raise the quality of its institutions.



In 1991 India embarked on major reforms to liberalize its economy after three decades of socialism and a fourth of creeping liberalization. Twenty-five years later, the outcome has been an outstanding economic success. India has gone from being a poor, slow-growing country to the fastest-growing major economy in the world in 2016. The _World Economic Outlook_ for 2016 says that the United States and India are the two pillars of strength today that are helping hold up a sagging world economy.1 Once an object of pity, India has become an object of envy among developing countries; it is often called a potential superpower and is backed by the United States for a seat on the UN Security Council.



Yet those successes have been accompanied by significant failures and weaknesses in policies and institutions. The past 25 years of liberalization are largely a story of private-sector success and government failure and of successful economic reform tarnished by institutional erosion. Even as old controls have been abolished, new ones have been created, so what leftist critics call an era of neoliberalism could more accurately be called neo-illiberalism.



The quality of government services remains abysmal, and social indicators have improved much too slowly. The provision of public goods — police, judiciary, general administration, basic health and education, and basic infrastructure — has seriously lagged improvements in economic performance. Political appointees and government interference erode the independence and quality of institutions ranging from the courts and universities to health and cultural organizations. India's economic reforms have been highly successful in moving the country from low-income to middle-income status, despite little improvement in its institutions and quality of public goods. To sustain rapid growth and to become a high-income country, India will need major reforms to deepen liberalization and build high-quality institutions.



It is difficult for youngsters today to grasp that until 1990, India was famous (or perhaps infamous) as the biggest beggar in the world, seeking food aid and foreign aid from all and sundry. It was hamstrung by a million controls, imposed in the holy name of socialism and then used by politicians to create patronage networks and line their pockets. On attaining independence in 1947, Indian politicians were worried that imperial foreign rule would return in the guise of economic domination through trade and investment.



So India sought ""economic independence"" to buttress political independence, and that took the form of aiming for economic sufficiency, along with a variation on soviet-style five-year plans. India's share of global trade fell steadily from 2.2 percent at independence to 0.45 percent in 1985, and that was actually hailed as a policy triumph by Indian socialists. The public sector was supposed to gain the commanding heights of the economy. Nothing could be manufactured without an industrial license or imported without an import license, and those licenses were scarce and difficult to get. Any producers who exceeded their licensed capacity faced possible imprisonment for the sin of violating the government's sacred plan targets. India was perhaps the only country in the world where improving productivity (and hence exceeding licensed capacity) was a crime.



The underlying socialist theory was that the market could not be trusted to produce good social outcomes, so the government in its wisdom must determine where the country's scarce resources should be deployed and what exactly should be produced, in what location, and by whom. In other words, the people would be best served when they had no right to decide what to produce and no right to decide what to consume: that was all to be left to a benevolent government.2



In its first three decades after independence in 1947, the Indian economy averaged just 3.5 percent GDP growth, which was derisively called the ""Hindu rate of growth."" That was half the rate achieved by the Asian tigers.



Indian socialism reached its zenith in the 1970s, when the banks and several major industries were nationalized. The top income tax rate rose to 97.75 percent, and the wealth tax to 3.5 percent. The _Garibi Hatao_ (Abolish Poverty) slogan of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (1969-77) aimed to cut fat cats to size and create a paradise for the poor. In fact, the poverty ratio did not fall at all until 1983.



Meanwhile, the population had virtually doubled since independence in 1947, meaning that the number of poor people virtually doubled in this socialist era. There could scarcely be a crueler demonstration of how policies in the name of the poor could end up impoverishing them even further. GDP growth improved to 5.5 percent in the 1980s because of some very modest liberalization plus a government spending spree. But the spending spree was unsustainable and ended in tears and empty foreign exchange reserves in 1991.3



P. V. Narasimha Rao became prime minister in 1991. The Soviet Union was collapsing at the time, proving that more socialism could not be the solution for India's ills. Meanwhile, Deng Xiaoping had revolutionized China with market-friendly reforms. And so Indian politicians turned in the direction of the market too. India had no Thatcher or Reagan leading any ideological charge. Reform was very pragmatic, with Rao insisting he was pursuing a ""middle path"" and not a radical transformation. The Indian economy took two years to stabilize but then achieved record growth of 7.5 percent in the three years 1994-97. When the reforms began, all opposition parties had slammed them as a sellout to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But when the outcome was record GDP growth, the objections melted away in practice even if not in rhetoric. Every successive government that came to power continued down the path of economic liberalization, despite some steps backward. The reforms were erratic and half-baked but not reversed.4



The Asian financial crisis of 1997-99 laid India low, yet it proved far more resilient than other Asian nations. Soon after came two droughts (in 2000 and 2002), the dot-com collapse and global recession of 2001, and the huge global uncertainty created in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Indian economy sputtered in those difficult years, and average GDP growth slowed to 5.7 percent in 1997-2003. But then followed the global boom of 2003-8, spearheaded by China, which lifted all boats across the world. India's GDP growth soared, and it reached a peak of over 9 percent per year in the three years 2005-8.5



The euphoria of those days has now dimmed. Many serious problems arose after 2010-11, such as widespread charges of mass corruption, which led to paralysis in decisionmaking; a collapse of the public-private partnership model for infrastructure; huge bank losses; huge losses from state electricity boards giving massive subsidies and failing to check electricity theft; and major problems in land acquisition, environmental clearances, and other clearances, which led to delays that killed some capital-intensive projects. The economy slowed, and that plus the anticorruption public mood led to the crushing defeat of the Congress Party-led coalition in the 2014 election after a decade of mostly successful rule.



The new government led by Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party has sought to tackle some of the worst problems, and growth has picked up to an estimated 7.5 percent in 2015-16. That growth rate is slower than before, yet China has slowed even more dramatically to 6.5 percent. So India has become the fastest-growing major economy in the world, an unexpected and notable feat, even if it owes more to the slowing of China than to its own acceleration.6



Public anger over corruption and failed government services has risen, so the public mood in India today is far from triumphant. Although India's position in the world has been transformed beyond recognition in the past 25 years, much reform is still needed, above all reforms in governance, institutions, and the delivery of government services.



India was in such poor shape before 1991 that it takes an effort to recall how bad things were. Some of the biggest changes since then are described below.



Until 1991 many superpowers (notably the United States) equated India with Pakistan in foreign affairs, even though Pakistan had barely one-eighth of India's population. India's slow-growing, inward-looking socialism made it unimportant in global terms, save as an aid recipient. Pakistan's military ties with the United States made that country seem a more important global player. But today, the United States views India as a potential superpower. President George W. Bush backed India's entry into the nuclear club. President Barack Obama has backed India for a seat on the UN Security Council. The United States sees India as potentially the only country in Asia that can check a rising Chinese juggernaut in the 21st century. And _Newsweek_ has called India a ""potential superpower.""7



Once a poor economic laggard, India now has the third-largest GDP ($7.98 trillion) in the world in purchasing power parity terms after China and the United States (Table 1).



 **Table 1. Five Biggest Countries in Purchasing Power Parity GDP, 2015 ($ trillion)**  
  




Per capita income is up from $375 per year in 1991 to $1,700 today. India has long ceased to be a low-income country as defined by the World Bank, which uses a threshold of $1,045, and has become a middle-income country.



India's annual GDP growth rose from 3.5 percent in 1950-80 and 5.5 percent in 1980-92 to an average of 8 percent since 2003, with a peak exceeding 9 percent in the three years 2005-8 (see Table 2). The International Monetary Fund estimates India's GDP growth at 7.3 percent in 2015 and 7.5 percent in 2016, faster than China's rates (6.9 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively). In a depressed global economy, the IMF sees the United States and India as the two bright spots, as the two major economies holding up an otherwise slowing world.



 **Table 2. Annual Growth of GDP**  
  




Before 1991 India was derisively called a bottomless pit for foreign aid. Every few years, a food crisis or foreign exchange crisis would send Indian ambassadors and politicians scurrying around the world, asking like Oliver Twist for more. Today, aid has not vanished but has become irrelevant to the balance of payments or investment plans. Gross aid flows exceed $5 billion, but after debt servicing, the net inflow is barely $0.5 billion.



An unexpected new development has been the rise of India's own aid to developing countries (though some would call it quasi-commercial loans to sell Indian equipment). India's net aid giving is now well over $1 billion per year, with Bhutan ($813 million) being the biggest beneficiary in 2014-15. Prime Minister Modi has offered African countries a $10 billion combined line of credit and Bangladesh $2 billion. The country that used to be a bottomless pit for aid is now a bountiful financier.



Its commercial finance has been spurred by economic reforms that have attracted inflows of foreign exchange other than foreign aid. Total foreign investment (equity plus portfolio inflows) came to $51.2 billion in 2014-15. Foreign commercial borrowing in the same year came to $68.2 billion gross and $10.4 billion net, whereas remittances from Indians overseas exceeded $70 billion. The remittance boom was a consequence of globalization, of Indians going abroad. Remittances remained stable through the Asian financial crisis and Great Recession (2007-9) and have greatly helped counter the volatility of foreign portfolio capital (sometimes called hot money) in difficult times. Critics of globalization once claimed it would make India subservient to foreign masters. Instead, by encouraging the movement of persons and goods, it has created a remittance flow and export strength that makes foreign aid irrelevant.



In the bad old days, any major drought meant India was dependent on food aid. When two droughts occurred in a row, as in 1965 and 1966, India survived only because of record food aid from the United States. A 1967 best-selling book by William and Paul Paddock declared that simply not enough food aid existed to save all needy countries, and so hopeless countries like India should be left to starve, conserving food aid for countries that were capable of survival.8



The Green Revolution made India first self-sufficient and then a surplus producer of food. India suffered two consecutive droughts in 2014 and 2015, yet agricultural production actually rose slightly; India became the world's largest rice exporter in 2015, exporting 10.23 million tons. India has also become a substantial exporter of wheat and maize in recent years. That is a measure of its agricultural transformation. Paddock and Paddock never imaged that India, which swallowed almost the entire food aid of the world in the mid-1960s, would become a donor of food aid to North Korea in 2010.



India's poverty ratio did not improve at all between independence in 1947 and 1983; it remained a bit under 60 percent. Meanwhile, the population virtually doubled, meaning the absolute number of poor people doubled. That was a cruel reflection of the failure of the socialist slogan _Garibi Hatao_ (Abolish Poverty). Poverty started declining gradually after 1983, but the big decline came after economic liberalization. In the seven years between 2004-5 and 2011-12, no fewer than 138 million Indians rose above the poverty line (Table 3).



 **Table 3. India's Poverty Decline (Tendulkar Committee Methodology)**  
  




India's poverty decline was 0.7 percentage points per year between 1993-94 and 2004-5, when GDP growth averaged about 6 percent per year. The annual rate of decline accelerated to 2.2 percent between 2004-5 and 2011-12, when GDP growth accelerated to over 8 percent per year. The link between fast growth and poverty reduction is striking.9



Between 2004-5 and 2011-12, the all-India poverty ratio fell by 15.7 percent. The decline was much higher at 21.5 percent for Dalits (the lowest Indian caste group) and 17.0 percent for scheduled tribes, traditionally the two poorest groups in India. The decline in the poverty ratio of the upper castes was much lower, at 10.5 percent. Muslims are another historically disadvantaged group. Their poverty ratio declined in that seven-year period by 18.2 percent, faster than the 15.6 percent for Hindus. In as many as seven states, Muslims are less poor than Hindus.10



Table 4 shows a sharp decline in the proportion of people saying they have been hungry in some or all months — from 17.3 percent in 1983 to 2.5 percent in 2004-5. That statistic should be regarded as solid proof of falling hunger. Yet the International Food Policy Research Institute now publishes a supposed _Global Hunger Index_ in which India fares rather badly with a score of 29 (on a scale ranging from zero for no hunger to 100 for complete hunger) against 12.6 for South Africa, 8.6 for China, 6.6 for Russia and less than 5.0 for Brazil.11 That hunger index completely ignores data from India's National Sample Survey Office data showing that very few Indians declare that they are hungry.



 **Table 4. Fewer Households Report Any Hunger in Preceding 12 Months**  
  




 _The Global Hunger Index_ is actually more a measure of nutritional indicators such as underweight and undersized children, and those characteristics are by no means the same thing as hunger. Small size can have genetic roots, as has been argued by Niti Aayog (the new name for a reformed planning commission) chair Arvind Panagariya.12 Besides, research by Dean Spears in India has proved conclusively that even when people get enough calories, open defecation and the disease it spreads prevent the body from absorbing the nutrients.13 The problem, then, is not hunger so much as terrible sanitation. Focusing on hunger instead of sanitation amounts to barking up the wrong tree. The hunger ratio in India has fallen so low that National Sample Survey Office surveys no longer bother to measure it.



In 1991, it took two years for anyone to get a telephone landline connection. N. R. Narayana Murthy, head of top software company Infosys, recalls that in the 1980s, it took him three years to get permission to import a computer and over one year to get a telephone connection.14



Today, the cell phone revolution means instant access to communication even in remote villages. The number of cell phone connections has just exceeded one billion. India has among the cheapest cell phone rates in the world, barely two cents per minute, and second-hand cell phones cost just $5, so even the poor can afford to make calls. That advancement has facilitated migration out of and remittances to poor areas. Once unconnected India is now globally connected.



In 1991 India's main exports were textiles and cut-and-polished gems. Today, its main exports are computer software, other business services, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and auto components. Most developing countries grew fast by harnessing cheap labor. India never did so, because its rigid labor laws inhibited labor flexibility, and they still do so today. Software and business services are estimated at $108 billion in 2015-16, up from virtually nothing in 1991. The range of business services has expanded from call centers and clerical work to high-end financial, medical, and legal work. Credit ratings agencies like Moody's and Standard and Poor's, which once gave India very poor ratings, now do a significant amount of their work out of India.



In 1991 Indian companies used obsolete technologies based on ancient licensing agreements and did very little research and development. Today, India has emerged as a global research and development (R&D) hub. General Electric has located one of its five global R&D centers in Bengaluru. Suzuki and Hyundai have made India a hub for small-car research and production. Microsoft and IBM are among the global companies using India as an R&D base.



Imports and exports, of both goods and services, have soared as a proportion of GDP because of India's opening up and consequent globalization. The World Bank estimates that in the period 2011-15, India's total trade (imports and exports) as a proportion of GDP was 49 percent, higher than the only two other continental-sized economies: China (42 percent) and the United States (30 percent). Many Indian politicians are still instinctively protectionist, yet the data show how much opening up has already happened.15



India has become a global hub for computer software development. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, IBM, Accenture, and other top international companies use India as a base. IBM has more employees in India than in the United States, because Indian skills are often as good as — and much cheaper than — those in the West. That fact has led to many complaints that IBM is shifting jobs to India. Many Indian engineers and scientists who used to work for multinationals abroad have returned to work in the companies' Indian subsidiaries and branches. The former brain drain has turned into brain circulation.16 The _Guardian_ carried an analysis titled ""India Is an Emerging Geek Power.""



India is now a low-cost commercial satellite launcher. By October 2015, it had launched 51 satellites for foreign countries, with payloads of less than 1,600 kilograms. To gain market share, it needs to develop payload capacity of over 3,000 kilograms, and building that capacity is a work in progress.17



In 1991 India produced fewer than 50,000 engineers per year, mostly from government colleges. India's economic success after 1991 has spurred the creation of thousands of private engineering colleges, with estimated admissions of 1.5 million students per year.18 The quality of the colleges is spotty, often dreadful. One oft-quoted rule of thumb is that half the graduates are useless, a quarter are usable, and a quarter are world-class. That outlook suggests massive waste. Yet producing up to a quarter million world-class engineers per year is a very solid base for future progress.



In 1991 Indian politicians and industrialists feared that economic liberalization would mean the collapse of Indian industry or its conversion into subsidiaries of multinational companies. Twenty-five years later, Indian companies not only have held their own but also have become multinationals in their own right. Dozens of Indian pharmaceutical companies — such as Sun Pharma, Cipla, Lupin, and Dr. Reddy's Labs — are now multinationals with higher sales abroad than in India. Through acquisitions, ArcelorMittal became the biggest steel company in the world. The Tata Group acquired Corus Steel and Jaguar Land Rover and in the process became the largest private-sector employer in the United Kingdom. Today, the global slump in metals and the dumping by China have made many acquisitions that were completed in the boom years look like bad deals. Yet the fact remains that Indian companies are now viewed as having global management skills worthy of global takeovers. Ironically, although Tata has decided to sell its steel assets in the United Kingdom, one of the potential buyers is Liberty House, founded by another person of Indian origin, Sanjeev Gupta.19



India is about to reap a demographic dividend that will give it a big edge over rivals. The number of working-age people between 15 and 60 is expected to rise by 280 million between 2013 and 2050, even as China's workforce dwindles from 72 percent to 61 percent of a soon-to-be declining population.20 All the Asian tigers enjoyed a demographic dividend in their boom years, and all are aging now.



India's working-age population has started rising, yet participation in the workforce has actually fallen in recent years, especially for females. The reason is partly that more young people are now studying in high school and college instead of working. It is partly because, as families rise from low-income to lower-middle-income status, they pull their women out of manual work as a mark of social superiority. Indeed, young women who do not work can expect to get a better class of husbands in the arranged marriages that dominate Indian social behavior. However, as families move up to upper-middle-class status, their daughters become college graduates and re-enter the workforce. That change means that India's demographic dividend has been delayed, but will soon come, and its quality will improve because its workforce will be better educated. That holds promise for future GDP growth.



As Table 5 shows, the male work participation rate has remained unchanged in rural areas and has risen marginally in urban areas since 1983. But the rural female participation rate has crashed from 32.7 percent in 2004-5 to 24.8 percent 2011-12, a huge withdrawal, whereas the urban female rate — always among the lowest in the world — is down from 16.6 percent to 14.7 percent. Given that India has roughly 600 million females, the data suggest that over 40 million women pulled out of the workforce between 2004 and 2012. That number is more than the entire female population of all but a handful of countries in the world. That factor makes India's rapid GDP growth in the 2000s even more remarkable: all other miracle economies in Asia had rapid increases in workforce participation in their fast-growing phase.21



 **Table 5. Male and Female Work Participation Rates in India**  
  




A sudden scarcity of rural labor has helped raise rural wages quickly, a phenomenon buttressed by rapid GDP growth and a National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ensuring 100 days of work per family on government projects after 2008. During the 11th five-year plan (2007-12), nominal farm wages in India increased by 17.5 percent per year, and real farm wages by 6.8 percent per year, the fastest growth ever. Those wage increases were an important cause of the record drop in poverty.22



The Indian word _jugaad_ has crept into management literature. It originated when Indian farmers wanted an inexpensive vehicle and got the idea of strapping an irrigation pump on a steel frame with four wheels to create a functioning vehicle called a _jugaad_. Many variations of that vehicle are assembled by small local companies in many rural towns using spare parts of existing vehicles. It represents grassroots homegrown ingenuity. The vehicle can ferry goods or carry up to 50 passengers.



 _Jugaad_ no longer means just the original vehicle. It has now come to mean, simply, innovation around obstacles of all sorts — in designing, selling, managing, and even surmounting government controls. Thus, _jugaad_ includes forms of corruption and tax evasion no less than frugal engineering. By solving problems by hook or by crook, it raises moral issues but gets things done under the most difficult conditions.23



India has become a world leader in frugal engineering, a concept that did not exist in 1991. Frugal engineering is the capacity to design and produce goods that are not just 10-15 percent cheaper than in Western countries but 50-90 percent cheaper. Tata Motors has produced the cheapest car in the world, the Nano, which costs $2,000. It was a commercial flop and did not meet Indian consumer aspirations. But it was nevertheless an engineering feat. Bajaj Auto has developed a low-cost quadricycle that could put three-wheelers and small cars out of business. India's telecom industry is the cheapest in the world, with calls costing just two cents per minute. The Jaipur Foot is an Indian artificial limb that is sold at 100th the price of competing artificial limbs in the United States. Narayana Hrudayalaya and Aravind Netralaya are hospitals that provide heart and eye surgery, respectively, at one twentieth or less of the cost of surgery in the West — one reason for the emergence of what is now called medical tourism.24



The Bombay Stock Exchange, set up in 1875, is one of Asia's oldest. Yet before the economic reforms of the 1990s, it was viewed as a snake pit. A handful of brokers could rig prices at will, fake share certificates abounded, and settlement periods were extended for months on end if that suited the brokers controlling the exchange. A major scandal in 1992 — when broker Harshad Mehta shamelessly rigged the market using illegal borrowings from government banks — led to a stock market overhaul. Various financial agencies created a completely new National Stock Exchange with high technical and ethical standards. It was fully electronic, with no trading floor at all, and bids and offers were matched automatically by computer, preventing a lot of old-style rigging. The National Stock Exchange went fully electronic before London and New York did: it was a state-of-the-art exchange, a rare case when India leapfrogged global bourses.



That change both slashed costs and ended most forms of rigging. The Securities and Exchange Board of India was created, along the lines of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States, and gradually brought order and trustworthy practices that were earlier absent. It decreed that paper share certificates must be dematerialized and held in electronic form by depositories, to end the menace of fake certificates. Settlement periods were compressed dramatically to T+2 (payment two days after a transaction), among the fastest rates of settlement in the world (the United States still has a T+3 period). To survive, the Bombay Stock Exchange had to clean up its act and also go electronic. So since the 1990s, India has developed one of the most efficient stock markets in Asia. The daily turnover has gone from a few million dollars to over $100 billion, which explains why portfolio flows into India have been among the highest in Asia.25



Before 1991 very high tax rates (up to a 58 percent corporate tax) plus a high wealth tax meant that businesses kept income off the books. Many listed companies diverted profits into the hands of controlling families by dubious means, cheating minority shareholders. Improving shareholder value meant higher stock market prices, which would have been welcomed in other countries but constituted a recipe for personal bankruptcy in India. High share prices meant high wealth tax liabilities that required promoters to sell shares to pay the tax, with the prospect of losing control.



After 1991 direct tax rates gradually came down substantially (to 30 percent plus surcharges for individuals and corporations). The wealth tax on shares was abolished, making it possible to raise shareholder value without being penalized for it. Indeed, by keeping all profits in a company instead of milking them, a company could raise share prices and attract foreign investors at a handsome premium, making honesty an ingredient for success. Foreign investors soon started paying much higher prices for companies with good governance than those with dodgy tactics.



So corporate honesty began to be rewarded for the first time, and that (rather than any moral imperative) made Indian business cleaner. It attracted household investment and enabled ordinary citizens to participate in the stock market boom that raised the Sensex (India's equivalent to the Dow Jones Index in the United States) from just 1,000 in 1991 to 28,000 in 2015. The corporate tax was cut from a maximum of 58 percent to 30 percent, yet corporate tax collections increased from 1 percent of GDP to almost 6 percent at one point. That was a major reason for the revenue boom that facilitated increased spending on education, health, and infrastructure.



Personal income tax rates also fell from 50 percent to 30 percent, but once again collections rose, from 1 percent of GDP to almost 2 percent. For the first time, real estate transactions in some cities were conducted entirely by check: earlier, a big chunk of the sale price was paid in black cash to escape high capital gains taxes and the stamp duty. The Bollywood film industry, once run entirely on black money financed by the underworld, is today reputed to make payments to top stars almost entirely by check.26



In many developing countries, a handful of crony capitalists (like Pakistan's notorious 22 families) have dominated industries, thanks to their political contacts. India was no exception until 1991, because the license-permit raj made all clearances a favor to those with clout. But since then, economic liberalization has facilitated the rise to the top of a vast array of new entrepreneurs. The best known are in software (such as Infosys, Wipro, and HCL), but many have also emerged in pharmaceuticals, as discussed earlier; in infrastructure (Adani, L&T); telecommunications (Bharti Airtel); steel (Jindal, Bhushan); and finance (ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank, Yes Bank).



Most amazing of all has been the rise of Internet-based companies like Flipkart, Snapdeal, MakeMyTrip, Paytm, Ola Cabs, Zomato, Jabong, Naukri.com, and others, each valued at billions of dollars by international investors. Their market value vastly exceeds that of most traditional big business houses.



Some of the new businesspeople (notably in real estate and infrastructure) are called crony capitalists, and certainly they have strong political contacts. Yet they don't get safe monopolies in return (as in Mexico), and many of them have suffered disastrous falls in recent years (such as DLF, Unitech, Lanco, and IVRCL).



Kickbacks in India are more accurately called extortion by politicians than classical cronyism, because the returns to kickbacks are uncertain and sometimes disastrously negative. Economic liberalization and competition have led to the crash and sometimes bankruptcies of famous old companies (Hindustan Motors, Premier Automobiles, JK Synthetics, DCM), indicating stiff competition and survival only of the fittest. Of the 30 companies constituting the Sensex in 1991, only 9 were still there two decades later. This business churn indicates healthy competition across industry as a whole. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said of the new entrepreneurs: ""These are not the children of the wealthy. They are the children of liberalization.""27



Economic liberalization has benefited Dalits, the lowest of the Hindu castes, once condemned to the dirtiest work, such as cleaning latrines, cremating the dead, and handling dead animals and their hides. A seminal survey in two districts of Uttar Pradesh revealed striking improvements in the living standards of Dalits in the past two decades. TV ownership was up from zero to 45 percent, cell phone ownership was up from zero to 36 percent, two-wheeler ownership (of motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds) was up from zero to 12.3 percent, and children eating yesterday's leftovers was down from 95.9 percent to 16.2 percent.



Even more striking was the improvement in Dalits' social status. The proportion of cases in which Dalits were seated separately at weddings was down from 77.3 percent to 8.9 percent. The proportion of non-Dalits accepting food and drink at a Dalit house went up from 8.9 percent to 77.3 percent. _Halwaha_ (bonded labor) incidence was down from 32 percent to 1 percent. The proportion of Dalits using cars for wedding parties was up from 33 percent to almost 100 percent. Dalits running their own businesses went up from 6 percent to 37 percent. And the proportion of Dalits working as agricultural laborers was down from 46.1 percent to 20.5 percent.



Beyond all expectation, thousands of Dalits have emerged as millionaire businesspeople and established a Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Its president, Milind Kamble, says that just as capitalism killed feudalism, it is also killing casteism. In the fierce competition of a free market, what matters is suppliers' prices not their caste. This fierce competition, brought about by economic reforms, has opened new commercial space that did not exist during the license-permit raj, and Dalits have been able to occupy part of the new space.28



In the two decades since 1991, India's literacy rate has shot up by a record 21.8 percentage points, to 74 percent (see Table 6). In the earlier two decades, it rose by less: 17.8 percentage points. India's literacy rate remains poor by global standards, but it has improved much faster in the era of reform than in the earlier era of socialism.



 **Table 6. Literacy Growth in India (%)**  
  




In the past decade, the improvement in all-India literacy (9.7 percentage points) was vastly exceeded by several poor backward states — Bihar (16.8), Uttar Pradesh (11.5), Orissa (10.4), and Jharkhand (16.1). Female literacy improved even more dramatically, by 11.8 percentage points across India, and at still higher rates in Bihar (20.2), Uttar Pradesh (17.1), Orissa (13.9), and Jharkhand (15.3).



Life expectancy in India is up from an average of 58.6 years in 1986-91 to 68.5 years. Infant mortality is down from 87 deaths per 1,000 births to 40. These are major improvements. Yet they lag well behind achievements in other countries.29



Despite 25 years of economic reform, India remains substantially unfree and plagued by poor governance and pathetic delivery of all government services.



Leftist critics accuse India of going down the path of neoliberalism. The actual process could better be called neo-illiberalism. Although many old controls and licenses have indeed been abolished over the past 25 years, many new controls and bureaucratic hurdles have appeared, mostly in such areas as the environment, forests, tribal rights, and land and in new areas like retail, telecom, and Internet-related activities. Many state governments have failed to liberalize sufficiently. Hence, entrepreneurs complain bitterly of red tape and corruption.



A survey conducted in January 2016 by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy showed that projects worth Rs 10.7 trillion ($160 billion) were stuck for various reasons, up from Rs 10.5 trillion ($158 billion) in September 2015.30 The Heritage Foundation's _Economic Freedom Index_ places India at just 123rd out of 178 countries. Of the foundation's five categories — free, mostly free, moderately free, mostly unfree, and repressed — India falls into the ""mostly unfree"" category. The Fraser Institute's index of economic freedom ranks India at 114th of 157 countries. India's freedom score as calculated by the Fraser Institute has actually declined in recent years, from a peak of 6.71 in 2005 to 6.43 in 2013.31



The World Bank's 2016 _Doing Business_ report puts India at 130th of 189 countries in the ease of doing business in the country. That change is an improvement from its earlier 142nd position, but it still leaves India in the bottom half of countries. India ranks especially low in the ease of getting construction permits (183rd), enforcing contracts (178th), paying taxes (157th), and starting a business (155th).32



Markets cannot function without good governance. With almost no exceptions, the delivery of government services in India is pathetic, from the police and judiciary to education and health. Unsackable government staff members have no accountability to the people they are supposed to serve, and so callousness, corruption, and waste are common. Politicians like a patron-client system in which they earn gratitude by helping constituents and sundry groups through the many controls and permits, rather than abolishing the controls and permits, which would level the playing field but also leave them less powerful.



 **The judicial system is a mess.** Justice is supposed to be blind. In India, it is also lame. India holds the world record for legal case backlogs (31.5 million), which will take 320 years to clear, according to Andhra Pradesh high court judge V. V. Rao. India's Law Commission has recommended the appointment of 50 judges per million population (in the United States, the ratio is much higher at 107 per million). The current sanctioned judicial strength is just 17 per million, and unfilled vacancies are as high as 23 percent in the lower courts, 44 percent in high courts, and 19 percent in the Supreme Court. No wonder the staggering backlog of cases does not diminish, and most people are reluctant to litigate to redress their grievances.33 The lower courts are hotbeds of corruption, and recently senior lawyers such as Prashant Bhushan have alleged that even Supreme Court judges are corrupt.



Lengthy procedures and constant adjournments mean that cases can linger for decades or even more than a century. In the case of the 1975 murder of L. N. Mishra, a prominent politician, 20 different judges took 38 years to reach a verdict, although the case was supposed to be heard on a day-by day basis. Of the 39 witnesses called by the defense, 31 died before the case ended. When the accused sought to have the case dismissed saying the long delay had made justice impossible, the court declared that 38 years was by no means too long.34



However, there are two bright spots. First, the judiciary is quick to decide on writ petitions against arbitrary government action, which has proved a great comfort to investors. Second, faced with an incompetent and corrupt administration that fails to deliver, judicial activism has frequently taken the shape of orders to the government on executive matters. Purists will object that the judiciary should stay within its area and not interfere in the executive branch. But for many Indians, court activism is the only way to get redress from a callous administration.35



 **The police system is a mess.** India has 123 policemen per 100,000 population, almost half the UN recommended level of 220 and far below the levels in the United States (352) and Germany (296). Huge unfilled vacancies are common in all states. In Uttar Pradesh, a state of 200 million people, the overall shortage is 43 percent, with the shortage of head constables being 82 percent and inspectors 73 percent.36 The police are notoriously inefficient and corrupt. In many states, they will not even register complaints without a bribe.



N. C. Saxena, who headed the 1962 National Police Commission, once wrote that the police had ceased to regard crime detection and criminal conviction as their key goals. The reason was that the agenda of home ministers in every state was very different. The top priority of home ministers was to use the police to harass political opponents. The second priority was to use the police and prosecutors to tone down or dismiss cases against their own parties and coalition members. The third priority was to use police for VIP security. And the last priority was to use police for crime detection — which yielded no political dividends and so received the least attention.



One consequence of a lousy police force and lousy courts is that virtually no influential person gets convicted beyond all appeals: he or she is likely to die of old age first. The system rewards lawbreakers and penalizes law abiders. And that erodes every walk of life from business and politics to education and health. Without better governance, economic liberalization will not work properly, because the first assumption of all market economics is the existence of rule of law. If not, the quasi-mafia and crony capitalists will rule supreme.37



 **Politics are criminalized.** In India, criminals take part in politics and often become cabinet ministers. That gives them huge clout and ensures that charges against them are not pursued. An analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms looked at 541 of the 543 members of Parliament elected in 2014 and found 186 had criminal cases pending. In the earlier 2009 election, the figure was 158. Of the winners in 2014, 112 have been charged with serious offenses, such as murder, kidnapping, and crimes against women. Some of those charges may be false but not most. No party is clean — all have criminals aplenty, since those people provided money, muscle, and patronage networks that every party finds useful.38



Only institutional change can break the criminalization of politics. Exposure of criminal cases is not enough. India needs a new law mandating that all cases against elected members of Parliament and members of the Legislative Assemblies will receive top priority and will be heard on a day-by-day basis until completed. That law will make electoral victory a curse for criminals — it will expedite their trials instead of giving them the political immunity they seek. If such a law is enacted, we may well see criminal legislators and ministers resigning in order to get off the priority trials list. Such a reform can truly transform the existing perverse incentives.



 **Corruption has experienced a recent backlash.** Corruption in countries often gallops upward with GDP, and India in the past 25 years has been no exception. In one sex scandal, the governor of a state had to resign after the madam of a brothel circulated photos of him with three naked girls. Why did she do so? Because the governor had promised her a mining license, and when he failed to deliver, she exposed him in revenge. Only in India is the supply of naked girls a potential qualification for getting a mining license.39



The comptroller and auditor general (CAG), who for decades had produced little-read audits of government finances, suddenly started calculating the possible revenue lost by the government by allocating spectrum on a ""first come, first served basis"" (in reality favoring friends who were tipped off on the deadline) instead of auctioning it. He estimated the loss at Rs 1.76 trillion ($26.2 billion). Later, the CAG estimated the loss to the government from coal mines being ""allotted"" by ministerial discretion instead of being auctioned at Rs 1.86 trillion ($27.8 billion).



The Supreme Court joined the anticorruption party by castigating discretionary allotments of any natural resource and cancelling spectrum licenses for which foreign companies had paid millions of dollars. The court also held individual bureaucrats responsible, sending a chill through the entire bureaucracy, which hitherto had assumed they were protected by the decisions of their ministers.



An anticorruption crusade led by Anna Hazare, a veteran social activist, attracted massive public response. The anticorruption uproar led to complete paralysis in decisionmaking: no bureaucrat or minister wanted to sign any file for fear of being accused of corruption. The stink of corruption led to the decimation of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government in the 2014 election, which brought Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party to power.40



Critics claim that economic reforms brought in the massive corruption. In fact, areas that were comprehensively liberalized saw the disappearance of corruption. Before 1991, bribes were needed for industrial licenses, import licenses, foreign exchange allotments, credit allotments, and much else. But economic reform ended industrial and import licensing, and foreign exchange became freely available. Lower import and excise duties ended most smuggling and excise tax evasion. However, the economic boom hugely raised the value of all natural resources and the telecommunication spectrum, thus raising kickbacks for their allotments.



Many infrastructure areas earlier reserved for the government were opened to private-sector participation, often in public-private partnerships, and many of them were bedeviled by crony capitalism. Businesspeople said most areas became cleaner after liberalization, but some areas worsened — namely, natural resources, real estate (which was always highly corrupt and highly regulated), and government contracts. Transparency International's _Corruption Perception Index_ rated India 34th of 41 countries in its first report in 1995, improving to 45th of 52 countries in 1997. Its position further improved to 84th of 168 countries in 2015 and stood at 76th of 168 countries in 2016. So India has moved from being in the bottom quintile of countries to the top half. Extensive corruption in recent years in some sectors cloaks a general improvement in the fully liberalized sectors.41



Narendra Modi was elected on an anticorruption platform, and businesspeople say extensive corruption has largely ended in New Delhi. But it continues in state capitals that control 62 percent of all government spending. And for the average person, the worst corruption is that of low-level government functionaries.



Even as liberalization has abolished regulations and associated corruption in traditional areas, it has seen the rise of hundreds of new controls related to the environment, health, safety, forests, tribal areas, and land acquisition. Every year, the central and state legislatures enact more laws and regulations without abolishing thousands of obsolete ones. Many state governments have brought in new price controls. So India remains a difficult country in which to do business.



 **Lousy government services lead to lousy social indicators.** The quality of the delivery of government services remains poor. The big improvements in private-sector competitiveness are not even remotely replicated in government service competitiveness. India's social indicators remain dismal. It has slipped even compared with the other five countries of South Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka — see Table 7.) Yet India has the fastest economic growth in South Asia. Back in 1990, only one of its neighbors, Sri Lanka, had better social indicators, but now India looks to be second worst, ahead of only trouble-torn Pakistan.



Indian social indicators have improved faster in the past 25 years of liberalization than in the earlier socialist era, but the improvement is clearly insufficient. Government services of all sorts remain basically unreformed and are delivered by a callous, unsackable bureaucracy. Prime Minister Modi shows no sign of taking on this bureaucracy. Chief ministers who have tried to take on the trade unions of the civil service have typically been forced to retreat.

Surveys have shown that half of government schools have no teaching activity at all: teacher absenteeism is chronic, which induces high pupil absenteeism.42 Teachers in government schools are highly paid even by international standards, yet they neglect their duties with impunity. As Table 8 shows, the ratio of teacher salaries to GDP is an average of 3.0 in nine major states, against just 1.2 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 0.9 in China, 1.5 in Japan, and 1.0 in Bangladesh and Pakistan.



 **Table 8. Primary School Teacher Salaries as Ratio of per Capita GDP**  
  




Note: OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.



Many teachers are deep into politics, and many become legislators. Teachers staff polling booths during elections, which is one reason no party wants to crack down on teachers: they may retaliate by collaborating with rivals in stuffing ballots. Yet these same teachers often do not teach at all: desperate poor families are pulling their children out of free but useless government schools and putting them in private schools, which are somewhat better. One study of 74 countries (the Program for International Student Assessment PISA Plus survey of 2009) placed India last, even though India in this case was represented by its two best states. The government's reaction was to stop participating in future surveys.43



In 2015 India's _Annual Status of Education Report_ said that only 48.1 percent of children in their fifth school year could read a text appropriate for their second school year. Arithmetic remains a challenge. Only 44.1 percent of Class 8 students in rural India managed to solve a division problem in 2014, compared with 46 percent in 2013.



India's public spending on health, which elsewhere commonly provides health care access to the poor, has always been among the lowest in the world. India has world-class hospitals for the elite, but the masses are at the mercy of quacks and dubious practitioners of traditional indigenous medicine. Table 9 shows how far India lags behind other regions in public health spending.



 **Table 9. Public Health Spending as a Percentage of GDP**  
  




Given this low rate of public spending, the quality of public health is poor, and health indicators in India are typically worse than in neighboring countries of South Asia. India has some of the worst nutritional indicators in the world. Anemia affects over 80 percent of the population in several states, including many in the richest one-third. Child malnutrition, measured by low weight for age, affects 46.7 percent of all Indian children, worse than in most African countries.



A family health survey suggests that virtually no improvement in child malnutrition occurred between 1998-99 and 2005-6, despite rapid GDP growth. However, data from the National Nutritional Monitoring Board show some improvement. By global standards, Indian children suffer from stunting, low weight, and wasting. The puzzle is that malnutrition and anemia affect high-income groups too. Calorie intake is falling despite rising income — poor people want to switch to superior, tasty foods rather than get more nutrients out of basic foods. One reason for the measured malnutrition is that open defecation spreads diseases that inhibit the absorption of food nutrients. Better sanitation is vital and is a public health issue. Nutrition is a bigger problem than hunger, so nutritional education and fortification of food with vitamins, iron, and iodine should be on the agenda.44



Subsidies, freebies, and waste are still a problem. Formal subsidies as defined by the central government have fallen from 2.5 percent of GDP to 1.6 percent. But that definition excludes a variety of goods and services provided below cost, and which are often free. The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy has estimated subsidies, broadly defined as nonrecovered costs of services and goods, at 13.4 percent of GDP, of which barely half are for merit goods and half are for nonmerit goods.



Subsidies for public health education and basic services are surely warranted. But many other subsidies are nonmerit goods, and they include free or highly subsidized electricity and water, fertilizers and petroleum products, higher education, food and other benefits for well-off people, and a bewildering variety of freebies given by various state governments.



The latest election manifesto of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which rules the state of Tamil Nadu, includes the following freebies: cell phones for ration card holders, laptops with Internet connections for 10th- and 12th-grade students, maternity assistance of Rs 18,000 ($269), increased maternity leave (from six to nine months), 100 free electricity units every two months, waiver of all farm loans (at a cost of Rs 400 billion or $5.9 billion), increased fisher folk assistance to Rs 5,000 ($75), a 50 percent subsidy for women to buy mopeds or scooters, an eight-gram gold coin for women getting married, and a free woman's kit, including sanitary napkins. Note that the state government already provides 20 kilos of free rice per family; a free mixer, grinder, and fan per family; subsidized kitchens; and subsidized goats or cows for rural families.45



The most important government programs, like subsidized food and a rural employment guarantee scheme, are plagued by waste, corruption, ghost rolls, and a huge leakage of benefits. The government itself estimates that it takes three rupees (Rs) to get one rupee to the poor. The list of subsidies and freebies excludes tax breaks of all sorts, many of which make no sense, estimated at Rs 623 billion (US$9.3 billion) in the 2016 budget. Losses of state electricity boards have soared to Rs 3 billion (US$44.8 million). A scheme for cleaning up electricity losses has been launched but is likely to fail, as did an earlier rescue in 2002. The fertilizer subsidy alone has sometimes been 1.5 percent of GDP, more than all public health spending combined.46 Subsidized fertilizer is being smuggled out to Bangladesh, a poorer country that has no such subsidy. Recent studies show that subsidized farm credit is being diverted by farmers to nonfarm uses, and some farmers simply borrow cheap and on-lend at higher rates.47



Political parties know subsidies are excessive and irrational but claim they have to continue them to survive in elections. Competition for freebies is a political race to the fiscal bottom. And it has no easy fixes in a democracy. Consequently, the limited resources of a still-poor country are constantly being wasted on a massive scale instead of being used to build the economy, social infrastructure, and effective safety nets. 



**The infrastructure is a mess.** Poor infrastructure is India's Achilles' heel. Any time economic growth takes off, it runs into an infrastructure constraint. From 2004 to 2014, the government aimed to overcome the problem through a massive expansion of public-private partnerships and boasted that India had more such partnerships than any other country. Alas, many of them are now bust, and many others have been abandoned.



The 12th five-year plan (2012-17) envisaged $1 trillion of investment in infrastructure, of which half was to come from the private sector. That goal now sounds like a pathetic joke. The gargantuan losses of many infrastructure companies now threaten to sink the banks that lent to them. About 10-20 percent of the loans of public-sector banks have been restructured or are under some form of stress.



With the slowdown of economic growth after 2008, many infrastructure projects suffered from excess capacity. Delays in land acquisition and environmental clearance plunged others into the red. No less than 30,000 megawatts of power capacity was stranded for want of coal and natural gas. State electricity boards have given massive subsidies to farmers and other users and have simply not paid power distribution companies, which have racked up Rs 3 trillion ($44.8 billion) in losses.



In India, delays in clearances and land acquisition make early stages of infrastructure very risky. Yet such projects have historically had a high debt-to-equity ratio, so any delay is financially fatal. The Modi administration has given the government a major role in financing fresh equity in infrastructure, with the private sector mainly executing government contracts. Clearances and land acquisition have picked up. Bank loans to state electricity boards have largely been replaced by state bonds, relieving bank stress.



Arvind Panagariya, head of Niti Aayog, details the plan to eliminate rail capacity and speed issues:



Of stuck projects worth Rs 3.8 trillion, this government has already unblocked Rs 3.5 trillion worth of projects. Consequently, road construction has risen from 8.5 kilometers a day during the last two years of the previous government to 11.9 kilometers in 2014–15 and 16.5 kilometers in 2015–16. The construction of national highway projects awarded has risen from 3,500 kilometers in 2013–14 to 8,000 kilometers in 2014–15 and 10,000 kilometers in 2015–16. The average rate of expansion of rail tracks has risen to 7 kilometers per day … the construction of the first high‐​speed rail between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the modernization of 400 major railway stations, the construction of dedicated eastern and western freight corridors of 1,305 km and 1,499 kilometers, respectively, and laying down of 1,875 kilometers of new railway lines.48



Public‐​private partnership projects are picking up once more but have the potential to once again get bogged down, and any rescues will raise outcries that crony capitalism has returned. The current practice of auctioning such projects at a fixed tariff for 25 years does not work, since conditions keep changing, and any change in contract draws accusations of crony capitalism. India needs an independent institution that can renegotiate infrastructure projects and be seen to be honest.49



The land problem is being overcome by replacing forcible land acquisition by voluntary land pooling, in which farmers give up land but get back a part of it after development, which has commonly increased the land price tenfold. The new capital of Andhra Pradesh has acquired over 30,000 acres through land pooling.50



Coal production rose by 32 million tons in 2014–15 against an increase of 31 million tons in the previous four years together. Coal shortages have ended, and most parts of India have surplus electricity for the first time in decades. However, state electricity boards have not been reformed as a condition of their rescue, and they have the potential to once again go deep into the red because of politically ordained subsidies. In sum, infrastructure problems are slowly lessening, but major challenges remain.51



 **The skill shortage is worsening.** India is supposedly going to reap a bonanza from its demographic dividend. UN estimates suggest that changing demographics will give India an additional 280 million people in the working‐​age group (15–64 years) between 2010 and 2050, even as China’s workforce declines in absolute numbers. But this dividend will prove worthless unless the new workers are skilled and can find useful jobs.



India’s primary schools are in pathetic shape, and so dropouts are excessive, and those completing school are barely educated. College expansion has been massive, especially of private colleges in recent decades, but the quality is spotty and the education, often useless. Consequently, India is producing millions of unemployable school and college graduates who don’t want to do manual work but don’t have the skills for white‐​collar work either. India is now witnessing a demand from relatively well‐​off castes — such as the Jats in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the Gujars in Rajasthan, and the Patels in Gujarat — for reclassification as “backward castes,” so that they qualify for a quota in government jobs and top educational institutions. When the town of Amroha invited applications for 114 jobs as “sweepers,” it received 19,000 applications, including some from people with MBAs and B.Tech. degrees.52



Recognizing the problem, the National Skills Development Corporation, a government agency, is financing private companies that do vocational training, but that has not worked. In the absence of a credible certification system, employers are unwilling to pay a wage premium for workers with vocational training certificates. Quality has to replace quantity, and that has always been a weakness of all government services and government‐​financed schemes. Posts in government colleges have long been influenced by politicians and sometimes given in return for kickbacks. The explosion of private engineering colleges after the software boom means India has almost 1.5 million engineering seats on offer, of which barely two‐​thirds are filled. Some employers say only 10 percent of engineering graduates are employable as software engineers. Quality is a huge future challenge for which the entire institutional framework of education needs overhauling.53



How can we sum up 25 years of economic reform? Three major trends are visible. First, the vast majority of successes have been private‐​sector successes, whereas the vast majority of failures have been government failures, mainly in service delivery. Second, wherever markets have become competitive and globalized, the outcomes have been excellent. But many areas remain unreformed, a few areas have been marked by backsliding, and those along with new forms of regulation are combining to create what can be called neo‐​illiberalism. Third, the weak quality of Indian institutions is increasingly a problem, and without better institutions, India will be unable to sustain high growth.



Consider each of those three trends in further detail. The private sector has performed outstandingly in the past 25 years, taking advantage of new opportunities created by liberalization and globalization. Indian companies more than held their own against foreign newcomers, and the vast majority of big Indian companies have become multinationals, making acquisitions globally.



The computer software and business services sector has been outstanding and has become India’s largest and most famous export sector, fetching $110 billion in 2015–16 against India’s entire merchandise exports of $261 billion. The auto industry, highly protected for decades, has opened up and become world‐​class: India is now a global hub for the production and design of small cars. The pharmaceutical industry feared being wiped out by the acceptance of drug patents after the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995. But in fact it flourished in the new climate and now supplies 20 percent of the U.S. consumption of generic drugs. Most Indian pharmaceutical companies export more than they sell at home, and dozens have become multinationals through foreign acquisitions and organic expansion.



Reliance Industries Ltd. has set up the biggest export‐​oriented oil refineries in the world and has higher refining margins than the famed refineries of Singapore. Dozens of completely new corporations have emerged out of nowhere and have soared to the top (the latest being e‐​commerce giants like Flipkart). India has become a global hub for R&D and for frugal engineering.



India has also witnessed several private‐​sector failures, notably of companies in public‐​private partnerships in infrastructure. Crony capitalism has become a problem in many areas where political discretion flourishes. However, both cronyism and public‐​private partnerships could be called examples of government failure rather than private‐​sector failure. On balance, India’s private sector has done a world‐​class job of transforming India.



By contrast, government failure has been widespread. All tiger economies witnessed a big improvement in the provision of public goods, which was needed to encourage private dynamism and sustain growth. But in India, the provision of all government services remains poor, and so India has slipped in social indicators compared with its slower‐​growing neighbors in South Asia. Even remote Indian villages have an adequate supply of shops providing cigarettes and tea. But they have no adequate supply of education, health, public safety, or judicial redress.



Why? Because the sellers of tea and cigarettes are accountable to the consumers they serve, and their income depends on satisfactory service provision. But government services are provided by salaried, unsackable staff, who are not accountable to those they serve, and who are justly notorious for corruption and callousness. They are accountable only to ministers in state capitals, where powerful trade unions ensure that there is no penalty for nonperformance. India needs new laws and institutions to ensure accountability of government servants of all consumers: this alone will raise the quality of government services. Cash transfers to the needy can be a vast improvement over leaky, corrupt subsidies for items ranging from food grains and fertilizers to farm credit and rural electricity. India needs new laws and institutions to ensure accountability to consumers. In education, two obvious remedies are vouchers to poor families and honest licensing of private schools to empower parents.



The second area of concern is the emergence of neo‐​illiberalism. Wherever the government has created competitive, globalized markets, the outcomes have been outstanding. In the 1990s, the government gradually opened up the economy, abolishing industrial and import licensing, freeing foreign exchange regulations, gradually reducing import tariffs and direct tax rates, reforming capital and financial markets, and generally cutting red tape. Those changes enabled India to boom and become a potential economic superpower. But some areas were never liberalized, such as land and natural resources, and those areas have been marked by massive scams and crony capitalism that have created widespread public outrage. The resulting uproar has hugely slowed decisionmaking. New rules, however, are making it mandatory to auction some natural resources rather than to allot them by ministerial discretion. That is a major improvement, but the reduction of ministerial discretion needs to be extended much further.



Many old price and quantitative controls should be abolished, and yet more are being enacted. Extensive controls permeate the entire chain of agricultural inputs, outputs, and processed agricultural goods (notably sugar). New price controls have been clamped on seeds and even on royalties paid by seed companies to suppliers of technology.54 The tax regime is uncertain, and many cases of retrospective taxation have tarnished the investment climate.



India is among the biggest users of anti‐​dumping measures permitted by the World Trade Organization. Even as old controls have been liberalized, dozens of new regulations are issued every year relating to new areas like the environment, health and safety standards, forests, and tribal areas. As with the old controls, the new controls are issued in the name of the public good and are then used by politicians and inspectors to line their pockets. The courts are so angry with corruption that they have increasingly intervened in many of these areas and have started issuing detailed new regulations (especially regarding natural resources), adding to controls and uncertainty. Instead of a million regulations badly enforced and wracked by corruption, India needs fewer regulations well enforced.



The third concern is the quality of India’s institutions. The police‐​judicial system is pathetic, court cases go on forever, few criminals are convicted beyond all appeals, and contracts are very difficult to enforce. This situation favors lawbreakers at the expense of law abiders and now taints every walk of life from politics (which is full of criminals) to business, the bureaucracy, professions, and almost everything else.



The bureaucracy is notoriously corrupt and slow moving, marked by widespread absenteeism. Staff positions fall vacant and remain unfilled, leading to huge backlogs of work. Major reforms are needed to make the civil service accountable to citizens, with penalties (including firing) for nonperformers and wrongdoers. The bureaucracy lacks skills in almost every sector — from education and health to transport and electricity. The political class must find ways to induct experts from outside into the civil service. Bureaucrats complain of current rules that make them criminally liable for government decisions that lead to private gains for any corporation, even if they have not derived any personal benefit. Those rules hinder quick decisionmaking and must be abolished.



Public‐​sector corporations remain large, wasteful, and unreformed. Government banks still control 70 percent of bank lending, have the worst record of bad loans and financial losses, and yet are such convenient cash cows for politicians that no party wants to privatize them.



Educational and regulatory institutions need to be strong and independent. But in India, their quality is increasingly eroded by political interference and the appointment of political favorites rather than independent experts. Quick justice requires plea bargaining; quick resolution of bad loans and bankruptcies requires good faith in restructuring contracts; and many long‐​term contracts need periodic revision in good faith. But corruption is so rife — and accusations of corruption so widespread — that no negotiation in good faith is possible, and so the process of litigation and contracts in limbo goes on seemingly forever. India needs deep institutional reforms to remedy these ills and to produce a more honest, accountable, and sensitive system of institutions.



In their seminal book _Why Nations Fail_ , Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson say that the quality of a country’s institutions ultimately determines whether a nation succeeds or fails. Many poor countries have managed to achieve rapid economic growth in their initial stages even with weak institutions of the sort India has. But once a country enters middle‐​income status, as India now has, it must improve its institutions or suffer economic slowdown.55 Doing the simplest things to improve productivity has already been achieved, and the future of productivity depends not just on technology but on the creation of strong, reliable, meritocratic institutions that are not easily subverted by money, muscle, and influence.



The 25 years from Narasimha Rao to Narendra Modi have moved India from low‐​income to middle‐​income status. To reach high‐​income status, India must become a much better governed country that opens markets much further, improves competitiveness, empowers citizens, vastly improves the quality of government services and all other institutions, jails political and business criminals quickly, and provides speedy redress for citizen grievances. That is a long and difficult agenda.

"The draconian coronavirus lockdowns across the world have led to sharp drops in carbon emissions, but this will have “negligible” impact on the climate crisis, with global heating cut by just 0.01C by 2030, a study has found. But the analysis also shows that putting the huge sums of post-Covid-19 government funding into a green recovery and shunning fossil fuels will give the world a good chance of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 1.5C. The scientists said we are now at a “make or break” moment in keeping under the limit – as compared with pre-industrial levels – agreed by the world’s governments to avoid the worst effects of global heating. The research is primarily based on newly available Google and Apple mobility data. This gives near-real-time information on travel and work patterns and therefore gives an idea of the level of emissions. The data covered 123 countries that together are responsible for 99% of fossil fuel emissions. The researchers found that global CO2 emissions dropped by more than 25% in April 2020, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 30%. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  These falls show that rapid changes in people’s behaviour can make big differences to emissions in the short term, but the scientists said such lockdowns are impossible to maintain. Therefore, economy-wide changes are needed for a transformation to a zero-emissions economy, such as greening transport, buildings and industry with renewable energy, hydrogen or by capturing and burying CO2. “The direct effect of the pandemic-driven [lockdown] will be negligible,” said the researchers, whose analysis was led by Prof Piers Forster at the University of Leeds. “In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3C by 2050.” The global average temperature in 2019 was 1.1C above the long-term average and even with current emissions-cutting pledges a further rise of 0.6C is expected by 2050. “It is now make or break for the 1.5C target,” said Forster. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to really change the direction of society. We do not have to go back to where we were, because times of crisis are also the time to change.” Prof Keith Shine, at the University of Reading and not part of the study team, said: “It is deeply impressive to get such a near-real-time analysis of the climate impact [of the lockdowns].” Shine said a green recovery from the pandemic is essential to meet the Paris climate agreement target: “The study shows that, because CO2 is so persistent in the atmosphere, short-term emission reductions resulting directly from the pandemic lockdowns lead to undetectable reductions in warming. It is only via sustained and radical changes in the way we use fossil fuels that we can hope to meet the Paris [climate agreement] target.” The analysis, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used mobility data from Google and Apple that tracks the location of individuals. This was used to assess changes in levels of transport and office and factory working, and then the emissions of 10 different greenhouse gases and air pollutants. These estimates matched the measurements available for some gases, such as nitrogen oxides, pollutants mostly emitted by diesel vehicles. The team assumed that significant restrictions on activity caused by Covid-19 remained in place until the end of 2021. However, using computer models, the team showed this would only produce a tiny reduction in long-term global heating. The scientists also examined recovery scenarios. If the recovery mirrors the investments made after the 2008 financial crisis – which included major support for fossil fuels – the global temperature will rise by more than 1.5C by 2050, which scientists say will cause widespread damage across the world. However, a strong green recovery that invests 1.2% of global GDP in low-carbon technologies – more than $1tn (£760bn) – and does not support bailouts for fossil fuel companies is likely to cut warming by 0.3C, the scientists found. Forster said the recovery investments being made today are backing both green technologies and fossil fuels. “It is still going both ways. But every bit of warming is important to try to avoid, so if we don’t keep the rise to 1.5C, it is still worth getting to zero carbon as fast as possible.” Dr Jaise Kuriakose, at the University of Manchester and not involved in the study, said people’s activities had changed in previously unthinkable ways, with a stop to flying and a shift to virtual meetings. “These suggest there is a public willingness for behavioural changes to a more sustainable and low-carbon lifestyle,” he said. “[But] to take advantage of this, structural changes and new policies are essential. Without a green recovery, it is even challenging to meet the UK government’s legislated net-zero target by 2050, let alone the ambitious Paris agreement.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader passed on some interesting investment advice.
Market analyst Value Line, “the most trusted name in investment research” has issued warnings against investing in two major US solar energy companies: SOLARCITY CORP and SUNEDISON CORP.
234 million 3rd quarter loss
Value Line informs market participants that Solar City reported “a much great-than-expected net loss” in the third quarter: $234 million, thus “shocked market participants”. Value Line hints that the company is misleading the public by stressing the company’s “impressive operational statistics” adding that the company has had an “inability to translate the gains into anything coming close to a profit“. Value Line also reports of a huge increase in company debt.
Despite the projected growth in sales of solar modules, Value Line does not see any profit for Solar City. Value Line’s advice:
In sum, only the most risk-tolerant of speculators should consider this equity.”
Getting hammered…

The advice is not any better when it comes to renewable energy giant Sunedison, originally the wafer-making arm of Monsanto, now a global leader of solar and wind power. Value Line informs that the company “used loads of debt to buy alternative power entities” and that the “company’s timing could not have been worse” in a sector that “has been getting hammered“.

Here Value Line offers the same advice that “all but the most speculative investors to steer clear of this volatile equity“.
Largest bankruptcy in Spanish history
Meanwhile the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundations reports here how Spain’s renewable energy firm “Abengoa has announced the start of insolvency proceedings. International banks’ total exposure to a full Abengoa bankruptcy stands at about $21.4 billion, meaning the company’s downfall would end up being the largest bankruptcy in Spanish history.”
Ironically world leaders are meeting in Paris with the aim of steering people into investing in this junk-grade equity. A wonderful way to destroy wealth and people’s savings.

"It is always heart-breaking when children are injured by family dogs, and tragic when it leads to a death. Emotions understandably run high and there are calls for “something to be done”. Often the focus is on the most obvious element, such as the breed of the dog involved. Dog breed is commonly discussed in media reports of attacks and, despite the inaccuracies recent research shows these reports often contain, such discussion leads to perceptions that breed is a key factor in the risk of aggression. Is this the case, or is it distracting us from other important factors influencing dog behaviour? While there is little research in this area, what there is suggests the dog’s breed is of little importance. At Bristol University, we surveyed dog owners regarding aggressive behaviour in their dogs, such as growling, lunging, barking and biting. We asked about the occurrence of aggressive behaviour in three situations; towards family members, towards unfamiliar people entering the house, and towards unfamiliar people outside the house. From the nearly 4,000 replies, we investigated whether dogs were reported to show aggressive behaviour in more than one situation, and whether the characteristics of owners (such as age) and their dogs (including breed) influenced the risk of aggression in each context. What we found was that dogs tend not to be aggressive in more than one of the surveyed situations. That is, those that are aggressive towards family members rarely do so towards unfamiliar people, and vice versa. This is important, because it challenges the idea that dogs are either innately vicious, or “man’s best friend”. This won’t be a great surprise to anyone familiar with dog behaviour, who will know that each dog with a tendency towards aggression will have a backstory, where the behaviour can be traced to a specific situation. But it’s a very important message for the general public: understanding that any dog can potentially be aggressive given the right circumstances is key to reducing injuries. Approaching an unfamiliar dog without checking with the owner first is not a good idea, even if it looks cute and friendly with others. And owners need to understand that even their gorgeous, loving pet can show aggression if exposed to a situation where it feels anxious or threatened enough. Does that mean that all dogs should be controlled in some way, muzzled or kept away from children? No, of course not – dogs enhance our lives in so many ways, and most live alongside us without any problem. What’s more, keeping dogs away from people could be counter-productive: less familiarity with people is likely to make dogs more worried about them, increasing the risk of aggression. Better to focus on education, so people understand why aggression develops and can recognise early signs. This is particularly important for those getting puppies, whose early life can, like humans, have a big impact on the whole of their life. And these messages need to be simple, clear, authoritative and consistent. In our study, we compared breed groups in each situation with a reference category of cross-breeds. In terms of dogs that were aggressive toward family members, we found no difference between those of specific breeds and cross-breeds. For aggression toward unfamiliar people, gundogs (hounds, retrievers and pointers) had a reduced risk compared to cross-breeds, and pastoral or herding dogs (for example German shepherd dogs) had an increased risk specifically when outside the house. So there are some breed effects on risk of aggression in some circumstances, but, importantly, the contribution these effects made was small. No more than 10% of the difference between aggressive and non-aggressive dogs were accounted for by the statistical models – and these included all the significant factors, not just breed. Clearly different breeds vary in aspects of their behaviour – any dog owner will tell you that. But when it comes to risk of aggression, the influence of breed is pretty small. It’s also important to point out that we don’t know if these effects are related to the characteristics of the dogs themselves, because they could also be influenced by the type of people who choose to own particular breed types. So, in evaluating aggression risk for an individual dog, there are more important factors to consider than its breed. But there is one aspect where breed is relevant to the risk of injury from dogs: size and strength. Because while large or powerful dogs don’t display any greater risk of aggression than any other, the potential for serious injury is higher if they do. So should particular, powerful breeds be banned? To answer that, it’s worth considering whether there’s evidence that this approach works, or whether reducing aggression risk in all dogs is a better approach. Several countries, including the UK, have banned or restricted certain breeds. This had dealt a blow to dog welfare, not least those surreal cases where dogs’ lives are determined not by their behaviour but on measurements of leg length or skull width, and the long-term kennelling of dogs during protracted legal proceedings. History seems to show that this approach is not effective at reducing injuries – in fact they are rising, despite these measures. Paradoxically, breed-specific legislation can increase the number of dogs of banned breeds, as the cachet of an outlawed dog appeals to some. Dogs in these environments can indeed become dangerous – because the way they are treated makes aggressive behaviour more likely. Policy should instead focus on the factors that influence the risk of aggression in the first place. Most people object when governments take the approach of banning things – imagine the cries of “nanny state” if fast cars were banned from the roads on account of their greater likelihood of causing injury than less powerful vehicles if driven irresponsibly. In reality, society takes the approach of reducing the risk posed by all drivers, regardless of what car they drive. Every new driver is given a thorough education, which is bench-marked by a standard theoretical and practical driving test. We have well-established, and largely accepted, codes of practice that govern drivers’ behaviour to reduce accident risk, and laws to enforce them. It would make sense to take the same approach for reducing aggression towards humans in dogs. "

The Minister for (or against) Climate Change can relax. New Zealand’s paltry 0.17% of global carbon emissions is so small we no longer need to bother about any reductions and can toss the Zero Carbon Act in the bin.



In a timely reminder, before you indulge in the excesses of the Christmas Season, a study has identified the real culprits who, collectively, are responsible for **TEN TIMES** as much carbon emissions as the whole of New Zealand.



 **People with obesity** have greater carbon dioxide production from oxidative metabolism than individuals with normal weight. Also, maintenance of greater body weights requires more food and drinks to be produced and transported to the consumers. Similarly, transportation of heavier people is associated with increased consumption of fossil fuels. This results in additional carbon dioxide emissions related to food production and transportation processes. Globally, obesity was estimated to contribute to an extra 700 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions per year or about **1.6 percent of all man-made emissions.**



Obviously, the counter-argument could be mounted, that physical exercise also leads to higher carbon emissions as physical exertion increases the metabolic rate – more huffing and puffing of evil CO2. So perhaps it is the fit and healthy ones who are to blame?

"**Facebook and Twitter's chief executives have been challenged over their handling of the US election in their latest appearance before the US Senate.**
Democrats questioned whether steps taken to flag that President Trump's claims of election fraud were ""disputed"" had gone far enough.
Republican members of the Judiciary Committee asked whether the tech firms should be taking such action at all.
This was the second time the CEOs had been cross-examined in three weeks.
They were previously questioned by the Senate Commerce Committee last month in what was a more rowdy event.
Once again, the issue of a law known as Section 230 loomed large.
It says the platforms are generally not responsible for illegal or offensive things users post on them.
President-elect Biden has suggested the regulation should be ""revoked"" since it encourages the spread of falsehoods, and several of the Democratic senators at the latest hearing followed his lead.
Republicans also voiced concern of their own.
They said the social media companies were taking editorial decisions about what to take down, label or leave unaltered.
This, they said, made them publishers rather than just distributors of information, and as a consequence they should not be covered by Section 230 in its current form.
""Federal law gave you the ability to stand up and grow without being hit by lawsuits,"" said Republican Senator Blackburn.
""You have used this power to run amok.""
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added: ""When you have companies that have the power of governments, have more power than traditional media outlets, something has to give.""
The two tech CEOs began by defending their record over the recent US election.
But Mr Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter's decision to block links to a controversial New York Post investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter had been ""wrong"", and that its failure to subsequently restore the newspaper's own tweets about the article had required a further policy change.
""I hope this... demonstrates our ability to take feedback, admit mistakes and make all changes transparently to the public,"" he said
Mr Zuckerberg avoided direct reference to the matter in his opening remarks.
However, he used the opportunity to challenge recent claims by Democrats that Facebook had been slow in removing posts that promoted insurrection and violence.
""We strengthened our enforcement against militias and conspiracy networks like QAnon to prevent them from using our network to organise violence or civil unrest,"" Mr Zuckerberg said.
The two tech leaders were then both challenged over some of their recent decisions.
The Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal wanted to know why Facebook had not banned Steve Bannon.
President Trump's former top advisor recently called for the beheadings of disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci and the FBI director Christopher Wray in a video he posted to both Twitter and Facebook.
Twitter threw him off its service, but Facebook only froze Mr Bannon's page.
Mr Zuckerberg said Mr Bannon ""did violate our policies"" but had not clocked up enough strikes to permanently lose access.
And when the senator called for a rethink, Mr Zuckerberg responded: ""That's not what our policies would suggest we should do.""
Mr Zuckerberg went on to dispute reports that Facebook had forgiven infractions by both of Donald Trump's sons and the news site Breitbart, among others, in order to avoid accusations of bias from conservatives.
""Those reports mischaracterise the actions that we've taken,"" he said.
The Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein followed up with questions to both executives over their responses to President Trump's posts about election fraud, which lacked factual basis.
She asked Twitter's chief whether he thought adding labels but allowing the tweets to remain visible went far enough.
Mr Dorsey responded that he believed providing ""context"" and ""connecting people to the larger conversation"" was the right path to follow.
Senator Feinstein went on to ask Mr Zuckerberg if he felt enough had been done to prevent people delegitimising the election's result.
She noted that hashtags for Steal The Vote and Voter Fraud had garnered more than 300,000 interactions on Facebook's platforms in the hours after Mr Trump falsely declared victory.
""I believe we have taken some very significant steps in this area,"" Mr Zuckerberg responded, pointing to information it had placed at the top of the screens of US-based Facebook and Instagram users.
""I think that we really went quite far in terms of helping to distribute reliable and accurate information about the results.""
The Republican Senator Ted Cruz took a different tack, asking why Twitter was ""putting purported warnings on virtually any statement about voter fraud"".
When Mr Dorsey repeated his earlier point about linking people to conversations, Mr Cruz pushed back.
""No you're not. You're putting up a page that says 'voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States'. That's not linking to a broader conversation. That's taking a disputed policy position.""
Mr Cruz added that Twitter had the right to take such a position, but only if it accepted it was a publisher and gave up Section 230's protections.
And he challenged both firms to disclose how many times they had blocked Republican and Democratic candidates for office in the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections to reveal any discrepancy.
Neither tech chief would give a firm commitment to do so.
Republican Senator Joni Ernst later asked what the two tech leaders were doing to monitor the political views of their staff.
Both of the chief executives said this would be hard to do, but they suggested one consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic was they would have more people working from home in the long-term, which in turn should entail greater diversity among their workforce.
This was a far more considered hearing.
When senators last grilled Dorsey and Zuckerberg, the politicians were in full campaigning mode and it was a bit of a mess.
The tone today was far more relaxed, and we've learnt more because of that.
Dorsey talked of the ""impossible"" situation Twitter was in - being accused of overly-censoring by Republicans and not doing enough by Democrats.
Both companies said they wanted there to be more transparency, particularly around the way they moderate their platforms.
Twitter was in particular in the crosshairs of Republicans, especially around its policy of adding flags to President Trump's tweets.
Facebook was more a target of Democrats, who wanted to know why, for example, it had not permanently suspended Steve Bannon.
Both tech leaders accepted that Section 230 needs to be revisited.
And it seems inevitable this law will be reformed. So the debate will now turn to what replaces it.
Republican Senator Joshua Hawley said his office had been contacted by a Facebook whistle-blower and told of an internal tool called Centra.
This, the politician claimed, was used to track people's use of the wider internet as well as to monitor them logging into different Facebook accounts even if registered with different names.
""I'm not familiar with it,"" said Mr Zuckerberg.
Mr Hawley expressed his frustration with this response, saying: ""It's always amazing to me... how many people before this committee suddenly develop amnesia.""
Meanwhile, the Republican Senator Michael Lee brought up Twitter's suspension of an account belonging to Mark Morgan, the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection.
The action was taken after Mr Morgan tweeted that the wall on the border with Mexico had helped stop ""gang members, murderers, sexual predators and drugs from entering our country"".
""What exactly is hateful about [that]?"" asked Senator Lee.
Mr Dorsey acknowledged that the action had been taken in error.
""There was a mistake and it was due to the fact that we had heightened awareness around government accounts,"" he explained.
The Senator responded: ""I understand that mistakes happen, but what we're going to see today is that mistakes happen... almost entirely on one side of the political aisle rather than the other.""
Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono, however, said that independent research suggested such allegations of bias were ""completely baseless"".
Senator Lindsey Graham also questioned both men about whether their organisations had any evidence of their platforms being addictive.
""From what I've seen so far, it's inconclusive, and most of the research suggests that the vast majority of people do not perceive or experience these services as addictive [but] there should be controls given to people to help them manage their experience better,"" said Mr Zuckerberg.
Mr Dorsey said: ""Like anything else, these tools can be addictive and we should be aware of that, acknowledge it and make sure that we are making our customers aware of better patterns of usage.""
Vice-President elect Kamala Harris is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee but did not take part in the hearing."

The Atlantic: David A. Graham: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel: Get Used to Endless War
From ISIS to climate change, the Pentagon chief says, the threats that face the United States are long-term challenges.
It sure seems like there are frightening events happening everywhere today—from ISIS to Ebola, Russian imperialism to Chinese saber-rattling, climate change to congressional dysfunction. But is it really worse, or will this, too, pass?
Bad news: It’s really worse, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told James Fallows at the Washington Ideas Festival Wednesday….
And Hagel didn’t seem especially sanguine that it would end anytime soon. In other words: Get used to endless war…
He noted in particular the challenge of global warming, which Hagel’s Pentagon has made a priority, declaring it a national-security threat, even as Hagel’s own Republican Party continues to block broader steps..
Buckle your seatbelts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman ZDF public television here brings a report on the performance of wind turbines in Germany titled: “Wind energy – a loss business?“. In summary: Investors are losing money and many are finding themselves the victim of overblown promises.

ZDF public television wind occurrence chart above based on data provided by the German Association for Wind Energy. It shows that actual wind occurrence fell below expectations most of the time. Chart cropped here.
Everywhere in Germany monster wind turbines, which at times soar over 200-meters, are popping up. They are supposed to eventually supply the country with clean, environmentally-friendly energy, the ZDF reports. But according to an analysis of 200 wind parks carried out by Werner Daldorf, an expert certified accountant, they are failing economically. It turns out that wind energy investors often see returns that fall far short of what they were originally told to expect – despite all the subsidies designed to make wind parks risk-free and profitable for their operators.
At the 0:30 mark, Daldorf tells ZDF:
About two thirds of the investments are not paying out as expected. The capital that the investors paid is at risk and possibly will not be recovered.”
The problem, ZDF reports, is that without wind there is no money. ZDF says that future projections of wind occurrence appear to have been overblown, and “are well below what was expected and produce far less power than first thought” – see chart above. Most of the time the wind blows below what investors were told to expect. As a result, not only is wind energy making German power exorbitantly expensive for consumers, but it is also hitting rosy-eyed investors.

At the 1:25 mark, The ZDF tells viewers:
Not only have a number of small investors, communities and towns been misled, many investments are doing poorly. But the exact data is being kept under wraps.”
The City Utility of Mainz, which invested heavily in wind energy, wrote to ZDF:
The actual wind yield coming from these turbines has been far less than expected – despite the safety buffer that had been assumed.”
ZDF clarifies: “In plain language, the investment aren’t paying off.” The only ones making money, ZDF writes, are the builders, land leasers, banks and turbine manufacturers. The losers, Daldorf summarizes, are often the investors.
No surprise there. With charts like the one shown above, it’s becoming clear that wind energy is in large part just a ruinous scam.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Welt here has a commentary on wind energy by Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg. The title of his guest commentary: “Wind energy, powerless and expensive“.
Hat-tip Peter H at Facebook.
Wind and sun energy are often viewed by fossil fuel critics as the go-to green energies. But careful analyses show that these energies are in reality impractical due to their haphazard supply and very poor efficiency. Most wind installations fail to reach 20% of their rated capacities; sun only provides power when it’s daytime and not cloudy. The figures that Lomborg presents are sobering, inconvenient and totally discouraging for wind and sun power proponents.
Citing the International Energy Agency, Lomborg writes so far today only 0.4% of global energy comes from wind and sun, despite the tens of billions of dollars invested in the energy sources. He adds:
Even in 2040, if all governments stick to their promises, sun and wind will cover only 2.2 percent of the world’s energy by 2040.”

Lomborg says that the reason why sun and wind will be “no decisive solution against climate change” is the energies’ inability to be effectively stored. He calls the belief that the energies are cheaper than fossil fuels a “Fata Morgana”.
The problem remains that storage technologies today are cumbersome, horrendously expensive and thus unfeasible. Wind and sun remain a luxury for the rich. Lomborg explains to readers how wind energy are dependent on subsidies, and that without them they make no sense. The Danish star economist points out that not only do wind and sun need subsidies, but now also so do fossil fuel plants so that they can remain on standby when the wind and sun go AWOL. He also says that wind and sun only save about half of the claimed CO2 emissions, and that under some circumstances they actually cause greater emissions.
$131 trillion for 1°C less warming
He writes the planned expansion of green energies by the year 2040 will cost 2.3 trillion dollars and result in only in a mere 0.o175 °C less temperature rise by the end of the century (using the climate forcing figures provided by the climate models).
That means 1°C of theoretical less warming would cost 131 trillion dollars! If there ever was a new definition for insanity, that’s it.

"Coastal and river flooding struck Britain again this week with huge waves hitting southern and western coasts and around 100 flood warnings still in place by Wednesday evening. Disturbing but, sadly, not unfamiliar scenes were accompanied by an impressive catalogue of disruption and bitter tales of avoidable personal tragedy.  But was this weather or climate? Must we expect more of these kinds of events and if so what can we do about it? As with all things climatic the answers are far from simple, but we can start with three basic facts.  First, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, so at the simplest level, the global hydrological cycle is likely to intensify. This suggests it’s likely to get wetter somewhere, but not necessarily everywhere. Second, the ocean will expand as it warms, leading to rising average sea levels in the coming decades – this is one of the most confident predictions of climate-change science. Third, any melting of the continental ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland would raise global sea levels further.  Of these three factors, only more intense storms would affect river flooding. Changes in storms are extremely difficult to predict, and will vary between regions, while river flooding is also affected by highly local factors related to soils and land use. If river flooding is changing already then the signal is not yet clear, but the evidence from the past is that relatively modest climate fluctuations since the last glacial period have been accompanied by substantial changes in flooding regimes. But coastal flooding is another story. Although individual events are highly dependent on winds and tides, and hence subject to the same uncertainties as inland storm behaviour, the inexorable rise of sea level in response to ocean warming shifts the probability of coastal flooding steadily upwards.  The fact that the dynamics of ice sheets are hard to predict just means we can’t be sure how fast sea levels will rise, but the “likely” range from the IPCC is 26-82cm by 2100, so the uncertainty is as big as the signal itself. Indeed even predictions of the warming component of sea level rise depend on poorly understood processes such as the rate of transport of warm water to the deep ocean and typically vary by a factor of two. As rising sea levels will mean more coastal flooding it might seem the answer is clear – invest in sea defences now to avoid damaging floods before they happen. But how much to invest, where and when are much harder questions to answer. We’ve already seen that the rate of sea level rise is highly uncertain, but this is only one factor in the equation of cost versus benefit of sea defences.  Just as important is the value of land to be protected, which depends on how it is used. If land is built on, the degree of coastal development invokes public planning policy as well as private and commercial development decisions. And if land at risk is used for producing marketable agricultural or commercial output, then the value depends on the price of those goods on international markets. Any decision of where and how much to invest in coastal protection is thoroughly mired in uncertainty. The rate of sea level rise is highly uncertain, and the statistics of individual flooding events even more so. The value at risk depends on the propensity for coastal versus inland development; and the fact that coastal economies are embedded in a globalised world means macroeconomic forces, including international trade, affect the cost-benefit calculation. So far, the instinct of scientists and politicians has been to take a “science-first” approach, working forwards from the most complete possible scientific knowledge to the best possible decisions. But the science will never be complete and time is short. Much better, some have argued, to start from the policy end – prioritising the science that is necessary to choose between the policy options that are actually available, and using models as tools to explore the most relevant options.  Science first or policy first, we need better ways to making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The ERMITAGE project has taken important steps in this direction by combining models of climate, economy and agricultural production. Initial results confirm earlier conclusions: money put into coastal protection pays for itself handsomely."
"Set in 2029, Assembly for the Future – part of Bleed festival – invites thinkers and artists to address an Australian audience in 2020 to let them know what the future holds. These futures may be realistic, idealistic or utterly fanciful; for Scott Ludlam, it is one filled with hope, collaboration and a post-capitalist global uprising, as he imagines a time when ecological catastrophe has been averted, Australia is a renewable continent, and the oldest living culture on earth is the foundation for a movement of justice and peace. – I’m speaking to you from the Sovereign Yuin nation on the south coast of what you’d have called New South Wales. Since the treaty handbacks started we don’t use that name much any more, and I can’t say anyone misses it. So you’ve been shifted nine years forward; it’s July 2029; which is not such a huge traverse when you think about it; 3,285 days and nights. And the reason each of you have been brought here will become clearer as we go, but for me it’s really simple: it’s so I can say thank you, deeply, for all of the things you did during those 3,000 days and nights. Because we’re not so far down the timeline, a lot about 2029 will seem very familiar to you. The NBN is still absolutely shit, Fremantle still haven’t won a flag and the weather is a real mess. But you already know that the 2020s are going to be an impossibly turbulent decade so there’s a lot for us to cover. To get the big-picture stuff out of the way early, I want you to know; we did it. It looks like we turned the ship. I know it’s hard to believe. But here we are: the last coal burner got turned off three years ago; this is a renewable continent now; we’re even exporting clean energy to the north. Emissions are back to where they were in about 1994 and trending slowly down thanks to a global replanting program that I believe some people here today had a bit to do with. So the collapse scenarios that the doomers insisted were inevitable; turns out they weren’t, because nothing is. We’re not living in some rosy utopia here obviously, but something much more messy and interesting between these imaginary extremes. Now in the timezone you’ve just arrived from, I know it feels like you have more urgent problems than gas balances in the atmosphere. A world in the grip of the most dangerous pandemic in a century, the United States descending into fascism, and a locust economy going into cardiac arrest. In our own colonial corner of the world the white supremacist mask is slipping. It’s a big time. What I want to say is: hold on to each other. It gets weirder and harder yet, but you have to hold on; on the other side of the white water there’s the possibility of a more even flow. That thing of history coming in lurches and lulls and stops and starts; that’s an old pattern, maybe one of the oldest there is. It never repeats, because nothing is ever the same, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t rhythms and symmetries that show up over and over. That’s one of the things the pandemic taught us; tiny causes can have massive consequences if they line up with stress fractures and larger weaknesses in structures that seem outwardly solid. So how’s this for a tiny cause: a virus particle 0.1 micron in diameter is about to wipe $25tn off the expected profits of the most powerful fossil fuel companies in the world; they’re going to fall like dominos, taking down exposed banks and insurance companies until finally the whole structure caves in. The corona depression breaks the spine of capitalism and opens a fleeting moment of space for something new. A friend of mine used to say that in a crisis, the first person with a plan on the table wins. For the first time in memory, the first people with a plan didn’t look or sound anything like the people whose plans we’d been following since colonisation. This was something different; a post-capitalist uprising, leaderless and somehow everywhere, bigger and richer than our brittle nationalisms could contain. A global grassroots network called the Progressive International serving as a mediator, clearinghouse and organising lattice for social movements all over the world to link arms in common cause. This new freedom is not given willingly, it is ceded reluctantly, with spite and violence, and because we are organised for the first time, we are equal to it. Try to imagine what happens when the media oligarchs that drenched us in race hate, disinformation and division for our whole lives hit the wall and are placed in the hands of receivers, some of them in the hands of prosecutors. You don’t realise how loud the consumerist shriek is inside your head until it’s suddenly gone and now we can hear ourselves think for the first time. The quiet is delicious. We can hear each other’s common humanity. We can hear music and voices raised from parts of the world we’d been drowning out. It gets weirder and harder yet, but you have to hold on; on the other side of the white water there’s the possibility of a more even flow I know it sounds like a small thing but when it happens it changes everything: seamless online translation of voice and text between the world’s languages. One of the most enduring barriers to the arising of a truly global civil society is gracefully transformed into a strength almost overnight; the mass extinction of language and song is brought back from the brink at the same time as our hands in the soil are holding back the other mass extinction. Finally we can hear each other, and that, in combination with the sudden absence of amplified hate speech swamping the airwaves, breaks the white supremacist spell. We close the internment camps. Not by asking nicely; in a few places we show up and physically push the fences down with borrowed earthmoving equipment, but they are closed and staying closed. It’s kind of weird that this is all unfolding almost exactly a hundred years after the 20th century great depression, but some form of deeply embedded collective memory held us back from making the same mistakes twice. Instead of using the tools of central planning and socialism to save capitalism and unleash it in an even stronger form, we’re using them to dismantle its predatory architectures and provide a dignified life for everyone. All the ideas that had been subsisting at the margins – universal income support alongside universal healthcare, education and housing – those were the first plans on the table in a crisis, and so they prevailed. Not by asking nicely; this takes hundreds of millions of us; by far the largest civil society mobilisations in history, globally networked and with a blissful absence of white saviour leader figures to attack and co-opt, it’s unstoppable. I don’t know if anything I’m telling you sounds implausible or unlikely; but if you don’t believe me there are a couple of things I’d ask you to look for when you get home to 2020. First thing is, notice emboldened voices from the margins; people the mainstream has been stepping on and silencing since forever; notice how they’ve been finding their voices and linking arms and not taking shit; it’s not that they haven’t been doing that all along, but that widening cracks in the neoliberal armour mean others can hear them more clearly. These voices are in the process of moving from the periphery to the centre, needing only that moment of historical slippage. Second – this one’s an easy one – a mass movement of children organising their way toward a global strike. I mean it’s kind of obvious when you think about it; the movement leaders of the 2020s and 2030s had already brought six million people out onto the streets before they’d left high school. They weren’t on holiday during the pandemic, it turns out they were studying movement theory, strategy and history. They have learned a thing or two from organised labour about the power of the strike, and my favourite thing is what happens when organised labour learns it back from these kids and rolls it out in every timezone at once. Notice emboldened voices from the margins; people the mainstream has been stepping on and silencing since forever; notice how they’ve been finding their voices Third thing is, try to imagine the power you get when the world’s largest, youngest and newest social movement joins its strength with some of the world’s oldest and most storied; the original rebels against extinction who have been resisting dispossession and genocide in some places for 500 years. When you get back to 2020, look for signs that middle class environmental and social justice organisers are hearing the Sovereignty message clearly for the first time. That’s a clue that what’s about to unfold is going to be deeper and more enduring than what’s come before it, because it’s going to be carrying the generational memory of our whole species with it this time. When it starts to unfold that’s how you’ll know it’s the real thing; because it will wear this lineage so proudly. A movement for justice and peace, ecology and democracy, grounded in the oldest living cultures on earth. Hundreds of years in the making, carried forward now by a generation of children determined to seize their own century. Whatever it is, whatever crazy project or collaboration, whatever is that thing that scares you in just the right way, when you get home, do it. You have to do it. You’ll find the others making their own way, and make common cause with them. It’s 2029. Our human family is eight decades into the anthropocene. It feels like the centre is holding. Because of you, and what you’re about to do, it finally feels like we’re home.  This is an edited version of Scott Ludlam’s speech.

"**Thousands of ads from Joe Biden's election campaign and some from President Trump's have been mistakenly blocked by Facebook.**
The social network's policy to ban any new ads a week before election day as part of its crackdown on misinformation kicked in on Tuesday, but pre-approved ads should still run.
Mr Biden's digital campaign manager expressed fury at the situation.
Facebook blamed technical issues, and apologised.
In a blog, it said: ""We have identified a number of unanticipated issues affecting campaigns of both political parties.
""Some were technical problems. Others were because advertisers did not understand the instructions we provided and when and how to make changes to ad targeting.""
""While this impacted a small proportion of the ads about politics and social issues in our system, we regret any disruption in the delivery of these ads.""
Facebook admitted it could have been clearer in explaining how advertisers would need to edit their targeting during the restricted period.
In a series of tweets, Mr Biden's digital director Rob Flaherty expressed his anger that ads were being blocked in the crucial final week of campaigning.
In a statement, he described the situation as a ""fiasco"" leading to ""widespread issues that are plaguing all of our ad campaigns since the onset of new ad restrictions"".
He added: ""It is abundantly clear that Facebook was wholly unprepared to handle this election despite having four years to prepare.""
President Trump's campaign confirmed that some of its ads were also blocked.
Facebook's record on handling political ads has been controversial, and it has been criticised for its decision not to fact-check posts by politicians.
Responding to pressure to do more about misinformation, it decided to ban ads in the week leading up to the US election.
Later, it said it would ban ads which prematurely declared victory, and then added that it would also temporarily block political ads after the polls closed."

"**You probably haven't heard of Dan Bongino, but if you are on Facebook you might have seen one of his posts. You may have even shared one.**
Dan Bongino is ex-NYPD and Secret Service and also worked as presidential protection for two presidents - George W Bush and Barack Obama.
Now a prolific right-wing commentator, in the last two months his Facebook posts have attracted more shares than those of Fox News and CNN, combined.
But he's not the only one to have an outsized influence over America's social media conversation.
As the election campaign became more intense, a very small group of personalities and social media accounts on both sides of the political divide have resonated with audiences in a way even politicians and media organisations have not.
Their rapid surge in popularity has seen such people generate more social media interactions than almost every politician and major publisher.
They have become this election's ""influencers"" - with strong but pithy opinions, picking up what they see as political contradictions and hypocrisy. Some make memes, others just inspire the meme-makers with their ironic observations.
""My life is all about owning the libs now,"" said Mr Bongino two years ago. He attacks the left and defends President Trump in a direct and aggressive style - not being part of the traditional political establishment seems to be part of his appeal.
He is also very critical of mainstream media (although he is himself a commentator on Fox News) and a section of his website is dedicated to ""debunking liberal myths"". Some of his most successful posts have titles like ""Exposing how much of a liar Joe Biden is"" and ""Fact-checking Kamala Harris' fake Lincoln quote at the debate"". He has been criticised and fact-checked himself many times - but that hasn't stopped people sharing his posts.
One video montage of Ronald Reagan's speeches on law and order had almost as many shares as all New York Times Facebook posts in the previous month.
Mr Bongino has recently told The New York Times that he doesn't know what's behind this rapid increase but attributes his success to his team and Facebook's user base - older and more conservative than other social networks.
Conservative voices have been particularly strong on Facebook during this campaign.
Franklin Graham, son of late preacher Billy Graham, is one of the most influential evangelicals in America. His Facebook posts are consistently among the most shared, whether he is praising Trump's foreign policy, urging followers to pray for the president's victory or sharing discredited theories about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.
Hollywood actor James Woods returned to Twitter the start of 2020 after a 10-month hiatus. Woods's account has been suspended multiple times for spreading conspiracy theories and violating the platform's rules. His blistering attacks on Democrats are often screenshotted and widely shared by pro-Trump accounts on other social platforms.
One progressive (the more liberal-leaning end of the Democratic Party) page is winning the meme war.
Occupy Democrats, founded in 2012 by immigrant twin brothers Rafael and Omar Rivero, amasses millions of shares every month with its text heavy, highly partisan pictures. The page had more shares than Donald Trump's official account this month.
When Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign in April, Rafael Rivero started a new page, ""Ridin' With Biden"", which quickly surged to a rapid success. The brothers run other popular accounts, including ""Impeach Trump"" and ""Fight Trump"".
Robert Reich, economic adviser and former US Secretary of Labor, has served in the administrations of three Democratic presidents. His tweets and memes attacking Trump and criticising economic inequality are hugely popular with left-leaning Americans on social media. Reich is arguably the biggest left-wing personality on Facebook - in October, his page had more shares than Joe Biden and Barack Obama combined.
It is well known that Facebook and Twitter have been battlegrounds for years, but Instagram hasn't always seemed like a natural place for political activism.
In 2020 this has changed as the pandemic and the protests following George Floyd's death generated a huge increase in social justice content being widely shared on Instagram.
""We don't think you should need to have a degree, or to be able to afford to get behind paywalls, in order to understand the world around you, so we try to break it down into simple, digestible round-ups,"" said Lucy Blakiston, one of the co-founders of SYSCA, a hugely popular account she runs from New Zealand.
Ms Blakiston and two other young women started the project in 2018, while all three were at university. Two of them now have full-time jobs, and run SYSCA on the side. Their Instagram account has grown from fewer than 100,000 followers at the start of this year to over 2 million, more than most progressive media brands. To put this into context, it took The Guardian almost four years to get its Instagram following to that level.
It is not news that in a highly polarised landscape, activism can drown out impartial information and many have warned that social media ""echo chambers"" mean people only see and share content which matches their political point of view.
""I think our US election coverage has made an impact, but among people who already think similarly to how we do,"" said Ms Blakiston.
""We are from New Zealand, a place where we are lucky enough to have a leader who we can trust to look after us in times of need,"" she added. ""We look at how things are going in America and think that everyone deserves to have a leader that they trust to look after them.""
Slideshow explainers seem to have resonated really strongly with Instagram's younger and more progressive audiences. Progressive accounts dedicated to this format, like ""So You Want To Talk About..."" now generate a number of interactions comparable to major news outlets.
This small group of influencers have clearly benefited from the divisive nature of an election campaign - many posts take advantage of schadenfreude (glee at another's misfortune), one-upmanship and function as digital calls to action.
But there are also hints that things could change - these highly liked posts featuring moments of unity show positive messages can and do break through."

"LONDON  —   The Emmy and Tony Award winner Bryan Cranston (“Breaking Bad”) will star as Howard Beale in a new stage adaptation of the bitingly satirical film “Network” scheduled to open at the National Theater in London this year, the theater announced on Friday. Ivo van Hove, the acclaimed international theater director, will stage the play, about executives at a struggling TV network and their Machiavellian maneuvers for higher ratings  —   including the manipulation of Mr. Cranston’s character, the “mad as hell” television host that Peter Finch played in the film. Lee Hall, the screenwriter of “Billy Elliot,” is adapting the   screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. Mr. van Hove, who won a Tony last year for directing a revival of “A View from the Bridge” on Broadway, is set to open the show in November on the National’s Lyttelton stage. The theater also announced that its hit production of “People, Places and Things” would travel to St. Ann’s Warehouse in New York in October. The actress Denise Gough earned   reviews when she played the lead role, Emma, at the National in 2015, and later in London’s West End. She will travel to New York with the show. The theater announced the plays as part of a broader lineup for 2017 and 2018. Other productions include the world premiere of “Saint George and the Dragon” by Rory Mullarkey, which will be directed by Lyndsey Turner, who staged a   production of “Hamlet” in 2015 starring Benedict Cumberbatch and a production of “Macbeth” starring Rory Kinnear. “Saint George” will open in October, and “Macbeth” in the spring of 2018."
"Villagers living in the Somerset levels who have been inundated with floodwaters for weeks will be able to sympathise with the difficulties faced by those in the similarly low-lying Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, in Alaska.  Here, rising sea levels, decreased ice cover and melting permafrost have led to rapid erosion. Inhabitants of the delta – an area nearly three times the size of Scotland – are struggling to prevent their roads, airstrips, docks and houses from being lost to the next storm. Scores of villages have made plans to relocate entirely, and have emergency evacuation plans in place.  But it’s not only modern villages that are at risk. A less well appreciated consequence of the changing climate in coastal Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic north is the steady loss of thousands of archaeological sites to the sea. The scale of this destruction became clear when Warren Jones, a Yup’ik Eskimo leader from the village of Quinhagak sent photos of artefacts found by local people on the beach. These weren’t just stones and bones but carved wooden dolls and masks, in complete condition and even with traces of paint still intact. Artefacts like these don’t survive on the surface for very long.  In 2009 our team from the University of Aberdeen followed a trail of wooden artefacts down the beach to find the remains of a rapidly eroding prehistoric village. Finely carved harpoon shaft fragments and other artefacts protruded everywhere from the erosion face. Although much had already been lost there was much left to save – we recovered more than 8,000 artefacts in the first two seasons alone. By 2013 the erosion face had already moved 10m inland and all traces of those first excavations were gone. The site of Nunalleq, which means “old village” in the Yup’ik language, was occupied between about 1300-1650 AD, leaving behind layers of house floors about a metre deep. Until recently everything was locked in icy permafrost – the level of preservation is startling. About 80% of the artefacts are made of wood and other organic materials. Kayak parts, basketry, masks, dolls, bowls and many other items have been recovered, often complete. Pottery, ivory, bone and finely ground stone tools are also abundant. The huge scale of the loss of this cultural heritage taking place is doubly tragic because the prehistory of the Yup’ik people is very poorly known. Despite the vast size of the Yup’ik homeland, which straddles the Bering Straight from Siberia to Alaska and Canada, and it rich culture, the daunting logistics and harsh conditions have discouraged archaeologists. Our work would have been impossible but for our partnership with the Qanirtuuq Corporation, the Yup’ik-owned organisation that manages the village on behalf of its people. Nearly a third of families living in this village of less than 600 live below the poverty line, yet Qanirtuuq, Inc. supported our work for three years while we gathered enough data to support a major grant application. Village leaders and elders decided that saving, and reconnecting, with their past was important to their future.   Beyond the spectacular artefacts, the soils on site are also rich with scientific data in the form of the organic detritus left by daily village life: wood chips, whittled sticks, strands of woven grass, feathers, cut bits of hide, dog fur and even scraps of human hair.  Prehistoric villagers at Nunalleq had a mixed diet of fish such as salmon, and also caribou and marine mammals. Since the site was occupied just before and during the onset of the Little Ice Age, a era of cooling climate that began around 1400, this data presents a unique opportunity to discover what species might be most sensitive to similarly rapid climate change today. And that in turn may give the Yup’ik a clue to what changes they might expect to their menu today as a consequence of global warming."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Tony Heller reminds us (and Bernie Sanders) how warm it was back in 1951 on New Years Eve: https://twitter.com/Goddardde
===========================================================
At his always interesting Saturday Summary at Weatherbell Analytics here, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi confirms what Tony Heller’s Real Science posted a couple of days ago: December 24, 1955 was warmer than the impressively warm December 24, 2015.
It goes to show that you simply cannot judge climate based on a single weather event.
Europe too has seen a record warm November-December period. And that too was due to a weather pattern that saw persistent southerly winds throughout the entire period. Of course southern winds are going to warm up an area.
At the mark, Joe compares December 24 of 1955 to 2015:

Images cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary video December 16, 2015.
Clearly USA December 24, 1955 was much warmer than in 2015. And Joe reacted harshly to all the media hype of the recent days, calling it “ridiculous” and “propaganda”.  He accuses the alarmist side of being “disingenuous”, using “lies and deception” and pushing “false missives”.

Joe reminds that the current El Niño warmth will soon give way to cool conditions – thanks to the upcoming La Niña .
2015 only the globe’s 6th warmest on record
At the 9:57 mark Joe debunks the claims that 2015 has been a globally record warm year. Charts based on NCEP data by Dr. Ryan Maue show that 2015 is in fact not even in the top 5 warm years. Joe tells his viewers that clearly 2002, 2003 2005, 2006 and 2007 were warmer.
I’ve spliced together the three charts Joe showed to provide an overall impression of the trend of the last 37 years, 1978 – 2016 (sorry for the poor quality – but you get the idea).

NCEP global temperature data.
Here we see that the last decade was warmer than the current one so far. Moreover the upcoming La Niña will act to markedly dampen global temperatures by late 2016. Joe suspects they will fall well below the zero line of the above chart. By then we can expect the climate activists to start chasing droughts, floods, tornadoes, plankton or whatever.
For the upcoming weeks, the forecasts show that the weather patterns are set to shift over both North America and Europe, which are about to get a taste of winter – just as Joe predicted months ago.

"THE BLOOD OF EMMETT TILLBy Timothy B. Tyson291 pp. Simon  Schuster. $27. The existence of racial terror is not a singular phenomenon in our country’s national archive. Consider 2015, a feverish June night in South Carolina, when Dylann Roof, feeding off racist conspiracy theories, walked into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine black parishioners. Then reach back almost 20 years before that, to 1998, when James Byrd Jr. a black man, was abducted by three white men and fatally dragged from the back of a pickup truck along unforgiving Texas asphalt. Then there is perhaps the most monstrous application of racial terror in our historical register: Aug. 28, 1955, when    Emmett Till was lynched. The events of that bitter morning, their motivations and ramifications, have found a meticulous, if not their most exhaustive, retelling in Timothy B. Tyson’s “The Blood of Emmett Till,” an account of absorbing and sometimes horrific detail. Comprehensive in scope, its final 60 pages alone are a catalog of notes and sources. Tyson is a senior research scholar at Duke University and the author of “Blood Done Sign My Name,” about the 1970 lynching of Henry Marrow in Tyson’s hometown, and he tracks Till’s life from Argo, Ill. to Chicago, to his last moments in Money, Miss. where  —   despite the hesitation of his mother, Mamie  —   Till had sojourned with relatives. On a Wednesday evening in August, Till allegedly flirted with and grabbed the hand of Carolyn Bryant, a white woman who worked as the cashier at a local market. According to recovered court transcripts released by the F. B. I. in 2007, he let out a “wolf whistle” as she exited the store to get a gun from her car. Bryant later informed her husband and his half brother, who proceeded to uphold a grim tradition: Till was abducted, beaten, shot in the head and thrown into the Tallahatchie River. A   gin fan was tied to his neck with barbed wire, with the hope that he would never be found. Black life in America has endured as little more than a fragile truth in the hands of white aggressors. And Tyson does well to remind us just how   racial terror can be when wielded with brute force: “Affronted white supremacy drove every blow. ” There are a number of facts to parse in this book  —   such as Till’s affinity for straw hats on churchgoing Sundays, and the sheriff’s belief that the body recovered from the river was part of an “N. A. A. C. P.  scheme” to disgrace Mississippi  —   but none perhaps more profoundly consequential than Bryant’s own admission to Tyson that the events that led to Till’s death didn’t happen as she had previously attested. Outside private correspondence with her attorney, trial testimony and her unpublished memoir, Bryant remained   about her interaction with Till. In 2008, in her only interview since that fateful season of death, Bryant admitted to Tyson that a crucial piece of her testimony in court was fabricated. Till never “grabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities,” as she had avowed on the witness stand. “You tell these stories for so long that they seem true,” she confesses early in the book, “but that part is not true. ” And so we are left with a sobering certainty, one that even Bryant herself is forced to concede to Tyson, more than 50 years later: “Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him. ” The sum of history is made up of recurring patterns. Each new decade has brought past sins to the fore. From Emmett Till and Henry Marrow to Amadou Diallo, Rekia Boyd and Alton Sterling. These deaths,   lynchings that have taken new shapes, are simply the mores and modes of a   American custom: white supremacy. “The real horror comes when your dead brain must face the fact that we as a nation don’t want it to stop,” the novelist Chester Himes wrote to The New York Post upon hearing that Till’s murderers were acquitted. “If we wanted to, we would. ”"
"“M. Butterfly,” the   play about a French diplomat who has a lengthy affair with a Chinese opera singer, will be revived on Broadway this fall with Clive Owen starring and Julie Taymor directing. The drama, inspired by a true story, won the Tony Award for best new play in 1988, when it starred John Lithgow and B. D. Wong (who won a Tony). The playwright David Henry Hwang is making significant revisions to the script for the revival, incorporating recent discoveries about the relationship between Bernard Boursicot, who was an embassy worker, and Shi Pei Pu, a man whom Mr. Boursicot had believed for years to be a woman. The two were convicted of espionage in 1986. They were pardoned a year later. Mr. Owen, a British actor (“Closer”) will play the diplomat, named Rene Gallimard in the play. The play will be his second on Broadway  —   he made his Broadway debut in a 2015 revival of “Old Times,” by Harold Pinter. The role of the singer, named Song Liling in the play, has not yet been cast. The revival will mark Ms. Taymor’s first return to Broadway since “ : Turn Off the Dark,” a troubled production from which she was dismissed. She is best known as the creative genius behind the stage adaptation of “The Lion King,” for which she won two Tony Awards in 1998, for direction and costume design, and which is still going strong on Broadway and in productions around the world. Her most recent Off Broadway productions, including “Grounded” at the Public Theater and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” at Theater for a New Audience, won significant critical praise. The “M. Butterfly” revival, produced by Nelle Nugent, Steve Traxler, Kenneth Teaton, Benjamin Feldman and Doug Morris, the chief executive of Sony Music, is scheduled to open on Oct. 26 at an unspecified theater."

John McLean writes of a new paper about the pattern in global average temperature anomalies since 1950 and how they are linked to changes in cloud cover and ENSO:
Key points of the paper:

Indicates that the temperature pattern can be attributed to a
sequence of events, namely a shift in the prevailing ENSO conditions,
then a reduction in total cloud cover and then a shift on cloud
(decrease in low level cloud that was largely offset by an increase
in mid and upper level cloud)
Uses the Trenberth, Fasulo & Kiehl energy balance diagram to show
that the loss in total cloud cover caused an increase in heat energy
being absorbed at the Earth’s surface that was greater than the
increase that IPCC 5AR claims was due to greenhouse gases
Indicates that greenhouse gases played little if any part in the
warming, which not only refutes the IPCC’s belief or opinion but also
means that there is negligible, or even no, 16 or more years’ of
“missing heat” to be found.
Shows the changes in cloud cover and temperature both as global
averages and then for the six latitude bands each of 30 degrees, the
latter indicating the changes in cloud cover applied to most latitude
bands except the Antarctic and to a less extent 30S-60S.
Doesn’t attempt to identify the reason for the reduction in total
cloud cover or the shift from low level cloud.

McLean writes:
On the last point above, I think a reduction in micro-particle emissions probably contributed.  The disappearance of London’s “pea soup” fogs after the ban on the burning of coal is probably a good precedent. It would be ironic if the reduction in micro-particle emissions was due to government legislation because that would mean that the warming was manmade.  To be fair though, it was probably the first deliberate attempt to clean up the atmosphere even if it didn’t come with a warning about possible changes to weather patterns.  We also shouldn’t forget that there may be other causes, such as changes to cooking fuel in the tropics.

Late Twentieth-Century Warming and Variations in Cloud Cover

Author John McLean  Department of Physics, College of Science Technology and Engineering, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.



ABSTRACT

From 1950 to 1987 a strong relationship existed between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and HadCRUT4 global average temperature anomaly, interrupted occasionally by volcanic eruptions. After 1987 the relationship diverged, with temperature anomaly increasing more than expected, but was re-established after 1997 at an offset of ~0.48°C higher. The period of increased warming from 1987 to 1997 loosely coincided with the divergence of the global average temperature anomalies over land, which are derived from observation station recordings, and the global average anomalies in sea surface temperatures. Land-based temperatures averaged 0.04°C below sea temperatures for the period 1950 to 1987 but after 1997 averaged 0.41°C above sea temperatures. The increase in the global average temperature anomaly and the divergence of land and sea surface temperatures also coincided with two significant changes in global average cloud cover. Total cloud cover decreased during the period from 1987 to 1997 and, for most of the remainder of the period from 1984 to 2009, decreases in low-level cloud were accompanied by increases in middle and upper level cloud. These changes can be found in both global average cloud cover and in each of the six 30°C-latitude bands. The impact of these changes in cloud cover can account for the variations in HadCRUT4 global average temperature anomalies and the divergence between land and sea temperatures.

"A new book, described as “deeply and fatally flawed” by an expert reviewer, recently reached the top of Amazon’s bestseller list for environmental science and made it into a weekly top 10 list for all nonfiction titles. How did this happen? Because, as Brendan Behan put it, “there’s no such thing as bad publicity”. In an article promoting his book, Michael Shellenberger – with jaw-dropping hubris – apologises on behalf of all environmentalists for the “climate scare we created over the last 30 years”.  Shellenberger was named a hero of the environment by Time magazine in 2008 and is a loud advocate of nuclear power, but the article was described by six leading scientists as “cherry-picking”, “misleading” and containing “outright falsehoods”. The article was widely republished, even after being removed from its first home, Forbes, for violating the title’s editorial guidelines on self-promotion, adding further heat to the storm. And this is why all those who deny the reality or danger of the climate emergency should be ignored. Obviously, I have broken my own rule here, but only to make this vital point once and for all. The science is clear, the severity understood at the highest levels everywhere, and serious debates about what to do are turning into action. The deniers have nothing to contribute to this. However infuriating they are, arguing with them or debunking their theories is likely only to generate publicity or money for them. It also helps to generate a fake air of controversy over climate action that provides cover for the vested interests seeking to delay the end of the fossil fuel age. But the deniers are not all the same. They tend to fit into one of four different categories: the shill, the grifter, the egomaniac and the ideological fool. The shill is the easiest to understand. He, and it almost always is he, is paid by vested interests to emit clouds of confusion about the science or economics of climate action. This uncertainty creates a smokescreen behind which polluters can lobby against measures that cut their profits. A sadder case is that of the grifters. They have found themselves earning a living by grinding out contrarian articles for rightwing media outlets. Do they actually believe the guff they write? It doesn’t matter: they just warm their hands on the outrage, count the clicks and wait for the pay cheque. The egomaniacs are also tragic figures. They are disappointed, frustrated people whose careers have stalled and who can’t understand why the world refuses to give full reverence to their brilliance. They are desperate for recognition, and, when it stubbornly refuses to arrive, they are drawn to make increasingly extreme pronouncements, in the hope of finally being proved a dogma-busting, 21st-century Galileo. The ideological fool is the fourth type of climate denier, and they can be intelligent. But they are utterly blinded by their inane, no-limits version of the free-market creed. The climate emergency requires coordinated global action, they observe, and that looks horribly like communism in disguise. They could explore the many credible climate action plans being pursued, including by those on the political right. But their cognitive dissonance forces them to the conclusion that because state intervention is wrong, acting to avert climate danger cannot be right. Intellectual gymnastics to “expose” climate alarmism then follow naturally. But why do I say ignore them all? The climate crisis is urgent, and we need debate to drive action. However, vigorous debates over action are already taking place in good faith all over the world, from the tops of governments to the smallest local action groups. Every nation in the world signed up to the 2015 Paris climate deal, pledging to keep global heating below 2C and ideally to 1.5C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change involves thousands of international scientists and is arguably the greatest scientific endeavour in history. It has spent three decades spelling out in painstaking detail how humanity is causing global heating, how catastrophic that threatens to be – and how drastic action is required to avert the worst. The world of finance and business is catching up fast with the science, and almost all the technology needed already exists. In short, no sane or serious actor can countenance denial of climate danger. Bad-faith arguments motivated by greed, egomania or ideology have nothing to add. Which brings me to the US president, Donald Trump. Political leaders are the exception to the rule. Their climate idiocy should be challenged, as they hold actual power. But even in this case, reality is fast debunking their proclamations. In the US, coal is dying, because green energy is cheaper and cleaner, however great Trump claims he will make the miners. Even if Trump, and Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, persist, other nations will begin to ostracise them via trade sanctions and border taxes. As for the shill, grifter, egomaniac and ideological fool, the reality of increasing climate impacts and successful action is fast exposing them as well. Those willing to employ the shills and the grifters are dwindling. The book I started with has now been knocked off the environmental bestsellers list, fittingly enough by one published by the environmental hero Rachel Carson, in 1951. I can’t profess to know what Shellenberger’s motivation was, but one thing is clear: the egomaniacs and ideological fools will get the place in history they so lust for. It will be a small footnote marking the useful idiots of the climate war. • Damian Carrington is the Guardian’s Environment editor"
"“The animals are dying. Soon we will be alone here.” These two short statements – declarative, understated – open The Last Migration, Australian author Charlotte McConaghy’s debut novel. They work to set both the scene and the tone of the book: the novel is dreamy, elegiac, often heightened to the register of fairytales or myths; and it is set in a near future, where the effects of climate change have meant that the world’s animal life has almost completely died out.  This mass extinction is, McConaghy writes, “a fate we are, all of us, intimately aware of”. It’s a particular kind of existential loneliness, the book imagines, to live in a world devoid of birdsong, of chance encounters with creatures so different from ourselves – and it is a loneliness with which each character struggles in their own way. The novel’s protagonist is Franny, a restless and willful Irish-Australian woman with a deep affinity for birds, who is determined to track and follow the last remaining Arctic terns on what may well be their final annual migration, from their nesting grounds in Greenland to Antarctica. This journey is the longest migration undertaken by any animal – a complete crossing of the globe – and a feat that terns complete twice-yearly. The book uses this act of endurance, this instinctual movement, metaphorically: Franny too is driven to constant movement by forces she cannot control or understand, and is determined and driven even in the face of great adversity. Early in the novel, Franny manages to talk her way onto one of the few remaining fishing boats headed out of Greenland, promising the ship’s captain, Ennis, she can deliver him a catch even in the depleted ocean by following the terns she has tagged with trackers and which will stop to feed as they travel. Ennis is a kind of Ahab figure, dreadfully obsessed with chasing what he terms the “Golden Catch”, one last great haul – which is why, despite his reservations, he allows Franny onto his ship. As the ship travels south, into ever-more dangerous waters and increasingly further from human sanctions and society, Franny’s own dark past and the ways in which it has brought her to this place are slowly revealed to the reader. The Last Migration is something of a hybrid novel, both an adventure story and a piece of speculative climate fiction, constantly slipping between a kind of literary realism and more magical elements, between moments of domestic drama – such as when Franny visits the rambling family of one of the ship’s crew in a coastal town in Newfoundland, or remembers her life with her ornithologist husband, Niall – and sweeping epic. This slipperiness is heightened by the book’s constant shuttling about in time, as well as the unreliability of Franny’s narration, the half-truths and silences with which she surrounds herself and everything she holds back from the other characters and the reader alike. McConaghy also structures much of the book and fleshes out her characters according to metaphor: Franny, who often describes herself as “a creature”, has so deep an identification with birds that she often dreams of turning into one, or of her throat filling with feathers; her wanderings around the world are described as instinctual and “in her nature”, just like a migration. She sleepwalks, driven in part by this restlessness within her, in part by her traumatic past. There are storms at sea that correspond with emotional turmoil, a sense of isolation within the characters that is aligned with that of a world stripped of natural life, and dream sequences and images that repeat and unfurl as the book progresses. This all adds to the broody, otherworldly quality of the book’s atmosphere, but it does, at times, begin to feel a bit laboured and mannered – especially as the novel progresses. So too is there a neatness to the ending that seems an uncomfortable fit with the ambiguity and slipperiness of the rest of the book. The Last Migration is nonetheless an aching and poignant book, and one that’s pressing in its timeliness. It’s often devastating in its depictions of grief, especially the wider, harder to grasp grief of living in a world that has changed catastrophically, where governments and scientists are scrambling to ameliorate what harm they can – choosing, for example, which particular animals are the most important to try to save (pollinators, like insects and bats), and which to let disappear forever. But it’s also a book about love, about trying to understand and accept the creatureliness that exists within our selves, and what it means to be a human animal, that we might better accommodate our own wildness within the world. • The Last Migration by Charlotte McConaghy is out now through Penguin Random House"
"Medical treatments for amphibians, resurrection of extinct species, increasing temperatures in the deep oceans and trade-offs between the financial value of fossil fuels and the magnitude of climate change. Our diverse group of 20 researchers, science advisers and one journalist identified these as among 15 little-understood issues that may affect global environmental status in the coming years. Brought together by William Sutherland, professor of conservation biology at Cambridge University, this was the fifth annual gathering to carry out environmental horizon scanning, a formal way of systematically identifying future developments that may affect society or the natural world. These developments have not yet been realised, but may be approaching quickly. Identifying these emerging issues gives researchers, decision-makers, and the public an opportunity to pay attention, ask questions and prepare.  Published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, the horizons we identified for 2014 were based on the input of more than 350 people who raised more than 80 different topics. The final 15 were those that seemed to be most plausible, least well-known, and whose effects may be the most substantial.  A common debate over the last year or two has been whether global warming has been on hiatus since 1998. It’s true that the rate at which Earth’s surface temperature is increasing seemed to slow during the past decade. Does that mean global climate models are wrong? As it turns out, the models largely are correct. The heat isn’t missing – rather, temperatures are increasing in an unexpected place: the deep ocean. The apparent rate of climate change and the geographic distribution of changes in climate affects decisions about energy policy. The potential environmental effects of rising deep-sea temperatures are poorly understood. How the vast ecological and geochemical systems of the deep oceans will react to heating, and how that might affect coasts, are open questions. Two other climate change-related topics we identified for 2014 were advances in carbon-based solar cells, which we think have considerable potential as an alternative source of energy, and the response of financial markets to the concept of unburnable carbon.  For society to keep increases in global temperature below 2°C, considerable reserves of coal, oil and gas must be left in the ground. Yet the value of these reserves to the world’s largest 200 companies – an estimated US$4 trillion – is based on the expectation that the reserves ultimately will be burned. If the reserves are not burned, then the resulting decrease in their value might have serious effects on society. Investors and regulators may find themselves navigating between preventing unprecedented climate change at the risk of financial crisis, or preventing financial crisis at the risk of unprecedented climate change. Fortunately, not every issue in our horizon scan was quite so daunting. Industrial farming of macroalgae – seaweed – has the potential to produce up to six times more biofuel than can be grown on land. At that scale, however, seaweed farming also could affect the status of near-shore ecosystems and fisheries. Would this be a good thing or a bad thing? We don’t make value judgements in our horizon scans, but we recognise that the environmental effects could be complicated and substantial, and therefore might warrant consideration. Another coastal issue we identified is that more than 10m hectares of coastal and lowland peat swamp forest in Southeast Asia have been drained for agriculture and plantations. As a result, that land gradually is sinking. It’s expected that by the year 2100, much of Indonesia and Malaysia’s lowlands will have subsided by up to four metres. In the Netherlands, where drainage of peat long ago caused coastal areas to sink below sea level, flooding was alleviated by dykes and pumps. But similar engineering systems might not be effective in tropical regions that experience monsoons, and they typically are extremely expensive. We recognised that at the nexus between public health and the environment are emerging biotechnological methods to sterilise Aedes mosquitoes via heritable genetic modifications. These methods also could be applied to controlling or eradicating well-established populations of non-native invasive species. Doing so might greatly increase the probability of conserving the native species with which they compete. But potential unintended effects of these methods have not been investigated in detail. Animals such as the woolly mammoth, passenger pigeon, and thylacine someday might be resurrected by new methods in synthetic biology. In some cases the animals might be reintroduced to the wild. And, even in captive populations, the animals could play a role in research and education. The viability, safety and ethics of this work, however, have not been explored fully. It has been suggested that resurrection efforts might distract from more-practical conservation measures, and from the role that genetic diversity plays in increasing species’ potential for adaptive evolution. Other issues we identified included increasing the size of islands over which efforts are being undertaken to eradicate invasive mammals. For example, rabbits, black rats, and feral cats have been removed from Macquarie Island, and programs are underway to remove reindeer, house mice, and brown rats from South Georgia. Other issues we identified for 2014 were expanding the IUCN’s endangered designations to include not only species but ecosystems; developing probiotic treatments for populations of amphibians that are declining in response to chytridiomycosis, a chronic skin disease; an emerging fungal disease that is causing declines of snakes; the sharp decline, after decades of recovery, of elephant and rhinoceros populations; and the growing pressure to exploit Antarctica’s natural resources. Our previous horizon scans identified topics including the re-emergence of rinderpest in 2011; sterile farming and deep-ocean mining in 2012; and the rapid growth of concentrated solar power in 2013. By investigating and debating the issues identified in horizon scans, the better prepared society may be in years to come. Brandon Keim of WIRED magazine contributed to this article."

Tegucigalpa, Honduras — Why has Honduras lagged behind its neighbors and much of the rest of the world? It is resource‐​rich, has deep‐​water ports both on the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, is very scenic and, because of its mountain terrain, has sub‐​climates that meet most people’s preferences.



As can be seen in the accompanying table, Honduras compares poorly with neighboring countries and some other countries of similar size. Guatemala next door has a per capita income roughly 50 percent higher, Costa Rica three times higher, Chile five times higher, and Switzerland and Hong Kong about 12 times higher than Honduras’. Honduras lags and suffers because of the lack of the rule of law and economic freedom.





Honduras is, unfortunately, well-known for having the highest murder rate in the world. In cities such as San Pedro Sula, drug gangs engage in open warfare on each other. The relatively good news is that the violence is seldom directed against tourists, legitimate business people and professionals, even though property crime is high.



The genuinely good news is that Honduras has a relatively small government, comparatively low taxes, and manageable government debt. It has free-trade agreements with 40 countries, accounting for about 1.5 billion people, so it is an attractive location for many export-oriented businesses. The financial sector and monetary system are both reasonably stable and well-managed.



The regulatory system is uncertain with too many corrupt bureaucrats and judges. There is extensive underemployment in part due to the corruption and counterproductive labor laws and regulations.





The Honduran ZEDE experiment is a part of the attempt to not only catch up with its neighbors but to surpass them.



Despite its problems, the ills that plague Honduras are known and fixable. Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani demonstrated that crime and murder rates can be quickly brought down with smart policing and a determined political leadership. (New York City has approximately the same population as Honduras.) Honduras should move to “e‐​government” as Estonia did a couple of decades ago under the leadership of Prime Minister Mart Laar to quickly get rid of much of the corruption. Corrupt and incompetent judges need to be fired, and even be temporarily replaced with some respected foreign judges as some countries have done. Former Chilean mining and labor minister, Jose Pinera, was the architect of the reform of Chile’s social security system and subsurface property rights regime, which were key ingredients in Chile’s rush from a poor to a developed country. Honduras ought to adopt much of the Chilean model.



Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, his predecessor and the Honduran Congress have supported the creation of free zones within Honduras as demonstration projects to show the benefits of free markets and the rule of law in creating well‐​paying jobs and economic growth. The first of these zones will be operational within the next couple of months. They are known as ZEDEs, meaning Zone for Employment and Economic Development.



The approval and operational rules of each ZEDE are provided by an international committee known as CAMP (Committee of Best Practices). In order to provide international credibility and independence, the majority of the CAMP members (of which I am one) are non‐​Hondurans, drawn from nine countries. An American ex‐​pat and free‐​market political evangelist, Mark Klugmann, Honduran lawyer and former government official Octavio Sanchez, Executive Secretary of the Cabinet Ebal Diaz, and former President Ricardo Maduro were instrumental in the design and selling of the ZEDE concept. The ZEDEs will be able to create their own infrastructure — plus fire, police, medical facilities and civil court system (using the British common law system rather than the Honduran administrative law system if they so choose). The ZEDEs can also allow choice in currency. In essence, each ZEDE will operate as a free city — devising most of its own rules, regulations and structure to make it economically attractive to foreign investors. If they work as envisioned, they will be major employment generators and free of corruption, and thus serve as a role model for the rest of Honduras.



There are many recent examples of countries — and relatively free economic enclaves around the world — achieving very high economic growth rates for a sustained period of time. There is no reason why Honduras cannot make the necessary changes to become a high‐​growth country, with the doubling of real incomes every decade or so, quickly becoming a developed (and safe) country. The Honduran ZEDE experiment is a part of the attempt to not only catch up with its neighbors but to surpass them.

"When the Russian owned factory ship Oleg Naydenov was recently seized by armed Senegalese commandos for illegal fishing in Senegal’s exclusive territorial 12-mile fishing zone, it shone a much-needed spotlight on the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or “pirate fishing” as it is commonly known. The worldwide loss of fish stocks from pirate fishing costs legitimate fisheries between US$10-23.5 billion every year. Pirate fishers are also notorious for their involvement in smuggling drugs and firearms and for serious human rights abuses. Developing countries with poor governance are particularly targeted by pirate fishers. For example, more than a third (37%) of all reported catches from the coast of West Africa are thought to be illegal. Since 2010, the Environmental Justice Foundation has documented more than 200 reports of illegal fishing there by Korean vessels alone. Such plundering of the seas deprives law-abiding fishers of earnings, and food. From an environmental perspective, illegal fishing has a considerable impact on the replenishment of fish stocks. By using banned and harmful practices, pirates remove juvenile fish that have not had a chance to breed, and destroy vital fish habitats. A study from Guinea-Bissau reported that if all fishing nets of an illegal mesh size (and so small enough to catch juveniles) were eliminated, legal fishers would see their profits rise by perhaps 50–100%. The human rights violations which occur aboard illegal fishing vessels are horrific. Poor people in search of work are routinely trafficked across borders then sold into illegal fishing by professional brokers. They then become trapped in a world of abuse, intimidation and work for little or no pay. Once trapped their chances for escape are limited. Hi-tech tools are increasingly deployed against illegal fishers. For example, by following tracking transmitters on ships with satellites, authorities can identify if a vessel is fishing where it shouldn’t. In some regions the amount of illegal fishing has been reduced, for example in the Antarctic where it has dropped to less than 10% of previous levels. This has been possible due to well-funded surveillance and worldwide cooperation. In Europe, major trade sanctions were for the first time announced against countries operating flags of convenience. This practice allows boat owners to purchase the right to fly the flag of nations that have not signed the UN Law of the Sea. As such the boat does not need to recognise international fishing law. Under the new sanctions, fish imports from Belize, Guinea and Cambodia will be banned from the European Union, while South Korea, Ghana and Curaçao have all been warned that they will have to show progress on tackling pirate fishing within six months or face a similar fish import ban. Although fishing vessels have names and other identifiers, these are not permanent and can be easily painted over and changed by their owners. This makes it incredibly difficult for authorities to recognise specific vessels engaged in illegal fishing and to track misconduct. Introducing mandatory, permanent ship registrations in accordance with standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been recommended by organisations such as the Environmental Justice Foundation and Oceana.  The IMO ship numbering system is already well recognised and the new records it could create would produce an independent audit trail for fishing vessels and their ownership. In November 2013, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) became the first marine management organisation to require IMO numbers on all vessels fishing within its jurisdiction. In the fight against illegal fishing, much could also be gained from tighter port controls. In Europe, Council Regulation (EC) 1005/2008 provides a framework that allows illegal fish to be seized in European ports. However, some countries implement this law more assiduouly than others; Spain alone is believed to account for over 50% of consignment rejections across the whole of the EU. Given that pirate fishing undoubtedly causes serious environmental problems and poses a threat to food security for some of the world’s poorest countries, it is an issue that needs urgent, co-ordinated international attention.

"WASHINGTON  —   By some measures, President Trump has altered the perception of American foreign policy more in the past seven days than his predecessors did in the past seven decades. A nation that built its brand around the world as open to the world’s needy and ambitious is now viewed, after Mr. Trump’s immigration executive order, as closing its doors in a way it never did even after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Twenty years of    efforts to rebuild a relationship with Mexico  —   on trade, counterterrorism and drug interdiction  —   crashed into an avoidable blowup with the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, who canceled his visit here. When Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain came for what appeared to be a largely successful visit, Mr. Trump’s first by the leader of a close ally, she spoke of maintaining sanctions on Russia until it met its commitments on Ukraine. Mr. Trump stayed silent. After he spoke the next day to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the official readout provided by the White House made no mention of Ukraine, or of the   operation to influence the American election that led President Barack Obama, in his last days in office, to issue new sanctions. Perception is different from reality. It is possible that when viewed from a distance of a few years, Mr. Trump’s pronouncements about “extreme vetting” and his rush to push some of America’s most experienced career diplomats out of their jobs will look like a   blitz intended to send a message to the world that he meant what he said when he talked about “America First. ” In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to try to soften his action, arguing that “this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. ” He promised to “find ways to help all those who are suffering,” words that were missing on Friday when he announced that all refugees from Syria would be barred from entry to the United States, indefinitely. “It’s one week in,” Robert M. Gates, the former secretary of defense and C. I. A. director, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “Every administration I’ve worked for begins with a flurry of executive orders” meant to distinguish itself from it predecessor. But Mr. Gates, who has served eight presidents, of both parties, quickly added that Mr. Trump risks accelerating a sense of an America that is pulling back and putting up walls, leaving a power vacuum around the globe. “That vacuum will not be filled by benign forces,” he said. Two other prominent, establishment Republicans, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, called the lumping together in the immigration order of a major adversary, Iran, with an ally, Iraq, one of many reasons that the moves are “a   wound in the fight against terrorism. ” Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to announce shifts in policy that surprised allies and upturned the existing order. President Richard M. Nixon’s decision to abandon the gold standard and to recognize China were shocks to the system. So was President George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq, though it was telegraphed for more than a year, as was Mr. Obama’s decision to strike a nuclear accord with Iran and to reopen diplomatic relations with Cuba. But in the case of Mr. Trump, there is a sense that the rush for change has superseded a study of unintended consequences. The ban on immigration and visitors from seven nations came with minimal, if any, input from the State Department about the regional fallout  —   as did Mr. Trump’s declaration that he intends to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The absence of advance thinking about how to deal with green card holders and Iraqi interpreters who were promised entry to the United States in return for their service to American troops forced the White House to amend its interpretations of the order less than 48 hours after Mr. Trump signed it. It was all symptomatic of a new president eager to tweet first and work out details later. “This is policy by thunderbolt,” said Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who served as the head of the National Intelligence Council and has written extensively on how the United States can gain leverage from its “soft power”  —   the attractiveness of its culture and democracy. “You don’t want to tear up 70 years of foreign policy until you think hard about what replaces it. ” But inside the halls of the State Department, where Rex W. Tillerson, the pick for secretary of state, has just begun to find his way around, there is definitely the sense among career diplomats that this is Year Zero. Last week, the “landing team” of Trump designees told several of the department’s most senior diplomats  —   career officials, some with decades of service  —   to clear out of their offices. Almost all had submitted their resignations, the protocol when administrations changed, but had volunteered to stay on for a month or two until successors were appointed, to ensure that State Department facilities were safe, American citizens were evacuated from perilous places and passports were issued. The Trump team made it clear it had no interest in transitions. (Mr. Tillerson also never met    with his predecessor, John Kerry, before the inauguration.) It was not exactly a purge, but the fact remains that some of the government’s most experienced diplomats have moved on  —   including some of the   women in the department. Among them is Anne Patterson, 67, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and a former ambassador to Pakistan and Egypt, two of the biggest tinderboxes Mr. Trump will face. Victoria J. Nuland, 55, one of the department’s top Russia experts and former ambassador to NATO, who dealt with the Ukraine crisis, decided to retire after concluding there was probably no place for her in Mr. Trump’s administration. Such a housecleaning leaves open the question of whether Mr. Tillerson, who has extensive experience abroad as chief executive of Exxon Mobil but none as a diplomat, will have the kind of help he needs in a very different kind of enterprise than negotiating on behalf of the world’s largest oil company. In such an atmosphere, even seemingly routine moves  —   like the reorganization of the National Security Council  —   take on a political air. On Sunday, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and chief ideologue, Stephen K. Bannon, was designated a permanent member of the “principals committee” of the National Security Council, putting a political aide on par with the secretaries of state and defense. Meanwhile, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to be downgraded, told to attend only when their issues were on the table. “This is stone cold crazy,” Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser until earlier this month, wrote in a Twitter post. “Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK?” she said, using acronyms for the Islamic State and North Korea. Mr. Trump’s answer is simple: When you have come to upend the establishment, the establishment must vacate the premises."

Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are an important arm of civil society in liberal democracies. “Service Delivery” NGOs are some of the most recognisable brands in the world. In Australia especially, NGOs like the Country Fire Authority, State Emergency Service and the Country Women’s Association are some of our most venerable and trusted institutions.



But NGOs have become almost synonymous with political lobbying – especially of the far left variety. Unfortunately, many of these lobbyists are unscrupulous leftist bullies who blacken the collective reputation of the entire NGO sector.



Especially when they abuse charitable status.



Animal activist group Vegan Rising has been stripped of its official charity status. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission revoked the group’s registered charity status today, following an investigation. Vegan Rising had been granted charity status with the same purpose of controversial animal activist group Aussie Farms — “the purpose of preventing or relieving the suffering of animals”.



Aussie Farms, the creeps behind the alarming series of mass-raids on family farms, have already had their charity status pulled – yet still claim to be a charity.



Aussie Farms had its charity status revoked last month, but The Weekly Times recently revealed it was still calling itself a charity and the national regulator had no power to stop it.



So, do Vegan Rising actually **do** anything to help actual animals?



Vegan Rising seeks donations through its website for “powerful campaigns for animals” and states it has “one objective […] to help create a vegan world” […]Vegan Rising members took part in a national day of animal activist action in April where they brought one of Melbourne’s busiest intersections to a stand still […]



According to ACNC documents, Vegan Rising received more than $12,000 in donations and bequests in the 2017-18 financial year. It spent less than $4000 in the same period.



That would be a big, fat, **“NO”** , then.



Other shifty, bullying green-left NGOs are also coming under the microscope. GetUp notoriously subjected a female MP to an unprecedented campaign of harassment and stalking at the last election. Its campaign against Treasurer Josh Frydenberg developed a nasty whiff of the sort of anti-Semitism now infesting the British left. Now, it’s trying to fill its coffers from off the backs of Australia’s revered firies.



GetUp is using the bushfires raging along Australia’s east coast in a new drive for public support, asking people to sign a petition berating Scott Morrison’s government for not doing enough to resource emergency services. A GetUp email seeking support links the current bushfire season to climate change and includes a request for donations to help fund the group’s work […]



Liberal senator Eric Abetz branded the new campaign a “false” and “tawdry” attempt to link uncontested government and community support for firefighters to GetUp’s political agenda.



He said GetUp was trying to revive its standing after discredited efforts at the May federal election to target Coalition MPs such as Nicolle Flint, Josh Frydenberg and others with an anti-Coalition “hit-list” campaign.



Every time you think these dodgy NGOs have scraped as low as they possibly could, they go right ahead and prove that leftist venality is a bottomless pit.

"The secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, a free trade agreement being hammered out between twelve countries, has received another broadside from Wikileaks. The third leak in three months, this was the draft environmental chapter and a report showing the positions on the chapter of the twelve member countries – Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US, and Vietnam.  The latest leak is significant for three reasons. First, the fact that someone or some member country inside the process has leaked yet another chapter shows there are some very unhappy campers holed up in these negotiations. Pressure is clearly being applied to countries that feel they need outside voices to help them hold the line. That pressure continues to intensify, making further leaks likely. These documents, dated 24 November 2013, the last day of the Salt Lake City round that preceded the December meeting of TPP ministers in Singapore, gives some insight into how ministers are trying to break the deadlock in key areas.  Asking one country, in this case the Canadian chair of the environment working group, to prepare a new text themselves to present to the rest is a controversial strategy used at the World Trade Organisation to isolate countries that are holding outlier positions, even ones that are critically important for them. They can be treated as obstructive if they insist on holding the line, unless they are sufficiently powerful to get their own way when it comes to the political trade-offs. Second, the text is weak – hardly the 21st century standard-setter TPP cheerleaders have been claiming. The environmental provisions in this document address a wide range of issues from overfishing, shark-finning and protecting endangered species, to recognising indigenous rights over traditional knowledge and genetic resources. Most of the provisions are aspirational and it has no teeth to enforce what limited obligations there are. I have mixed feelings about that. The core chapters of these agreements, especially on investment, agriculture, intellectual property and services, impose pro-corporate rules on governments and communities. Those rules are toxic to biodiversity, ecosystems, indigenous knowledge and resources, human and animal health, water, forests fish and other natural resources, and other aspects of conservation and the environment. And those rules are certainly enforceable, in the case of investments both by states and through the notorious investor-state dispute settlement processes . The secrecy of the cases, inconsistent, usually pro-investor interpretations, conflicts of interests of many arbitrators, and excessive awards of compensation, including compound interest, are just some of the grievances.  The vast majority of investor-state disputes involve government measures to regulate natural resources or to protect the environment or public health. Environment chapters are often mere fig leaves, used to deflect criticisms. So it’s no surprise that the TPP’s environment chapter is weak, lacking measures for enforcement or dispute. They are not meant to act as an antidote. So the leaked chapter confirms our expectations that the “gold standard” rules are only for the corporations, not to protect people and the planet. But if the agreement does happen, a strong chapter could be important. That leads to the third and most significant point from the leaks. The chair’s commentary shows the US is the outlier on most of the disputed provisions. That includes articles that refer explicitly or by implication to international agreements it has not signed, such as the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But the most important outlier is the refusal of all the other governments to agree that even these weak obligations should be enforceable by trade sanctions under the dispute mechanisms that apply to the agreement as a whole. Instead, they have proposed a mixture of consultations, political discussions, and arbitration that leads to a conclusion about a breach and an action plan – but nothing to enforce it. Back in May 2007 President George W Bush did a deal with the Democrat-controlled Congress. Its terms included what must be in the environment chapter of any US free trade agreement. Those requirements include the enforceability of the chapter by imposing trade sanctions for governments found to have breached their obligations. The US has required that in all subsequent free trade pacts. But this leaked text falls far short of the May 2007 standards in many ways, and especially on sanctions. This poses a dilemma for the Obama administration. On 9 January a bill was tabled in both houses of Congress seeking fast track negotiating authority for the TPP and other agreements. Fast track would require Democrats and Republicans to accept or reject a final text as a whole, within a specified time. Obama is already struggling for support. This environment chapter will strengthen opposition from some Democrats and force Obama to rely even more on hostile Republicans. Even with fast track, a TPP with an unenforceable environment chapter would be very hard to pass. As if to herald such a showdown, US Trade Representative Michael Froman made clear in response to the leak, that “we will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or we will not come to agreement”. It is hard to imagine the environment chapter being the break point for the TPP. The US will play hardball. The current bet is on a trade-off that accepts enforcement of an incredibly weak chapter, making the concession largely meaningless. But the leaked chapter will show that the other eleven countries have caved to US demands, an association they may soon regret."

The more than seven billion people living in the world today need affordable, abundant energy — and a livable climate — to flourish. But the world’s leading source of energy is also the leading source of increasing greenhouse gases.



What to do? This is the vital question Al Gore took on in his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, and takes on again in his newly released follow‐​up An Inconvenient Sequel.



As the most influential figure in the international climate conversation, Gore has a responsibility to give us the _whole picture_ of fossil fuels’ impacts — both their benefits and the risks they pose to humans flourishing. Unfortunately, Gore has given us a deeply biased picture that completely ignores fossil fuels’ indispensable benefits and wildly exaggerates their impact on climate.





Gore’s Inconvenient Sequel gives a biased, self‐​serving, and convenient picture of fossil fuels and climate — convenient for Gore’s legacy, that is, but inconvenient for the billions his energy poverty policies will harm.



The running theme throughout An Inconvenient Sequel is that Gore’s first film was even more right than he expected. The movie begins with defenders of fossil fuels mocking or ignoring the dramatic predictions of An Inconvenient Truth. Leaving aside a heroic (and highly disputed) portrayal of Gore rescuing the Paris climate accord, the rest of the movie focuses on vindicating Gore’s two chief predictions: 1) That we could replace fossil fuels with cheap solar‐ and wind‐​powered “renewables”; and 2) that continued use of fossil fuels would lead to catastrophic temperature rises, catastrophic sea‐​level rises, catastrophic flooding, catastrophic drought, catastrophic storms, and catastrophic disease proliferation.



To justify these claims, Gore makes extensive uses of anecdotes: he shows us the town of Georgetown, Tex. and its use of  100‐​per‐​cent renewable energy, a deadly heat wave in India, a deadly flood in Miami, a deadly drought in Syria, a deadly storm in the Philippines, and the Zika virus penetrating the United States.



Some of his anecdotes are meant to prove that cheap solar and wind are, as 2006 Gore prophesied, quickly dominating the world’s energy supply and, as 2006 Gore also warned us, that our rapidly warming climate is killing more and more people each year. But he has not given us the whole picture.



Take the rising dominance of solar and wind, which is used to paint supporters of fossil fuels as troglodytes, fools, and shills for Big Oil. The combined share of world energy consumption from renewables is all of _two per cent_ _._ And it’s an expensive, unreliable, and therefore difficult‐​to‐​scale two per cent.



Because solar and wind are “unreliables,” they need to be backed up by reliable sources of power, usually fossil fuels, or sometimes non‐​carbon sources including nuclear and large‐​scale hydro power (all of which Gore and other environmentalists refuse to support). This is why every grid that incorporates significant solar and wind has more expensive electricity. Germans, on the hook for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s self‐​righteous anti‐​carbon commitments, are already paying three times the rates for electricity that Americans do.



Stories about “100‐​per‐​cent renewable” locations like Georgetown, Tex. are not just anecdotal evidence, they are lies. The Texas grid from which Georgetown draws its electricity is comprised of 43.7 per cent natural gas, 28.8 per cent coal, 12 per cent nuclear, and only 15.6 per cent renewable. Using a virtue‐​signalling gimmick pioneered by Apple, Facebook, and Google, Georgetown pays its state utility to label its grid electricity “renewable” — even though it draws its power from that fossil‐​fuel heavy Texas grid — while tarring others on the grid as “non‐​renewable.”



If we look at the overall trends instead of engaging in anecdotal manipulation we see that fossil fuel energy is the fastest‐​growing energy source in the world — still. Fossil fuels have never been more vital to human flourishing. There are _1,600 coal_ Advances in technology are making fossil fuels cleaner, safer, and more efficient than ever. To reduce their growth let alone to radically restrict their use — which is what Gore advocates — means forcing energy poverty on billions of people.



Gore and others should be free to make the case that the danger of greenhouse gases is so serious as to warrant that scale of human misery. But they should have to quantify and justify the magnitude of climate danger. And that brings us to the truth about climate.



The overall trend in climate danger is that it is at an all‐​time low. The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) shows 6,114 climate‐​related deaths in 2016. In other recent years the numbers have maxed out in the tens of thousands. Compare this to the 1930s when, adjusted for population, climate‐​related deaths hit the 10‐​million mark several times.



The most significant cause of our radically reduced climate danger is industrial development, which takes a naturally dangerous climate and makes it unnaturally safe. And industrial development is driven by cheap, plentiful, reliable energy — which, today, overwhelmingly means fossil fuels. Climate will always be dangerous so priority number one is to have the energy and development to tame it. Modern irrigation, residential heating and air conditioning have made once uninhabitable places perfectly comfortable.



Gore’s _Inconvenient Sequel_ gives a biased, self‐​serving, and convenient picture of fossil fuels and climate — convenient for Gore’s legacy, that is, but inconvenient for the billions his energy poverty policies will harm. As citizens, we must start demanding responsible thought leaders who will give us the whole picture that life‐​and‐​death energy and climate decisions require.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vorholt at Germany’s center-left national weekly Die Zeit here reports in a commentary that the country is “fouling up its Energiewende” (shift to renewable energies) and writes that experts say the country will not reach its stated CO2 emissions reductions target. He calls this situation “embarrassing”.
Don’t look too closely
Lately there have been a number of reports stating that Germany’s Energiewende has become more window dressing and grandstanding than substance. Vorholt brings up an important point, warning that if Germany fails at its man-on-the-moon project Energiewende, the country even risks taking the wind out of the sails of the global green energy movement. After all if technology savvy Germany cannot do it, then other countries won’t bother trying. So far it does not look good. Germany’s electricity rates have skyrocketed, CO2 emissions however have remained stubbornly high and Germany’s power grid is now far more unstable and at risk of blackouts. Who wants to copy that?
Vorholz writes:
In view of the real problems with the conversion of the energy supply system, one has to hope that foreign countries don’t look too closely. Namely a close look could could be sobering.”
Reaching targets looks unrealistic
At the current rate, Germany will never meet its 2020 target of reducing CO2, Vorholt reports, writing that the country would have to triple its current rate of emissions reductions in order for it to reach the 2020 target of a 40% reduction over 1990 levels. He cites a statement issued by a government appointed commission, which issued a 19-page report that sees the Energiewende has “many deficits” and that there are “comprehensive necessities to act“. Die green-leaning Zeit adds:
Even the high-ranking government advisors are skeptical. The central target of reducing CO2 emmissions by 40 percent by 2020 with respect to 1990 levels is ‘substantially at risk’.”
Clearly, Germany reaching the set targets is very much in serious doubt.

One factor that does not get mentioned in the Die Zeit piece is the millions of refugees who are expected to arrive in Germany over the coming years, and so further increase the demand for power and energy.
Global climate will be decided in China and India
Another obstacle to meeting the 2020 40% reduction target comes from Germany’s socialist SPD party: Hannelore Kraft, the Prime Minister of Germany’s most populated and industrial state of North Rhine Westphalia, a region that is concentrated with heavy industries and trade unions. The influential socialist politician has sharply criticized the Federal Ministry of Environment’s plans for a rapid shut-down of the country’s coal-fired power plants, many of which are located in her state, slated to take place over the next 20 years.
German public radio Deutschlandfunk reports here:
The SPD politician says this is a go-it-alone by Hendricks [Federal Minister of Environment] and is neither the position of the SPD in North Rhine Westphalia, nor of the SPD at the national level.”
Coal miners, steel workers and power plant employees represented by powerful trade unions aren’t about to willingly trade in their high paying industrial jobs in exchange for a reduction of global CO2 emissions by a few ten thousandths of a percent. Deutschlandfunk adds:
The IG BCE mining union spoke of symbolic actions. Not in Germany, but in other countries, such as China or India, will the global climate be decided.”
In summary, not only the technical obstacles are appearing insurmountable, but also the political ones as well. Germany of course will sign on to ambitious reductions in CO2 emissions in Paris and try to project an image of leadership. That is easy. Doing it, however, will be a completely different story.

Joe Romm, of the political activist group: Center for American Progress
After the Willie Soon imbroglio there came news that Dr. Roger Pielke Jr., who is not a climate skeptic, is also under investigation (in what can only be seen as part of a broader witch-hunt). Pielke Jr. writes on his blog, “the Climate Fix” about undisclosed Conflicts Of Interest (COI):

 
I have Tweeted that undisclosed COI is endemic in scientific publishing. I have had several requests for elaboration.
Here is a great example.
This paper was published by ERL in 2010: http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/1/014017/fulltext/
It has a list of 53 co-authors. The ERL publication policy states:
“All authors and co-authors are required to disclose any potential conflict of interest when submitting their article (e.g. employment, consulting fees, research contracts, stock ownership, patent licenses, honoraria, advisory affiliations, etc). This information should be included in an acknowledgments section at the end of the manuscript (before the references section). All sources of financial support for the project must also be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The name of the funding agency and the grant number should be given, for example: “This work was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through a National Cancer Institute grant R21CA141833.””
There was no COI disclosure whatsoever associated with this paper.
The 53 authors include (for example) Joe Romm, Hal Harvey and Amory Lovins each of whom had massive undisclosed financial COI (obviously and easily documented) associated with renewable energy and political advocacy. No doubt other co-authors do as well. Further, several of these co-authors have also testified before Congress without COI disclosure.
Two points:

The lack of COI disclosure in this case does not mean that the paper is in any way in error.
The lack of COI disclosure in this case does not in any way justify or excuse similar lack of COI disclosure by Willie Soon. But it does point to the incredible selectivity of outrage in standards of COI disclosure, e.g., as applied by the NYT and US Congress. The Soon case and the example here are exactly parallel.

If COI disclosure is a good idea, and I think that it is, then it should be applied consistently across academic publishing and testimony, rather than being used as a selectively applied political bludgeon by campaigning journalists and politicians seeking to delegitimize certian academics whose work they do not like.
 

 
To be clear on Pielke’s point, Romm is paid to run the political attack blog “Climate Progress” by the Center for American Progress, a progressive (liberal) political action group in Washington, DC. according to his bio there. According the the lastest IRS form 990 on file (required for tax exempt 501c3 organizations) Romm’s outfit collected over 39 million dollars in revenue in 2012. See form 990 here: CAP_300126510_2012_09818b30
The Center for American Progress has a long history of big political money:
Funny how Joe Romm didn’t see the need to disclose such potential conflicts of interest to a highly paid political organization that politicizes climate, while writing a scientific paper about climate. Meanwhile his blog attacks Willie Soon saying:
Climate Deniers’ Favorite Scientist Quietly Took Money From The Fossil Fuel Industry
Joe, pot, kettle.
The label “paid shill” doesn’t really do justice here to Romm’s hypocrisy.

Two years ago protestors took over the streets of Istanbul, Turkey’s first city. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan beat them down and last year was elected president. Critics feared his plan to invest the largely ceremonial post with Putinesque authority. On Sunday, however, Turkish voters revoked his party’s majority.



The Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002. Erdogan initially allied with liberals to systematically dismantle the authoritarian, nationalistic, coup‐​prone system that had replaced the Ottoman Empire.



Military leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who achieved distinction defending against the allies in the infamous Gallipoli campaign, rose to power in World War I’s tumultuous aftermath. He became the first president of the Republic of Turkey and took on the name Ataturk (“Father of the Turks”), which parliament reserved for him. His ubiquitous image dominates the landscape; his mausoleum and memorial cover an entire city block in the capital of Ankara. The only comparable personality cult which I’ve seen is in North Korea.



Ataturk was no self‐​effacing republican. He ruthlessly modernized, enforced secularism, and constructed a one‐​party state. After his death there were elections but the politicians didn’t really rule. The military staged three hard coups, the last in 1980, and a softer putsch in 1997.



The generals executed and jailed opponents. Even criticism of Ataturk and “Kemalism” resulted in prosecution. Academics and journalists risked their jobs. Ruthless repression of the Kurds (which Ankara denied were a separate people) led to a 30‐​year war which cost 40,000 lives. In 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus, seized nearly 40 percent of the island, and ethnically cleansed the occupied zone of Greeks; the division of the island lives on four decades later. Religious minorities, such as the Armenian and Greek Orthodox, were marginalized. The military attempted to suppress even moderate Islamic sentiments. As Istanbul mayor Erdogan read an Islamist poem in public, for which he was ousted and imprisoned briefly.





The Turkish people must take full advantage of their opportunities in a new Turkey.



Eventually the nationalist establishment imploded. Weak coalition governments tolerated corruption and delivered economic malaise. In 2002 the AKP won a dramatic victory.



The party delivered liberty and prosperity. The AKP dismantled repressive elements of the “Deep State,” put the military back in its barracks, created a more business‐​friendly environment, moved towards Europe, and pushed social reforms. A female journalist told me that the mildly‐​Islamic AKP paid more attention to problems of domestic violence than had previous nationalist‐​secularist regimes. Author Graham Fuller argued that the AKP’s first decade was “extraordinary” and “may have been the best government Turkey has ever had since it adopted democratic rule in the 1950s.” Turkey grew wealthier and more influential, and the Turkish people rewarded the AKP with a steadily larger proportion of their votes.



However, Erdogan had foreshadowed an uglier future when he declared a couple decades ago: “Democracy, for us, is a train you get off once you reach your destination.” He apparently believed he reached his destination by 2011, when Fuller dates Erdogan’s shift. That year the AKP purged more moderate members. By then several more liberal Turks told me they were becoming increasingly concerned over the government’s direction.



Today Erdogan denounces critics domestic and foreign, using every repressive tool of the state against them. He dallies with Islamist and terrorist forces as he tries to make Turkey into a regional Weltmacht. He waxes paternalistic, discussing what Turks should eat and drink, and how many children they should have. While switching positions he constructed a $615 million presidential palace, four times the size of Versailles. No Sultan lived so opulently.



Turks see that his past accomplishments are fading. Widespread prosperity cemented his rule, but the Turkish economic engine is slowing: growth is down, unemployment is up, consumer confidence has fallen, the current account deficit is the biggest in the OECD, stock values have declined, and the lira has lost some 40 percent of its value compared to the dollar since 2013.



Growth greatly increased opportunities for corruption. Charges of misconduct reached the cabinet and Erdogan, as prosecutors began investigating. After apparent stealth recordings of damning conversations leaked to the public, Erdogan blamed an earlier ally, cleric Fethullah Gulen, and purged police, prosecutors, and judges. The charges were dropped.



Although elections remain free, political rights and civil liberties are only middling. Overall Freedom House rated Turkey as partly free. The organization downgraded Ankara in its latest report because of the government’s “more pronounced political interference in anticorruption mechanisms and judicial processes, and greater tensions between majority Sunni Muslims and minority Alevis.”



The State Department’s human rights assessment includes a list of depressing particulars. For instance, the government interferes with freedom of assembly and expression, uses excessive force in breaking up protests, makes arbitrary arrests, politicizes the judiciary, maintains impunity for security forces despite claims of torture and unlawful killings, and provides inadequate protection for vulnerable populations.



Despite some reforms, noted State, “The penal code and antiterror law retain multiple articles that restrict freedom of expression, the press, and the internet.” After battling against misuse of security laws, including against himself, Erdogan deployed the legislation against military officers and civilians. The government claimed improbably vast conspiracies, most notably the Diyarbakir KCK (Kurdish), Ergenekon (nationalist), and Sledgehammer (military) cases. Roughly 500 people were arrested and 300 charged in the Ergenekon case alone. Although some of the convictions were ultimately overturned, many defendants spent years in jail awaiting trial.



Ergodan has led a particularly virulent campaign of intimidation against journalists, with Turkey for years leading the world in the number of imprisoned journalists. As of last October roughly 150 awaited trial. In its latest media freedom report, Freedom House ranked Turkey as “not free” and 142 out of 199 countries. The group noted that press freedom continued to fall “as the government moved more aggressively to close the space for dissent.” Turkey registered the ninth biggest drop worldwide from 2010 to 2014. Of course, officials denied any impropriety; regime supporters insisted to me that the media was conspiring with the military.



However, the _New Yorker’s_ Dexter Filkins cited “an extraordinary climate of fear among journalists.” Several reporters and columnists with whom I spoke feared criticizing the prime minister; their editors were reluctant to pursue stories against the government. A number of journalists lost their jobs. Affirmed Freedom House: “Government harassment of journalists is also common, leading to self‐​censorship and dismissals.”



The government also applies sustained though often invisible pressure on media organizations, including the threat of public investigations and loss of television licenses. Last month a government prosecutor sought to ban two television stations associated with Fethullah Gulen. Businessmen privately admit that they fear political retaliation. The dearth of coverage of the 2013 protests and disproportionate attention given the supposedly nonpartisan President Erdogan campaigning for the AKP in the recent election demonstrate government tactics at work.



After taming the traditional press the Erdogan government began targeting internet freedoms, with, noted Freedom House, “an overall strategy of demonizing and discrediting social media.” Although half of Turks are online, Freedom House rated Turkey as only partly free. People face significant obstacles to access, limits on content, and restrictions on use. In recent months the government has blocked access to Soundcloud, Twitter, Vimeo, and YouTube as well as thousands of websites, arrested dozens of individuals for comments on social media, prosecuted bloggers and websites for postings, and mandated access to user information through ISPs. Those charged include a former Miss Turkey and 16‐​year‐​old student. Government critics also suffer from organized online attacks, including denial‐​of‐​service assaults on newspapers.



While relaxing unfair restrictions on Muslims—such as the ban on women wearing headscarves—the government has yet to address the lack of legal protection for religious worship and practice by every faith. Indeed, individuals critical of Islam or the Prophet Mohammed face prosecution under the blasphemy statute. Religious minorities remain particularly vulnerable to arbitrary state decisions. For instance, the government continues to interfere with internal operation of the Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches. Ankara has returned a number of confiscated religious properties, but the Greek Orthodox Halki Seminary, remains closed despite government promises to act. Jews can worship freely but, warned the latest report of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, “they remain concerned about rising anti‐​Semitism in society and in the media and occasional derogatory comments by government officials.” One Turkish Jew hoping to emigrate told the _New York Times_ : “last year the level of hate speech in Turkey reached an unnerving level.”



In short, Turkey is headed in a dangerous direction, toward a corrupt, authoritarian state. The country needs an Arab Spring of sorts, but within the democratic process. An electoral revolution, not a street putsch. The use of the rule of law to end an illiberal government. The ballot box must make political power accountable.



On Sunday that process began. One article last week pessimistically warned: “This might be Turkey’s last election.” However, the AKP received less than 41 percent of the vote, down from roughly 50 percent four years ago (and 52 percent in last year’s presidential contest). The ruling party fell 18 seats short of a majority in the 550‐​member Grand National Assembly.



None of the opposition parties is a likely coalition partner. The Republican People’s Party (CHP) upholds the Kemalist vision and is nationalist and social democratic. More extreme is the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), described as “a stone’s throw from fascist” by Aaron Stein of the RUSI think tank. Making a dramatic entrance in fourth place was the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), a liberal‐​left Kurdish‐​based coalition which came together less than three years ago. But these parties also are unlikely to form a countervailing coalition. The AKP could establish a minority ministry and dare its opponents to oust it or trigger early elections.



In any case, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu may not survive, despite claiming victory and calling the AKP the “backbone of Turkey.” Certainly Erdogan’s vision of an enhanced presidency appears dead. Said Selahattin Demitras, head of the HDP: “The discussion of executive presidency and dictatorship has come to an end in Turkey with these elections.” Even half of AKP members oppose the idea. The government no longer can even pass common legislation if the opposition unites. The electoral result also is likely to embolden Erdogan’s opponents. For the first time in more than a decade AKP rule no longer appears to be inevitable.



Indeed, Erdogan may find it hard to control his party. Past prime ministers turned presidents such as Turgut Ozal and Suleyman Demirel lost influence. Some AKP members indicate privately that they do not like being asked to subordinate their beliefs to Erdogan’s ambitions. Moreover, Prime Minister Davutoglu holds the stronger institutional position and may have grown to enjoy making his own decisions. After the president criticized some government actions and policies, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc responded that “we love our president,” but added: “please do not forget that there is a government in this country.” That sparked a call for Arinc’s resignation.



Erdogan remains his party’s most popular figure and might try to oust his critics, but an intra‐​party civil war could wreck the AKP and government. Potential aspirants for power abound, led by Abdullah Gul, a former AKP prime minister, foreign minister, and president with international credibility. Erdogan’s and Gul’s partnership ended badly and the former ostentatiously bypassed Gul in tapping Davutoglu as successor. Other senior AKP officials also have run afoul of Erdogan and might enjoy a little revenge served cold.



Of course, fear of losing power could impel Erdogan to launch a crackdown. Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum warned that the former “will barrel, bulldoze, and steamroll his way ahead, ignoring traditional and legal niceties with or without changes to the constitution.” But doubling down would be risky. Although the military is unlikely to launch a coup, it might also not stand behind the government. The regime doubted the reliability of the police in reassigning some _45,000_ officers, as well as several thousand prosecutors and judges, as suspected Gulen followers. The election demonstrated that Erdogan represents only a plurality of the population. Civil strife could risk his future.



President Erdogan made the democratic transformation of Turkish politics possible. The Turkish people must take full advantage of their opportunities in a new Turkey. Only they can ensure a prosperous and free Turkey.

"AMSTERDAM  —   Pedram Paragomi, a    Iranian medical student, was excited about his first trip to the United States. It had taken him a year to arrange a postdoctoral research post at the University of Pittsburgh. When he sat down in Seat 19E, on a Boeing 777 operated by KLM out of Tehran early Saturday, he felt that he had finally fulfilled his dream. “It’s the excitement you feel when you make a long trip to an unknown destination,” Mr. Paragomi said. It was not to be. Mr. Paragomi and six other Iranians remained stranded at Schiphol Airport outside Amsterdam on Tuesday, as their travel ordeal stretched into its fourth day. They were among thousands of people affected by President Trump’s executive order barring from the United States, for 90 days, travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The largely spontaneous and spirited protests at American airports over the weekend focused on several aspects of Mr. Trump’s order, including a   ban on all refugees, an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and an attempt  —   later blocked by judges  —   to deport people with valid visas or refugee status who had already arrived in the United States. But many travelers were stuck in various states of limbo abroad  —   far from the sightlines of American protesters  —   and their plight has only slowly come to light, in many cases through the efforts of volunteer lawyers who have been working on their cases. A    Syrian man said that he had been blocked from flying from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, to the United States, where he had a research position lined up at a university in North Dakota. He said Mr. Trump’s order would affect his career. In an email to The New York Times, he shared a copy of his United States visa  —   the word CANCELED was written over it  —   but asked that his name not be used because he did not want to jeopardize his residency status in the United Arab Emirates. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a group of Somali refugees remained at an airport on Tuesday. Ethiopian officials ejected a journalist who tried to speak with them, citing unspecified national security concerns. The seven Iranians stuck in Amsterdam were pulled aside on Saturday by United States agents stationed at the airport. They could not leave the airport because they did not have European visas. Mr. Paragomi likened their plight to that of the character played by Tom Hanks in the 2004 film “The Terminal,” about a man stuck at an airport for nearly a year after a coup in his country made it impossible for him to fly back home. Among the Iranians stuck there were Esaghi Abolghasem and his wife, Kobra Alizadeh, who had left Iran on the same flight as Mr. Paragomi. They were heading for Washington to visit their daughter, whom they had not seen in five years. “My heart was filled with joy,” Mr. Abolghasem said. He was stunned when he heard the news that he could not travel to the United States because of Mr. Trump’s order. “I thought I would get a heart attack,” Mr. Abolghasem said. From Amsterdam, Mr. Paragomi, the medical student, called his cousin in California, who was fast asleep. “He didn’t believe it,” Mr. Paragomi recalled. “He thought I had made a mistake with my papers. He said: ‘Such things don’t happen in the United States. Of course you can travel. ’” Nobody knew what to do with the stranded Iranians. After hours of wandering through the immense airport, they met at a transfer point. All had cash, as Iranians generally do not possess international credit cards. “We sat there,” Mr. Abolghasem said. “Nobody did anything. ” After a day they started looking for places to showers, but the two airport hotels were expensive. One man in the group went to pray at the airport’s meditation center, where he met an airport official who introduced the group to a Dutch pastor who offered to help. “It’s a very sad situation,” said the pastor, Nico Sarot. “We should be uniting people. Some are building walls, where we should be tearing them down. I’m trying to help them out with the airlines and with lawyers, and also just to be there to listen to their stories, but there is just not so much we can do. ” Night after night, they slept in the chairs at the airport. “It was cold, we had no blankets,” Mrs. Alizadeh said. “I felt so sad to suddenly be in this situation. ” But there was hope, too. When they saw on the news that across the United States people had started to gather at airports in protest, they told each other to wait. “I was hoping there would be people outside of Amsterdam airport too,” Mr. Paragomi said. “We thought if we stick it out, maybe we can travel to the U. S. as well. ” By the time a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump’s order on Saturday night, other Iranians had already given up and flown back home. But the group of seven decided to stay, hoping to be admitted. “Dutch immigration officers started coming over, asking what our plans were,” Mr. Paragomi recalled. “Airline representatives spoke to us, warning that if we didn’t go back, our tickets would become invalid. ” On Monday they were all taken to a business class lounge to have showers. They were given food, too. Lawyers from the United States got in touch with them by WhatsApp and email to help out. But by Tuesday afternoon, their resistance had started to crumble. A KLM flight heading for Tehran was leaving, and Mr. Paragomi said on Tuesday morning that he did not know what to do. “I worked so hard for this,” he said of his research post in Pittsburgh. “If there is a slight chance I can go and study in the U. S. I will stay. ” Eventually, Mr. Paragomi and four other Iranians took a plane back to Tehran, while two Iranians stayed behind, having received help from an American lawyer based in the Netherlands. As he gathered his belongings for the flight home, Mr. Paragomi asked: “I’m only a student. What did I do wrong?”"

December 17 was a special day in the sun watchers’ circle. On that day a new record, for the greatest number of days without visible sunspots in a single year since the Space Age began, was set.



So far in 2019, the sun has been without sunspots for more than 271 days, including the last 34 days in a row. Since the Space Age began, no other year has had this many blank suns. The sun has been spotless on 18, 19, 20 December as well – so add 3 to those numbers as at the time of writing this post.



The previous record was 268 blank days during 2008. That was during the deepest Space Age Solar Minimum of 2008-2009. Now 2019 has moved into first place.



The Solar Minimum is a normal part of the 11-year sunspot cycle. The past two (2008-2009 and 2018-2019) have been long and deep, making them “century-class” Minima. To find a year with more blank suns, you have to go back to 1913, which had 311 spotless days. Obviously we have run out of days in 2019 to beat that benchmark. If there was not another sunspot in 2019, the count would only be 285 days.



Last week, the NOAA/NASA Solar Cycle Prediction Panel issued a new forecast. Based on a variety of predictive techniques, they believe that the current Solar Minimum will reach its deepest point in April 2020 (+/- 6 months) followed by a new Solar Maximum in July 2025. This means that low sunspot counts and weak solar activity could continue for some time to come.



What does this mean for us? The Earth’s climate gets cooler when there are fewer sunspots. The extreme example happened between 1645 and 1715 when the normal 11-year sunspot cycle vanished. This period, called the Maunder Minimum, was accompanied by bitterly cold winters in the northern hemisphere. Fishing settlements in Iceland and Greenland were abandoned. Icebergs were seen near the English channel. The canals of Venice froze. It was a time of great hardship.



However, the current narrative of limiting CO2 in order to limit temperature rises to less than some arbitrary number above some arbitrary level at some arbitrary time in the past will be harder to maintain if temperatures drop year on year. 



Watching the climate ‘scientists’ attempt to explain temperature anomalies dropping while the measured atmospheric CO2 levels continue to increase will be fun.



Regardless of what happens to the temperature, it will still be ‘Climate Change’ and your evil way of life will be the cause.

"It is very good to see you acknowledge the threats of a growing population, and offer a note of caution regarding the recent Lancet study, whose projections still show 2 billion more people on the planet by 2064 (Editorial, 23 July). The greatest risk attached to such projections is a belief that a reducing population will happen without further intervention, or that it is something to be feared. With more women today having an unmet need for contraception than 20 years ago, and reproductive health services, education and poverty alleviation all threatened by Covid-19, the changes that empower people to choose smaller families are vulnerable as never before. It is necessary to prepare for a world with different demographics than we have today, but we undoubtedly have the resources and ingenuity to meet the challenges of smaller populations. The challenges of increased population and consumption, however, are even more profound, and far more threatening. Those include crashing biodiversity, hunger, poverty and worsening climate change.Alistair CurriePopulation Matters  • The idea that population growth is to blame for our ecological issues is perhaps the biggest myth in the history of environmentalism. As your editorial concedes, Thomas Malthus’s dire predictions never transpired, largely because he ignored the role of technology in increasing resource use efficiency. Malthus also overlooked the fact that there are huge inequalities in resource consumption, and it is these inequalities that are to blame for crises such as famine. The question of inequality is particularly important now because wealthy countries have often used population as a way of blaming developing countries for environmental problems. The authors of a major report from 1991, which has shaped India’s climate change policy since, argued that per-capita emissions were the “only morally defensible” unit of measurement, calling out what they considered to be “environmental colonialism” by Europe and North America. Global Justice Now rightly describes the overpopulation debate as fuelled by eugenics and racism. Actually, resource consumption and environmental transformation are accelerating much more rapidly than population growth. Population is now the least important driver of environmental degradation, overtaken by disproportionately high consumption patterns in developed economies. Overpopulation arguments let high-consuming economies in the global north off the hook, with the average Briton passing the average annual per-capita carbon emissions of a number of African countries within the first two weeks of 2020.Joe Williams Department of geography, Durham University, Caitlin Robinson Department of geography and planning, University of Liverpool • When Thomas Malthus described how exponential population growth must lead to premature death, he did not know that scientific knowledge and development would lead to a world demographic transition. We now know poor nations have high birth and death rates. Death rates come down with improved health and hygiene, and women’s education. Once people realise their children will survive to become adults and be able to support them in old age, they have fewer children. As birth rates come down to match lower death rates population stops growing and can even go into reverse as is likely in Japan. The key to it all lies in equality. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett showed in their book The Spirit Level that equality is better for everyone. Our small planet needs big solutions such as massive international aid from developed nations and through the United Nations to end inequality and speed up the essential development of poorer nations.Martin PaskYork • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"**Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has ordered a military offensive, after an army base was taken over by forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray.**
Mr Abiy accused the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), of launching the attack.
The attack resulted in ""many martyrs, injuries and property damage"", he said in a TV address.
The cabinet has declared a state of emergency in the region for six months.
The national authorities have also shut down electricity, telephone and internet services in Tigray.
Tensions between the government and TPLF, which used to be part of the governing coalition before falling out with Mr Abiy, have escalated in recent months, with both sides accusing the other of plotting to use military force.
On Tuesday, the federal parliament proposed that the TPLF be designated as a ""terrorist organisation.""
Mr Abiy said that attackers ""tried to loot"" military assets during Wednesday morning's attack, adding that ""the last red line had been crossed"" forcing the federal government into a military confrontation.
Mr Abiy's office also accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
""The national defence force that has been in the bunkers for the past 20 plus years defending its people and the country by paying heavy sacrifices with its blood and flesh, has been attacked, this evening in Mekelle and many other places, by traitors and the force they organised,"" Mr Abiy said in a TV address.
""The army has been attacked from behind by its own citizens and many have been martyred, wounded and properties destroyed,"" he added.
Details of the attack could not be immediately verified.
The BBC has spoken to eyewitnesses who have confirmed that the Northern Command Headquarters in Tigray's regional capital, Mekelle, is under the control of regional forces.
BBC Tigrinya's Girmay Gebru reports that sounds of gunfire could be heard early on Wednesday morning but calm has since returned.
People were walking around the city but passenger vehicles are not operating because local authorities have imposed restrictions on movement and they have also closed the airspace, our reporter adds.
Banks and the only local office of state-owned Ethio Telecom - the country's only mobile phone company - have been closed. The national carrier Ethiopian Airlines has also stopped flights to the region.
It's unclear how the federal government will implement the state of emergency it has declared because regional leaders are in charge, our reporter says, adding that Tigray forces have been deployed to the border it shares with Amhara region.
A local official has claimed that federal forces deployed to the region had defected but this has not been confirmed.
Last week Tigray leaders blocked a general appointed by Mr Abiy from assuming a new posting, saying he no longer had the authority to make such moves.
""We will never be the first to shoot nor the first to blink,"" Getachew Reda, a senior member of the TPLF, told AFP last week.
On Tuesday night, hours before Mr Abiy's announcement, Wondimu Asamnew, another senior Tigrayan official, told AFP the federal government was amassing troops on the southern border of Tigray - a claim that could not be independently verified.
""I think when it comes to military mobilisation, it's not child's play. It can trigger all-out war... what they are doing is playing with fire... a small spark can ignite the whole region. So I think we are on the alert and I can assure you we are capable of defending ourselves,"" Mr Wondimu said.
**By Desta Gebremedhin, BBC Tigrinya**
The threat of an armed conflict between the federal government and the authorities in Tigray has been brewing for some time, so the current escalation has not come as a surprise to many Ethiopians.
Mr Abiy seems to have lost patience with the Tigray leaders who he sees as undermining his authority since he took office in 2018. Critics, however, accuse the prime minister of excluding TPLF officials in his reformist plans - some say his purge of the region's leaders has contributed to the current crisis.
His close relationship with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, considered a foe in Tigray, has also contributed to the bad blood.
Mr Abiy has said the mission of the federal troops in Tigray is ""to save the country and region from instability"".
His challenge is that Tigray, like other regions in Ethiopia, has its own well-trained and armed special police forces and militia, so any potential conflict could be costly for both sides.
The fear is that any escalation in Tigray could spill over to the rest of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries.
The Tigray region's president, Debrestion Gebremichael, told reporters on Monday that the government was going to attack - alleging it was punishment for organising its own election for the Tigray parliament in September, in direct defiance of the federal government and electoral board's decision to postpone all elections following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government has described the vote as ""illegal"". The national electoral board has since said the general election should go ahead in May or June of next year.
The TPLF held most of Ethiopia's political power from 1991 to 2018, when Mr Abiy came to office following nationwide protests by ethnic Oromos. Since then, their power has waned.
Mr Abiy, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for restoring relations with Ethiopia's long-time foe Eritrea, is facing increasing criticism from a number of sides, with ethnic clashes in several parts of the country and accusations that he has reversed some of the political reforms he introduced, with opposition leaders once more being locked up."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor a planet that is supposedly seeing one record hot year after another, it sure strange is that there’s so much cold gripping vast areas of Asia.
Chart right: East Asia is forecast to remain extremely frigid over the foreseeable future.
Snowless winters, which according to climate scientists were supposed to become a thing of the past at middle latitudes, are now failing to materialize even down in the tropics in places like Thailand!
Switzerland’s online news site NZZ here reports that a cold wave has swept across Thailand and claimed 14 cold-related deaths.
First snow in 115 years!
The same NZZ reports here that Okinawa saw its second only snowfall since historical measurements began. The Swiss news site writes that on the Japanese island of Amamioshima “snow fell for the first time in 115 years“.
Dozens die of cold in Taiwan
Russian news site RT wrote that dozens have died of cold in Taiwan since Saturday as a result of “a rare cold snap sweeping through East Asia“. The RT reports:

Taiwan’s Central News Agency reports fatalities may have already reached 85. The majority of those deaths were reported in the capital Taipei, as well as New Taipei city and Taoyuan in northern Taiwan. For some, it was their first time seeing snow in person, and many flocked to the mountains to view the spectacle in all its glory.”
The problem, the RT writes, is that most homes in Taiwan don’t have central heating because it normally has a subtropical climate. The NZZ reported that the 4°C reading measured on Sunday had been “the lowest in 44 years“.
Lowest ever temperatures in China
Also the Daily Star here adds:
In South Korea, more than 500 domestic and international flights have been cancelled in Jeju as the island, known for balmy weather and beaches, saw -6C weather. The airport was due to reopen last night.”
The NZZ also writes that in China 24 weather stations recorded the lowest ever temperatures.
Also the following chart shows that southeast Asia is forecast to remain brutally cold over the next 7 days. Source here.

"In a world with so many problems, it’s easy to feel helpless. And particularly right now in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, quite alone. But even as we practice social distancing, we have an opportunity to work together to solve the greatest problem that humanity faces. No, I’m not talking about coronavirus. I’m talking about climate change. As a climate scientist, I’m often asked what people can do about climate change, a problem so pervasive and impactful that literally all the rest of humanity’s problems play out upon its landscape. But there is no one specific answer, no magic bullet. Everyone has something different to contribute. And that’s the challenge. We must each find what we’re passionate about, capable of and good at. And we must all find our voice. For some, that means organizing and attending local protests to put pressure on politicians, or participating in clean-up efforts that require nothing more than some gloves and trash bags. For others, it means supporting environmental organizations. It can mean working with businesses to reduce pollution or researching new technologies. Artists, celebrities and opinion leaders can use their platforms to educate, motivate and elevate others to join the cause. And we can change our lifestyle to lower our individual carbon footprint – eating less meat or going electric. Our efforts as individuals are important. But alone they cannot solve this problem. We need collective action and systemic change. We need policies to incentive the decarbonization of our society. That requires politicians willing to support climate-friendly policies. And the only way we get them is by voting. Voting is a moment of activism that can have a years-long impact. Just look at the Trump administration. Slim minorities in a handful of states by just over a quarter of eligible voters resulted in a president, Donald Trump, who threatens our entire planet. Trump stocked his administration with polluters and lobbyists who took the regulatory reins off their pals in the oil and gas industry. His administration has slowly but steadily dismantled a half century of environmental progress. In the space of a few years Trump has erased America’s leadership and moral standing. His threat to withdraw from the Paris agreement (which he can’t actually make good on if he loses the upcoming election), has provided an excuse for other major emitters such as China to ease off in their own decarbonization efforts. The result has been a surge of fossil fuel pollution that will remain in the global atmosphere for thousands of years, impacting everyone on Earth. Yet there is reason for cautious optimism that we can still right this ship. Because no sooner than Trump was elected were others organizing to mitigate the damage he has done. For example, in response to his decision that he would pull the US out of the Paris agreement, climate action became a priority from the ground up. A coalition quickly formed between mayors and governors both red and blue, CEOs, university presidents and faith leaders of all types to tell the world that they remained dedicated to the climate fight. Since then, they’ve demonstrated exactly how powerful we can be when we work together for a common goal. This coalition represents nearly 70% of US GDP and over half of our emissions and alone is on track to cut US emissions by 25% by 2030. If cities, states, businesses and all other non-federal institutions made maximum effort to curtail their emissions the US could reach a nearly 40% reduction by 2030. Well, you can look for local organizations that may need help. You can join, or donate to, any number of worthy local or national charities that speak to the combination of what you love to do and what you want to protect. And you can vote. On climate. From president to police commissioner. Your vote will reverberate for years, as the efforts that have grown in the dark shade of the Trump administration are poised to bloom with a President Joe Biden, a climate-friendly Congress and state and local politicians who favor climate action. Strong majorities of voters want action on climate to be part of recovery efforts that grow our economy. Across the country, youth activists have lit a beacon of moral clarity that demands action in response to science. In Congress, House Democrats just released their report on the climate crisis, and are ready to turn it into action, while the Biden campaign has just released a robust new climate platform that, if enacted, would put us on solid footing to win the climate fight. Though it may not be perfect, it’s the strongest climate call ever put forward by a Democratic party nominee for president, and will quite literally mean a world of difference compared to the Trump agenda. Within two decades we could decarbonize our power sector and create 25m clean energy jobs. Through a wartime-scale mobilization to rid our economy of carbon, we can address the unemployment crisis we currently face and put our country on the path to generate good, durable and clean jobs. It’s a classic win-win scenario. Despite the environmental hostility of the current Washington power brokers, local leaders have laid the groundwork for success. All we need now is for the federal government to do its job, and serve as a powerful centralized force to protect us. And all that takes is a vote. In November. Michael E Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University. He is author of the upcoming book The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet, due out in January (Public Affairs Books)"
"**Business is booming for America's tech giants.**
Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google reported sales and profits figures on Thursday covering the three months to 30 September - and there was a common thread: growth shows no sign of slowing.
The cardboard boxes and delivery trucks were an early sign - and now we've got more proof: Amazon continues to be one of the biggest winners from the pandemic.
Sales at the internet giant shot to $96.1bn in the three months to 30 September - up 37% from the same period in 2019. And profits hit a record $6.3bn, nearly three times last year's total.
The rise was driven by its e-commerce business in North America, as families increasingly turned to online shopping. But the company's advertising and cloud computing business also saw significant gains.
The growth has not come without cost. Amazon said it had $2.5bn in Covid-related expenses and its reputation has also taken a hit, with protests against the firm's working conditions and other policies.
Facebook, owner of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported a whopping 2.5 billion daily users on average in September across its platforms. That's up 15% from September a year ago - but only a 3% rise from June, when people stuck-at-home turned to social media, generating a flood of activity.
The company warned that the number of Facebook users even declined in the US and Canada - its most profitable market - and told investors they expected the trend to continue.
Twitter reported a similar story, claiming 187 million daily active users in the July-September quarter, up just 1 million from the prior period.
Amid the shutdowns earlier this year, many businesses cut advertising spending. The move led sales to slow at Facebook and pushed Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to its first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue since becoming a publicly-listed company in 2004.
But spending from those businesses has returned.
At Google, revenue was up 14% year-on-year - far better than analysts had expected. The rise helped profits jump an eye-popping 59% year-on-year to more than $11bn, sending the firm's shares up more than 6% in after-hours trading.
Twitter also saw revenue rise 14%, while at Facebook it jumped 22% and the firm said it expected that growth to accelerate.
Apple sales hit $64.7bn, up slightly from a year ago - handily beating most analyst expectations, as sales of laptops and iPads surged.
But shares in the firm sank in after-hours trading anyway, as investors digested a more than 20% drop in iPhone revenue.
The hit was especially evident in Apple's Greater China region - where it typically generates about 20% of its sales and sales dropped almost 30%.
Apple expressed confidence that buyers were simply holding out for its latest phone, which went on sale later than in prior years.
""Despite the ongoing impacts of Covid-19, Apple is in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever, and the early response to all our new products, led by our first 5G-enabled iPhone line-up, has been tremendously positive,"" chief executive Tim Cook said.
As is typical, discussions from the companies focused on sales and profits - and not the controversies swirling around them as calls for tougher regulation gain traction in the US and elsewhere.
In its prepared comments, Facebook stood out with its brief nod to the issue, warning of ""headwindsâ¦ from the evolving regulatory landscape"".
But the companies' financial success will only make them more of a target for complaints, warned Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight.
""Tech dominance will continue to raise eyebrows given the antitrust concerns,"" he said. ""There will be further calls from rivals to regulate tech companies."""

The White Island volcano did what any volcano might do naturally, but the fact people were on it having a tourist experience when it happened was a terrible tragedy. 



The aftermath, however, is the MSM reviving the likes of Pike River, the Christchurch Earthquake, and the Christchurch terror attack whilst using the tragedy to [promote by stealth, ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/politics-by-stealth/)the conversion of yet another European geographical name into a Maori one. 



It needs to stop. I even saw some numpty attributing the explosion to the fraud that is “climate change” by saying this is what you get if you deny climate change.



Immediately the media and the politicians exclaimed that New Zealanders wanted full information, full transparency from the Police and the full statistics for the disaster-addicted. The Police and rescuers were questioned and bullied while still trying to do their jobs. ‘Call outs’ were heard, saying that the communications systems to the public were simply not good enough; what do they want, live-streaming? I say, no, thank you very much.



Those on White Island at the time were there for a tourist experience knowing full well they were going to be standing on an active volcano as they all had signed a disclaimer! 



Certainly, I was risk-aware when last year we climbed Vesuvius in Italy and looked into the gassing volcanic depths, being fully aware that an eruption might occur. [Of course, it is expected that some of the White Island tourists will now say that they didn’t know](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7776183/Australian-cruise-passenger-says-tourists-werent-warned-increased-activity-White-Island.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) there was a risk. 



Most of the New Zealand media and the wider commentariat are now, of course, instant armchair experts, opining that



White Island is the second volcanic eruption this year in which tourists were killed. An explosion from Stromboli in Italy killed a tourist last July. 



A few years ago, over 40 died when an unexpected explosion caught hikers unaware at Mount Ontake in Japan, and at least six hikers were killed at Mayon in the Philippines during a volcanic blast.



The media and the far-left, however, will not let any of these facts get in the way of a good story. 



‘White Island’ will be spun to make the entire tragedy far more controversial than it is, in part as propaganda promoting the far-left wing dark agenda of control which includes the denigration of European civilisation. 



Attempting to force the silent majority of New Zealand to become hooked on disaster and tragedy is clearly not the way to go. The media hopefully won’t take the hint, particularly after the [USA](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/donald-trump-owning-the-art-of-the-impossible/), [Australian](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/morrison-delivers-early-christmas-gifts-to-aussie-voters/) and[ UK elections ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/boriss-moment/)where the silent majority voted against the Marxism of the left, the elitist media, academics and champagne-socialist elitist propaganda. 



There is hope in New Zealand, that individuals will exercise some common sense and wake up to the scams, instead of worrying about volcanoes, earthquakes and weather that are beyond the control of mankind. We should be concentrating on dodgy politicians and be wary of our undemocratic MMP system where voter majority doesn’t matter.

"**Wednesday promises to be another stressful day for Facebook, Google and Twitter.**
Their chief executives will be grilled by senators about whether social media companies abuse their power.
For Republicans, this is the opportunity they've been waiting for.
Two weeks ago, Twitter prevented people posting links to a critical New York Post investigation into Joe Biden.
It then apologised for failing to explain its reasoning before ditching a rule it had used to justify the action.
For many Republicans, this was the final straw - incontrovertible evidence that social media is biased against conservatives.
The accusation is that Silicon Valley is at its core liberal and a bad arbiter of what's acceptable on its platforms.
In this case, Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz believed Twitter would have acted differently if the story had been about President Donald Trump.
When conservatives claim bias, they are usually referring to what they see as unfair moderation.
It's the idea that their posts are overly-censored and/or suppressed.
But it's difficult to definitively prove social media is biased.
For one, the likes of Facebook and Twitter can be secretive - they don't share all of their data or reveal exactly how their algorithms work.
Is social media really biased against Republicans?
Is social media really biased against Republicans?
Is social media really biased against Republicans?
As a result, when Republicans cry foul, it is often ""accusation by anecdote"". A single example that proves a larger trend.
For instance, they note that Twitter ""hid"" a tweet by President Trump saying ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" during the protests in Minneapolis. But it didn't hide a tweet from Iranian ayatollahs calling for armed resistance in Israel.
This - according to many on the right - proves Twitter's double standards.
Such examples were repeatedly given during a congressional hearing in July where the bosses of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon were cross-examined.
""I'm just going to cut to the chase"", said Republican congressman Jim Jordan. ""Big Tech is out to get conservatives.""
This was something the CEOs denied.
But what is certainly true is that several have recently taken a much more hands-on approach to moderation.
In doing so, they are grappling with the kinds of issues that newspaper editors face every day: what should should and should not be published?
A survey from Pew Research Center in August indicated that 90% of Republicans believed social media sites censored political viewpoints. Some 59% of Democrats held the same view.
So do they have a point?
One of the Republican criticisms of social media is that its algorithms push down conservative content. But that isn't borne out by the data for Facebook.
Data from CrowdTangle, a public insights tool owned by Facebook, puts together the most popular posts for each day on Facebook. On any given day the top 10 most popular political posts are dominated by right-leaning commentators like Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro, along with posts by Fox News and President Trump.
Mr Trump's Facebook page has 32 million followers, nearly 10 times more than his Democratic challenger in next month's election, Joe Biden.
If the accusation is Facebook suppresses right-wing content, it doesn't seem to do it very well.
So is right-wing content in fact being favoured over left-wing content?
It's quite not as simple as that.
""I think it's a mistake to look at it as a right-wing versus left-wing bias,"" says Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.
""The bias is toward content that generates strong emotions.""
He says that while ""some pretty extreme right-wing"" posts have spread widely on social media in the US, their popularity isn't proof of the platforms suffering from structural bias.
""In Mexico, you might see a completely different arrangement of what gets promoted,"" he adds.
But, if you look at what is clamped down on, you can see why more people from the right might get tangled up in moderation than those from the left.
For example, few Democrats claim postal voting is rigged.
President Trump and many Republicans do.
Facebook has a policy to label claims about voter fraud. It argues it is trying to tackle disinformation that could erode faith in the US electoral system.
Even so, Republicans are disproportionately affected.
Let's take another issue - Black Lives Matter.
Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has openly stated he supports the movement. The Black Lives Matter Facebook page has just over 740,000 followers.
However, another Facebook page called Blue Lives Matter has close to 2.3 million followers. It aims to support police officers and push back against an ""anti-cop"" narrative.
The group has been criticised for appropriating the BLM name - and been accused of racism, something the group's founder Christopher Berg denies.
Mr Berg believes that Facebook is biased against conservative voices. Can that possibly be true considering the page's popularity?
""I wouldn't be looking at the follower count and the reach. I would be looking at things behind the scenes, that individuals can affectâ¦ things like demonetising a page,"" he tells me.
This is when Facebook judges a page has violated its rules and prevents it earning money from ads and subscriptions.
Mr Berg believes this is a a less perceptible type of bias, and one right-wing pages are more susceptible to.
But his suspicion is hard to prove. Facebook doesn't publish a list of pages it has taken action on.
Twitter is a very different beast to Facebook.
Only a small minority of its users regularly post content of their own.
And a Pew study last week found that 70% of highly prolific US adult tweeters were Democrats.
This makes Twitter appear to be a more liberal place, but once again it's hard to prove it's biased against conservatives.
Let's take Covid-19 as an example.
It's true that Twitter has acted on Mr Trump's tweets more than Mr Biden's. For example, it blocked a Trump post suggesting that the flu was more dangerous than Covid.
But at the same time, studies suggest Mr Trump is far more likely to spread disinformation around Covid.
In fact, one from Cornell University suggested the president was the largest single driver of Covid disinformation.
So it's perhaps not surprising that he is targeted disproportionately by Twitter moderators.
This is exactly why social media companies would rather not have to moderate their platforms. As soon as you begin deciding what can and can't be published, you start making political calls.
In fact, some Republicans treat any kind of moderation as an attack on free speech.
An executive order signed by President Trump in March said: ""We cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet.""
In other words, the decision to arbitrate can be seen as philosophically anti-conservative.
Mr Trump has also said he will remove Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
This prevents social media companies from being liable for the things that people post. It would potentially hammer the social media industry.
And as Big Tech takes a more interventionist approach - whether it's against QAnon, hate speech or any other banned activity - accusations of bias will follow.
And just as those claims of bias are difficult to prove, so too are they very hard to disprove.
This is now where social media companies find themselves.
They of course deny that they act in a biased way.
Most Americans don't believe them."
"**Facebook has explicitly banned Holocaust denial for the first time.**
The social network said its new policy prohibits ""any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust"".
Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wrote that he had ""struggled with the tension"" between free speech and banning such posts, but that ""this is the right balance"".
Two years ago, Mr Zuckerberg said that such posts should not automatically be taken down for ""getting it wrong"".
""I'm Jewish and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened,"" he told Recode at the time.
""I find it deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong.""
His remarks led to a large public backlash.
But on Monday, as Facebook changed its policies, he wrote that he had changed his mind.
""My own thinking has evolved as I've seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech,"" he wrote in a public Facebook post.
""Drawing the right lines between what is and isn't acceptable speech isn't straightforward, but with the current state of the world, I believe this is the right balance.""
Earlier this year, Facebook banned hate speech involving harmful stereotypes, including anti-Semitic content. But Holocaust denial had not been banned.
Facebook's vice-president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said the company had made the decision alongside ""the well-documented rise in anti-Semitism globally and the alarming level of ignorance about the Holocaust, especially among young people"".
She said that later this year, searching for the Holocaust - or its denial - on Facebook would direct users to ""credible"" information.
But she also warned change would not happen overnight, and training its employees and automated systems would take time.
The World Jewish Congress - which had conferred with Facebook on anti-Semitism - welcomed the move.
""Denying the Holocaust, trivializing it, minimizing it, is a tool used to spread hatred and false conspiracies about Jews and other minorities,"" the group said in a statement.
But it also noted that it had campaigned for the removal of Holocaust denial content from the platform ""for several years"".
Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted: ""This has been years in the making.""
""Having personally engaged with Facebook on the issue, I can attest the ban on Holocaust Denial is a big deal... glad it finally happened.""
This was a bit of a ""wait, they don't do this already?"" moment.
Perhaps that's because Facebook has quite radically shifted its position on removing hate speech and fake news in recent months.
We're still seeing loopholes from an old moderating regime being closed.
Critics, though, argue this isn't happening fast enough.
The combined platforms of Facebook and Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - have an extraordinary reach of billions of users worldwide.
That influence has to be used responsibly, and Facebook acknowledges this.
The advertising boycott in July also helped cement the view internally that more had to be done to tackle hate speech.
Mark Zuckerberg's instincts have always been to champion freedom of speech - the best way to fight bad speech is good speech he's always said.
But this latest move appears to indicate Facebook now accepts it needs to be more proactive in combating hate speech."
"Amid warnings from Washington that the US will be watching very closely, the interim deal agreed late last year to scale-back Iran’s nuclear programme has come into force, a positive development in a slow-burning crisis that has built up dangerous levels of heat in the past few years.  Carved out in negotiations between Iran and the permanent UN Security Council members, the US, Britain, Russia, China and France, plus Germany, this freeze or strategic stalemate is clearly preferable to military action led by the US or Israel. That would inevitably only herald yet more major instability in the Middle East. But this agreement is no panacea. It addresses only part of the problem – Iran’s programme of enriching uranium to weapons-grade level – and only for a limited time of six months. So the real challenge is to turn this temporary freeze into a long-term concrete deal. Assuming, of course, that both sides keep to the spirit of the arrangement. The heart of the deal reached in November is that Iran, in return for a temporary lifting of the economic sanctions that have devastated its economy, has agreed to three things. It will stop building uranium enrichment centrifuges and plutonium re-processing facilities – the two materials necessary to build a nuclear bomb. It will cap uranium enrichment – bringing it down to well below weapons-grade levels, around 95%-pure uranium-235, but high enough (around 3-4% uranium-235) to be used in civilian power reactors. And it will allow extensive oversight and regular inspection by IAEA monitors of its IR-40 nuclear reactor and heavy water plant at Arak, and other declared facilities. This is a watershed moment. The Iranian right to enrich uranium, a necessary step in producing the fissile material required for civilian reactors and nuclear weapons, has been at the centre of the dispute for nearly a decade. If Iran can’t enrich uranium to high levels of purity or separate large amounts of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel then it cannot build a nuclear warhead. Throughout the last decade, Iran has consistently claimed its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes, that is, for generating power and medical isotopes, as is their right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The international community, represented by the five permanent members of the UNSC and Germany (the P5+1), has always argued that Iran uses the civilian exclusions of the NPT as cover for a nuclear weapons programme. Given the vast oil and gas reserves Iran enjoys, this is a fair point. Complicating matters further are the previous revelations of secret facilities, evidence that Iran has worked secretly to develop nuclear warhead technology and that the Iranian leadership has continually mislead and frustrated IAEA weapons inspectors. So it’s entirely possible that there could be further undeclared nuclear or weaponisation facilities in Iran that will continue working despite this agreement. Essentially, the problem is that any state with an advanced military force, particularly in respect of its ability to deploy ballistic missiles, and sufficient technological sophistication to enrich uranium can theoretically build a nuclear weapon. In fact the standoff with Iran is an example of a enduring trend in nuclear proliferation, where states can all but acquire the capability to build a nuclear bomb, without technically breaking international law. This, known as nuclear latency, may well be what the Iranian leadership seeks, rather than building a bomb outright.  The problem is that international law makes it possible for states to move very close to weaponisation before they actually contravene the NPT or other international laws. India, North Korea, Pakistan, and South Africa initially developed nuclear weapons under a civilian guise. Israel, while it still neither confirms nor denies possessing nuclear weapons, did the same. And many other states such as Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and Taiwan used the same rouse before abandoning their nuclear ambitions. Others, notably Japan, currently have the ability and know-how to quickly build a nuclear bomb should they decide to, because of their advanced civilian nuclear industry. So really, Iran is in many ways merely the latest manifestation of a predicament that has dogged nuclear non-proliferation since the 1960s. As a result the Geneva deal, while praiseworthy, is only a first step in finding a lasting resolution with Iran. The temporary freeze on enrichment does not involve giving up fissile material stockpiles, nor surrendering centrifuges or facilities. At best the deal opens the door to a peaceful resolution to a potential conflict that neither the West nor Iran wants. At worst it merely postpones difficult decisions. It’s possible that the Iranian leadership, difficult to read at the best of times, may not have come to a decision on the nuclear programme. As such, any move to prevent full weaponisation must be vigorously pursued. But recent history is littered with states – most recently North Korea – that have taken advantage of similar diplomatic thaws to carry on regardless."
"It seems every year has seen weather extremes in recent times. After 2012 brought Hurricane Sandy to the east coast of the United States and the wettest year ever for England, many may have expected a quieter time, but unusual weather continued to make news across the world in 2013. I have selected five significant events. Inevitably, many stories have been missed out – in particular heatwaves (Australia had a very warm year) and floods in Canada and the US.  But whether it’s blizzards in March or floods in June, the weather events that really stick with us are the ones that seem too unusual for the location or time of year. On 11 March a wintry area of low pressure moving into northern France pushed fronts over the Channel Islands and coastal counties in southeast England, bringing in cold air from northern Europe.   Snow led to blizzard conditions on Guernsey that were said to have been the worst for at least 16 years with level snow depths of at least 16 cm; there was even an air frost on the Isles of Scilly – a very rare event at any time of the year. Approximately 47,000 homes lost power in Normandy due to snowfall; in North Cotentin 25cm of snow lay by mid-afternoon on the 11th with wind gusts up to 100 km/h on the coast. In Belgium, the snowstorms caused 1,600 km of traffic jams; high-speed Eurostar and Thalys trains were also suspended. Extreme rains in the Alpine region and in Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland caused the most intense and extended flooding in the Danube and Elbe river catchments since at least 1950. More than 400 mm of rain in places during 29 May−3 June. Passau in southeast Germany had its highest river water level since 1501. At least 20 people died as a result of the floods. May had been a wet month in central Europe with rainfall more than twice the average for the month, leading to almost saturated soils. An area of low pressure brought large amounts of moisture from the south across the Alps, where it met very cold air from the north at upper levels in the atmosphere. The heavy rainfall was in part triggered as air was forced to rise over the Alps. Total damage was, by mid-July, said to have exceeded $16 billion. The Southwest Asian monsoon season brought the worst flooding and devastation in the past half century to regions near the India-Nepal border.  The monsoon arrived 15 days early in Uttarakhand, with a cloudburst and very heavy rain during 14−18 June. Northwest India received nearly double its average June rainfall with the monthly total at Lakshmi Ashram of 523.8 mm being 344% of average. The flooding occurred during the peak tourist and pilgrimage season with hundreds of thousands of visitors being stranded as bridges and roads were washed away. At least 6,000 people died. The deluge caused the melting of the Chorabari Glacier and many rivers burst their banks. Warnings by the India Meteorological Department predicting heavy rains were not given wide publicity beforehand. Typhoon Haiyan (known as Yolanda in the Philippines) was an exceptionally powerful tropical cyclone that devastated parts of the Philippines (in particular) in early November. The known death toll by the end of November was more than 6,000 although more than 10,000 were estimated to have died in Tacloban City alone; it was reportedly the strongest-ever storm at the time of landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar, on the 7th at 2005 UTC. Haiyan was identified initially as a storm on 2 November and rapid intensification to typhoon status followed by 5 November. Around 1200 UTC on 7 November Haiyan attained its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h and a central surface pressure of 895 millibars. Six hours later gusts up to 378 km/h were declared. Such was the scale of the damage that a major international call for relief was initiated. On 5 December a major depression moved eastwards from northwest Scotland to southern Sweden (central pressure 962 millibars at 2400 UTC) – and further eastwards the next day. As a surface wind from the north to northwest became established later in the day, a massive tidal surge affected coastal areas around the North Sea. Earlier, winds gusting up to 142 mph battered Scotland. Coastal areas of the North Sea are particularly prone to storm surges because water flowing into the shallower southern end cannot escape quickly through the Dover Strait. Winds blowing from the north increase this funnelling effect, raising the coastal water levels. In the UK thousands of people had to evacuate their homes along the east coast, where the coastal surge was the worst since 1953 with local flooding and some houses being washed into the sea as cliffs gave way. At least six people died by the time the winds moved finally down over northeast Europe. Almost inevitably, it is the unusual, extreme and tragic events that remain longer in our memories. Every year brings different weather events and these are impossible to predict months in advance."
"Laughter saved Linda Ragoo’s face. That is what a doctor told her after she had a stroke in 2003. It happened on a Sunday, at the end of an exhausting weekend of chores, errands and obligations. Ms. Ragoo felt part of her body go numb. “I sat down by the bed and I felt my leg, like it was sleeping,” Ms. Ragoo recalled. “It’s sleeping too long. ” She was able to call one of her sisters, who rushed to Ms. Ragoo’s Brooklyn apartment and found her on the floor, unable to move, the left side of her body paralyzed. While they waited for an ambulance, Ms. Ragoo asked to use the bathroom. Her sister fetched a long stick, presumably to prod her across the floor. Ms. Ragoo cracked up at the absurdity of the moment. “My sister said, ‘Stop this nonsense, stop this nonsense,’” she said. “And I keep laughing. ” She spent the next month in a hospital. Ms. Ragoo’s mobility is still restricted by partial paralysis. But her facial muscles, built up by years of laughter, are as they have always been. Ms. Ragoo, 78, credits her jocular spirit and easygoing sense of humor in part to her upbringing in Trinidad, with its tropical weather,   way of life, and holiday and carnival celebrations. In the 1970s, Ms. Ragoo went to New York in search of an even better life. She settled in Brooklyn and found work as a nurse’s aide. Though hardships and tragedy have marked her life, “I can make a joke out of nothing,” she said. Just recently, she dozed off in her recliner and somehow managed to slide off it, flopping to the floor. For her, it was a rude, yet hilarious, awakening. “I laugh at my own self when I do stupid things,” she said. “I laugh at myself many times. ” Levity not only carried Ms. Ragoo through the setbacks after her stroke, but it also helped her cope with a more painful loss. Her son Satinus, 58, had a heart attack and died in 2014. He was a nurse’s aide, like his mother. “I’m telling you, things can’t put you down,” Ms. Ragoo said of staying positive through trying times. She lives alone in a   apartment in Crown Heights, which is how she likes it. There is plenty of space just for her. And she does not need much of it to flourish. When it was time to get a new mattress, she willingly downgraded from a queen to a full. As much as she relishes independence, health problems drove her to seek outside help. Ms. Ragoo has arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and osteoporosis, as well as mobility issues caused by the stroke. Ms. Ragoo sought help from Heights and Hills, which offers support services for older adults, and has a home attendant. Each month, Ms. Ragoo receives $811 from Social Security and $612 from a pension. Because of her tight income, Ms. Ragoo could not afford an   last summer. Usually a fan had been sufficient to keep her cool, but not last year. “When that heat took me, I couldn’t stand it,” she said. She mentioned her concerns to her social worker and made clear the severity of the problem. “I told her, ‘This is not funny. ’” Ms. Ragoo said. Her caseworker reached out to FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and applied for a $600 grant in Neediest funds, which allowed Ms. Ragoo to buy an  . Ms. Ragoo fondly recalls more youthful pleasures, like traveling, especially cruises, and taking trips to the casino. Ms. Ragoo has not done either in some time. But it is hard to keep her from a dance floor pulsating with salsa or calypso. Her coordination and energy are not what they once were, but she still has rhythm. “I dance with my cane,” she said. “I hold my cane and I move from side to side. Because they say if you don’t use it, you lose it. ” But she is quick to joke with people about her age. On a recent December afternoon, Ms. Ragoo declared she was just 16, despite the cane clutched to her side and dark glasses shielding her eyes after cataract surgery. “It’s the best therapy, to laugh,” she said. “You have to keep on laughing. ”"
"

At the risk of sounding like a broken record (well, OK–at the risk of _continuing_ to sound like a broken record), I'd like to say a bit more about economists' tendency to get their monetary history wrong. In particular, I'd like to take aim at common myths about the gold standard.   
  
If there's one monetary history topic that tends to get handled especially sloppily by monetary economists, not to mention other sorts, this is it. Sure, the gold standard was hardly perfect, and gold bugs themselves sometimes make silly claims about their favorite former monetary standard. But these things don't excuse the errors many economists commit in their eagerness to find fault with that ""barbarous relic.""   
  
The false claims I have in mind are mostly ones I and others–notably Larry White–have countered before. Still I thought it would be useful to address them again here, because they're still far from being dead horses, and also so that students wrapping-up the semester will have something convenient to send to their misinformed gold-bashing profs (though I urge them to wait until grades are in before sharing!).   
  
For the sake of those who don't care to wade through the whole post, here is a ""jump to"" list of the points covered:   






As Larry White has made the essential point as well as I ever could, I hope I may be excused for quoting him at length:   




Barry Eichengreen writes that countries using gold as money 'fix its price in domestic-currency terms (in the U.S. case, in dollars).' He finds this perplexing:



But the idea that government should legislate the price of a particular commodity, be it gold, milk or gasoline, sits uneasily with conservative Republicanism’s commitment to letting market forces work, much less with Tea Party–esque libertarianism. Surely a believer in the free market would argue that if there is an increase in the demand for gold, whatever the reason, then the price should be allowed to rise, giving the gold-mining industry an incentive to produce more, eventually bringing that price back down. Thus, the notion that the U.S. government should peg the price, as in gold standards past, is curious at the least.



To describe a gold standard as ""fixing"" gold’s ""price"" in terms of a distinct good, domestic currency, is to get off on the wrong foot. A gold standard means that a standard mass of gold (so many grams or ounces of pure or standard-alloy gold) _defines_ the domestic currency unit. The currency unit (“dollar”) is nothing other than a unit of gold, not a separate good with a potentially fluctuating market price against gold. That one dollar, defined as so many grams of gold, continues be worth the specified amount of gold—or in other words that one unit of gold continues to be worth one unit of gold—does not involve the pegging of any relative price. Domestic currency notes (and checking account balances) are _denominated_ in and redeemable for gold, not _priced_ in gold. They don’t have a _price_ in gold any more than checking account balances in our current system, denominated in fiat dollars, have a price in fiat dollars. Presumably Eichengreen does not find it curious or objectionable that his bank maintains a fixed dollar-for-dollar redemption rate, cash for checking balances, at his ATM.



Remarkably, as White goes on to show, the rest of Eichengreen's statement proves that, besides not having understood the meaning of gold's ""fixed"" dollar price, Eichengreen has an uncertain grasp of the rudimentary economics of gold production:   




As to what a believer in the free market would argue, surely Eichengreen understands that if there is an increase in the demand for gold under a gold standard, whatever the reason, then the _relative_ price of gold (the purchasing power per unit of gold over other goods and services) _will_ in fact rise, that this rise will in fact give the gold-mining industry an incentive to produce more, and that the increase in gold output will in fact eventually bring the relative price back down.



I've said more than once that, the more vehement an economist's criticisms of the gold standard, the more likely he or she knows little about it. Of course Eichengreen knows far more about the gold standard than most economists, and is far from being its harshest critic, so he'd undoubtedly be an outlier in the simple regression, y = α + β(x) (where y is vehemence of criticism of the gold standard and x is ignorance of the subject). Nevertheless, his statement shows that even the understanding of one of the gold standard's most well-known critics leaves much to be desired.   
  
Although, at bottom, the gold standard isn't a matter of government ""fixing"" gold's price in terms of paper money, it is true that governments' creation of monopoly banks of issue, and the consequent tendency for such monopolies to be treated as government- or quasi-government authorities, ultimately led to their being granted sovereign immunity from the legal consequences to which ordinary, private intermediaries are usually subject when they dishonor their promises. Because a modern central bank can renege on its promises with impunity, a gold standard administered by such a bank more closely resembles a price-fixing scheme than one administered by a commercial bank. Still, economists should be careful to distinguish the special features of a traditional gold standard from those of central-bank administered fixed exchange rate schemes.   
  
  




Back in the early 1950s, and again in 1960, Milton Friedman estimated that the gold required for the U.S. to have a ""real"" gold standard would have cost 2.5% of its annual GNP. But that's because Friedman's idea of a ""real"" gold standard was one in which gold coins alone served as money, with no fractionally-backed bank-supplied substitutes. As Larry White shows in his _Theory of Monetary Institutions_ (p. 47) allowing for 2% specie reserves–which is more than what some former gold-based free-banking systems needed–the resource cost of a gold standard taking advantage of fractionally-backed banknotes and deposits would be about _one-fiftieth_ of the number Friedman came up with. That's a helluva bargain for a gold ""seal of approval"" that could mean having access to international capital at substantially reduced rates, according to research by Mike Bordo and Hugh Rockoff.   
  
Friedman himself eventually changed his mind about the economies to be achieved by employing fiat money:   




Monetary economists have generally treated irredeemable paper money as involving negligible real resource costs compared with a commodity currency. To judge from recent experience, that view is clearly false as a result of the decline in long-term price predictability.



I took it for granted that the real resource cost of producing irredeemable paper money was negligible, consisting only of the cost of paper and printing. Experience under a universal irredeemable paper money standard makes it crystal clear that such an assumption, while it may be correct with respect to the direct cost to the government of issuing fiat outside money, is false for society as a whole and is likely to remain so unless and until a monetary structure emerges under an irredeemable paper standard that provides a high degree of long-run price level predictability.*



Unfortunately, neither White's criticism of Friedman's early calculations nor Friedman's own about-face have kept gold standard critics from repeating the old canard that a fiat standard is more economical than a gold standard. Ross Starr, for example, observes in his 2013 book on money  that ""The use of paper or fiduciary money instead of commodity money is resource saving, allowing commodity inventories to be liquidated."" Although he understands that fractionally-backed banknotes and deposits may go some way toward economizing on commodity-money reserves, Starr (quoting Adam Smith, but failing to look up historic Scottish bank reserve ratios) insists nonetheless that ""a significant quantity of the commodity backing must be maintained in inventory to successfully back the currency,"" and then proceeds to build a case for fiat money from this unwarranted assertion:



The next step in economizing on the capital tied up in backing the currency is to use a fiat money. Substituting a government decree for commodity backing frees up a significant fraction of the economy's capital stock for productive use. No longer must the economy hold gold, silver, or other commodities in inventory to back the currency. No longer must additional labor and capital be used to extract them from the earth. Those resources are freed up and a simple virtually costless government decree is substituted for them.



Tempting as it is to respond to such hooey simply by noting that the vaults of the world's official fiat-money managing institutions presently contain rather more than zero ounces of gold–31,957.5 metric _tons_ more, to be precise–that response only hints at the fundamental flaw in Starr's reasoning, which is his treatment of fiat money as a culmination, or limiting case, of the resource savings to be had by resort to fractional commodity-money reserves. That treatment overlooks a crucial difference between fiat money and readily redeemable banknotes and deposits, for whereas redeemable banknotes and deposits are generally understood by their users to be close, if not perfect, substitutes for commodity money, fiat money, the purchasing power of which is unhinged from that of any former money commodity, is nothing of the sort. On the contrary: its tendency to depreciate relative to real commodities, and to gold in particular, is notorious. Consequently holders of fiat money have reason to hold ""commodity inventories"" as a hedge against the risk that fiat money will depreciate.   
  
If the hedge demand for a former money commodity is large enough, resort to fiat money doesn't save any resources at all. Indeed, as Roger Garrison notes, ""a paper standard administered by an irresponsible monetary authority may drive the monetary value of gold so high that more resource costs are incurred under the paper standard than would have been incurred under a gold standard."" A glance at the history of gold's real price suffices to show that this is precisely what has happened:

From ""After the Gold Rush,"" _The Economist_ , July 6, 2010.   
  
  
  
Taking the long-run average price of gold, in 2010 prices, to be somewhere around $470, prior to the closing of the gold window in 1917, that price was exceeded on only three occasions, and never dramatically: around the time of the California gold rush, around the turn of the 20th century, and for several years following FDR's devaluation of the dollar. Since 1971, in contrast, it has exceeded that average, and exceeded it substantially, more often than not. Here is Roger Garrison again:   




There is a certain asymmetry in the cost comparison that turns the resource-cost argument against paper standards. When an irresponsible monetary authority begins to overissue paper money, market participants begin to hoard gold, which stimulates the gold-mining industry and drives up the resource costs. But when new discoveries of gold are made, market participants do not begin to hoard paper or to set up printing presses for the issue of unbacked currency. Gold is a good substitute for an officially instituted paper money, but paper is not a good substitute for an officially recognized metallic money. Because of this asymmetry, the resource costs incurred by the State in its efforts to impose a paper standard on the economy and manage the supply of paper money could be avoided if the State would simply recognize gold as money. These costs, then, can be counted against the paper standard.



So if it's avoidance of gold resource costs that's desired, including avoidance of the very real environmental consequences of gold mining, a gold standard looks like the right way to go.   
  
  




Of the many misinformed criticisms of the gold standard, none seems to me more wrong-headed than the complaint that the gold standard isn't even a reliable guarantee against serious inflation. The _RationalWiki_ entry on the gold standard is as good an example of this as any:   




Even gold can suffer problems with inflation.Gold rushes such as the California Gold Rush expanded the money supply and, when not matched with a simultaneous increase in economic output, caused inflation.The ""Price Revolution"" of the 16th century demonstrates a case of dramatic long-run inflation. During this period, western European nations used a bimetallic standard (gold and silver). The Price Revolution was the result of a huge influx of silver from central European mines starting during the late 15th century combined with a flood of new bullion from the Spanish treasure fleets and the demographic shift brought about by the Black Plague (i.e., depopulation).



Admittedly the anonymous authors of this article may not be professional economists; but take my word for it that the same arguments might be heard from any number of such professionals. Brad DeLong, for example, in a list of ""Talking Points on the _Likely_ Consequences of re-establishment of the Gold Standard"" (my emphasis), includes observation that ""significant advances in gold mining technology could provide a significant boost to the average rate of inflation over decades.""   
  
Like I said, the gold standard is hardly free of defects. But being vulnerable to bouts of serious inflation isn't one of them. Consider the ""dramatic"" 16th century inflation referred to in the _RationalWiki_ entry. Had that entries' authors referred to plain-old _Wikipedia_ 's entry on ""Price revolution,"" they would have read there that   




Prices rose on average roughly sixfold over 150 years. This level of inflation amounts to 1-1.5% per year, a relatively low inflation rate for the 20th century standards, but rather high given the monetary policy in place in the 16th century.



I have no idea what the authors mean by their second statement, as there was certainly no such thing as ""monetary policy"" at the time, and they offer no further explanation or citation. So far as I can tell, they mean nothing more than that prices hadn't been rising as fast before the price revolution than they did during it, which though trivially true says nothing about how ""high"" the inflation was by any standards, including those of the 16th century. In any case it was not only ""not high"" but dangerously _low_ according to standards set, rightly or wrongly, by today's monetary experts. Finally, though the point is often overlooked, the European Price Revolution actually began well in advance of major American specie shipments, which means that, far from being attributable to such shipments alone, it was a result of several causes, including coin debasements.   
  
What about the California Gold rush, which is also supposed to show how changes in the supply of gold will lead to inflation ""when not matched with a simultaneous increase in economic output""? To judge from available statistics, it appears that producers of other goods were almost a match for all those indefatigable forty-niners:  as Larry White reports, although the U.S. GDP deflator did rise a bit in the years following the gold rush,   




The magnitude was surprisingly small. Even over the most inflationary interval, the [GDP deflator] rose from 5.71 in 1849 (year 2000 = 100) to 6.42 in 1857, an increase of 12.4 percent spread over eight years. The compound annual price inflation rate over those eight years was slightly less than 1.5 percent.



Once again, the inflation rate was such as would have had today's central banks rushing to expand their balance sheets.   
  
Nor do the CPI estimates tell a different story. See if you can spot the gold-rush-induced inflation in this chart:   
  
  


![U.S. CPI](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/download-remote-images/www.alt-m.org/212978993417/U.SCPI3_-1024x575.jpg?itok=9iTd3O6t)



*Graphing Various Historical Economic Series,"" MeasuringWorth, 2015.   
  
Despite popular beliefs, the California gold rush was actually not the biggest 19th-century gold supply innovation, at least to judge from its bearing on the course of prices. That honor belongs instead to the Witwatersrand gold rush of 1886, the effects of which later combined with those of the Klondike rush of 1896 to end a long interval of gradual deflation (discussed further below) and begin one of gradual inflation.   
  
Brad DeLong is thus quite right to refer to the South African discoveries in observing that even a gold standard poses some risk of inflation:   




For example, the discovery and exploitation of large gold reserves near present-day Johannesburg at the end of the nineteenth century was responsible for a four percentage point per year shift in the worldwide rate of inflation–from a deflation of roughly two percent per year before 1896 to an inflation of roughly two percent per year after 1896.



Allowing for the general inaccuracy of 19th-century CPI estimates, DeLong's statistics are correct. But that ""For example"" is quite misleading. Like I said: this is the most serious instance of an inflationary gold ""supply shock"" of which I'm aware. Yet even it served mainly to put an end to a deflationary trend, without ever giving rise to an inflation rate substantially above what central banks today consider (rightly or wrongly) optimal. As for the four percentage point change in the rate of inflation ""per year,"" presumably meaning ""in one year,"" it's hardly remarkable: changes as big or larger are common throughout the 19th century, partly owing to the notoriously limited data on which CPI estimates for that era are based. Even so, they can't be compared to the much larger jumps in inflation with which the history of fiat monies is riddled, even setting hyperinflations aside. Keep this in mind as you reflect upon Brad's conclusion that   




Under the gold standard, the average rate of inflation or deflation over decades ceases to be under the control of the government or the central bank, and becomes the result of the balance between growing world production and the pace of gold mining.



Alas, keeping matters in perspective–that is, comparing the gold standard's _actual_ inflation record, not to that which might be achieved by means of an ideally-managed fiat money, but to the _actual_ inflation record of historic fiat-money systems, is something many critics of the gold standard seem reluctant to do, perhaps for good reason.   
  
While we're on the subject, nothing could be more absurd than attempts to demonstrate the unsuitability of gold as a monetary medium by referring to gold's unstable real value in the years _since the gold standard was abandoned_. Yet this is a favorite debating point among the gold standard's less thoughtful critics, including Paul Krugman:   




There is a remarkably widespread view that at least gold has had stable purchasing power. But nothing could be further from the truth. Here’s the real price of gold — the price deflated by the consumer price index — since 1968:



Compare Professor Krugman's chart to the one in the previous section. Then ask yourself (1) Has gold's price behaved differently since 1968 than it did before?; and (2) Why might this be so? If your answers are ""Yes"" and ""Because gold and paper dollars are no longer close substitutes, and gold is now widely used to hedge against depreciation of the dollar and other fiat currencies,"" you understand the gold standard better than Krugman does. But don't get a swelled head over it, because it really isn't saying much: Krugman is one of the observations that sits squarely on the upper right end of y = α + β(x).   
  
  




The complaint that a gold standard doesn't rule out inflation is but a footnote to the more frequent complaint that it suffers, in Brad DeLong's words, from ""a deflationary bias which makes it likely that a gold standard regime will see a higher average unemployment rate than an alternative managed regime."" According to Ben Bernanke ""There is…a high correlation in the data between deflation (falling prices) and depression (falling output).""   
  
That the gold standard tended to be deflationary–or that it tended to be so for sometimes long intervals between gold discoveries–can't be denied. But what certainly _can_ be denied is that these periods of slow deflation went hand-in-hand with high unemployment. Having thoroughly reviewed the empirical record, Andrew Atkeson and Patrick Kehoe conclude as follows:   




Deflation and depression do seem to have been linked during the1930s. But in the rest of the data for 17 countries and more than 100 years, there is virtually no evidence of such a link.



More recently Claudio Borio and several of his BIS colleagues reported similar findings. How then (you may wonder), did Bernanke arrive at his opposite conclusion? Easy: he looked only at data for the 1930s–the worst deflationary crisis ever–ignoring all the rest.   
  
Why is deflation sometimes depressing, and sometimes not? The simple answer is that there is more than one sort of deflation. There's the sort that's caused by a collapse of spending, like the ""Great Contraction"" of the 1930s, and then there's the sort that's driven by greater output of real goods and services–that is, by outward shifts in aggregate supply rather than inward shifts in aggregate demand. Most of the deflation that occurred during the classical gold standard era (1873-1914) was of the latter, ""good"" sort.   
  
Although I've been banging the drum for good deflation since the 1990s, and Mike Bordo and others have made the specific point that the gold standard mostly involved inflation of the good rather than bad sort, too many economists, and way too many of those who have got more than their fare share of the public's attention, continue to ignore the very possibility of supply-driven deflation.   
  
Of the many misunderstandings propagated by economists' tendency to assume that deflation and depression must go hand-in-hand, none has been more pernicious than the widespread belief that throughout the U.S. and Europe, the entire period from 1873 to 1896 constituted one ""Great"" or ""Long Depression ."" That belief is now largely discredited, except perhaps among some newspaper pundits and die-hard Marxists, thanks to the efforts of G.B. Saul and others. The myth of a somewhat shorter ""Long Depression,"" lasting from 1873-1879, persists, however, though economic historians have begun chipping away at that one as well.   
  
  




Speaking of 1873, after claiming that a gold standard is undesirable because it makes deflation (and therefore, according to his reasoning, depression) more likely, Krugman observes:   




The gold bugs will no doubt reply that under a gold standard big bubbles couldn’t happen, and therefore there wouldn’t be major financial crises. And it’s true: under the gold standard America had no major financial panics other than in 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, 1907, 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933. Oh, wait.



Let me see if I understand this. If financial crises happen under base-money regime X, then that regime must be the cause of the crises, and is therefore best avoided. So if crises happen under a _fiat_ money regime, I guess we'd better stay away from fiat money. Oh, wait.   
  
You get the point: while the nature of an economy's monetary standard may have some bearing on the frequency of its financial crises, it hardly follows that that frequency depends mainly on its monetary standard rather than on other factors, like the structure, industrial and regulatory, of the financial system.   
  
That U.S. financial crises during the gold standard era had more to do with U.S. financial regulations than with the workings of the gold standard itself is recognized by all competent financial historians. The lack of branch banking made U.S. banks uniquely vulnerable to shocks, while Civil-War rules linked the supply of banknotes to the extent of the Federal government's indebtedness., instead of allowing that supply to adjust with seasonal and cyclical needs. But there's no need to delve into the precise ways in which such misguided legal restrictions to the umerous crises to which Krugman refers.  It should suffice to point out that Canada, which employed the very same gold dollar, depended heavily on exports to the U.S., and (owing to its much smaller size) was far less diversified, endured no banking crises at all, and very few bank failures, between 1870 and 1939.   
  
  




Since Keynes's reference to gold as a ""barbarous relic"" is so often quoted by the gold standard's critics, it seems only fair to repeat what Keynes had to say, a few years before, not about gold _per se_ , itself, but about the gold-standard era:   




What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August, 1914! The greater part of the population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of comfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this lot. But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages… He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighboring office of a bank or such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But, most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.



It would, of course, be foolish to suggest that the gold standard was entirely or even largely responsible for this Arcadia, such as it was. But it certainly did contribute both to the general abundance of goods of all sorts, to the ease with which goods and capital flowed from nation to nation, and, especially, to the sense of a state of affairs that was ""normal, certain, and permanent.""   
  
The gold standard achieved these things mainly by securing a degree of price-level and exchange rate stability and predictability that has never been matched since. According to Finn Kydland and Mark Wynne:   




The contrast between the price stability that prevailed in most countries under the gold standard and the instability under fiat standards is striking. This reflects the fact that under commodity standards (such as the gold standard), increases in the price level (which were frequently associated with wars) tended to be reversed, resulting in a price level that was stable over long periods. No such tendency is apparent under the fiat standards that most countries have followed since the breakdown of the gold standard between World War I and World War II.



The high degree of price level predictability, together with the system of fixed exchange rates that was incidental to the gold standard's widespread adoption, substantially reduced the riskiness of both production and international trade, while the commitment to maintain the standard resulted, as I noted, in considerably lower international borrowing costs.   
  
Those pundits who find it easy to say ""good riddance"" to the gold standard, in either its classical or its decadent variants, need to ask themselves what all the fuss over monetary ""reconstruction"" was about, following each of the world wars, if not achieving a simulacrum at least of the stability that the classical gold standard achieved. True, those efforts all failed. But that hardly means that the ends sought weren't very worthwhile ones, or that those who sought them were ""lulled by the myth of a golden age."" Though they may have entertained wrong beliefs concerning how the old system worked, they weren't wrong in believing that it _did_ work, somehow.   
  
  




But how? The once common view that the classical gold standard worked well only thanks to its having been carefully managed by the Bank of England and other central banks, as well as the related view that its success depended on international agreements and other forms of central bank cooperation, is now, thankfully, no longer subscribed to even by the gold-standard's more well-informed critics. Instead, as Julio Gallarotti observes, the outcomes of that standard ""were primarily the resultants [sic] of private transactions in the markets for goods and money"" rather than of any sort of government or central-bank management or intervention. But the now accepted view doesn't quite go far enough. In fact, central banks played no essential part at all in achieving the gold standard's most desirable outcomes, which could have been achieved as well, or better, by systems of competing banks-of-issue, and which were in fact achieved by means of such systems in many participating nations, including the United States, Switzerland (until 1901), and Canada. And although it is common for central banking advocates to portray such banks as sources of emergency liquidity to private banks, during the classical gold standard era liquidity assistance often flowed the other way, and did so notwithstanding monopoly privileges that gave central banks so many advantages over their commercial counterparts. As Gallarotti observes (p. 81),   




That central banks sometimes went to other central banks instead of the private market suggests nothing more than the fact that the rates offered by central banks were better, or too great an amount of liquidity may have been needed to be covered in the private market.



  




To the extent that central banks did exercise any special influence on gold-standard era monetary adjustments, that influence, instead of helping, made things worse. Because an expanding central bank isn't subject to the internal constraint of reserve losses stemming from adverse interbank clearings, it can create an external imbalance that must eventually trigger a disruptive drain of specie reserves. During liquidity crunches, on the other hand, central banks were more likely than commercial banks to become, in Jacob Viner's words, ""engaged in competitive increases of their discount rates and in raid's on each other's reserves."" Finally, central banks could and did muck-up the gold standard works by sterilizing gold inflows and outflows, violating the ""rules of the gold standard game"" that called for loosening in response to gold receipts and tightening in response to gold losses.   
  
Competing banks of issue could be expected to play by these ""rules,"" because doing so was consistent with profit maximization. The semi-public status of central banks, on the other hand, confronted them with a sort of dual mandate, in which profits had to be weighed against other, ""public"" responsibilities (ibid., pp. 117ff.). Of the latter, the most pernicious was the perceived obligation to occasionally set aside the requirements for preserving international monetary equilibrium (""external balance"") for the sake of preserving or achieving preferred domestic monetary conditions (""internal balance""). As Barry Ickes observes, playing by the gold standards rules could be ""very unpopular, potentially, as it involves sacrificing internal balance for external balance."" Commercial bankers couldn't care less. Central bankers, on the other hand, had to care when to not care was to risk losing some of their privileges.   
  
Today, of course, achieving internal balance is generally considered the _sine qua non_ of sound central bank practice; and even where fixed or at least stable exchange rates are considered desirable it is taken for granted that external balance ought occasionally to be sacrificed for the sake of preserving domestic monetary stability. But to apply such thinking to the classical gold standard, and thereby conclude that in that context a similar sacrifice of external for internal stability represented a turn toward more enlightened monetary policy, is to badly misunderstand the nature of that arrangement, which was not just a fixed exchange rate arrangement but something more akin to an multinational monetary union or currency area. Within such an area, the fact that one central bank gains reserves while another looses them was itself no more significant, and no more a justification for violating the ""rules of the game,"" than the fact that a commercial bank somewhere gained reserves at the expense of another.   
  
The presence of central banks did, however, tend to aggravate the disturbing effects of changes in international trade patterns compared to the case of international free banking. Central-bank sterilization of gold flows could, on the other hand, lead to more severe longer-run adjustments, as it was to do, to a far more dramatic extent, in the interwar period.   
  
  




I know I'm about to skate onto thin ice, so let me be more precise. To say that ""The gold standard caused the Great Depression "" (or words to that effect, like ""the gold standard was itself the principal threat to financial stability and economic prosperity between the wars”), is at best extremely misleading. The more accurate claim is that the Great Depression was triggered by the collapse of the jury-rigged version of the gold standard cobbled together after World War I, which was really a hodge-podge of genuine, gold-exchange, and gold-bullion versions of the gold standard, the last two of which were supposed to ""economize"" on gold. Call it ""gold standard light.""   
  
Admittedly there is one sense in which the _real_ gold standard can be said to have contributed to the disastrous shenanigans of the 1920s, and hence to the depression that followed. It contributed by failing to survive the outbreak of World War I. The prewar gold standard thus played the part of Humpty Dumpty to the King's and Queen's men who were to piece the still-more-fragile postwar arrangement together. Yet even this is being a bit unfair to gold, for the fragility of the gold standard on the eve of World War I was itself largely due to the fact that, in most of the belligerent nations, it had come to be administered by central banks that were all-too easily dragooned by their sponsoring governments into serving as instruments of wartime inflationary finance.   
  
Kydland and Wynne offer the case of the Bank of Sweden as illustrating the practical impossibility of preserving a gold standard in the face of a major shock:   




During the period in which Sweden adhered to the gold standard (1873–1914), the Swedish constitution guaranteed the convertibility into gold of banknotes issued by the Bank of Sweden. Furthermore, laws pertaining to the gold standard could only be changed by two identical decisions of the Swedish Parliament, with an election in between. Nevertheless, when World War I broke out, the Bank of Sweden unilaterally decided to make its notes inconvertible. The constitutionality of this step was never challenged, thus ending the gold standard era in Sweden.



The episode seems rather less surprising, however, when one considers that ""the Bank of Sweden,"" which secured a monopoly of Swedish paper currency in 1901, is more accurately known as the Sveriges Riksbank, or ""Bank of the Swedish Parliament.""   
  
If the world crisis of the 1930s was triggered by the failure, not of the classical gold standard, but of a hybrid arrangement, can it not be said that the U.S. , which was among the few nations that retained a full-fledged gold standard, was fated by that decision to suffer a particularly severe downturn? According to Brad DeLong,   




Commitment to the gold standard prevented Federal Reserve action to expand the money supply in 1930 and 1931–and forced President Hoover into destructive attempts at budget-balancing in order to avoid a gold standard-generated run on the dollar.



It's true that Hoover tried to balance the Federal budget, and that his attempt to do so had all sorts of unfortunate consequences. But the gold standard, far from forcing his hand, had little to do with it. Hoover simply subscribed to the prevailing orthodoxy favoring a balanced budget. So, for that matter, did FDR, until events forced him too change his tune: during the 1932 presidential campaign the New-Dealer-to-be assailed his opponent both for running a deficit and for his government's excessive spending.   
  
As for the gold standard's having prevented the Fed from expanding the money supply (or, more precisely, from expanding the monetary base to keep the broader money supply from shrinking), nothing could be further from the truth. Dick Timberlake sets the record straight:   




By August 1931, Fed gold had reached $3.5 billion (from $3.1 billion in 1929), an amount that was 81 percent of outstanding Fed monetary obligations and more than double the reserves required by the Federal Reserve Act. Even in March 1933 at the nadir of the monetary contraction, Federal Reserve Banks had more than $1 billion of excess gold reserves.



Moreover,   




Whether Fed Banks had excess gold reserves or not, all of the Fed Banks’ gold holdings were expendable in a crisis. The Federal Reserve Board had statutory authority to suspend all gold reserve requirements for Fed Banks for an indefinite period.



Nor, according to a statistical study by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Christina Romer, did the Fed have reason to fear that by allowing its reserves to decline it would have raised fears of a devaluation. On the contrary: by taking steps to avoid a monetary contraction, the Fed would have helped to allay fears of a devaluation, while, in Timberlake's words, initiating a ""spending dynamic"" that would have helped to restore ""all the monetary vitals both in the United States and the rest of the world.""   
  
  




Just as ""paper"" always beats ""rock"" in the rock-paper-scissors game, so does managed paper money always beat gold in the rock-paper monetary standards game economists like to play. But that's only because under a fiat standard _any_ pattern of money supply adjustment is possible, including a ""perfect"" pattern, where ""perfect"" means perfect according to the player's own understanding. Even under the best of circumstances a gold standard is, on the other hand, unlikely to achieve any economist's ideal of monetary perfection. Hence, paper beats rock. More precisely, paper beats rock, _on paper_.   
  
And what does this impeccable logic tell us concerning the relative merits of gold versus paper money in practice? Diddly-squat. I mean it. To say something about the relative merits of paper and gold, you have to have theories–good ol' fashioned, rational optimizing firm and agent theories–of how the supply of basic money adjusts under various conditions in the two sorts of monetary regimes. We have a pretty good theory of the gold standard, meaning one that meshes well with how that standard actually worked. The theory of fiat money is, in contrast, a joke, in part because it's much harder to pin-down central bankers' objectives (or any objectives apart from profit-maximization, which is at play in the case of gold), but mostly thanks to economists' tendency to simply assume that central bankers behave like omniscient angels who, among other things, understand the finer points of DSGE models. That may do for a graduate class, or a paper in the _AER_. But good economics it most certainly isn't.   




***



I close with a few words concerning why it matters that we get the facts straight about the gold standard. It isn't simply a matter of winning people over to that standard. Though I'm perhaps as ready as anyone to shed a tear for the old gold standard, I doubt that we can ever again create anything like it. But getting a proper grip on gold serves, not just to make the gold standard seem less unattractive than it is often portrayed to be, but to remove some of the sheen that has been applied to modern fiat-money arrangements using the same brush by which gold has been blackened. The point, in other words, isn't to make a pitch for gold. It's to make a pitch for something –anything– that's better than our present, lousy money.

"**Big corporate rivalries - Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Boeing and Airbus, McDonald's and Burger King - tend to have one thing in common: competition for the same business.**
That's why Facebook and Apple's feud is so intriguing.
They're both big technology companies, and that's where the similarities end.
Almost all of Facebook's revenue is from advertising but it provides only a small fraction of Apple's, which comes mostly from devices and its App Store.
The two companies don't really compete with each other - they just don't like each other.
For years, Apple's Tim Cook has said Facebook treats its users as a product - to make money from advertising - and plays fast and loose with their privacy.
Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, says Apple's products are expensive and it has ulterior motives for criticising Facebook.
Last year, according to the New York Times, Apple even cut off Facebook's developer tools.
The latest chapter in the feud, last week, has made relations even worse.
Earlier this year, Apple announced it would introduce a feature called App Tracking Transparency, to give people more control over their data.
Crucially, customers would have to opt in for their data - previously handed over by default - to be used by apps such as Facebook's.
That is a massive problem for Facebook, which sells targeted adverts to make eye-watering profits. It says openly that this will damage its business.
Apple has postponed the proposed changes until next year, to give developers time to prepare.
In a letter outlining why the change was delayed last week, Apple's Jane Hovarth couldn't resist a pop at Zuckerberg: ""Facebook executives have made it clear their intent is to collect as much data as possible.
""This disregard for user privacy continues to expand.""
Facebook hit back, saying: ""They are using their dominant market position to self-preference their own data collection, while making it nearly impossible for their competitors to use the same data.
""They claim it's about privacy - but it's about profit.""
That is like rubbing salt into an open wound for Apple, which takes genuine pride in its belief it has a loftier business model than Facebook.
As far back as 2010, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs reportedly warned Facebook about privacy.
And in 2018, Mr Cook, Apple's current boss, said he could have followed Facebook by using data to sell ads but ""we elected not to do that"".
Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor and author of Zucked, a critical book about Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg, is no fan of Facebook either.
""Apple's culture is one of empowering its customers,"" he says, ""Facebook's culture is exploiting its users.
""Historically, Apple has had plenty of reasons to criticise other people and has chosen not to do so.
""I think that's a tribute to how offensive they find Facebook's behaviour.""
Does Facebook have a point, though? Is Apple in fact trying use its market dominance to freeze out competitors?
Although Apple's advertising business is comparatively small, Morgan Stanley predicts its revenue from advertising will grow sharply in the next few years.
So does it want to stop Facebook harvesting user data just to cash in itself?
That would be an intellectually strange thing to do.
One of the most common US TV ads this autumn is an Apple privacy campaign.
A series of people blurt out embarrassing things they have looked up on the internet to random strangers.
The tagline is: ""Some things shouldn't be shared - iPhone helps you keep it that way.""
So Apple clearly believes privacy is popular - it would be odd to undermine that.
Apple has, however, been described by all sides of the political spectrum as monopolistic.
It is currently involved in a series of legal actions, after accusations it abuses its dominant App Store to impose unfair terms on developers.
And then there are accusations it doesn't pay its fair share of tax, something the company denies.
The privacy-v-purity argument certainly rankles with Mr Zuckerberg.
In 2014, when Mr Cook first publicly criticised Facebook for treating its customers as a product, the Facebook chief executive hit back, telling Time magazine: ""A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers.
""What, you think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them?
""If you were in alignment with them, then they'd make their products a lot cheaper.""
And perhaps he has a point - Apple is one of the wealthiest companies in the world.
The even stranger part of this mutual contempt is the two companies' co-dependence.
The iPhone would be far less appealing to many customers if Facebook (along with WhatsApp and Instagram) wasn't available.
Conversely, would people look for other social media platforms if they couldn't use Facebook on an iPhone?
It makes sense for both companies to have a healthy, strong working relationship.
And yet, they don't.
Apple expert Carolina Milanesi is one of many who believes the two companies just see the world in a different way and the animosity between them is cultural and personal.
""Philosophically, they're just so different,"" she says.
""When you're looking at Apple, if they feel so strongly about how Facebook is behaving against their customers, then why do we have Facebook as an app on Apple devices?""
And that gets to the nub of the issue.
Until now, this has been two companies not getting along.
But it's been a phoney war - their relationship has actually been symbiotic.
What Apple is now proposing, however, is far from phoney.
Make no mistake about it - its obsession with privacy is not good for Facebook.
Its new rules will hurt the social network.
Of all the likely rivalries in big tech, Facebook v Apple seems, on the face of it, the least likely.
Google is Facebook's obvious competitor; Microsoft and Google are Apple's.
But the issue of privacy has stoked a fire between Facebook and Apple that won't go out.
And it's likely 2021 will see that rivalry rage still further."
"**A report backed by Democratic lawmakers has urged changes that could lead to the break-up of some of America's biggest tech companies.**
The recommendation follows a 16-month congressional investigation into Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.
""These firms have too much power, and that power must be reined in,"" Democratic lawmakers working on the probe wrote.
But Republicans involved in the effort did not agree with the recommendations.
In a statement, one Republican congressman Jim Jordan dismissed the report as ""partisan"" and said it advanced ""radical proposals that would refashion antitrust law in the vision of the far left.""
Others have said they support many of the report's conclusions about the firms' anti-competitive tactics but that remedies proposed by Democrats go too far.
""Antitrust enforcement in Big Tech markets is not a partisan issue,"" said Republican Ken Buck. ""But an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cureâI would rather see targeted antitrust enforcement over onerous and burdensome regulation that kills industry innovation.""
US tech companies have faced increased scrutiny in Washington over their size and power in recent years. The investigation by the House Judiciary Committee is just one of multiple probes firms such as Facebook and Apple are facing.
The 449-page report, penned by committee staff, accused the companies of charging high fees, forcing smaller customers into unfavourable contracts and of using ""killer acquisitions"" to hobble rivals.
""To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,"" it said.
It said the findings should prompt politicians to consider a series of changes.
Those included stronger enforcement of existing competition law, as well as changes to limit the areas in which a firm may do business or prevent companies from operating as players in areas where they are the dominant provider of infrastructure - as Amazon does, for example, when it acts as both a seller and marketplace for other merchants.
This report is blockbuster.
It carries heft too - it's stacked with evidence collected over 16 months.
But the key thing here is these are Democrat suggestions.
This is not a bi-partisan set of recommendations.
In fact, from what we've already heard from Republicans many of the recommendations are ""non-starters"" for conservatives.
It's also been reported that some Republicans were angered by omissions in the report.
Republicans wanted sections on alleged anti-conservative bias - which was apparently blocked by Democrats.
There are, however, Republicans who want to find common ground on antitrust.
For example, Republican Ken Buck has indicated he'd support some of the recommendations. For example, shifting the anti-competition burden of proof for acquisitions - making it more difficult to buy up the competition.
In truth though, we're unlikely to see any concrete legislative proposals until after the election.
But what's now crystal clear is both Biden and Trump - in their own different ways - offer existential challenges to the power of Big Tech.

In testimony before the committee in July, the bosses of tech firms defended their actions.
On Tuesday, Amazon hit back at what it described as ""fringe notions of anti-trust"" law, as competition law is known in the US.
""The fact that third parties having the opportunity to sell right alongside a retailer's products is the very competition that most benefits consumers and has made the marketplace model so successful for third-party sellers"", the company said in a blog post.
Divisions in Washington between Republicans and Democrats make the prospects of significant action against the firms unlikely, tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said.
""The lack of consensus and divergence among both sides of the aisle on the antitrust issues remains a major issue to move things forward,"" he said.
While that could change if Democrats gain more power in the upcoming US election, he said, ""Despite the report/content and framework for recommendations around Big Tech players (e.g. M&A, business practices) without core law changes we believe this antitrust momentum hits a brick wall.""
In response, Facebook said in a statement: ""Instagram and WhatsApp have reached new heights of success because Facebook has invested billions in those businesses.
""A strongly competitive landscape existed at the time of both acquisitions and exists today. Regulators thoroughly reviewed each deal and rightly did not see any reason to stop them at the time."""
"**Google, Facebook and Microsoft should be paying more corporation tax in developing nations, says ActionAid.**
The aid charity estimates that poorer countries are missing out on up to $2.8bn (Â£2.2bn) in tax revenue that could be used to tackle the pandemic.
ActionAid is calling for big companies to pay a global minimum rate of tax.
Facebook and Microsoft declined to comment while Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Multinational corporations are currently not required by law to publicly disclose how much tax they pay in some developing countries.
According to ActionAid, ""billions"" might be at stake that could be used to transform underfunded health and education systems in some of the world's poorest countries, especially since multiple tech giants have reported soaring revenues during the pandemic.
The aid charity wants to see a new global tax system created, preferably by the United Nations, whereby large corporations are required to pay a global minimum rate of corporate tax reflective of their ""real economic presence"".
ActionAid estimates that $2.8bn could pay for 729,010 nurses, 770,649 midwives or 879,899 primary school teachers annually in 20 countries across Africa, Asia and South America.
The aid charity said its research showed that the developing nations with the highest ""tax gaps"" from Google, Facebook and Microsoft are India, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria and Bangladesh.
""Women and young people are paying the price for an outdated system that has allowed big tech companies, including giants like Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft, to rack up huge profits during the pandemic, while contributing little or nothing towards public services in countries in the global south,"" said David Archer, global taxation spokesperson for ActionAid International.
""The $2.8bn tax gap is just the tip of the iceberg - this research covers only three tech giants. But alone, the money that Facebook, Alphabet (Google's owner) and Microsoft would be paying under fairer tax rules could transform public services for millions of people"".
There have long been concerns that the biggest corporations do not pay enough tax in developed nations, and re-route profits through low-tax jurisdictions.
Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon have all settled disputes with French tax authorities over their operations in the country over the last decade. And the UK in April launched a new digital sales tax aimed at forcing tech giants to pay more on the income they generate inside the country.
In February, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by firms like his.
He added that Facebook accepted the fact it might have to pay more in Europe ""under a new framework"" in future, and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution."
"**President Trump's former top advisor, Steve Bannon, has been suspended from Twitter over the ""glorification of violence"" amid the election aftermath.**
Mr Bannon said a re-elected Mr Trump should fire the top infectious disease expert and the FBI director, and called for violence against them.
It comes as the tech firms continue a clampdown on misinformation.
Facebook has shut down a large group which alleges fraud, and announced new measures to amplify genuine results.
Mr Bannon, once widely thought of as one of the most powerful men in Washington, served as the boss of Mr Trump's 2016 campaign, and as a top presidential advisor for the first several months of his presidency.
On Thursday, he posted a video podcast to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, in which he said both Dr Anthony Fauci - the face of the country's fight against coronavirus - and FBI Director Christopher Wray, should be fired after Mr Trump's re-election, but also said they should be subjected to violence.
President Trump has expressed frustration with both men, clashing with Dr Fauci over the pandemic, and with Mr Wray over what he sees as a failure to investigate his opponent, Joe Biden.
Facebook and YouTube both removed the video, but Twitter issued an outright suspension of Mr Bannon's ""war room pandemic"" account, for violating its policy on the glorification of violence.
The account has been permanently suspended, rather than banned for a limited amount of time, Twitter said in a statement.
President Trump, meanwhile, had another of his tweets hidden and labelled by Twitter after falsely claiming victory and alleging the existence of ""illegal votes"".
The President responded by tweeting: ""Twitter is out of control"".
The Stop the Steal Facebook group had about 350,000 members when the social media giant removed it, something the social network admitted was an ""exceptional"" measure. It did so because it was ""creating real-world events"" and ""we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group"", Facebook said.
The social network is now taking further measures to restrict the flow of ""inaccurate claims"" in order ""to keep this content from reaching more people"".
""These include demotions for content on Facebook and Instagram that our systems predict may be misinformation, including debunked claims about voting. We are also limiting the distribution of live videos that may relate to the election on Facebook,"" the firm said in a statement.
As President Trump continues to allege, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud took place, Facebook also said it would alter its election banner notifications and spread news of the projected winner, once a majority of independent outlets projected the result.
The same notice will be put on posts from both candidates.
Separately, Bloomberg reports that Twitter will remove the ""special treatment"" it affords President Trump as a world leader, in the event of Joe Biden winning the presidency.
Twitter has specific rules for world leaders, which means it will not ordinarily ban them for the same offences for which it would ban ordinary users. Twitter argues that such posts - even when violating its rules - are sufficiently newsworthy to stay up, with a handful of exceptions.
Instead, Twitter can label the post of a world leader, hiding it from view and restricting engagement - but leaving it viewable to anyone who clicks through a warning message about the content.
It has repeatedly done this to Mr Trump's tweets, leading to high-profile arguments with the president and his supporters.
But Mr Trump would return to the status of a regular user if he loses the election, Bloomberg reported - meaning that his tweets could be deleted outright or his account suspended, for policy violations."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN World Health Organization has begun paving the way for steering the global population away from one of nature’s most nutritious foods for the human species: meat from livestock.

Those of us who follow climate science know exactly how the sham works: Select only the studies that support the theory, dismiss all others, and claim the evidence is overwhelming. The latest in the UN sights is meat, a vital human food staple over the last 4 million years.
Photo Matthias Heitmann 
The importance of meat in the roughly 4-million year history of the human diet can neither be overstated nor denied. Human brain development is directly traced back to its consumption. Yet global bureaucrats at UN’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) want to have us believe otherwise and have rolled out their latest sham science. Their latest claims:
1) Processed meat such as bacon and sausages are shown to directly cause cancer.
2) Unprocessed fresh meat is also likely linked to higher rates of cancer.
We’ve seen it all before in climate science: Activist bureaucrats single out something they don’t like (CO2), funnel billions of dollars to whores in white lab coats who in turn produce phony scientific studies to scare the public. This is also how they did it with saturated fats in the 2oth century, and carbon dioxide since the 1980s.
CNN here writes of a reaction to the latest UN findings:
‘They tortured the data to ensure a specific outcome,’ said Betsy Booren, vice president of scientific affairs at the North American Meat Institute.
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the scientists who issued the report were split on their decision to make an explicit link between red meat with cancer.”
The problem with the UN’s findings is that it blames the wrong things for disease. Why does the UN ignore the obvious culprits in our food supply: i.e. plant-based cooking oils and sugar. Recall how in the 20th century animal-based saturated fats used to be used for cooking, but the edible oils industry corrupted both the science and the FDA. Soon followed a tsunami of fraudulent science papers, all blaming saturated fats for heart disease, cancer and metabolic syndrome, and more. Consumers were tricked into switching to a diet rich in carbohydrates and plant based oils. Instead of butter, eggs, cheese and lard, people were told to consume vegetable oils made of rapeseed, cottonseed, sunflower seeds etc. – the very oils that many of us call biodiesel and burn in our cars. Today we have an unprecedented global epidemic of diabetes, cancer and heart disease as a result of the fraud-based nutritional guidelines.

World’s oldest person, 116, has been eating bacon over 100 years
Ironically the world’s oldest person, Susannah Mushatt Jones, 116 years old, swears by bacon owing her longevity to the fatty meat which the UN now labels as a carcinogen. It just cannot get more absurd. Yet it does. There are other studies showing that it is vegetarian diets are in fact more dangerous than meat-eating diets. For example read here and here.
UN bureaucrats lying through their vegan teeth
It’s no secret that the vegetarian and vegan movements are not driven by nutritional science, rather they are in large part driven by environmental and animal rights moralists. It has little to do with what is the most nutritional for us. As was the case with carbohydrates and plant-based oils, global bureaucrats are now laying the foundation for the next future mega health crisis, which will be inevitably brought on by the severe nutritional deficiencies of a meatless diet.
The very bureaucrats who for decades falsely told us to stay away from saturated fats, such as whole butter and cheese, are now telling us to stay away from one of the most fundamental food staples of humans: meat. The bureaucrats are lying through their teeth again.
But bug guts and bug meat are healthy!
So according to the UN what should us humans be eating? The answer: bugs! That’s right, bug guts and bug meat are healthy; but animal meat is carcinogenic.

UN says meat on the left is safe to eat, but bacon on the right causes cancer! Photo left: Toby Hudson, CC BY-SA 3.0
 This is the new dimension of absurdity we are seeing from today’s pathological global bureaucrats.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNothing puts the spotlight on Europe’s and USA’s foreign policy debacle better than the Syria crisis and the waves of “refugees” pouring into Europe.
It is a policy catastrophe that will surely multiply in size over the coming months and years ahead, and especially puts European security a risk. Naturally Europe’s leading politicians are desperate to find an excuse. They’ve found one, it appears – so at least has Jean Pascal Van Ypersele, Vice-Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): climate change.
Belgian television here presents a clip of Van Ypersele’s view on what is behind the Syrian civil war and refugee crisis. I’ve translated his words from the French to English:
Exactly now is the time to ask questions. You know that there have been a number of studies published over the last months that show the drought in the Middle East and in the region of Syria over many years is probably a factor that amplified in any case the difficulties of the region. It shows very well, this example of Syrian migrants, these Syrian refugees, that the problems are linked to the question of climatic change, that climate change is linked to an entire series of other questions.”
This is one of the most dishonest claims coming from a person who was educated at a Catholic institution. Such people, and our current Pope, really have succeeded in destroying whatever remaining faith I previously had in the Church in the wake of the child molestation affairs.
Such dishonesty and deception just cannot be followed. These totally incompetent leaders flat out refuse to take any responsibility whatsoever – for anything. For them it’s a game of shirk and blame, and it’s just mind-blowingly awful and morally disgusting.

 _The Inside Story_ in a newspaper last weekend featured an interview with Hamish Rutherford and Gabriel Selischi, OMV’s head of operations for Australia and New Zealand. The interview was one of the better pieces of journalism rarely seen in this newspaper. It illustrated the reality of what is required in the energy sector in the future on the basis New Zealand can’t bank on renewables filling the gap left by dwindling oil and gas supplies. This is in contrast to the path the Government is taking the country on which is based largely on ideology.



Mr Selischi likened the situation facing New Zealand’s energy system to a child which enjoyed a nice lifestyle inherited from its parents but was now facing difficult choices as the situation changed: declining gas supply. He said that since the discovery of the massive Maui field, a series of large gas discoveries relative to the country’s demands meant supply was plentiful. Mr Selischi pointed out that with no commercial discoveries since 2006 the buffer that was there does not exist anymore. He says the Government made a risky bet when it called symbolic time on the industry with a ban on new offshore permits despite the economy remaining dependent on petroleum products.



OMV has budgeted $500 million for an exploration campaign off the coast of Taranaki and in Otago’s Great South Basin. Mr Selischi makes the point that the fact there is so much attention on exploration is, somehow, illogical as exploration will just tell you you have something you could use. Yet **everywhere OMV looks, Greenpeace is there.** These idiots, (my description), according to Mr Selischi, have blockaded it’s New Plymouth offices, boarded a drilling support vessel and climbed the Wellington building housing their Australasian headquarters where they were eventually met by Police. In Mr Selischi’s words “And immediately released.” Greenpeace describes the drilling as “reckless”.



So what is the Government’s response? From Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods, nothing more than an acknowledgement that OMV was legally within its rights to operate in New Zealand. “We are seeing globally an increase in protest against fossil fuels as people become more aware of the need for transition. This is a fact of life for these industries and one they need to acknowledge. Here in New Zealand, there is a right to protest and for our citizens to make their voices heard, but also a legal right for permit operators to conduct their business.”



So is Megan Woods condoning the sort of protest described by Mr Selischi? If she is then I’m surprised he hasn’t decided to put his $500 million back in his pocket and leave. That type of protesting is not legal and Ms Woods should be ordering the Police to arrest those involved, which I thought was part of their job description. Mr Selischi said, “ I don’t see myself being able to operate as today, and commit large amounts of money if this disruption will become more systematic.” That statement is probably beyond Ms Wood’s comprehension. He goes onto say “ And by the way, government, you don’t pay. You pay nada for it. It’s just me risking the money, just to prove there is something possible there.”



The Government should be backing OMV as its own officials warn that the offshore permit ban could be counterproductive to global climate targets, as methanol from New Zealand tended to displace higher – emitting fuels, such as coal, globally. Ironically, because of a lack of gas, we are now importing a million more tons of coal from Indonesia, the highest level since 2006. According to energy analyst John Kidd, that’s 500,000 thousand Corollas on the road. Kidd has written a lengthy report where he comes down firmly on the side of OMV describing the potential financial rewards from a successful drilling campaign but also has grim warnings about the impact on the industry if the campaign fails.



The bottom line here is the story OMV tells (disputed by the Government) that New Zealand does not have enough gas, or more precisely, not enough to smoothly move away from petrol products without sending industrial activity elsewhere, possibly less efficiently than here. That, of course, counts for nothing when you have a Government whose policies are driven by ideology and not reality. A Government where, in the area of protesting, anything goes without any consequences. Scaling buildings, boarding boats, vandalising property, all apparently fine by Megan Woods.



This Government of buffoons would probably celebrate if OMV left. Neither commonsense nor intelligence has been a hallmark of their tenure so far. A look at those in the ranks will tell you this situation is not about to change anytime soon.

"RICHLAND, Wash.  —   When Tim Snider arrived on Enewetak Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to clean up the fallout from dozens of nuclear tests on the ring of coral islands, Army officers immediately ordered him to put on a respirator and a bright yellow suit designed to guard against plutonium poisoning. A military film crew snapped photos and shot movies of Mr. Snider, a    Air Force radiation technician, in the crisp new safety gear. Then he was ordered to give all the gear back. He spent the rest of his   stint on the islands wearing only cutoff shorts and a floppy sun hat. “I never saw one of those suits again,” Mr. Snider, now 58, said in an interview in his kitchen here as he thumbed a yellowing photo he still has from the 1979 shoot. “It was just propaganda. ” Today Mr. Snider has tumors on his ribs, spine and skull  —   which he thinks resulted from his work on the crew, in the largest nuclear cleanup ever undertaken by the United States military. Roughly 4, 000 troops helped clean up the atoll between 1977 and 1980. Like Mr. Snider, most did not even wear shirts, let alone respirators. Hundreds say they are now plagued by health problems, including brittle bones, cancer and birth defects in their children. Many are already dead. Others are too sick to work. The military says there is no connection between these illnesses and the cleanup. Radiation exposure during the work fell well below recommended thresholds, it says, and safety precautions were top notch. So the government refuses to pay for the veterans’ medical care. Congress long ago recognized that troops were harmed by radiation on Enewetak during the original atomic tests, which occurred in the 1950s, and should be cared for and compensated. Still, it has failed to do the same for the men who cleaned up the toxic debris 20 years later. The disconnect continues a longstanding pattern in which the government has shrugged off responsibility for its nuclear mistakes. On one cleanup after another, veterans have been denied care because shoddy or intentionally false radiation monitoring was later used as proof that there was no radiation exposure. A report by The New York Times last spring found that veterans were exposed to plutonium during the cleanup of a 1966 accident involving American hydrogen bombs in Palomares, Spain. Declassified documents and a recent study by the Air Force said the men might have been poisoned, and needed new testing. But in the months since the report, nothing has been done to help them. For two years, the Enewetak veterans have been trying, without success, to win medical benefits from Congress through a proposed Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act. Some lawmakers hope to introduce a bill this year, but its fate is uncertain. Now, as new cases of cancer emerge nearly every month, many of the men wonder how much longer they can wait. The cleanup of Enewetak has long been portrayed as a triumph. During the operation, officials told reporters that they were setting a new standard in safety. One report from the end of the cleanup said safety was so strict that “it would be difficult to identify additional radsafe precautions that could have been taken. ” Documents from the time and interviews with dozens of veterans tell a different story. Most of the documents were declassified and made publicly available in the 1990s, along with millions of pages of other files relating to nuclear testing, and sat unnoticed for years. They show that the government used troops instead of professional nuclear workers to save money. Then it saved even more money by skimping on safety precautions. Records show that protective equipment was missing or unusable. Troops requesting respirators couldn’t get them.   safety monitoring systems failed. Officials assured concerned members of Congress by listing safeguards that didn’t exist. And though leaders of the cleanup told troops that the islands emitted no more radiation than a dental   documents show they privately worried about “plutonium problems” and areas that were “highly radiologically contaminated. ” Tying any disease to radiation exposure years earlier is nearly impossible there has never been a formal study of the health of the Enewetak cleanup crews. The military collected nasal swabs and urine samples during the cleanup to measure how much plutonium troops were absorbing, but in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, it said it could not find the records. Hundreds of the troops, though, almost all now in their late 50s, have found one another on Facebook and discovered remarkably similar problems involving deteriorating bones and an incidence of cancer that appears to be far above the norm. A tally of 431 of the veterans by a member of the group shows that of those who stayed on the southernmost island, where radiation was low, only 2 percent reported having cancer. Of those who worked on the most contaminated islands in the north, 20 percent reported cancer. An additional 34 percent from the contaminated islands reported other health problems that could be related to radiation, like failing bones, infertility and thyroid problems. Between 1948 and 1958, 43 atomic blasts rocked the tiny atoll  —   part of the Marshall Islands, which sit between Hawaii and the Philippines  —   obliterating the native groves of breadfruit trees and coconut palms, and leaving an apocalyptic wreckage of twisted test towers, radioactive bunkers and rusting military equipment. Four islands were entirely vaporized only deep blue radioactive craters in the ocean remained. The residents had been evacuated. No one thought they would ever return. In the early 1970s, the Enewetak islanders threatened legal action if they didn’t get their home back. In 1972, the United States government agreed to return the atoll and vowed to clean it up first, a project shared by the Atomic Energy Commission, now called the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. The biggest problem, according to Energy Department reports, was Runit Island, a   spit of sand blitzed by 11 nuclear tests in 1958. The north end was gouged by a    crater that documents from the time describe as “a special problem” because of “high subsurface contamination. ” The island was littered with a fine dust of pulverized plutonium, which if inhaled or otherwise absorbed can cause cancer years or even decades later. A millionth of a gram is potentially harmful, and because the isotopes have a   of 24, 000 years, the danger effectively never goes away. The military initially quarantined Runit. Government scientists agreed that other islands might be made habitable, but Runit would most likely forever be too toxic, memos show. So federal officials decided to collect radioactive debris from the other islands and dump it into the Runit crater, then cap it with a thick concrete dome. The government intended to use private contractors and estimated the cleanup would cost $40 million, documents show. But Congress balked at the price and approved only half the money. It ordered that “all reasonable economies should be realized” by using troops to do the work. Safety planners intended to use protective suits, respirators and sprinklers to keep down dust. But without adequate funding, simple precautions were scrapped. Paul Laird was one of the first service members to arrive for the atoll’s cleanup, in 1977. Then a    bulldozer driver, he began scraping topsoil that records show contained plutonium. He was given no safety equipment. “That dust was like baby powder. We were covered in it,” said Mr. Laird, now 60, during an interview in rural Maine, where he owns a small auto repair shop. “But we couldn’t even get a paper dust mask. I begged for one daily. My lieutenant said the masks were on back order so use a  . ” By the time Mr. Laird left the islands, he was throwing up and had a blisterlike rash. He got out of the Army in 1978 and moved home to Maine. When he turned 52, he found a lump that turned out to be kidney cancer. A scan at the hospital showed he also had bladder cancer. A few years later he developed a different form of bladder cancer. His private health insurance covered the treatment, but   left him deep in debt. He applied repeatedly for free veterans’ health care for radiation but was denied. His medical records from the military all said he had not been exposed. “When the job was done, they threw my bulldozer in the ocean because it was so hot,” Mr. Laird said. “If it got that much radiation, how the hell did it miss me?” As the cleanup continued, federal officials tried to institute safety measures. A shipment of yellow radiation suits arrived on the islands in 1978, but in interviews veterans said that they were too hot to wear in the tropical sun and that the military told them that it was safe to go without them. The military tried to monitor plutonium inhalation using air samplers. But they soon broke. According to an Energy Department memo, in 1978, only a third of the samplers were working. All troops were issued a small film badge to measure radiation exposure, but government memos note that humid conditions destroyed the film. Failure rates often reached 100 percent. Every evening, Air Force technicians scanned workers for plutonium particles before they left Runit. Men said dozens of workers each day had screened positive for dangerous levels of radiation. “Sometimes we’d get readings that were all the way to the red,” said one technician, David Roach, 57, who now lives in Rockland, Me. None of the high readings were recorded, said Mr. Roach, who has since had several strokes. Two members of Congress wrote to the secretary of defense in 1978 with concerns, but his office told them not to worry: Suits and respirators ensured the cleanup was conducted in “a manner as to assure that radiation exposure to individuals is limited to the lowest levels practicable. ” Even after the cleanup, many of the islands were still too radioactive to inhabit. In 1988, Congress passed a law providing automatic medical care to any troops involved in the original atomic testing. But the act covers veterans only up to 1958, when atomic testing stopped, excluding the Enewetak cleanup crews. If civilian contractors had done the cleanup and later discovered declassified documents that show the government failed to follow its own safety plan, they could sue for negligence. Veterans don’t have that right. A 1950 Supreme Court ruling bars troops and their families from suing for injuries arising from military service. The veterans’ only avenue for help is to apply individually to the Department of Veterans Affairs for free medical care and disability payments. But the department bases decisions on old military records  —   including defective air sampling and radiation badge data  —   that show no one was harmed. It nearly always denies coverage. “A lot of guys can’t survive anymore, financially,” said Jeff Dean, 60, who piloted boats loaded with contaminated soil. Mr. Dean developed cancer at 43, then again two years later. He had to give up his job as a carpenter as the bones in his spine deteriorated. Unpaid medical bills left him $100, 000 in debt. “No one seems to want to admit anything,” Mr. Dean said. “I don’t know how much longer we can wait, we have guys dying all the time. ”"
"**""I spend a lot of time doing Zoom town halls,"" says Melissa Watson, a schoolteacher and army veteran standing for Congress in South Carolina.**
Her district is mostly rural, and pandemic restrictions have limited her ability to knock on doors.
South Carolina shut down non-essential businesses on 1 April, and then implemented a state-wide home-or-work order on 7 April. Apart from a few exceptions, like necessary shopping or outdoor exercise, residents had to stay at home unless they were working.
So, Ms Watson joins Zoom meetings with local groups and county parties. ""Whatever anybody will invite me to,"" she jokes.
Meetings with female politicians and businesswomen, which she calls ""Women, Wine, and Watson"" are among her favourite Zoom gatherings.
Ms Watson uses a host of different apps to support her campaigning, She lists seven for me, including apps that analyse data and two different text messaging services.
It may seem strange that the humble text message - the old-fashioned SMS, not even WhatsApp - has emerged as the workhorse of the 2020 US election.
By some estimates one billion text messages will have been sent in this US campaign cycle. That is at least double, and perhaps triple, the volume of texts sent in previous campaigns, says Jay Godfrey, vice president of NationBuilder, a leading campaign software firm in Los Angeles.
The reason for that deluge is that people pay attention to texts.
According to research company Gartner, 70-98% of text messages are actually read, compared with 20% of emails and people respond to 40-50% of texts, but only 6% of emails.
Email ""is dying a slow and painful death,"" says Daniel Serralde, chief of staff for the Dallas county Republican party.
Messaging apps like Hustle, GetThru, and RumbleUp let campaign volunteers first message their close networks, then their neighbours and others in their vicinity.
They are designed for elections: Hustle for political campaigns and non-profit organisations, GetThru targeting the Democratic side, and RumbleUp aiming at the Republican end.
These apps, or versions of them, are designed to go into the hands of party supporters, to help them contact people they know.
Recipients can reply, since there's a human volunteer on the end, and ask questions about voting locations, postal ballots or Zoom meetings.
More Technology of Business
There's also the option of cross-referencing a volunteer's own contacts with target lists of supporters or undecided voters.
""Actually the most effective voice to get someone to go out and participate is their sister, co-worker or mum,"" says Mr Godfrey.
And when your sister sends you a link, perhaps for a Zoom town hall meeting or a petition, and you click on it, the campaign will know it was her link you clicked.
That means campaigns can ""see, acknowledge, and thank people who are really enthusiastic,"" says Mr Godfrey.
It's a change for the better, argues Brendan Tobin, vice president of Ecanvasser, a campaign software company founded in Ireland which now works internationally.
""It's more relational, it's more real and sustainable, and political parties don't lose these people post election,"" he says.
Like much of the new 2020 campaign technology, these apps are inexpensive and can create a more level playing field for poorer candidates and non-traditional voices, who might otherwise be excluded.
The Lincoln Project, a group of prominent Republicans opposing Donald Trump's re-election, is an example.
Peer-to-peer messaging and social media placed them in the spotlight.
""That kind of group wouldn't be getting as much traction traditionally. They're a major player despite being shunned by their own party which is pretty astonishing,"" Mr Godfrey says.
As for television, campaigns used to buy huge amounts of advertising around local TV programming and hope for the best.
But now, it's possible to aim a particular advert to a specific television viewer.
That's because many modern cable boxes are ""addressable"", which means they have an individually identifiable serial number built into their microprocessor. So cable TV firms can tailor advertisements to particular households and they sell that service to campaigns.
Ten years ago this technique was only available in the biggest urban areas, but is now available in every state.
Early in an election, campaigns can aim at undecided voters, then closer to election day, target their supporters who may need extra encouraging to vote.
Facebook is another avenue for campaigns looking to find particular voters. ""We did a lot of Facebook ads,"" says Ms Watson.
""We tried everything to see what was going to give us the biggest bang for the buck, and Facebook ads probably was the most successful for us,"" she explains.
Facebook lets candidates and other advertisers target users by postal code, education, income, age, job, gender, or if you've interacted with their Instagram account.
In fact Facebook allows advertisers to dice the population almost any way they like, perhaps finding people who have recently got engaged, had children, speak Spanish - or those who like vintage jazz pages or honky-tonk.
And if you're a candidate and have a list of at least 20 particular people, you can upload their email addresses or mobile phone numbers as a Facebook Custom Audience.
There's also a bit of code called Facebook Pixel that tracks which users click from Facebook ads to advertisers' sites, and makes it easier for advertisers to hone in on exactly who's clicking.
However, there is a danger that such narrowly targeted political messages swamp core supporters.
This high volume of contact ""is naturally starting to tiptoe up to the irritating,"" warns Mr Godfrey.
The danger is you are turning people off because multiple organisations are contacting the same voter.
Also, when you get to this level of precision, ""you get blinders and start to hyper-focus and leave out the art of politics, crafting the broader appealing message,"" says Michael Frias, chief executive of Washington DC-based Catalist, a data utility for political groups.
And here is a sobering thought; spending on the 2020 US election is set to reach $10.8bn (Â£8.3bn), says the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Yet a 2017 study from the University of California, Berkeley suggests the effect of all this money and campaigning on voters' candidate choices is, to quote the authors - ""zero""."
"Hong Kong’s Endangered Species Advisory Committee meets today to decide whether to follow China’s lead and destroy its own (33-tonne) stockpile of contraband ivory.  This is welcome news, but the destruction of confiscated specimens from threatened species should be standard practice for a country signed up to doing so. The Chinese stockpile destroyed earlier this month, around six tonnes worth up to US$12m, only represents about 13% of its current stock, that is, the stock that has accumulated despite 121 tonnes going missing.  China joins a string of countries to tackle their ivory stockpiles, following the US, the Philippines, Gabon and Kenya. But these destructions in total, amounting to nearly 27 tonnes of confiscated ivory, represent a mere 9% of the estimated global volume seized between 1996 and 2011. As with all 179 signatories to the Convention on Trade in International Species (CITIES), China is directed to save in storage or destroy ivory, except for “bona fide scientific, educational, enforcement or identification purposes”. Confiscated specimens can also be returned to their country of origin, but this can be very costly, logistically complex, and runs the risk of them re-entering the black market. And yet elements of China’s decision to destroy some of its stockpile are indeed extraordinary. Statements made by China in recent years have dodged the issue of its role in the illegal ivory trade chain. Until recently China deflected blame, framed the ivory crisis as an African law enforcement issue, or suggested that confiscated ivory in African stockpiles be offered to satisfy Chinese consumer demand. China’s action comes as increasing numbers of Chinese nationals are apprehended at African airports carrying ivory out of the continent. While critics may call it a publicity stunt, it seems China recognises that it is part of the wildlife trafficking problem, and is resolved to be part of a serious solution.  Destruction of stocks addresses ivory demand in a way that catching ivory traffickers does not. It suggests the problem lies not just with smugglers but with all those who desire the smuggled commodity, and that the government will tolerate neither. Publicly destroying stockpiles has the potential to change attitudes and perhaps the plight of elephants for the better. It contributes to the momentum required to resolve the current poaching crisis. In parts of Africa, national ivory stockpiles have long been viewed as a government asset that has the potential to bring in revenue for wildlife and other agencies. A long-standing, ongoing debate between African pro-trade and anti-trade factions started when the African elephant was first listed in CITES appendices, and only seems to take a backseat when elephant carcasses overwhelm the physical and political landscape.  Why store large volumes of ivory contraband for great lengths of time for little purpose? Storage and good security eat up funds that could be better spent elsewhere. Poor security risks thefts, of which there are many examples from “secure” government vaults, such as in Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, and Vietnam. Reports of tusks “with legs”, like Ivindo 3 from Gabon and a Ugandan pair – ivory confiscated in Africa and then again in Asia – demonstrate that recycling ivory from government stockpiles back into the black market is a reality.  Maintaining stockpiles may contribute to ambiguity over the legal status of ivory. It can also give the impression that contraband ivory is a legitimate commodity to be speculated on – an asset worth keeping hold of. Destruction, rather than storage, circumvents controversy of inciting “ivory worship”, such as when Sri Lankan authorities considered transferring poached tusks trafficked from Kenya to a Buddhist temple last year. Some critics complain that destroying ivory contraband is a waste. But let’s remember that the real waste occurred when the elephant was destroyed for its teeth and could no longer contribute to the ecosystem, the tourist economy, or Africa’s cultural heritage.  Others argue that destroying stockpiles sends a scarcity signal down the illegal trade chain, leading to price rises and increased poaching to capitalise on the increased value. But this would mean stockpile leakage is a significant source of commercial ivory, further demonstrating the dimensions of the problem. Besides, other urgent conservation or anti-poaching actions are designed to cut supply. China’s destruction of a portion of its illegal ivory stockpile should be commended as an important contribution that could seed a “distaste” for ivory in what is the world’s largest market for it. With a paltry number of ivory seizures in 2013, this decisive and widely broadcasted action by the Chinese government shines some hope on an otherwise dismal prospect for the future of the African elephant. Let’s hope that Hong Kong follows suit. "

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
From September 21 – 24, 2015, the 10th Deutsche Klimatagung (German Climate Conference) took place in Hamburg. Along with a number of topics Jochem Marotzke explained to his colleagues that it did not matter how far reality diverged from the modeled temperature curves. This would say nothing about the existing or missing quality of the models. The man is just ingenious.
Another presentation was made by Sebastian Wagner and Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center in Geestacht, Germany. In it they claimed that the cold phases of the last 2000 years were simply caused by volcanic aerosols, even though weak solar activity would be a far better explanation for these cool periods. Unfortunately the models that are used are unable to show the sun as a driver because the assigned irradiative forcing or the climate forcing of solar activity fluctuations have been intentionally pegged too low.
No warming trend in Antarctica
Problems also in Antarctica: Using temperature reconstructions from climate proxies, there was no warming in the 20th century, according to Wagner and Zorita. To the contrary the models showed a virtual warming, which in reality never existed. The presentation’s abstract states:

Over the southern hemisphere the situation is however more heterogeneous and the model simulation shows no such clear cut changes compared to the northern hemispheric continents. For instance, the change in the GHG concentrations does not lead to a pronounced increase in the temperatures over Antarctica. Here the reconstruction shows quite stable levels also in the 20th century, whereas the simulation shows a similar increase as for the northern hemisphere.”

In other words: The models fail to get a grip on reality.

"**A Facebook group dedicated to the 1990s got ""flipped-turned upside down"" when Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Will Smith posted to say hello.**
The Hollywood star, who has 77 million followers, left ""The group where we all pretend it's still the 90s"" pinching themselves with his six posts.
Fresh Prince co-stars DJ Jazzy Jeff and Hilary Banks actress Karyn Parsons also said ""hi"" to the 35,000 members.
""Ok ok ok.... am i seeing things,"" commented one stunned member.
""Oh wow Is that really you?"" posted another on the group, which was created during the coronavirus pandemic by two men from Cardiff.
""That pic just confirms I've had the best childhood growing up in the 90s,"" said one group member, echoing the sentiments of the thousands of comments that followed in a haze of rose-tinted reminiscence for the decade.
When it comes to '90s nostalgia, there are few bigger triggers than the cast of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
The US show, which originally aired from 1990 to 1996, follows a street-smart teenager born and raised in West Philadelphia (played by Smith) who is sent to move in with his wealthy uncle and aunt in their Bel Air mansion after getting into a fight in the local playground.
Smith - who went on to star in hit films such as Independence Day, Bad Boys, Men in Black and Wild Wild West - was joined on the Facebook group by Karyn Parsons, who played bossy boots Hilary Banks.
Smith and Parsons even changed their social avatars to get into the groove of the role-play Facebook group, which takes users back to the 1990s in a world where Tamagotchi, Global Hypercolour T-shirts and Just Seventeen magazine remain king.
Amid posts about ""going to Dixons to buy a Walkman"" and ""circling Game Boys in the Argos catalogue"", arguably one of the world's best-known actors popped up with a post showing him standing on a chair saying ""Sup y'all??""
Smith even went on to create a poll asking how he should ""kill some time"" as he's ""got a long break between shooting eps of Fresh Prince"".
It's not the only recent example of a Wales-based group being unexpectedly sprinkled with star dust, with Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney recently taking over National League football club, Wrexham FC - much to fan groups' excitement.
Smith and his Fresh Prince pals were suggested as possible new group members by Facebook, especially as there's a Fresh Prince reunion on the cards.
Smith was offered by Facebook as ""a collaboration to see what groups like this could achieve"".
""It can't get any better for us than Will Smith, he epitomises the '90s,"" said group creator Cameron Scott, an admin assistant for a solicitor firm by day.
""The way he dressed, his attitude, he was perfect. Everyone in this world, it is the 1990s and Will Smith has really got the concept, his posts are written as if it was the 1990s.
""It's amazing for us, perfect.""
""The group where we all pretend it's still the 90s"" is run by someone who was actually only born in 1993 but who grew-up watching TV shows including Buffy, Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Charmed with his big sister Kysha.
Cameron came up with the concept in April at the start of lockdown ""while listening to East 17 on his Walkman"" in his house in Cardiff.
""Facebook liked how far this group has come. We gained members quickly as people were at home more, on social media more, but also wanted as escape from the real world and coronavirus.""
He added: ""Also we had a clear vibe, if you're in the group you're back in the 1990s. You buy CDs at Woolworths, wear Sweater Shop jumpers and listen to your Walkman - it's pure escapism, a trip back in time.
""It's a real feel-good community on the group, it's great for people's mental health and it's just a nice place to be - and to have Will Smith join us, was really cool."""
"**The UK will impose new rules next year aimed at preventing Google and Facebook from abusing their market dominance.**
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the two firms accounted for around 80% of the Â£14bn ($18.7bn) spent on advertising online in 2019.
The new regime will attempt to give consumers more control over their data.
It will also ""help small businesses thrive, and ensure news outlets are not forced out by bigger rivals,"" according to the government.
""There is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power among a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth of the sector, reducing innovation and having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them,"" said Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden, in a statement.
""It's time to address that and unleash a new age of tech growth.""
The new code will set clear expectations for the most powerful firms over what represents acceptable behaviour when interacting with competitors and users.
Platforms that are funded by digital advertising could be required to be more transparent about the services they provide and how they are using consumers' data.
They will be expected to give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising, and prevented from placing restrictions on their customers that make it hard for them to use rival platforms.
The code will be enforced by a new dedicated unit within the CMA.
The Digital Markets Unit could be given powers to suspend, block and reverse decisions made by technology firms and to impose financial penalties for non-compliance.
Google and Facebook have previously said they are committed to working with the British government and regulator on digital advertising.
The new code could also affect the media industry, which has lost much of its advertising revenues to Facebook and Google.
The new code will attempt to govern commercial arrangements between publishers and platforms to help keep publishers in business.
It will try to stop online platforms from imposing unfair terms on news publishers that limit their ability to monetise their content."

Tax credits provided by the federal government to developers of low‐​income housing are poorly monitored and have suffered from mission creep. Instead of providing housing to households whose incomes are below the poverty line, many states are using these funds to socially engineer people into living in high‐​density housing projects along transit corridors.



Low‐​Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) is the federal government’s largest program for building affordable housing, costing the Treasury $10 billion a year. This compares with less than $3 billion a year spent on the Department of Housing & Urban Development’s (HUD’s) public housing capital program. Yet LIHTCs are administered not by HUD but by the Internal Revenue Service, which relies on state housing agencies to oversee the program.



Many states, however, are more interested in using the funds to boost transit ridership than to provide housing for people living in poverty. The housing that is built is anything but affordable, often costing three times as much per square foot as housing built without subsidies. Only a few units of subsidized housing are affordable to people living below the poverty line; most are available to any household earning less than the urban area’s median income, which literally means half the households in the region.



The rules are based on assumptions that high‐​density housing and public transit are somehow more energy efficient and climate‐​friendly than single‐​family homes and driving. 



As the Los Angeles Tenants Union complains, “U.S. housing policy has become a market‐​driven, mixed‐​income program of ‘Affordable Housing’ for carefully selected, mostly middle‐​income tenants, largely excluding the very poor.”



Each year, the IRS apportions out LIHTCs to the states based on population. The states then give the tax credits to various for‐​profit or non‐​profit developers, which can use the credits to offset their federal income taxes or sell the credits to other companies. LIHTCs can be used to pay for up to 70 percent of the cost of supposedly affordable housing, with other state and local funds often making up most of the other 30 percent.



The result is that developers put up almost none of their own money to build low‐​income housing. The rents they collect are restricted to keep the housing affordable but certainly pay for the costs of operating the housing. After 30 years, the restrictions are lifted and the property owners can charge market rates, sometimes leading to a doubling or tripling of rents.



To see how this program works in detail, I recently examined dozens of housing projects funded in Seattle since 2008. Almost all of these projects were built or are being built by non‐​profit organizations such as Mercy Housing, which has low‐​income housing projects in 18 states ranging from California to Georgia.



These projects cost an average of about $300,000 per apartment unit, which sounds affordable in a region where the median home price is $780,000. But while the median home in Seattle is around 2,000 square feet in size, the average unit built with low‐​income housing funds is less than 700 square feet.



Current home construction costs in Seattle average $141 per square foot. The affordable housing projects, however, cost an average of $532 per square foot. This included basic construction costs (including contingencies) of $260 per square foot, plus all sorts of additional fees and costs including $40 of “developer fees” (meaning money for the non‐​profit), $38 per square foot for land acquisition, and the costs of constructing common areas such as hallways in multifamily dwellings. For comparison, new homes in Buckeye, Arizona sell for as low as $126.55 per square foot, including the land, all permits and hookups, developer fees, and other costs.



One reason construction is more expensive in Seattle is that Seattle has an urban‐​growth boundary that has driven average land prices to $1.3 million an acre, compared with under $300,000 an acre in fast‐​growing urban areas that have no urban‐​growth boundaries such as Atlanta, Houston, and Raleigh. Yet none of the non‐​profits that build low‐​income housing in Seattle make any effort to repeal the state’s growth‐​management law, which has more than doubled inflation‐​adjusted rental rates in Seattle since it was passed in 1990. Why should they, when high housing costs increase the demand for their projects?



An even bigger problem is that most of the Seattle projects weren’t really built to provide affordable housing; instead, they were built to provide customers to the region’s light‐​rail system. To be eligible for state and city housing funds covering the 30 percent of costs that LIHTCs won’t pay, Seattle projects have to comply with an “Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard” that requires, among other things, “compact development,” “access to public transportation,” and “walkable neighborhoods.” As a result, all but two of the 30 projects whose applications I examined in detail were mid‐​rises (4- to 6‐​story) or high‐​rises (7‐​plus stories). Such projects are much more expensive to build due to the need for more structural steel and concrete, not to mention all of the common areas they require that aren’t needed for single‐​family homes.



These rules are based on assumptions that high‐​density housing and public transit are somehow more energy efficient and climate‐​friendly than single‐​family homes and driving. In fact, midrise and high‐​rise construction uses far more energy and emits more greenhouse gases per square foot than low‐​rise construction. Multifamily housing also uses more energy per square foot than single‐​family housing. Furthermore, public transit uses more energy and emits more greenhouse gases per passenger mile than driving an average car. High‐​density housing is only more “sustainable” if people are willing to live in cramped apartments—but even then, smaller single‐​family homes would use even less energy.



“Government will malperform if an activity is under pressure to satisfy different constituencies with different values and different demands,’’ wrote Peter Drucker in his 1989 book, _The New Realities_. ‘‘Performance requires concentration on one goal.” Agencies administering affordable housing funds have lost sight of their goal and so the money they spend doesn’t help as many people as it could.



Not that the housing built in Seattle’s project helps many low‐​income people. Many of the units are available to any household that earns less than the Seattle-area’s median income, which was $93,000 in 2019, and only a few are affordable to those who truly have low incomes. Despite the fact that the non‐​profits that built the projects spent none of their own money on the capital costs, the rents they charge for most of the apartments are higher than truly low‐​income people can afford to pay.



According to the Census Bureau, the poverty line for a Seattle family of four is under $33,000 a year. Given requirements that households spend no more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing, a family earning $33,000 a year can afford to spend $825 a month on rent and utilities. Yet only ten of the 110 units of the Capitol Hill TOD (for transit‐​oriented development), a project now being built with low‐​income housing tax credits, will be priced this low, and only five of those are large enough for a family of four. The average unit in the complex will require an income of $40,000 a year, and the most expensive $56,000. This means that most of the 110 units are really middle‐​income housing.



Nor does low‐​income housing have much influence on the housing market as a whole. Since 2008, Seattle has built or under construction 6,700 units of low‐​income housing, which is about 8 percent of the growth in the number of homes in the city. But it is actually less than that on net because hundreds of homes were demolished to make room for some of these projects. This simply isn’t enough homes to significantly influence overall housing prices. To make matters worse, Seattle’s share of affordable housing subsidies is funded by a property tax on existing homes, reducing the affordability of homeownership.



This isn’t just a Seattle problem: such high‐​cost, high‐​density housing is being built using affordable housing subsidies in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, and many other states. The real aim of such housing is often to boost transit ridership as many of the high‐​density housing projects springing up along light‐​rail lines are partially or entirely financed with LIHTCs and other low‐​income housing funds.



For example, in another recent study I found 33 high‐​density projects costing $383 million built with low‐​income housing subsidies along Phoenix, Arizona’s light‐​rail line. To add insult to injury, Phoenix’s transit agency claimed that these projects were “stimulated” by the light‐​rail line when in fact they wouldn’t have been built, at least not in that form, without the housing subsidies.



It is clear that the low‐​income housing tax credit program is not accomplishing its goals and should be abolished. Voters in general should be suspicious of ballot measures that would supposedly fund low‐​income housing but really fund transit‐​oriented developments most of whose housing units will rent at rates that won’t be affordable to families below the poverty line.

"**More than 200 Facebook workers from around the world have accused the firm of forcing its content moderators back to the office despite the risks of contracting coronavirus.**
The claims came in an open letter that said the firm was ""needlessly risking"" lives to maintain profits.
They called on Facebook to make changes to allow more remote work and offer other benefits, such as hazard pay.
Facebook said ""a majority"" of content reviewers are working from home.
""While we believe in having an open internal dialogue, these discussions need to be honest,"" a spokesperson for the company said.
""The majority of these 15,000 global content reviewers have been working from home and will continue to do so for the duration of the pandemic.""
In August, Facebook said staff could work from home until the summer of 2021.
But the social media giant relies on thousands of contractors, who officially work for other companies such as Accenture and CPL, to spot materials on the site that violate its policies, such as spam, child abuse and disinformation.
In the open letter, the workers said the call to return to the office had come after Facebook's efforts to rely more on artificial intelligence to spot problematic posts had come up short.
""After months of allowing content moderators to work from home, faced with intense pressure to keep Facebook free of hate and disinformation, you have forced us back to the office,"" they said.
""Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral.""
This letter gives a fascinating behind the scenes glimpse into what is happening at Facebook - and all is not well.
Mark Zuckerberg's dream is that AI moderation will one day solve some of the platform's problems.
The idea is that machine learning and sophisticated software will automatically pick up and block things like hate speech or child abuse.
Facebook claims that nearly 95% of offending posts are picked up before they are flagged.
Yet it's still easy to find grim stuff on Facebook.
On Monday I published a piece showing the kinds of racist and misogynistic content aimed at Kamala Harris on the platform.
Facebook removed some of the content, however even though I flagged it to Facebook, some of it is still there - a week after I reported it.
What this letter suggests is that AI is simply not working as Facebook execs would hope.
Of course, these are voices of moderators - Facebook will have a different take.
You could also argue that human voices may have a vested interest to say AI doesn't work.
But clearly, as the spotlight is well and truly on Facebook, there are internal problems that have now spilled out into the open.
Facebook said the reviewers have access to health care and that it had ""exceeded health guidance on keeping facilities safe for any in-office work"".
But the workers said only those with a doctor's note are currently excused from working in an office and called on Facebook to offer hazard pay and make its contractors full-time staff.
""Before the pandemic, content moderation was easily Facebook's most brutal job. We waded through violence and child abuse for hours on end. Moderators working on child abuse content had targets increased during the pandemic, with no additional support,"" they said.
""Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone.""
The letter is addressed to Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, as well as the chiefs of Accenture and CPL. It was organised by UK law firm Foxglove, which works on tech policy issues. More than 170 of the signatories were anonymous.
Facebook is not the only company to face staff worries about in-person work amid the pandemic.
Amazon has also come under fire for conditions in its warehouses, while outbreaks at firms from manufacturers to finance companies have stirred fears.
It comes just a day after Washington lawmakers grilled Mr Zuckerberg on the firm's content review policies."
"“I Can’t Breathe” is echoing across the planet. Filled with anguish and pain, these haunting words are spotlighting the systemic racism that has infected unjust policing practices, putting black and brown communities in its crosshairs. As police take lives with chokeholds and asphyxiate others with knees on their necks, we are reminded that racism is literally killing our people and planet. Communities of color have appealed for decades to politicians, policymakers and environmental organizations that they “can’t breathe,” only to be ignored. The simple fact is that Black, Brown, Indigenous and lower-wealth communities have disproportionately been the dumping grounds for our country’s deadliest toxic pollutants. We have instituted economic and environmental apartheid through redlining, restrictive covenants and unfair zoning practices. These continuing actions have created sacrifice zones, filled with smelters, coal-fired power plants, incinerators, petrochemical facilities and a host of other polluters. Along with the deadly co-pollutants being pumped into the lungs of local residents every day, sacrifice zones become killing fields. These are the areas of the unseen and unheard, where bodies are riddled with chronic medical conditions such as cancers, liver, kidney, heart and lung diseases, while also being the most medically underserved. These are also the areas where viruses with exotic names like Covid-19, West Nile and dengue come to feed. Studies show that Hispanics, Asians, American Indians/Alaska Natives and especially African Americans experience higher risks of harm (including premature death) from air pollution. Approximately 74 million people of color, or 57%, live in counties with at least one failing grade for ozone and/or particle pollution, compared with 38% of whites. Let’s be clear: we got here because we turned a blind eye to the public health time bomb that has been exploding in our most vulnerable communities, and as a result we now have an equally dangerous climate bomb that is accelerated by fossil fuels, racially tinged transportation development and deforestation. Once again, our most vulnerable are most at risk. The late congressman John Lewis warned: “When we take our air, waters and land for granted; when we show a simple lack of respect for nature and our environment, we unmake God’s good creation. Humanity is the most important endangered species under threat from climate change and yet we flood our ecology with poisons and pollution.” In this light, the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, which will formally take effect in less than 100 days, is all the more troubling. Frontline communities are hit first and worst from climate change. They are the least likely to be able to recover, often forgotten as decisions take place about rebuilding their communities by those who benefit from the disaster economy. And like other pollution, climate change has a cumulative effect on frontline communities. Since 1980, America has been hit with more than 250 weather and climate disasters, with increasing frequency in recent years. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the total cost of these events has exceeded $1.7tn. From 2016 to 2018, the US experienced a total of 45 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, or an average of 15 events annually. 2019 was the Earth’s second-hottest year on record. African Americans are disproportionately exposed to extreme heat. From the urban heat island effect, making cities much warmer than rural areas, to the lack of air conditioning and cooling stations in many communities of color, rising temperatures are deadly. Floods and hurricanes in 2019 cost dozens of lives and $20bn in damages. Vulnerable communities endure housing insecurities due to historic discrimination and residential segregation, often locating them in flood-prone areas that obstruct their access to affordable flood insurance and loans to rebuild. The climate emergency will have a disproportionate impact on Black and Brown communities. More than two-thirds of US adults say they have some anxiety about climate change, while nearly half of young adults say climate change stress impacts their daily lives. Mental health stressors will probably hit disadvantaged communities the hardest. President Trump claimed that he wants “crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet”. Environmental justice advocates like me agree, but the rhetoric is at odds with his administration’s actions to reverse at least 100 environmental rules. Along with attacks on voting and civil rights, the clear message is that the lives in Black, Brown and Indigenous communities don’t matter. If America is ever going to “win” on climate change, it must first break its addiction to fossil fuels and racism. Only then can it truly be great.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the past months we’ve witnessed a powerful El Niño, a Pacific oceanic phase that brings warm sea surface temperatures along the equatorial Pacific. This El Niño has made 2015 global temperatures among the highest on the satellite record.
But not only has the equatorial surface Pacific been warm, so has a vast part of the northeastern Pacific, as the following chart from April 2015 shows:

Figure 1: Warm sea surface temperature anomaly over the northeastern Pacific along the North American west coast indicated in red, recorded April 2015, along with a small patch of cool North Atlantic sea surface.

Also the North Atlantic sea surface had been warm, but recently turned cool as the above chart shows.
Disturbing trend
Now, some eight months later, we see a disturbing northern hemisphere oceanic surface trend very much in the works. No, sea surface temperatures have not gotten even warmer – rather quite to the contrary: they’ve gotten tremendously colder.
Hat-tip: wobleibtdieerderwaermung.

Fig. 2: The latest chart above shows the large reduction of the northeastern Pacific warm blob, and the huge growth in the North Atlantic cold region. Source: cropped from Unisys here. 
The above chart shows two major developments: 1) the northeastern Pacific warm blob has shriveled away massively, and 2) the North Atlantic cool spot has exploded in size and is now a vast region of cold sea surface temperatures. The northern hemisphere is de facto getting refrigerated.
La Nina will cool globe further
Not only are northern hemisphere sea surface temperatures falling rapidly, but also the equatorial Pacific is set for a widespread cool-down as the current El Niño begins its decline and heads towards  a La Niña, the cool phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Most models now show it will arrive possibly late 2016. This means the globe will very likely soon see three vast and major oceanic regions entering a cool phase all at once. This is setting up to have profound impacts on global temperature over the coming months and two-three years – if not longer.

Meteorologist Joe Bastardi at Weatherbell has pointed out a number of times that the last La Niñas have gotten progressively deeper, and states we should not be surprised if the next one is as deep, or even deeper. Could we be looking at a major northern hemispheric cooling (0.5°C or more) by 2017?
What’s interesting is the large corridor of cool Atlantic sea surface that has since formed southwest of the British islands, west of Spain (Fig. 2). Europeans will recall that the continent’s recent weather was dominated by almost non-stop southwesterly winds over the past 2 months. That period of extremely mild weather Europeans have been experiencing was in fact due to that large, uninterrupted flow of warm, southwesterly air coming off the Atlantic. Had the opposite happened, Europe would have been frozen over, just as was the case in 2010.
What happens to tropical warmth up north?
Today we see a powerful storm centered over Iceland that is pumping up yet more warmth – all the way to the North Pole:

Fig. 3: Unusual event: warm tropical air getting transported all the way to the North Pole. Source: here.
That sort of tropics-to-pole movement we see above has been going on over the northeast Atlantic for some 2 months -though not that extreme.
Here’s something to think about, and maybe I can get some feedback on this. What happens to all that thermal surface energy that got swept up from the Atlantic tropics and moved to the high latitudes (in the dead of winter)? Would it not all get rapidly radiated out into space at these very high latitudes?
Wouldn’t that pattern accelerate the surface cooling of the oceans at the mid and lower Atlantic latitudes (e.g. see Fig. 2, west of Spain)? Could this now protracted pattern have made the cooling in the Atlantic even more pronounced and explain in part why the North Atlantic has cooled? If so, what impact will a cool Atlantic in combination with a soon to be widespread cool Pacific have on global temperatures over the next couple of years?
Now throw in the soon-coming low solar activity.
If you are into warming, don’t be surprised if you suddenly find things turning very cool, and soon. The next couple of years will be interesting. My hunch is that Joe Bastardi is on the right track. We’ll soon see!

Last Thursday I visited a group of farmers in Whangarei to hear even more concerns about the Zero Carbon Bill, Firearms reform, and other current or proposed legislation that threaten their livelihoods and are creating much uncertainty and stress.  
Even overseas media is watching and commenting. Whether you believe that man-made climate change is a ‘thing’ or not, you’d have to be concerned by the eye-watering potential costs claimed in [this article](https://nypost.com/2019/12/08/reality-check-drive-for-rapid-net-zero-emissions-a-guaranteed-loser/) from the New York Post, against the infinitesimal difference climate change policies like the Zero Carbon Bill will make.



In these artificial conditions, if New Zealand meets its promise of zero emissions in 2050 and stays at zero for five decades, then the greenhouse-gas reduction, according to the standard estimate from the United Nations’ climate panel, will deliver a temperature cut by 2100 of 0.004 degrees.



 **GREEN, GREEN GRASS OF HOME**



Farming in New Zealand, thanks to our climate and rainfall that produce the beautiful green pastures for which our country is known world-wide, is already the most environmentally sustainable in the world. This should be the main selling point for our export markets.  
Current and proposed policies for the allocation of carbon credits do not take into account on-farm forest plantations nor covenanted bush that existed before 1990, nor pasture. Why on earth not? There is still more science to be done on the ability of soil and pasture to sequester carbon, but it may well be found that farming grass fed beef and lamb is actually a net carbon sink. We could be selling our product around the world with that as a major drawcard. Instead, we are hearing of UK consumers steering away from NZ meat products because they believe them to be contributing to climate change.



The NZ government owes it to our biggest export earners to complete the exercise of measuring these factors before imposing restrictions on stock numbers or issuing penalties, either of which will force farmers to sell up to forestry interests as their farms become uneconomical. Not only will those forestry interests be given subsidies to plant trees, forestry will never bring in the same returns as sheep and beef, hence the huge cost to our economy.



Why else are farmers so concerned? Perverse incentives and unintended consequences are well explained in [this piece](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=12279611) from a King Country farmer.



(My source for both the above links was the [50 Shades of Green Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/50shadesofgreen.nz) page.)



 **THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY**



Here in the ACT Party office, we’re not sure whether to be annoyed our policies are being copied, or just pleased that National is making the right sounds again about RMA reform, and agrees with us on congestion charging.  
Introduced by National in 1991, the Resource Management Act has had a very chequered career. As a brake on economic growth, few pieces of legislation have been so effective. The red tape jungle created by the RMA means the cost of developing land and building houses has gotten completely out of hand. It’s no longer an influence over the cost of building or renovating a house, it’s the principal determinant.



Neither of the two major parties has asked why the RMA needs to exist at all. That was until Monday, when we were told National has finally decided to do something, with Judith Collins saying her party will repeal the RMA. Then it’ll introduce a piece of transitional legislation to cover up the hole. As an aside, why do National and Labour adopt these temporary approaches, rather than get such an important law right first time? Then the Nats will split up the building planning and environmental aspects of the current act (I smell the arrival of more bureaucrats) and – finally – implement a ‘developer-friendly’ solution. No mention of a house-buyer friendly solution.



Can we believe this is all going to happen? Quoting _[Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118223167/national-promises-to-repeal-and-replace-rma)_ :



National campaigned in 2008 on reforming the RMA, with Nick Smith saying at the time “New Zealand will not achieve the ambitious goals John Key has for our country if we do not have the courage to reform the Resource Management Act.”



National did nothing of substance to the RMA over its nine year term under John Key. Collins said National couldn’t get its partners to accept the need for change – pardon? ACT constantly pushed National to make the necessary changes. Our [press release ](https://www.act.org.nz/act_welcomes_national_s_acknowledgement_of_the_housing_crisis?utm_campaign=beth_ad_lib_54&utm_medium=email&utm_source=actnz)yesterday gave this reminder:



National and ACT had a majority in 2008, but, despite pressure from ACT, National wouldn’t budge. The Nats refused to discuss the RMA in coalition negotiations in 2014. We still have the emails. In 2017, ACT and United Future offered to help Nick Smith cut planning red tape, but in the end he did a disastrous deal with the M?ori Party which included iwi co-governance arrangements.



This ‘new’ policy of National’s joins a growing list policy of positions that prove ACT has been right all along.



The other, also announced just yesterday, was [congestion charging](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/405588/national-proposes-to-scrap-auckland-s-regional-fuel-tax-start-congestion-charge). This is no different to [our policy ](https://www.act.org.nz/policies?utm_campaign=beth_ad_lib_54&utm_medium=email&utm_source=actnz#freedomToMove)that has been in place since 2017.



 **LET’S DO THIS**



The only way to be sure National will do either of these things, is to have more ACT MPs to hold them to it.



 **FREEDOM TO TAKE RISKS**



Of all National’s big announcements yesterday, [this one](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/national-party-wants-impose-fines-cyclists-refuse-use-cycleways) seems a little offside. They want cyclists to be fined for not using cycle lanes where they are available.



One has to wonder how big a problem this even is, and if cyclists aren’t using the cycle lanes, has anyone asked them why? Perhaps they’re poorly designed, or poorly maintained, or not kept free of obstacles. A cyclist is naturally going to ride where they think it’s most safe for the speed they want to travel. And did they ask the Police if this was something they wanted to enforce? Surely we all have bigger priorities. This seems overly interventionist. The Cycling Action Network agrees:



“Say if you don’t use the carpool lane and you’ve got three people in your car, do you think National wants to fine you for that? If you get on the bus and don’t say ‘thank you, driver’, are we going to be fining people for that?”.



One of the arguments I often hear for insisting cyclists use these lanes, and wear helmets, is that if they have an accident and hurt themselves or anyone else, we are all paying for them through ACC. If it was possible to opt-out of ACC and take private insurance instead:



1\. Those of us who choose to do so will no longer feel that we are funding the consequences of other people’s choices; and  
2\. Participants in risky activities can negotiate with their insurer to cover them in the event of an accident.



Ad Lib will take a break now until later in January. If you’re stuck in holiday traffic this summer, imagine how congestion charging might have eased it, and remember, if you’re in traffic, you are the traffic! Turn up the music, wind down the windows, and enjoy the scenery. Have a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

In recent history no European nation has demonstrated greater military prowess then Germany. That competence had tragic consequences in World War II and colors Berlin’s approach to the world today. However, more than seven decades after that horrendous conflict’s end Germany should take on the defense responsibilities appropriate for a significant power.



For years American officials have urged, asked, and even begged the Europeans to spend more on their militaries. Six years ago Defense Secretary Bill Gates argued: “The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress, and in the American body politic writ large, to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources.” But Europe’s governments consistently refused, even during the Cold War when facing what Ronald Reagan called the “Evil Empire.” Like the domestic welfare cheats of political lore, they consistently preferred dependency to work.



In fact, the Europeans long have been _reducing_ military expenditures. Only four of the European members currently spend at least two percent of GDP on the military, NATO’s admittedly arbitrary standard. They include just one of the three Baltic nations which profess to be so concerned about potential Russian aggression. Only one of the largest states with the most proficient militaries, the United Kingdom, hits the mark, and only through statistical legerdemain. An independent analysis concluded that despite claims to the contrary, Poland, too, fell short, despite claims to the contrary, leaving only Estonia and Greece at two percent or above.





Unless the majority of NATO’s European members consistently spend a lot more on the military, an alliance showdown has only been deferred.



France lags as well. But Germany, further east and most closely connected to the nations bordering Russia, does even worse. Last year Berlin devoted 1.19 percent of GDP to the military. Either Germans are cheap‐​riding or believe they face no serious security threat. In either case, Americans shouldn’t be expected to subsidize Germany’s defense.



In fact, President Donald Trump and his officials have been pressing the issue. Defense Secretary James Mattis said “America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defense.” The president made much the same pitch: “We strongly support NATO, we only ask that all NATO members make their full and proper financial contribution to the NATO alliance, which many of them have not been doing.” He reinforced that message at the recent NATO summit meeting.



Of course, that’s an unpopular argument to Europeans. They tend to dismiss this as a grubby preoccupation with money. First, if you just look at NATO costs—$2.8 billion in common funding, for instance—the Europeans argue that they look better. Of that amount, Washington provides just 22 percent, followed by Germany at 15 percent. But common funding is not force structure. NATO only has manpower and weapons to the extent that its members have manpower and weapons. Which means mostly the U.S.



Second, contend the Europeans, the relationship should be about trust and solidarity. Thus speak advocates of nations that deny trust and solidarity with the country they expect to defend their own. Cynics might point out how such an attitude is more than a little convenient. Why don’t the Europeans show trust and solidarity and promote America’s security?



The position of Germany is of particular note. It simultaneously bears the greatest historical responsibility for Europe’s current make‐​up, possesses the most abundant resources available to protect the continent, and has the most at stake in today’s European order. Berlin has spent the last seven decades atoning for its past. If Germany will not step up militarily, then who will? And if no one will, why should the U.S. continue to fill the gap?



A large German increase is necessary for Europe to come anywhere close to the extra $100 billion sought from the continent. Some countries, such as Italy, continue to retrench, while others which are spending more are minor contributors. Noted Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO staffer at Rasmussen Global, “Now more than ever, $100 billion is a long shot. Other important European players—such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands—are either too small or too economically weak to have much of an effect on the European defense budget. In this scenario, Germany’s $30 billion could make all the difference between a stronger Europe or a weaker one.”



Secretary Mattis apparently worried after his first meeting with German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen that the administration’s message was not clear. Noted _Der Spiegel’s_ Konstantin von Hammerstein and Peter Mueller: “Mattis had opted for a polite formulation, saying diplomatically that there was a certain amount of ‘impatience’ in Washington regarding the German contribution to the Western alliance. In other words: It’s time to finally pay your share or things will get uncomfortable! It seemed as though von der Leyen had been lulled into complacency by the friendly atmosphere and hadn’t recognized the urgency of Mattis’ message.”



However, it now appears that the Trump administration has achieved what none of its predecessors could—win a commitment from Berlin to meet the NATO two percent standard. Although German officials deny responding to Trump, the timing looks more than a little coincidental.



Chancellor Angela Merkel told a recent campaign rally: “Obligations have to be fulfilled and others in the world will demand that of us, and I think they’re right that Germany must fulfill its obligations too.” She earlier told a party organization: “In the 21st Century, we won’t be getting as much help as we got in the 20th. We need to greatly increase the Bundeswehr budget to get from 1.2 to two percent.”



Von der Leyen also has been pressing her government to do more. She admitted that other NATO members saw Germany was “doing so well economically” and described Washington’s demands for greater burden‐​sharing as “fair.” At the recent Munich Security Conference she admitted “yes, we know that we must bear a larger, fairer, share of the burden for trans‐​Atlantic security.” And she announced: “We Germans want to accept this challenge, and we want to accept it as Europeans.”



The Bundeswehr is planning to add 20,000 personnel by 2024 and take a more active role in NATO operations, such as deploying 450 troops in Lithuania. Moreover, Berlin recently inked agreements with France and the Netherlands to create joint fleets of transport and tanker planes, respectively. In January von der Leyen unveiled a $135 billion procurement program through 2030. She said: “I am sure that this will find attention and recognition in Washington.”



However, Trump administration officials are likely more interested to see if Germany follows through with the Merkel government’s plans. Reaching two percent requires Germany to almost double its present outlays. Von der Leyen stated the obvious: “We’re moving in the right direction, but we can’t do it in one year.” Alas, it isn’t obvious that Germany can do it in seven years either.



Recent annual increases have been modest. Last year the rate was two percent, and in 2015 just 1.2 percent. The previous two years German military outlays shrank in real terms. This year is supposed to be a more impressive 6.8 percent, but that still will barely nudge German outlays to 1.22 percent of GDP. And observers doubt Berlin will sustain similar increases in the future.



Despite its past vaunted military experience, Germany faces many problems. The International Institute for Strategic Studies observed that “the Bundeswehr is already struggling with recruitment and retention” and the “German armed forces are struggling to improve their readiness levels in light of increasing demands on NATO’s eastern flank.” Moreover, “the budget cuts of previous years have led to a shortage of spare parts and maintenance problems.”



Despite Berlin’s assurances, many of Germany’s neighbors are skeptical. Explained Fabrice Pothier: “The Bundeswehr is underperforming and has a limited ability to deploy its own troops or those of its allies. Germany is one of the world’s leading defense manufacturers and exporters, but too much of its defense budget is apportioned to personnel spending. No wonder, then, that German pledges to increase spending are usually met in Paris with an ironic shrug that it will only serve to make German officer pensions more attractive.”



Moreover, the fall elections might upend Germany’s pledge. Germany long has emphasized balanced budgets and resisted an active military role. Polls of public opinion are conflicting. In late 2015 the public favored expanding defense outlays by 56 to 30 percent. But in December another poll found two thirds of Germans opposed to spending more on the military.



When Merkel advocated increasing military outlays even she felt constrained to add that “the matters of development and crisis prevention are also important.” In fact, the government is divided, with control of the Foreign Ministry and other positions in the hands of the Social Democratic Party, the junior member of the “grand coalition.” The SPD already has blocked some of Merkel’s defense initiatives, such as increased military sales to Saudi Arabia. Last June Sigmar Gabriel, SPD chairman, complained: “We’ve fallen back into a kind of logic I know from my youth, in which the only question being discussed is who has to spend more money to procure arms.” Other SPD officials have spoken of “NATO saber rattling.”



At the Munich Security Conference earlier this year Gabriel, now also foreign minister and vice‐​chancellor, doubted the wisdom of going along with U.S. pressure, though he believed Berlin would have to spend more. Gabriel opined: “One has to ask whether it would really calm Germany’s neighbors if we turned into a big military power in Europe and … spent over 60 billion euros [roughly $63 billion] a year” on the military. He suggested that outlays for refugees was a preventative measure and should count as equivalent. An overemphasis on the military, he warned, “will not allow us to fight climate change, drought or poverty.” Indeed, “military intervention also taps funding that could be better spent in combatting hunger and misery.”



As for Chancellor Merkel’s promise to reach the two percent level by 2024, he tartly observed: “I don’t know where this money should come from.” Similarly, SPD Vice chairman Ralf Stegner said “Tanks instead of social security is a completely false debate.” The SPD’s parliamentary whip, Thomas Oppermann argued that “We should not make the mistake and trigger off a new arms race.” The SPD defense policy spokesman, Rainer Arnold, said simply that the two percent objective is “unrealistic.”



The betting is that attention on American demands will benefit the SPD in the upcoming election. While anti‐​Americanism is not likely to play as well as it did in 2002 when Gerhard Schroeder essentially ran against the Bush administration and its myopic plan for war in Iraq, opposition to both increased military spending and compliance with U.S. demands could energize SPD voters. Merkel’s party has responded by promising to maintain social outlays, but has not yet answered Gabriel’s question about the source of the extra money for defense.



In fact, the most fundamental problem may be that many Germans perceive no threats to warrant more “defense” outlays. They aren’t consciously cheap‐​riding. They simply aren’t worried.



Merkel argued: “We have to spend more for our external security. The conflicts of this world are currently on Europe’s doorstep, massively so.” However, a bigger military doesn’t look like the answer to Germans’ greatest security concerns: refugee flows and terrorist attacks. And no one has suggested intervening in Syria’s civil war—that is routinely seen as America’s job.



As for Russia, few Germans appear to believe its brutish behavior toward Georgia and Ukraine portends an attack on Poland, let alone Germany. For all of the fretting in the Baltics and tut‐​tutting elsewhere in Europe and America about Moscow’s actions, no one has provided any evidence that Vladimir Putin is mad enough to try to conquer Europe. What would Russia gain by triggering a potential nuclear war while attempting to swallow the continent backed by the U.S.? What evidence is there that the cynical authoritarian ruling in Moscow has morphed into a Slavic Adolf Hitler?



Berlin’s commitment to a substantial military build‐​up almost certainly will flag well before it reaches the two percent level. Which would result in renewed pressure from Washington. And a potential bilateral confrontation.



Administration officials see Germany as key. Wrote Hammerstein and Mueller: “It is increasingly clear that things could soon become uncomfortable for Berlin. The Pentagon sees Germany as the most important country in Europe, the one that sets the tone on the Continent. If the Germans don’t pay their share, U.S. defense officials believe, smaller European countries will follow suit, essentially hiding behind Berlin’s coat tail. The pressure from Washington, in other words, is only going to grow in intensity.”



And if Germany resists Secretary Mattis will be forced to confront his own red line: does he support America reducing its commitment to alliance with those unwilling to do substantially more to protect themselves? Unless the majority of NATO’s European members consistently spend a lot more on the military, an alliance showdown has only been deferred.

"**Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has written a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, asking him to put a ban on Islamophobic content.**
In a letter, Mr Khan said ""growing Islamophobia"" was encouraging ""hate, extremism and violence... especially through the use of social media"".
It comes a day after Mr Khan accused French President Emmanuel Macron of ""attacking Islam"".
Facebook already has a policy of removing hate speech on its platforms.
It defines hate speech as ""a direct attack on people"" based on protected characteristics including race, ethnicity, national origin and religious affiliation, through ""violent or dehumanising speech"" or ""harmful stereotypes"".
In a letter which he published on Twitter, Mr Khan referred to a recent decision by Facebook to ban any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust.
He called for a similar policy to be put in place for anti-Islam comments.
""Given the rampant abuse and vilification of Muslims on social media platforms, I would ask you to place a similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for Facebook that you have put in place for the Holocaust,"" he said.
""The message of hate must be banned in total - one cannot send a message that while hate messages against some are unacceptable, these are acceptable against others.""
On Sunday, Mr Khan accused the French president of ""attacking Islam"".
His comments came after Mr Macron paid tribute to a French history teacher who was murdered after he showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class.
Mr Macron said the teacher ""was killed because Islamists want our future"", but France would ""not give up our cartoons"".
In a tweet, Mr Khan responded: ""It is unfortunate that [Mr Macron] has chosen to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists who carry out violence.""
Mr Khan, who is currently under pressure from a coalition of opposition parties, has been known to court the religious vote to strengthen his base.
Shops in several Middle Eastern countries have also boycotted French goods in protests at Mr Macron's defence of the right to show cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are offensive to Muslims.
However, state secularism is central to France's national identity, and the state argues freedom of expression should not be curbed to protect the feelings of one particular community.
France's foreign ministry called the calls for boycott ""baseless"", adding that they should ""stop immediately"".
This is not the first time Pakistan has asked Facebook to help investigate content on its site.
In 2017, Mr Khan's predecessor Nawaz Sharif called on the social media giant to investigate ""blasphemous content""- it is unclear what exactly this might have been, but in the past, blasphemy accusations ranged from depictions of the Prophet Muhammad to inappropriate references to the Koran.
But critics said then that blasphemy laws, which allow the death penalty in some cases, are often misused to oppress minorities."
"The drama and somewhat unintentional humour of first one and eventually three ships getting caught in heavy sea ice in the Southern Ocean has been closely followed since before Christmas. The images of the ship Akademik Shokalskiy held captive in the thick Antarctic icepack caught the attention of people around the world, if not always for the right reasons.  Photos of the Schokalskiy bear little resemblance to Frank Hurley’s images of the Endurance – the wooden ship of Shackleton’s famous expedition of 1914-17 – that was trapped and shattered in similar pack ice. Yet they raise the same question: why would anyone willingly travel to this barren, cold and dangerous landscape? For the Schokalskiy voyagers, it was an opportunity to follow the route of another historical expedition, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Douglas Mawson. Both expeditions are examples of human courage and persistence in the face of incredible risks. Shackleton and crew travelled over 800 nautical miles of open water in a small lifeboat and then hiked another 50km over difficult terrain. Mawson completed an incredible 150km solo trek across wind-blasted Wilkes Land. But these expeditions are exceptional; most scientific and tourism-based Antarctic trips are incident free. In December 2012 I was fortunate enough to participate in the Geological Society of America’s 125th Anniversary Expedition to Antarctica, lead by Cheesman’s Safaris. This was not a scientific expedition per se but nor was it just a cruise – more a destination field trip with an emphasis on both local and regional geology. We sailed aboard the Akademic Ioffee, the slightly younger sister ship to the Schokalskiy. We departed on December 29 from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands, and followed sections of Shackleton’s route in a fashion similar to the Schokalskiy retracing Mawson’s path. Many Russian oceanographic vessels built during the Cold War were converted into tourist friendly ships with dorm-style cabins, cinemas, lecture rooms, libraries, dining halls and – in our case – a hot tub and sauna on the upper deck. These amenities meant we were rarely hungry, cold or uncomfortable, other than from sea sickness. Luckily both our crossings of the Drake Passage, the notoriously rough stretch of sea between Cape Horn and the South Shetland Islands, was relatively placid. But to leave the Falklands behind us and crossing the Drake is to officially leave civilisation and enter a foreign environment – even for those of us from northern latitudes accustomed to snow and cold. It wasn’t the cold that made it feel so foreign. The southern hemisphere’s summer provided comfortable walking temperatures ranging from -2°C to 6°C. Rather, it was the variability in light, the clarity of the atmosphere, and the sight of creatures seen only in the pages of National Geographic. Our first landing at Peggotty Bluff on South Georgia Island, where Shackleton also first landed, provided an abrupt introduction to what would greet us for the duration of the trip. As we stepped out of our boats, walking awkwardly wrapped in lifevests, GoreTex, and knee-high rubber boots, we found ourselves faced with territorial fur seals, huge but languid elephant seals bellowing their welcome, and gentoo and king penguins waddling across the shingle. Behind these amazing creatures were white snowfields, sheer black cliffs, and the diffuse blue and green hues of glacial ice. Moving past South Georgia and further south towards the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic peninsula, the icebergs we encountered grew in number and size. At first appearing as small growlers showing signs of recent melting and erosion, those we passed grew steadily larger, becoming blocky, table-top icebergs that looked as if they’d recently calved from an ice shelf – although we knew that wasn’t the case. With increasing icebergs came increasing snow cover, which meant fewer opportunities to examine exposed bedrock and penguins. It was interesting to see how penguin diversity decreased as we approached the peninsula, and that the penguin chicks grew smaller and smaller, until we found on Cuverville Island Gentoo penguins still sat on eggs. Geologically, the field trip focused on the interplay of tectonic plates in the region, as the rocks in this seemingly frozen landscape record an incredibly dynamic history. Dating from the ancient break of Gondwanaland, we found exposures of pillow lava that represented ancient oceanic crust exposed on South Georgia, volcanic creations like Deception Island, and Jurassic fossils exposed on the Antarctic peninsula. We were kept busy reading the story of geologic time recorded in the rocks. Passing through the Gerlach Strait and Neumayer Channel, where sheer ice cliffs and soupy pack ice crowded around the ship, I pondered the fate of the MS Explorer – the cruise ship that sank in 2007 after hitting an iceberg in the Bransfield Strait. I can’t speak for the scientists aboard the Schokalskiy, but I still grapple with the tension between the financial cost and carbon footprint of the journey, and the fact that one year on I am still processing what I saw and experienced. The experiences on this trip weren’t limited to the animals or the rocks; I continue to be surprised by how much I learned about the rich history of whaling, political complexity of the Antarctic Treaty and how tourism crops up up in unexpected ways. The opportunity to explore an extreme and foreboding, but fascinating environment such as Antarctica with minimal risk is why many people choose it as a destination, and why so many go back."

Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister in 2014 after his Bharatiya Janata Party won a strong parliamentary majority. Some Indians saw him as India’s Ronald Reagan, ready to liberate his nation from overweening regulation. Optimists predicted that India soon would have the world’s second largest economy with a middle class population dwarfing those of America and Europe. Once a symbol of international poverty, India would join a more active foreign policy with a larger military and become a true Weltmacht.



More than two years later India remains a country of great potential. India has enjoyed strong economic growth, but that reflects the fall in oil prices as much as domestic factors. Modi’s government has made some important reforms, but so far has left unchallenged many destructive economic policies and political abuses which continue to hobble an entrepreneurial people.



Most recently, New Delhi’s mismanaged currency “reform” has left many Indians without the cash necessary to conduct business. With bank withdrawals still limited, economists fear that the negative impact on growth will persist into the coming year. No wonder Indians joke, noted Sebastian Mallaby of the Council for Foreign Relations, that “India’s prospects look brighter the farther away you are.” Modi should launch a deregulatory blitz before concern for future elections drains away his remaining will to act.



India won its independence from Great Britain in 1947, but the ruling India National Congress Party led the new nation into a different kind of dependency. In the name of self‐​sufficiency, the economy was rule‐​bound and inward‐​looking. The state controlled the economy’s commanding heights and enshrined envy as the governing principle, with a top income tax rate of 97.75 percent. Business was ruled by an officious, incompetent, and corrupt “permit Raj” under which supplicants required cash or connections to prosper. In 2012 India’s bureaucracy still was rated the worst in Asia, an extraordinary mal‐​accomplishment.





Modi is more pro‐​business than pro‐​market, and a social engineer at heart, backing expanded state control in several areas.



In his recent Cato Institute study Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar related how in the 1980s it took the current head of a software company one year to get a phone and three years to win permission to import a computer. With production limits set by the government, he wrote, “India was perhaps the only country in the world where improving productivity (and hence exceeding licensed capacity) was a crime.” From India’s founding to 1983 the poverty ratio remained essentially unchanged, around 60 percent, even as several Asian nations raced into a prosperous future. India even fell behind its neighbor Communist China.



Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao introduced India’s first serious reforms in 1991. The Communist governments of Eastern Europe had been swept away, the Soviet Union was nearing its end, and Third World socialism had been discredited. Although Rao justified his policy as a “middle path,” for India it was revolutionary. Explained the Atlas Institute’s Eric D. Dixon and Tarun Vats: “India began a process of economic reform that has gradually brought freedom, dignity, and prosperity to millions upon millions of individuals. Within a decade, the average income in India had doubled, and nearly 250 million people—about a fifth of the population—have risen out of poverty since then.”



Future progress, however, was halting at best. A succession of weak governments mostly talked about reform, taking at most only modest steps. India’s economic liberty actually peaked in the mid‐​2000s. According to the _Economic Freedom of the World_ report in 2014, the latest year for which numbers are available, India ranked a dismal 112 out of 159 nations rated. It did particularly poorly on trade freedom, credit market regulation, regulation generally, and monetary policy.



Concluded Aiyar, India’s story is of “government failure, of successful economic reform tainted by institutional erosion. Although many old controls have been abolished, many still continue, and a plethora of new controls have been created in areas relating to the environment, health, tribal areas, and land.” This most entrepreneurial people, who have succeeded economically in other nations around the world, continues to be oppressed by their own government. Wrote Dixon and Vats, “People who want to work and build new businesses face an array of obstacles. Hundreds of millions of people in forgotten rural populations struggle to survive in the face of a regulatory regime that doesn’t understand their needs or protect their rights.”



Yet even modest reforms have yielded significant benefits. Observed Aiyar: “What used to be a poor, slow‐​growing country now has the third‐​largest [GDP] in the world with regard to purchasing power parity and is projected to be the fastest‐​growing major economy in the world in 2016.” Even on the more traditional exchange rate GDP measurement this year India passed the United Kingdom to possess the world’s sixth largest economy and the International Monetary Fund predicts that rapid economic growth will continue.



That should provide Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat state who ran on the platform of freeing up business, with a strong foundation for transforming the economy. Yet his performance so far has disappointed those who expected much from his government.



Modi proclaimed that “reforms are happening in a big way” with the simple “aim of enabling the people to realize their potential and dreams.” But obstacles to progress are many. Parliament meets only infrequently, about 60 days a year, which enhances the effectiveness of the opposition’s delaying tactics. The BJP did not win control the Rajya Sabha, or upper chamber, which depends on party control of state governments. The BJP’s enthusiasm for reform took a hit last year when it unexpectedly lost elections in the states of Bihar and Delhi.



Perhaps most important, Modi is no visionary. Mallaby observed: “Having spent a dozen years as chief minister of Gujarat, he seems stuck in the mindset of a provincial executive: he is more interested in projects than in policies; he is a modernizer, not a reformer.” Equally important, Modi is more pro‐​business than pro‐​market, and a social engineer at heart, backing expanded state control in several areas.



For instance, agriculture is highly controlled, and, said Aiyar, “New price controls have been clamped on seeds and even on royalties paid by seed companies to suppliers of technology.” To hold down prices the Modi government targeted “hoarding” and black markets, which actually are symptoms of government failure. New Delhi provided big salary increases to the very public employees who inhibit economic growth.



Moreover, reported The _Telegraph_ (Kolkata) in early 2016: “Over the past year, the Modi government has started to drum up the virtues of creating large state‐​owned assets in a throwback to a Nehruvian era of creating state monopolies in strategic areas.” The opposition Congress Party today actually may be more hostile to public monopolies than is the BJP. What we’ve seen, suggested Aiyar, is that Indian economic policy was not neoliberalism but “neo‐​illiberalism.”



Which reinforces _Times of India_ blogger Gurcharan Das’ claim that “India does well when it bets on its people; it does less well when it bets on its government.” Unfortunately, that continues to be the case under Modi.



The government claims to have eliminated 1159 obsolete laws and regulations, but what that means in practice is hard to assess. Modi’s most obvious achievements are as a minimalist modernizer. For example, the environmental approval process has been streamlined, though decisions still take 190 days (and the reform actually was developed by the previous government). Sanitation and e‐​governance have been improved. The government pressed India’s poor to open bank accounts, though many are unused. A biometric identification system allows distribution of welfare payments with less “leakage.” Central government tax payments to states have been rationalized.



In fact, in assessing the government’s first year in office the _Times of India_ opined that “this government’s biggest achievement has been its success in injecting optimism in the economy.” That may account for the significant, but likely temporary, rise in foreign investment; last year’s increase “would be difficult to replicate,” warned the Asian Development Bank.



Among Modi’s most important changes this year was to eliminate the requirement for minimum capital requirements and government certification to start a business. Amit Chandra of the Centre for Civil Society predicted that this reform would create “a level playing field for all entrepreneurs, big or small.” That will reduce one of the reasons so much of India’s economic activity is informal, where it is vulnerable to prosecution and extortion.



The government also finally won parliamentary approval of a uniform goods and services tax (GST) intended to replace a complicated collection of regional and national levies. Today trucks average 16 percent of their time waiting at state checkpoints where local taxes are collected. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the GST would “facilitate seamless transfer of goods across the country and bring a lot of financial equity,” which some economists predicted could add up to a couple points a year to growth. Participants at the _Economist_ -organized “India Summit 2016” viewed this as one of the most “transformational initiatives” in the country’s recent history.



However, the government is sacrificing simplicity if not uniformity in implementing the reform. Reported the _Economist_ , “the central government, in negotiations with state authorities, has put forward a schedule of seven different GST slabs ranging from 4% for gold to 26% or more for middle‐​class goods, with other goods being taxed at 6%, 12% or 18%, and basic goods remaining exempt.” Moreover, keeping some rates high, warned the magazine, “will threaten the GST’s third big advantage, of bringing business into the formal economy.” Even this diminishing reform isn’t likely to be implemented by the goal of April 2017. The rather disappointing experience, some observers fear, reduces the likelihood of other tax reforms.



Overall, the Modi government’s incomplete reform program has fostered substantial frustration. Mallaby observed simply: “the results have been disappointing.” _Business Standard_ (New Delhi) columnist Shankar Acharya, who began with an optimistic view of Modi, concluded late last year: “Economic reforms have clearly lost momentum and there is a sense of drift in economic policy.” The _Times of India_ complained that “the government hasn’t pressed the pedal hard on reforms” and “implementation of projects” has been slow.



Nevertheless, economic progress is evident as India ascends internationally. New Delhi rose in rankings for “Global Competitiveness” (World Economic Forum), from 71 to 55 to 39 in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. However, in its ease of “Doing Business” (World Bank), India went from 142 in 2015 to 130 in 2016, where it stalled out, remaining at 130 in 2017. (The World Bank reported that little progress was made in starting a business or registering property; access to electricity was much improved, while there had been backsliding in dealing with construction permits.) On the “Corruption Perception Index” (Transparency International) the country went from 85 in 2014 to 75 in 2015; the 2016 rankings have not yet been released.



Modi’s government proudly points to continuing high growth rates. However, many economists believe that estimates have been inflated because of changed methodology. In August Shilan Shah at Capital Economics figured rates were more likely 5.5 to six percent than seven percent.



Moreover, in September the Asian Development Bank warned that growth had been driven by government spending; private investment was “listless” and manufacturing growth was down this year. In fact, economists at the Reserve Bank of India warned that the nation’s growth rate may have peaked as the country relied on an increase in low productivity labor. India’s per capita GDP growth dropped in half between just 2011 and 2014, and is well behind that of China. India still has substantial growth potential, but economic reform is necessary to make it real.



Yet today the country remains convulsed by Modi’s decision to order the elimination of large bills, 86 percent of the nation’s cash, without having replacement currency available. The consequences for this cash‐​based economy have been predictably chaotic, as people lacked money to conduct business, pay household expenses, provide wedding gifts, get medical treatment, and otherwise handle their affairs. In many areas supply chains broke, companies closed, and firms sent employees to stand in bank lines, thereby bringing “the economy to a halt,” as Barun Mitra of the Liberty Institute explained to me. Economist Kenneth Rogoff called the impact “catastrophic.” Yet analysts figure it will be weeks before limits on bank withdrawals are lifted and months before the withdrawn currency is fully replaced.



Kalraj Mishra, Minister for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, dismissed business losses as “nominal and temporary,” and predicted “industrial momentum will be back” as soon as sufficient currency is restored. However, HSBC’s Pranjul Bhandari predicted that the currency debacle would knock as much as a two percent off of growth in the last quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017. Goldman Sachs cut its overall growth estimate for 2017 by 1.5 percent.



Unsurprisingly, while “India Summit 2016” acknowledged New Delhi’s efforts, participants paid much more attention to the many problems that remained unresolved. For instance, reported the event summary, to promote a mobile‐​internet services necessary is “sound regulation that makes payment systems easier, enables improvement sin information and communications technology infrastructure and reduces red tape. Complex land and labor laws will also need an overhaul.”



The latter is critical. Conference participant Suraj Saharan of logistics start‐​up Delhivery, which employs thousands of Indians, complained of “insane laws and regulations.” Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute warned that such restrictions “essentially guarantee mass underemployment and an India that, unlike its neighbors in East Asia, cannot benefit from global demand for manufactured goods.” The requirement that firms with at least 100 employees receive government permission to cut employment causes companies to rely on temporary workers or stay small. Yet the latter denies companies economies of scale.  
  
Alas, the Modi government has done very little in this area. One unnamed BJP official told the _Telegraph_ : “Look, if it’s a conflict between a corporate entity and its workers, we have to be on the side of the workers. We are a political party.” No matter, apparently, what actually _is in the interest of the workers_ , and everyone else. The only reason laborers do as well as they do today is because of the 1991 reforms.



Moreover, observed Aiyar: “With almost no exceptions, the delivery of government services in India is pathetic, from the police and judiciary to education and health. Unsackable government staff members have no accountability to the people they are supposed to serve, and so callousness, corruption, and waste are common.” On most every reformer’s wish list is modernizing the sclerotic legal system, with a backlog of _31.5 million_ cases, some of which take decades to resolve. Education reform is desperately needed: half of government schools teach little since rampant teacher absenteeism discourages student attendance.



Public‐​sector banks possess 70 percent of total assets, but nearly a fifth of their loans are “stressed.” Much more needs to be done to restructure the debt and revamp the entire sector. Explained Mallaby: “Rather than pulling the plug on deadbeat borrowers, banks are drip‐​feeding them with new loans to cover up the fact that the bankers blundered in lending to them.” Sustaining such economic zombies, which mimics Chinese policy, prevents potentially successful firms from getting capital.



Politicians keep electricity prices low. Public power companies lose millions of dollars daily while failing to provide service to a fifth of India’s households. Half of manufacturers suffer significant power cuts weekly. Said Archarya: “The electric power sector continues to be crippled by the massive losses and outstanding dues of state electricity boards.” The heavily used transportation network is inadequate and poorly maintained. Disproportionate reliance on roads results in higher logistical costs than in countries such as neighboring China. The Modi government has made progress in both areas, but much more needs to be done.



Overall the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy figured that subsidies run an incredible 13.4 percent of GDP. The benefits include, in Aiyar’s words, “a bewildering variety of freebies given by various state governments,” and many go to the wealthy. Modi said he plans to rationalize and target subsidies rather than end them, yet Acharya noted “little progress.”



Privatization has lagged. Economist Mohan Guruswamy of the Center for Policy Alternatives complained: “No one wants to take hard decisions because they’re worried about winning elections.” Even after Modi’s triumph, he explained, “The notion of liberal economics has never sunk in in India. There is still a distrust of private capital and foreign capital, and a consensus on state control of industries that cuts across parties. People still want a lifetime of employment, a lifetime of assured income.”



The _Los Angeles Times_ reported on government‐​owned Hindustan Photo Films, which no longer produces anything but has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years taking out loans to pay its staff. More than a decade ago the central government decided to close the obsolescent film‐​maker, but the company lives on. Reported the _Times_ : “Even today, as India becomes the fastest‐​growing major economy, the public sector still dominates major industries such as oil and mining, and the number of state‐​owned enterprises has risen by 70% since 1990.”



Corruption remains a serious problem. However, Modi responded in November by withdrawing most of India’s money. Cash deposited in banks that had not been previously accounted for is subject to a 50 to 85 percent confiscation rate. Complained Barun Mitra, the move was “the single biggest assault on private bank accounts, on the presumption that everyone is corrupt unless they can prove their innocence.”



Yet the cause of corruption is not cash. Rather, Dixon and Vats noted that the “informal status” of businesses “has often made them subject to vast public‐​sector corruption, bribe solicitations, raids, confiscations, and evictions.” Modi should have concentrated on deregulation and legalization of the gray, or informal, economy, which employs an incredible 90 percent of India’s workforce. Aiyar pointed out that “areas that were comprehensively liberalized [in the past] saw the disappearance of corruption.” The other problem, noted _Reason_ magazine’s Shikha Dalmia, is that tax rates “are way higher than what people think their government is worth” and Modi has yet to remedy that imbalance.



The prime minister still has time to act, but more state elections approach and the national poll must be held by 2019. As the latter nears he is even less likely to make major changes, sacrificing his nation’s great potential. Acharya worried: “economic reforms seem to be on the slow train, while good old fiscal populism is alive and flourishing. Against the background of a slowing world economy and slumping exports, this does not bode well for India’s economic growth and job‐​creation.”



Unfortunately, the economy is not the only issue requiring Modi’s attention. Hindu nationalism has expressed itself more violently after the BJP’s triumph. Most recent have been mob attacks on Muslims, including some allegedly involved in transporting or eating beef. Christians, a much smaller religious minority, also routinely suffer violence at the hands of Hindu radicals. Observed the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom: “Despite the country’s status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, India has long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occur, which perpetuates a climate of impunity.”



Although the Modi government has not directly encouraged such outbursts, in last year’s Bihar election the BJP pandered to religion and caste. Moreover, Modi was implicated in anti‐​Muslim riots when chief minister of Gujarat and as premier has said little about sectarian violence against India’s most vulnerable populations. Such attacks hurt all Indians by discouraging foreign investment, offending the concerned and scaring the nervous.



Perhaps Modi’s greatest success has come internationally. He appears to prefer the global stage to the grubby battle for domestic reform. Nevertheless, a more prosperous economy would improve India’s international standing. Better relations with China and Pakistan could help reduce commercial barriers in a region which lags in economic integration. And the incoming Trump administration, which appears set on confrontation with Beijing, may welcome closer ties with India. Increased trade and investment would benefit both nations. The _Washington Post_ observed that “Two decades of India’s information‐​technology success and the large pool of English‐​speaking engineers have created a fertile ground for e‐​commerce companies and innovative tech start‐​ups. The number of angel investors and venture capital funds is mushrooming.”



India is poised at the cusp of international greatness. But this entrepreneurial people continue to be hampered by enervating regulations and bureaucracies. If Modi wants to secure his legacy and, more important, liberate his people, he should implement decisive and far‐​reaching reforms. Argued Aiyar, “to become a high‐​income country, India must liberalize the economy much further, improve governance, and raise the quality of its institutions.” This means choosing tough solutions over tempting panaceas. Parth Shah of the Centre for Civil Society listed some of the choices for me: free markets versus “pro‐​business cronyism,” institutional reform versus government plans, and liberty versus “imposed discipline/​moral purity.”



Some Indian officials act like their nation’s success, which includes surpassing China’s economic growth and becoming a global power, is guaranteed by manifest destiny. However, warned Alok Sheel, an economic adviser to the Indian state of Kerala, “unless India successfully introduces productivity reforms and opens its markets, this ‘destiny’ will remain a pipe dream.”



The 21st Century could be the Indian Century, rather than another American Century or the Chinese Century. But India’s ascendance requires courageous political reforms by the Modi government now, not by some hypothetical reform administration years or decades in the future. To miss the opportunity today may be to miss much more for years to come.

[**Dr Muriel Newman**](https://www.nzcpr.com/author/mn/)  
[nzcpr.com](https://www.nzcpr.com/the-dark-age-of-political-intrusion/)



The medieval Dark Ages refers to the thousand year period in history between the fall of the Roman Empire around 500 AD and the beginning of the Renaissance in 1500 AD. It was a time of feudalism and the Crusades, when society turned its back on science and reason. Superstition ruled. 



A question that is increasingly being asked these days is whether we are now heading into another ‘Dark Age’, where common sense and rational thinking are again being replaced by fanaticism and superstition.



The symptoms of such a retreat from reason are all around.



Universities, founded on the principles of academic freedom, are now muzzling academics who challenge the view of radicals.



The Labour Government’s newly appointed Chief Justice is instructing the Judiciary – the upholder of the Rule of Law which ensures that all citizens are treated as equals – to embrace Maori ‘tikanga’ and embed race-based privilege and spirituality into our judicial system. 



A new National Research Charter – being developed by the Royal Society of New Zealand – could force all publicly funded research undertaken in this country to abide by the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, which themselves are not defined.  
  
Cultural competency ‘training’ is being widely used to indoctrinate the State sector with an agenda that promotes Maori privilege. But that is not enough for the Medical Council, which has recently issued a new [directive](https://www.mcnz.org.nz/our-standards/current-standards/cultural-safety/) requiring all doctors to meet ‘cultural safety’ standards as well.



Feminists are relentlessly promoting an anti-male campaign under the guise of ‘gender equality’, to the point where merit counts for nothing and older men are villainised and told to “move on” by the likes of the Green Party Minister for Women [Julie Anne Genter.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/the-destructive-religion-of-julie-anne-genter/)



Colonisation is being [reinvented as oppression,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/exchanging-new-zealand-history-for-a-cultural-briefing/) instead of liberation from a culture based on utu, cannibalism, and slavery, with those who speak out against race-based laws now branded as white racist supremacists.



Freedom of expression is under threat from the proposed criminalisation of ‘disharmonious speech’ and [‘hate speech’](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/labour-to-toughen-hate-speech-laws/).



The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples undermines national sovereignty through the introduction of the right to self-determination and separate self-rule. 



The [UN Global Migration Compact](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/non-binding-pact-legally-binding-after-all/) threatens national security by legitimising illegal migration. 



The UN Paris Agreement claims to be reducing man-made global warming to save the planet, but the overarching intent is to control free-market economies and redistribute wealth.



Furthermore, the climate change agenda has now been captured by an anti-establishment movement that is tapping into the emotions and fears of young people in particular. The new poster child of this global cult is Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager with Asperger’s Syndrome. She has now [revealed](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/climate-strikes-un-conference-madrid-by-greta-thunberg-et-al-2019-11) the agenda has a greater political motive: “The climate crisis is not just about the environment. It is a crisis of human rights, of justice, and of political will. Colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression have created and fuelled it. We need to dismantle them all.”



The concern is that Kiwis are too complacent and so are largely blind to the more sinister agendas driving many of these changes. Unlike the yellow vest movement in France or the freedom fighters in Hong Kong, new restrictions are being introduced with barely a murmur of protest. 



**So how is it that New Zealand society can be so quickly undermined and fractured, without civil upheaval?**



Surprisingly, the answer lies largely with social media.



Before social networking sites were established, the mainstream media was the gatekeeper for news. As the Fourth Estate – the fourth pillar of our Democracy alongside Parliament, the Executive, and the Judiciary – the mainstream media not only held the government to account, but they largely filtered out information that was deceptive or irrational. In general, they upheld their responsibility to present balanced arguments and the truth. 



But the rise of social media changed the landscape by enabling people to more easily channel their own information and share it directly through their networks.



Initially, the media ignored the intrusion, but as social media became more influential, they embraced it as a resource to try to halt their decline. It’s now reached the ridiculous stage where any social media story has the potential to become mainstream media’s headline news. Sound journalism and its associated costs, has been replaced with social media trivia. Much worse is the more recent development where mainstream media have become cheerleaders for [popularist campaigns](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/stuff-disgracefully-implies-that-disagreement-equals-mental-illness/) and refuse to publish contrary opinions.



Traditionally, the mainstream media challenged politicians or others who had chosen to become public figures. But nowadays anyone speaking out on social media is a target, especially if their opinions are not politically correct. They risk being personally attacked to destroy their credibility, and silence their views.



A recent [illustration](https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/national/air-nz-praised-for-speaking-m%C4%81ori-to-racist-woman/ar-BBXr7E5?li=BBqdg4K&ocid=iehp&fbclid=IwAR07y3rcUNiTnqBiNCGhpZkddAJcjEmPvyi6htG73XkDZwRPjKQzPeV-9-0) involves a lady who responded to an Air New Zealand social media message that began with “Kia ora” by politely pointing out she was not Maori: “Hello (I’m not Maori)…” 



Instead of replying in English, the Air New Zealand employee responded with a more complex Maori language expression.



The lady replied “I’m still not Maori. What’s the English translation of that?”



In response, Air New Zealand sent her a link to the on-line Maori dictionary.



At that stage the social media attackers weighed in, calling her a racist, and congratulating Air New Zealand for continuing to use Maori. Mainstream media then reported the story, adding to it by searching through her Facebook account to highlight anything else that was politically incorrect. 



This situation where propaganda now masquerades as news, and free speech is being suppressed is contributing to a more general malaise that is affecting society as the State becomes more pervasive and people feel increasingly powerless to change or improve their lives.



 _To be continued:_ Part two will publish 10.30 am this morning.

"More extreme heat, less frost and snow, and trees coming into leaf earlier are among the signs seen in 2019 that the climate crisis is exerting an increasing impact on the UK, the Met Office’s annual climate report shows. The year was 1.1C above the 1961-1990 average and the all-time high temperature record was broken in July when Cambridge hit 38.7C. The record-high for winter was also broken, with 21.2C in February at Kew Gardens in London.  Weather conditions are the result of the warming trend driven by global heating and natural variability. Last year was the 12th warmest year on records dating back to 1884 and one of the least snowy years on record. It was also the sixth consecutive year with fewer frosts than average. The last decade has seen 16% fewer days of air and ground frost compared with 1961–1990. “Our report shows climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK’s climate,” said Mike Kendon, lead author of the Met Office report. “Since 2002 we have seen the warmest 10 years in the series. By contrast, to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963 – over 50 years ago.” The Central England Temperature Series is the longest instrumental record in the world, stretching back to 1659. It shows the average temperature this century so far is 10.3C, which is 1.6C higher than the period 1659-1700. “Seeing these temperature records go down like sweaty skittles is a stark reminder that climate change is still tightening its grip on all our futures,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “No corner of the UK is immune to the impacts of climate change.” In June, research showed the likelihood of the UK experiencing deadly 40C temperatures for the first time is “rapidly accelerating” because of the climate emergency. Another analysis, from Public Health England showed the summer heatwaves of 2019 resulted in almost 900 extra deaths. A wide range of business, economics, health and environmental groups are urging governments including the UK to implement a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Gareth Redmond King, at WWF, said: “The whole world has to act ahead of next year’s UN climate conference and as hosts we must urgently raise our ambition to show global leadership.” The Met Office report also found rainfall in the UK in 2019 was 12% above the 1961-1990 average. Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre, said: “It was a particularly wet year across parts of central and northern England [with] some very severe flooding in early November. “Since 2009 the UK has now had its wettest February, April, June, November and December on record – five out of the 12 months,” he said. Warmer air can hold more water vapour and therefore produce more intense rainfall. Dr Darren Moorcroft, at the Woodland Trust, said: “In response to the warm winter and mild spring, the first leaves appeared on trees nearly 10 days earlier in 2019, compared to our baseline period [of 1999-2018]. Whilst this may not sound like much, research has shown this can have dire impacts further down the food chain.” Moorcroft added: “It is a stark reminder of the need to take immediate action on climate change. Trees are not only a measure of what’s happening, they’re a vital part of the solution: as natural carbon stores they’re key agents in fighting climate change.” The sea-level section of the report was contributed by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and showed levels continuing to rise due to increasing melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, mountain glaciers, and the warming of the ocean. The NOC director, Prof Edward Hill, said: “An immediate consequence will be higher extreme sealevels [during high tides and storms], which cause flooding and threaten lives, property and key infrastructure.” But he warned: “Only one of the long-term tide gauge sites is producing data of sufficient quality. High-frequency, high-accuracy, coastal sea-level monitoring is essential.”"

Congress rejected the Forest Service plan to give the agency access to up to $2.9 billion a year to suppress wildfires. In response, Secretary of Agriculture threatened to let fires burn up the West unless Congress gives his department more money. In a letter to key members of Congress, Vilsack warned, “I will not authorize transfers from restoration and resilience funding” to suppress fires. If the Forest Service runs out of appropriated funds to fight fires, it will stop fighting them until Congress appropriates additional funds.   
  
This is a stunning example of brinksmanship on the part of an agency once known for its easygoing nature. Since about 1990, Congress has given the Forest Service the average of its previous ten years of fire suppression funds. If the agency has to spend more than that amount during a severe fire year, Congress authorized it to borrow funds from its other programs, with the promise that Congress would reimburse those funds later. In other words, during severe fire years, some projects might be delayed for a year–hardly a crisis.   
  
Yet Vilsack and the Forest Service are intent on turning it into a crisis. In a report prominently posted on the Forest Service’s web site, the agency whines about “the rising costs of wildfire operations”–that cost not being the dollar cost but the “effects on the Forest Service’s non-fire work.”   




Numerous graphs in the report show declines in inflation-adjusted funding for various line items–but, deceptively, none of the graphs have the Y-axis set to zero, thus exaggerating those declines. Moreover, many of those line items are ridiculous anyway: who cares of land-management planning budgets have declined? The Supreme Court decided in 1998 that land-management planning was a waste of time, so why are they still spending any money at all on it? In any case, most of the items tracked by the charts aren’t programs the Forest Service borrows against for fire, so creating the proposed $2.9 billion emergency fund would do nothing to stop the funding declines.   
  
The question Vilsack should ask is not “Why won’t Congress give his agency a blank check?” but “Why does the Forest Service spend so much on fire anyway?” The answer to that question is complex but comes down to one simple thing: the Forest Service has no incentive to control costs as long as Congress keeps reimbursing them.   
  
As wildfire historian Stephen Pyne wrote in 1995, Forest Service fire managers have long been known for “creative accounting,” transferring “as many costs as possible” to the emergency fire funds. One of these is the “presuppression fund” that becomes available when fire danger is high; the other is the suppression fund that becomes available when a fire isn’t controlled by the first responders. When either of these conditions takes place, Pyne notes, “everything imaginable is charged to fires.” This situation has only gotten worse in the last two decades.   
  
So it’s not surprising that many Forest-Service-fed news articles have reported that 2015 was the costliest fire year ever, citing Forest Service costs of $1.7 billion. But none of the articles mention costs to the Department of the Interior, and while I can’t find that number anywhere, I suspect it was not a lot more than half a billion dollars, as the most it has ever spent in the past was around $470 million.   
  
The reason why this is important is that most fires this year were on Interior lands, not national forests. The Forest Service and its parent, the Department of Agriculture point to the near-record number of acres burned in 2015, about 9.8 million. But less than 20 percent of those acres were on national forest lands, while 54 percent were on Interior lands.   




As the table above shows, the Forest Service habitually spends more than five times as much as the Department of the Interior per acre burned on their respective lands. Unlike the Forest Service, Interior agencies have never had a blank check for suppressing fire, so they have had little incentive to wildly overspend.   
  
Worse, Congress’ policy of giving the Forest Service the average of its previous ten years’ of fire suppression costs gives the agency an incentive to spend more each year so that its ten-year average spirals upwards. Meanwhile, in mild fire years, Congress says that the appropriated fire suppression funds that the agency doesn’t need “may be transferred to the National Forest System, and Forest and Rangeland Research accounts to fund forest and rangeland research, the Joint Fire Science Program, vegetation and watershed management, heritage site rehabilitation, and wildlife and fish habitat management and restoration.”   
  
Thus, it’s heads the Forest Service wins; tails the taxpayers lose. When fire years are mild, the agency gets a windfall to spend on non-fire programs. When fire years are severe, it gets to borrow from those non-fire programs to spend all it wants on fire suppression, knowing it will be reimbursed–and then complains that its non-fire programs are hurt by the borrowings.   
  
One of the reasons why the administration and some environmental groups are behind the Forest Service proposal to give it $2.9 billion a year to draw upon is that increasing fire costs fit neatly into their global climate apocalypse. Yet the data don’t show that the United States is suffering worse droughts today than in the past. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the percentage of the nation that was severely or extremely dry during summer months (July-September) averaged about 15 percent in 2015. That’s high, but hardly a record.   
  
In recent years, this percentage has ranged as low as 3 percent in 1992 to as high as 24 percent in 1953. It was 20 percent in 2012 and 22 percent in 2000. There was a six-year period in the 1950s when it was 15 percent or more in all but one year (when it was 13 percent), and reached as high as 24 percent. So far, both the 1930s and the 1950s were dryer than the 2010s. This suggests that droughts are cyclical, not growing.   
  
What is growing is the Forest Service’s spending on fire. It will continue to grow until Congress gives the agency incentives to contain its costs rather than incentives to spend more each year.

The Trump administration’s decision to abandon the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP) coincides with China’s interest in playing a more prominent role in advancing trade and economic integration in the Asia‐​Pacific region. Beijing’s willingness to leverage its growing clout to underwrite a number of high‐​profile economic initiatives in the region, however, has raised concerns in Washington that such efforts will come at U.S. expense.



Such worries are overwrought. Rather than sound the alarm over China’s latest moves, policymakers should be open to the possibility that Beijing is finally becoming the responsible stakeholder that many have long urged it to be. On the trade front, encouragement is to be found in senior Chinese officials’ rhetorical support for free trade and its institutions, while Chinese leadership’s support for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a key steppingstone toward eventual realization of a Free Trade Area of the Asia‐​Pacific. Although in many ways inferior to the TPP, the RCEP’s standards could yet be improved, and even if left unchanged they still represent forward progress for free trade in the region.



Meanwhile, China’s backing of both the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative holds the possibility of much‐​needed improvements in infrastructure and connectivity that could bolster regional and global trade. With none of its own resources or prestige at stake, the United States stands to benefit considerably, and at little cost, from China’s efforts in this regard.



Moreover, zero‐​sum fears that China’s increasing prosperity and commensurate growth in its regional influence come at U.S. expense should be balanced against the dangers presented by a country that is, alternatively, isolated and economically flailing. Mired in its economic failures before opening up to reform in the late 1970s, China was dangerous to both its neighbors and itself, with the country engaging in several border wars as well as the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution.



Rather than reflexively viewing China’s economic initiatives as an affront to U.S. interests, the Trump administration should attempt to harness China’s emerging taste for global economic leadership. Instead of focusing so intently on the trade disputes that divide us, the Trump administration should seek to conclude the bilateral investment treaty negotiation and consider the merits of initiating negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement with China. Through such cooperation, the United States and China could become successful partners in the promotion of trade and prosperity in the increasingly vital Asia‐​Pacific region.



A leading argument put forth by some U.S. supporters of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP) was that failure to implement the agreement would redound to the benefit of China, effectively ceding economic and even political leadership in the Asia‐​Pacific region to Beijing. President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the agreement and instead to focus his administration’s trade efforts on the negotiation of bilateral deals and revision of past agreements means that such warnings will now be put to the test. By abandoning the TPP, the United States will likely watch from the sidelines as the rules and institutions shaping the region are determined.



Less clear, however, is whether China stands ready to fill the void left by Washington, and even whether a more active role by Beijing should be regarded as undesirable. Indeed, in the wake of recent rhetoric from Chinese President Xi Jinping in support of free trade, and signs of a greater willingness to help advance economic integration efforts in the region via the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and various infrastructure‐​centered initiatives, the country could conceivably play a welcome and positive role during the U.S. absence from regional trade liberalization efforts.



Amid growing signs that China may be ready to become a more “responsible stakeholder,” the Trump administration would be well advised to keep sheathed its rhetorical and executive action swords. International trade is not a zero‐​sum game, and noncoercive efforts that expand commerce are to be properly viewed as win‐​win outcomes that benefit the United States and carry the region a step closer to realizing a Free Trade Area of the Asia‐​Pacific (FTAAP). Just as Chinese economic gains should not be viewed as coming at U.S. expense, similarly the United States gains no economic benefit when China stumbles. Even those with a deeply rooted skepticism of Beijing’s goals and intentions should concede that any concerns over an active and growing China are secondary to those of a China that is disengaged and economically troubled. History has repeatedly shown that the country is most dangerous not during times of prosperity and international integration but rather when it is isolated and impoverished.



Instead of worrying about Chinese aspirations to exert economic leadership in the region, Congress and the Trump administration should devote their energies to avoiding trade provocations with China and to addressing the various economic ills that have sapped U.S. economic dynamism and vitality. By avoiding such lose‐​lose entanglements, further advancing freer trade through new bilateral agreements, and making needed reforms at home, a reinvigorated United States can reemerge on the economic scene in the coming years ready to resume its traditional place as a leading force for expanded international trade and economic integration.



At first glance, China may seem an unlikely candidate to play a leading role in the push for liberalized trade in the Asia‐​Pacific region. Although the country has made impressive strides since pro‐​market reforms were first introduced in the late 1970s, the economy remains rife with government intervention, and both U.S. officials and firms have expressed concern over an increase in regulatory barriers and discrimination against foreign companies.1 Citing such protectionist backsliding and the continued state dominance of the Chinese economy, both the European Union and the United States have refused to accord China market economy status for purposes of applying antidumping measures under their World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations.



However, China has shown possible signs of a growing realization that its economic future lies in breaking down barriers to trade rather than raising them. Perhaps most notably, President Xi provided a needed defense of free trade and globalization during his speech at this year’s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Among his remarks, Xi said:



We must remain committed to developing global free trade and investment, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation through opening‐​up and say no to protectionism. Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.2



Turning his attention to China’s domestic economy, the Chinese leader vowed to pursue unspecified “supply‐​side structural reforms,” measures to “enable the market to play a decisive role in resources allocation,” and various other actions designed to encourage investment in the country. “An open door allows both other countries to access the Chinese market and China itself to integrate with the world,” he added in a nod toward the mutual benefits of such measures. Meanwhile, at a World Economic Forum event in Dalian, China, in June, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called free trade a “prerequisite for fair trade” (effectively turning the common refrain that free trade must be fair trade on its head) and called the imposition of unilateral rules “much less advisable than pursuing all‐​win outcomes.”3



Less widely reported, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli (effectively China’s seventh‐​highest‐​ranking political figure) delivered a keynote speech at the Boao Forum in late March that featured repeated praise for free trade.4 Presumably taking his cues from President Xi, Zhang’s address included calls for reinforcing the multilateral trading system under the auspices of the WTO, making free‐​trade arrangements more open and inclusive; and he concluded by urging his audience to “work together to push forward economic globalization and free trade” to create a better future for Asia and the world.



Talk is cheap, and it is entirely possible that such rhetoric from senior Chinese leadership was meant to mollify foreign observers while plotting a very different course at home. However, reasons for encouragement do exist. The March 2017 launch of exploratory talks between Canada and China over a possible free trade agreement (FTA) is one positive signal, indicating both a willingness by Beijing to further open its economy and a tentative vote of confidence by Ottawa that China is serious about its desire for increased foreign trade and economic openness.5 Another seeming indication of China’s commitment is the March announcement by the governments of China and New Zealand that they are launching talks aimed at expanding an existing FTA between the two countries. (In addition to New Zealand, China has also signed FTAs with South Korea, Australia, Iceland, and Switzerland within the past five years and has ongoing negotiations for a trilateral FTA with Japan and South Korea.)6



A meeting among TPP countries, China, and South Korea in Chile in March also revealed a greater degree of enthusiasm by Beijing for trade liberalization. “The Chinese want to be the leaders, the benchmark. That was not like that before,” remarked Paulina Nazal, head of Chile’s international trade efforts.7



Meanwhile, as part of China’s blueprint for development of its domestic automobile industry, the country’s National Development and Reform Commission announced plans in April 2017 to raise the ownership limits on foreign carmakers, which had been limited to 50 percent under local joint‐​venture requirements.8 Reason for encouragement is also to be found in the agricultural sector, where the removal in recent years of price supports for corn, cotton, soybeans, and sugar has created additional room for imports to meet the country’s considerable appetite.9 Also of note, in July 2017, China announced that it will allow imports of rice from the United States for the first time ever.10 Such long‐​overdue measures are hopeful indications of the Chinese government’s recognition that successful domestic economic reform must include greater openness and increased foreign participation in the economy.



China’s foremost international trade initiative, of course, is its participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Comprising the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the 6 countries with which the organization has existing free trade deals (Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand), the RCEP is, despite its ASEAN roots, widely described as a China‐​driven effort. That, in turn, has led many observers to characterize the RCEP as a Chinese‐​led alternative—a rival—to the TPP and a potential economic threat to the United States. However, that characterization is roundly rejected by the governments that are party to both the RCEP and the TPP and that see membership in both as their preference.



The RCEP should be seen for what it is: an agreement that reduces trade barriers, promotes economic growth, and does not preclude members from joining other agreements, including ones with the United States.11 The RCEP would provide a much‐​needed boost to regional trade liberalization efforts in the wake of U.S. withdrawal from the TPP. The Asian Development Bank estimates the potential increase in global income from RCEP implementation to be in the neighborhood of $260 billion over 10 years, which is significant although smaller than the expected benefits from a TPP that includes the United States.12 The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) estimates global income gains from such a TPP of $492 billion through 2030.13



Moreover, the RCEP could advance U.S. interests by further integrating Beijing into the rules‐​based international order, by providing additional counterinfluences to market‐​distorting policies, and by further incentivizing the reform and liberalization of China’s economy. As the PIIE’s Sean Miner has noted, China—like other countries—uses international agreements to “overcome vested interests and push for domestic reforms” and has used such deals in the past to push through economic reforms that were “strongly opposed by powerful groups that profited from the status quo.”14



The RCEP could also serve as a steppingstone toward an FTAAP, which many regard as the ultimate goal of U.S. trade policy architecture in the region. The connection between the RCEP and FTAAP has already been highlighted by China, with the need to advance both efforts noted by President Xi during his Davos speech. The Chinese leader also cited the need to advance both initiatives during a keynote address to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held in Lima, Peru, in November 2016.15



The leaders of that forum have designated the RCEP as an officially sanctioned pathway to achieving the FTAAP, and a November 2016 analysis published by the organization cited the initiative as a “key pathway for broader economic integration.”16 Meanwhile, an October 2014 paper by Peter A. Petri and Ali Abdul‐​Raheem described both the RCEP and the TPP as “represent[ing] foundations for an FTAAP” and wrote that both agreements would “provide essential way‐​stations for economies on the path to region‐​wide integration.”17



RCEP critics have derided the agreement for its lack of ambition and relatively low standards, particularly compared with the TPP. This critique has merit, with the TPP covering a much broader set of topics (30 chapters versus roughly a dozen) and featuring a wider scope of tariff reduction and service‐​sector liberalization. It is unclear, however, that Beijing is a prime culprit for the lack of willingness to engage in deeper and more widespread tariff reductions. As PIIE’s Jacob Funk Kirkegaard points out, China actually desires further tariff liberalization in sectors such as manufacturing and light industry but has encountered resistance from a number of its trading partners in the RCEP who have seen their trade surpluses with China turn into deficits in recent years.18 That factor suggests that Americans who favor a more liberalized international trading regime should perhaps be fearful not of excessive Chinese clout in the RCEP but rather a lack of it.



Furthermore, with the RCEP yet to be concluded, its more modest standards and scope are far from set in stone, and the agreement’s ambitions could still be raised. Indeed, with the TPP’s future now clouded by the U.S. exit, it is conceivable that TPP members who are also participating in the RCEP may devote new energy to improving the deal as the best near‐​term prospect for liberalizing trade in the region. If the praise for free trade and economic integration from senior Chinese leaders is reflected at the negotiating table as talks progress, it could generate momentum for broadening and strengthening the RCEP’s standards.



Former president Barack Obama and others, meanwhile, have warned that, should the RCEP advance and the TPP stumble, it will allow “countries like China” to “write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st century.”19 Such language is commonly interpreted as an oblique reference to the FTAAP or other broader initiatives to advance trade in the Asia‐​Pacific region, and it assumes that either the RCEP or the TPP will be used as the starting point for such efforts.



This type of thinking, however, suffers from at least two possible flaws. First, despite the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP, the initiative is not moribund, with Japan and others attempting to rally the remaining members—the so‐​called TPP-11—to press ahead toward concluding the deal. Second, even if the TPP meets its demise, it is unclear why the RCEP would serve as the model or likely finishing point of any FTAAP or similar style agreement. Beyond the United States, numerous other countries—including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Pacific Alliance countries—have signaled their interest in more expansive, higher‐​standards agreements, and such desires would almost certainly be reflected at the negotiating table. The RCEP might set a floor for future negotiations, but there is little reason to view it as some kind of ceiling.



Furthermore, the simultaneous pursuit of both the RCEP and the TPP could have a salutary impact on the advancement of free trade in the region. As a July 2017 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) notes, a rivalry between the two agreements has the “potential to create a virtuous competition for trade liberalization and needed reform within China.”20



Beyond its expressions of interest in leading regional efforts to liberalize trade, the Chinese government has also taken the initiative to begin the process of building the infrastructure linkages necessary for expanded trade and integration in Asia. To that end, China has taken what appears to be a largely two‐​pronged approach through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, both of which were proposed in 2013 (and the AIIB was officially established a year later).



China’s rationale for launching the AIIB was the need for financing to close a yawning infrastructure gap in the region. Addressing the “daunting infrastructure needs across Asia” is listed by the bank as one of its key objectives.21 Indeed, the Asian Development Bank claims that $1.5 trillion must be spent per year by developing countries in the region through 2030 to meet their infrastructure needs ($1.7 trillion if one includes the cost of climate change mitigation), compared with current expenditures of $881 billion.22 Less officially, Chinese frustration with its lack of influence at the World Bank and the organization’s funding priorities are suspected to have played key roles.



One Belt, One Road, meanwhile, is the name given to an effort to inject renewed life into ancient trading links between China and Eurasia. Consisting of the land‐​based Silk Road Economic Belt and the sea‐​based Maritime Silk Road, OBOR is essentially a series of infrastructure projects designed to build and expand rail, road, energy, and maritime linkages.



In the AIIB and OBOR, China’s motives go beyond those officially stated to include an expansion of regional influence and to create demand that might soak up the excess capacity in China’s economy. Whether those goals will be realized is unclear, but neither should be viewed as aggressive or otherwise problematic from a U.S. perspective. If China succeeds in expanding its influence in Central Asia, it is likely to do so at the expense of Russia—a trade many U.S. policymakers would likely be perfectly willing to make. That said, having a bigger economic footprint does not necessarily translate into greater political influence. China’s role as the top foreign investor in Vietnam, for example, has not prevented outbreaks of anti‐​Chinese protests in the country;23 its attempted construction of a dam in Myanmar has actually proved a source of contention in bilateral relations;24 and development of a Chinese‐​run port project in Sri Lanka has been met with violent demonstrations.25 As author and China analyst Tom Miller notes, “China will struggle to convince its neighbors to embrace a new regional order centered on Beijing, precisely because they fear its immense economic power. No one wants to become a Chinese vassal.”26



Meanwhile, Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, notes that OBOR projects are unlikely to figure prominently in resolving China’s overcapacity problems because their magnitude is too great and the costs of transporting cement, steel, and other overproduced Chinese products to where they are needed will prove uneconomical.27 Indeed, to the extent that the initiative should provoke worry, it is that the lack of market forces at work will result in projects that generate poor economic returns.28 As a consequence, China could find itself facing even more debt, which is already one of the primary risks to the country’s—and, by extension, the world’s—economic outlook.



U.S. businesses, workers, and consumers, bearing no direct financial risk from OBOR or the AIIB, stand to benefit from those initiatives to the extent that they succeed in spurring more trade and greater prosperity in the region. Although the jury is out on how successful those Chinese‐​backed initiatives will prove to be, U.S. officials have reason to be at least cautiously optimistic. David Dollar, an economist and China expert at the Brookings Institution, has applauded the twin initiatives as providing the “hardware” of trade and investment that will serve as a counterpart to the “software,” which consists of regional trade agreements.29 Pieter Bottelier, a visiting scholar of China studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, calls OBOR a “very positive initiative and a major vision of how China can collaborate with countries in its neighborhood.”30 Moreover, McKinsey & Company’s Asia chair Kevin Sneader says that OBOR “has the potential to be perhaps the world’s largest platform for regional collaboration.”31



These individuals are hardly alone in their optimism. Michael Swaine, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, calls himself a “big supporter” of OBOR, adding that it is “not threatening American interests” and “could be very beneficial” for both China and the countries involved.32 The July CSIS report, meanwhile, notes that OBOR “compliments [sic] many U.S. interests in the region.”33 Citing the vast infrastructure needs of the Asia‐​Pacific region, meanwhile, _Financial Times_ columnist Martin Wolf says that “additional Chinese resources should be helpful.”34



More fundamentally, policymakers should recognize that, although China may not be operating directly out of the preferred U.S. playbook, its efforts could serve to advance the broader U.S. objectives of peace and prosperity in Asia. At the very least, Beijing should be given the opportunity to succeed before its efforts are placed under a cloud of suspicion. Those who insist on seeing ulterior motives in China’s economic initiatives should be wary of self‐​fulfilling prophecies and of provoking a breakdown in U.S.-China relations that observers almost universally agree would be wildly counterproductive.



Focusing on the AIIB, PIIE Senior Fellow and Director Emeritus C. Fred Bergsten effectively summarized the issue in a 2015 opinion piece:



As the incumbent power, the United States naturally wants China to support the international rules and institutions that it has led for 70 years. As the rising power, China naturally challenges a status quo it had no role in creating and wants to begin shaping a modified order itself.  
  
The United States has correctly urged China to exercise leadership consistent with its expanding power and to provide more resources to support development and other global goals. When the Chinese move in those directions, as they are doing with the AIIB, it is short‐​sighted and hypocritical for the United States to seek to block them.… This U.S. hostility reinforces the Chinese view that U.S. strategy is to contain and suppress it, so increasing rather than decreasing the prospect of uncooperative Chinese behavior.35



The United States should never simply take China at its word and assume the best of intentions, but neither should it adopt a default policy of opposition when Beijing seeks to act. China’s initiatives may prove to be economic folly or even part of some nefarious agenda, but policymakers should allow for the possibility that its actions will generate real benefits for the region. The ultimate goal of U.S. policy should not be power and influence for their own sake, but peace, stability, and prosperity.



None of this is to deny that an economically ascendant, authoritarian China will pose geopolitical challenges for the United States. But whatever the downsides of a more assertive and engaged China, they pale in comparison to the economically and politically isolated version of the country that existed from the post–World War II era until the 1970s.



During that period, China proved to be a menace toward both its neighbors and its own population. On the foreign policy front, China engaged in border conflicts with India in 1962 (and further skirmishes in 1967) and the Soviet Union in 1969. It went to war with United Nations forces during the Korean War in the early 1950s. Within China, meanwhile, the repression and backwardness typical of communist countries were interspersed with the horrific paroxysms of violence and economic self‐​sabotage known as the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward.



Since the formal adoption of Deng Xiaoping’s economic reform agenda in December 1978 and political rapprochement with the United States in 1979, however, China has become a much more cooperative and peaceful country. Aside from a conflict with Vietnam in early 1979—which began only weeks after economic reform was officially launched and just days before the reopening of embassies in the United States and China on March 1—and a brief clash in March 1988, also with Vietnam, over part of the Spratly Islands, the country’s record has been a largely peaceful one. Although Beijing continues to play a meddlesome and uncooperative role in the South China Sea, China has also shown its helpful side through assistance in the fight against Somali piracy and its status as the largest contributor of the UN Security Council’s five permanent members of troops to peacekeeping efforts.36



At home, the recent death of democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo under government custody is a painful reminder that the Chinese people’s political and civil rights continue to be repressed, and its 1989 massacre of protesters at Tiananmen Square will forever be a stain on the regime. That said, the current restrictions on liberty do not equate to the horrors of previous decades, and average Chinese citizens have experienced a significant increase in their standard of living.



Isolating China politically would run the risk of returning to the strained ties of the pre‐​rapprochement era. Any policy that treats the United States–China economic relationship as a zero‐​sum game or views Chinese economic strength as a threat per se would almost certainly prove counterproductive. Rather than a threat, a vibrant Chinese economy is in the national interest of the United States, and any slowdown in bilateral trade or in China’s growth would have profoundly adverse consequences for the U.S. economy as well. As the United States’ largest trading partner, China is the third‐​largest market for exported U.S. goods, the top source of imports (whose typically low prices are a boon to U.S. consumers), the second‐​largest foreign purchaser of Treasury bonds, and a critical low‐​cost manufacturing platform that boosts the competitiveness of leading U.S.-based firms such as Apple.37



Beyond direct costs, the impairment of China’s economic progress would exert considerable indirect costs as well. China is the leading trading partner not only of the United States but also of most, if not all, major Asia‐​Pacific economies, including Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Any significant reduction in Chinese growth would have adverse effects throughout the region and beyond. According to a 2016 International Monetary Fund working paper, a 10 percent drop in Chinese imports resulting from a 1 percent slowdown in gross domestic product beyond baseline growth for 2016–17 would “lead to a loss of about 1.2 percent GDP of export revenue in 2016 for all countries.”38 Network effects, meanwhile, could increase the drop to “2.0 percent of GDP in 2017 before abating gradually by 2020 to about 0.2 percent of GDP.”



While China has been promoting economic engagement in the Asia‐​Pacific region, the Trump administration has been moving in the opposite direction (for example, withdrawing the United States from the TPP). Although the most straightforward path to boosting U.S. competitiveness and matching China’s own initiatives would be to rejoin the agreement, statements from President Trump and senior administration officials suggest that this is an unlikely scenario. Nonetheless, a variety of options exist for the administration to repair some of the damage and at least partially recover the U.S. leadership position on trade that has been so casually discarded.



To start, U.S. thought leaders and officials given to deep suspicions should alter their thinking and approach to China. Although China is certainly not a steadfast ally of the United States, neither should it be regarded as a perpetual foe. Chinese and U.S. economic and geopolitical interests will sometimes align and sometimes diverge. Healthy skepticism is always warranted, but policymakers need to be careful that it does not degrade into paranoia and a default position that dark motives are behind all of Beijing’s moves.



To that end, the United States should be careful to avoid acting unilaterally or in rogue fashion in response to perceived economic transgressions by China. Rather, the United States should continue to rely on the rules of trade and the norms established under the WTO for resolving such disputes. That system, although not perfect, has worked remarkably well to prevent trade spats from getting out of control and for delivering justice under the rule of law. As a complainant, the United States has prevailed at the WTO in 91 percent of adjudicated issues.39 Loudly blaming China for American economic ills and imposing punitive tariffs as retaliation—although perhaps politically attractive—will be not only ineffective but self‐​defeating as well.



Beyond avoiding unnecessary trade spats with China, the United States should also seize on already existing opportunities to actively improve the bilateral trade relationship. One idea is to conclude the long‐​running negotiation for a bilateral investment treaty. Enjoying the backing of the U.S.-China Business Council, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, and many other U.S. business groups, an agreement to conclude the bilateral investment treaty was said to be nearing its final stages in the last days of the Obama administration.40 If the Trump administration were to pick up this effort (which is being negotiated—as the administration prefers—in a bilateral format) soon, on the heels of a May 2017 agreement between Washington and Beijing to liberalize trade in beef, chicken, financial services, banking, and other spheres, it could benefit from that success and find its way across the finish line. Doing so would help liberalize what Yukon Huang and David Stack call “one of the most restrictive investment regimes of any Organisation for Economic Co‐​operation and Development country for services” and would help generate real gains for U.S. firms in light of their comparative advantages in areas such as finance, communications, information technology, entertainment, and education.41



If the Trump administration chooses to be more ambitious, it could also opt to pursue a free trade agreement with Beijing. Although perhaps a fanciful notion to some, there may be scope for achieving a reasonably robust bilateral agreement. As Simon Lester and Huan Zhu suggest in a recent paper:



Without the TPP or other regional trade initiatives, and with no comprehensive talks going on at the WTO, the best way for the United States to promote market liberalization in China is to go directly to China and negotiate bilaterally on issues related to Chinese restrictions on trade and investment. In the past, there have been discussions between China and the United States on a number of issues, but most of these talks have been merely “dialogues” that did not lead to concrete results. What is needed instead is a formal negotiation that leads to enforceable commitments.42



The United States should also take proactive measures to improve the trading environment more broadly and to restore some of its lost leadership. With the TPP seemingly off the table, Washington should make the most of second‐​best options, including the possible negotiation of bilateral trade agreements with TPP members with which the United States does not already have such deals, particularly Japan and Vietnam. Using the TPP as a template for negotiating these deals—as well as for updating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico—would carry the dual possibilities of satisfying the needs of 21st‐​century trade agreements while making it more seamless for the United States to rejoin the TPP and help steer the partnership toward an FTAAP in the not‐​too‐​distant future.



Last, policymakers must realize that it is they rather than China or other foreign countries who will ultimately determine whether the United States finds itself on the path to economic prosperity. How much the U.S. economy grows will be determined far more by what happens in Washington than in Beijing. Instead of blaming foreign actors for U.S. economic ills, policymakers should leverage their position and power to restore any lost economic luster. It is not China that has burdened the United States with a byzantine tax code or any number of costly regulations that sap the country’s vitality and undermine its growth.43 Republicans—the putative party of personal responsibility—in the White House and Congress should seek to put their own economic house in order before focusing on alleged troubles being inflicted by other countries.



China’s rise has prompted considerable anxiety over its growing economic strength. Indeed, a feeling appears to have taken hold among significant parts of the American electorate—as well as within the White House—that China’s increasing might has come at U.S. expense. That, in turn, has led to a knee‐​jerk reaction among some observers that China’s international economic initiatives such as the RCEP, the AIIB, and OBOR pose some kind of threat to U.S. interests or are at least causes for extra vigilance.



Rather than reflexively expressing suspicion or opposition to China’s moves, the possibility should at least be entertained that the world’s second‐​largest economy is beginning to shoulder some of the leadership burden for the advancement of free trade and deeper economic integration.



While the RCEP is no one’s free‐​trade ideal, it should nonetheless be valued as a steppingstone to a fully liberalized Asia‐​Pacific region, reducing trade barriers at a time when broader efforts to do so appear to be flagging. China’s rhetorical support for free trade should be similarly appreciated. Although the depth of this commitment is yet to be seen, such messaging by Beijing sends an important signal at a time when traditional leaders such as the United States have become derelict in their duties.



Presumably the United States will eventually come to its senses and rejoin the multilateral trade game. In the meantime, policymakers should avoid unnecessary trade spats, work toward liberalizing trade and investment through bilateral agreements, and stay focused on initiatives to keep the United States commercially engaged in Asia.

"**Was this the week that the tide finally turned against the tech giants in the United States?**
A congressional committee lashed out at the anti-competitive practices of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, and in this week's Tech Tent we look at whether strong words may be followed by tough action.
A 450-page report from the House Judiciary Committee exploring breaches of anti-trust law might sound like a cure for insomnia, but the BBC's man in Silicon Valley, James Clayton, tells us it is anything but a dry read.
""The quote that jumps out is that it says that these companies that started in the garages of houses in Silicon Valley have emerged to be the monopolistic powers, the likes of which we haven't seen since the oil barons and railroad tycoons of the 20th century,"" he explains.
As well as fierce criticism of the way the companies abuse their dominant position, the report outlines ideas about what might be done about it. That may keep the likes of Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg awake at night.
Until now, it has been the European Union and its Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who have been taking on the tech giants, imposing big fines on Google and Apple, and demanding changes in their behaviour.
But Harvard University's Professor Jason Furman tells us Congress seems willing to go further: ""In many ways this new House report leapfrogs past Europe into an even more aggressive posture on the big tech companies.""
Prof Furman, who chaired an inquiry into the power of the tech giants for the UK government, outlines three areas where the American politicians seem willing to take aggressive action.
He says they want to make it much harder for big tech companies to buy up smaller ones, in the way that Facebook snapped up Instagram and WhatsApp. That is a move he strongly supports: ""We've made the mistake of allowing too many mergers that we shouldn't have.""
The politicians also want to ban the tech giants from going into what are described as ""adjacent businesses"": ""So Amazon could not sell products on its own platform, it could only sell products from other companies.""
But Prof Furman says the big news is that the report calls for a change in an American approach to competition policy - or antitrust as it's known in the US - which has assumed there is no problem, as long as consumers are not paying higher prices in the short term.
""It proposes to change the way antitrust is done more generally, to take the focus away from a sole focus on consumers, and to also look at questions like small businesses, workers, and broader issues like the functioning of democracy,"" Prof Furman explains.
That issue about the functioning of democracy is one where Facebook is in the spotlight right now as a hugely powerful platform for misinformation in the run-up to the US election.
This week the social media giant moved to shut down groups spreading the Qanon conspiracy theory, which promotes the idea that President Trump is leading a battle against satanic child abuse.
But the BBC's Disinformation Reporter Marianna Spring tells Tech Tent that the crackdown may have come too late for many who have disappeared down the Qanon rabbit hole.
She's been speaking to someone who wants to be known as ""Joe"", whose father has become obsessed with the conspiracy theory.
""I think the ban is great,"" he tells her. ""However, my dad has never really acknowledged that he is part of any Qanon following, despite echoing their 'where we go one, we go all' slogan and sharing many, if not all, of Qanon's beliefs.""
He says his father's exposure to this material actually comes from YouTube, not Facebook - ""so what's Google going to do about it?""
The pressure on the tech giants to take responsibility for their wider impact on society is growing. But just how likely they are to face new regulation may depend on the outcome of the US election.
It was the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee who wanted a really tough approach - a minority report from the Republicans agreed there was a problem, but favoured milder solutions.
So the tech firms may have more to fear from a President Biden than a returning President Trump."

At the risk of sounding like a broken record (well, OK–at the risk of _continuing_ to sound like a broken record), I'd like to say a bit more about economists' tendency to get their monetary history wrong. In particular, I'd like to take aim at common myths about the gold standard.   
  
If there's one monetary history topic that tends to get handled especially sloppily by monetary economists, not to mention other sorts, this is it. Sure, the gold standard was hardly perfect, and gold bugs themselves sometimes make silly claims about their favorite former monetary standard. But these things don't excuse the errors many economists commit in their eagerness to find fault with that ""barbarous relic.""   
  
The false claims I have in mind are mostly ones I and others–notably Larry White–have countered before. Still I thought it would be useful to address them again here, because they're still far from being dead horses, and also so that students wrapping-up the semester will have something convenient to send to their misinformed gold-bashing profs (though I urge them to wait until grades are in before sharing!).   
  
For the sake of those who don't care to wade through the whole post, here is a ""jump to"" list of the points covered:   






As Larry White has made the essential point as well as I ever could, I hope I may be excused for quoting him at length:   




Barry Eichengreen writes that countries using gold as money 'fix its price in domestic-currency terms (in the U.S. case, in dollars).' He finds this perplexing:



But the idea that government should legislate the price of a particular commodity, be it gold, milk or gasoline, sits uneasily with conservative Republicanism’s commitment to letting market forces work, much less with Tea Party–esque libertarianism. Surely a believer in the free market would argue that if there is an increase in the demand for gold, whatever the reason, then the price should be allowed to rise, giving the gold-mining industry an incentive to produce more, eventually bringing that price back down. Thus, the notion that the U.S. government should peg the price, as in gold standards past, is curious at the least.



To describe a gold standard as ""fixing"" gold’s ""price"" in terms of a distinct good, domestic currency, is to get off on the wrong foot. A gold standard means that a standard mass of gold (so many grams or ounces of pure or standard-alloy gold) _defines_ the domestic currency unit. The currency unit (“dollar”) is nothing other than a unit of gold, not a separate good with a potentially fluctuating market price against gold. That one dollar, defined as so many grams of gold, continues be worth the specified amount of gold—or in other words that one unit of gold continues to be worth one unit of gold—does not involve the pegging of any relative price. Domestic currency notes (and checking account balances) are _denominated_ in and redeemable for gold, not _priced_ in gold. They don’t have a _price_ in gold any more than checking account balances in our current system, denominated in fiat dollars, have a price in fiat dollars. Presumably Eichengreen does not find it curious or objectionable that his bank maintains a fixed dollar-for-dollar redemption rate, cash for checking balances, at his ATM.



Remarkably, as White goes on to show, the rest of Eichengreen's statement proves that, besides not having understood the meaning of gold's ""fixed"" dollar price, Eichengreen has an uncertain grasp of the rudimentary economics of gold production:   




As to what a believer in the free market would argue, surely Eichengreen understands that if there is an increase in the demand for gold under a gold standard, whatever the reason, then the _relative_ price of gold (the purchasing power per unit of gold over other goods and services) _will_ in fact rise, that this rise will in fact give the gold-mining industry an incentive to produce more, and that the increase in gold output will in fact eventually bring the relative price back down.



I've said more than once that, the more vehement an economist's criticisms of the gold standard, the more likely he or she knows little about it. Of course Eichengreen knows far more about the gold standard than most economists, and is far from being its harshest critic, so he'd undoubtedly be an outlier in the simple regression, y = α + β(x) (where y is vehemence of criticism of the gold standard and x is ignorance of the subject). Nevertheless, his statement shows that even the understanding of one of the gold standard's most well-known critics leaves much to be desired.   
  
Although, at bottom, the gold standard isn't a matter of government ""fixing"" gold's price in terms of paper money, it is true that governments' creation of monopoly banks of issue, and the consequent tendency for such monopolies to be treated as government- or quasi-government authorities, ultimately led to their being granted sovereign immunity from the legal consequences to which ordinary, private intermediaries are usually subject when they dishonor their promises. Because a modern central bank can renege on its promises with impunity, a gold standard administered by such a bank more closely resembles a price-fixing scheme than one administered by a commercial bank. Still, economists should be careful to distinguish the special features of a traditional gold standard from those of central-bank administered fixed exchange rate schemes.   
  
  




Back in the early 1950s, and again in 1960, Milton Friedman estimated that the gold required for the U.S. to have a ""real"" gold standard would have cost 2.5% of its annual GNP. But that's because Friedman's idea of a ""real"" gold standard was one in which gold coins alone served as money, with no fractionally-backed bank-supplied substitutes. As Larry White shows in his _Theory of Monetary Institutions_ (p. 47) allowing for 2% specie reserves–which is more than what some former gold-based free-banking systems needed–the resource cost of a gold standard taking advantage of fractionally-backed banknotes and deposits would be about _one-fiftieth_ of the number Friedman came up with. That's a helluva bargain for a gold ""seal of approval"" that could mean having access to international capital at substantially reduced rates, according to research by Mike Bordo and Hugh Rockoff.   
  
Friedman himself eventually changed his mind about the economies to be achieved by employing fiat money:   




Monetary economists have generally treated irredeemable paper money as involving negligible real resource costs compared with a commodity currency. To judge from recent experience, that view is clearly false as a result of the decline in long-term price predictability.



I took it for granted that the real resource cost of producing irredeemable paper money was negligible, consisting only of the cost of paper and printing. Experience under a universal irredeemable paper money standard makes it crystal clear that such an assumption, while it may be correct with respect to the direct cost to the government of issuing fiat outside money, is false for society as a whole and is likely to remain so unless and until a monetary structure emerges under an irredeemable paper standard that provides a high degree of long-run price level predictability.*



Unfortunately, neither White's criticism of Friedman's early calculations nor Friedman's own about-face have kept gold standard critics from repeating the old canard that a fiat standard is more economical than a gold standard. Ross Starr, for example, observes in his 2013 book on money  that ""The use of paper or fiduciary money instead of commodity money is resource saving, allowing commodity inventories to be liquidated."" Although he understands that fractionally-backed banknotes and deposits may go some way toward economizing on commodity-money reserves, Starr (quoting Adam Smith, but failing to look up historic Scottish bank reserve ratios) insists nonetheless that ""a significant quantity of the commodity backing must be maintained in inventory to successfully back the currency,"" and then proceeds to build a case for fiat money from this unwarranted assertion:



The next step in economizing on the capital tied up in backing the currency is to use a fiat money. Substituting a government decree for commodity backing frees up a significant fraction of the economy's capital stock for productive use. No longer must the economy hold gold, silver, or other commodities in inventory to back the currency. No longer must additional labor and capital be used to extract them from the earth. Those resources are freed up and a simple virtually costless government decree is substituted for them.



Tempting as it is to respond to such hooey simply by noting that the vaults of the world's official fiat-money managing institutions presently contain rather more than zero ounces of gold–31,957.5 metric _tons_ more, to be precise–that response only hints at the fundamental flaw in Starr's reasoning, which is his treatment of fiat money as a culmination, or limiting case, of the resource savings to be had by resort to fractional commodity-money reserves. That treatment overlooks a crucial difference between fiat money and readily redeemable banknotes and deposits, for whereas redeemable banknotes and deposits are generally understood by their users to be close, if not perfect, substitutes for commodity money, fiat money, the purchasing power of which is unhinged from that of any former money commodity, is nothing of the sort. On the contrary: its tendency to depreciate relative to real commodities, and to gold in particular, is notorious. Consequently holders of fiat money have reason to hold ""commodity inventories"" as a hedge against the risk that fiat money will depreciate.   
  
If the hedge demand for a former money commodity is large enough, resort to fiat money doesn't save any resources at all. Indeed, as Roger Garrison notes, ""a paper standard administered by an irresponsible monetary authority may drive the monetary value of gold so high that more resource costs are incurred under the paper standard than would have been incurred under a gold standard."" A glance at the history of gold's real price suffices to show that this is precisely what has happened:

From ""After the Gold Rush,"" _The Economist_ , July 6, 2010.   
  
  
  
Taking the long-run average price of gold, in 2010 prices, to be somewhere around $470, prior to the closing of the gold window in 1917, that price was exceeded on only three occasions, and never dramatically: around the time of the California gold rush, around the turn of the 20th century, and for several years following FDR's devaluation of the dollar. Since 1971, in contrast, it has exceeded that average, and exceeded it substantially, more often than not. Here is Roger Garrison again:   




There is a certain asymmetry in the cost comparison that turns the resource-cost argument against paper standards. When an irresponsible monetary authority begins to overissue paper money, market participants begin to hoard gold, which stimulates the gold-mining industry and drives up the resource costs. But when new discoveries of gold are made, market participants do not begin to hoard paper or to set up printing presses for the issue of unbacked currency. Gold is a good substitute for an officially instituted paper money, but paper is not a good substitute for an officially recognized metallic money. Because of this asymmetry, the resource costs incurred by the State in its efforts to impose a paper standard on the economy and manage the supply of paper money could be avoided if the State would simply recognize gold as money. These costs, then, can be counted against the paper standard.



So if it's avoidance of gold resource costs that's desired, including avoidance of the very real environmental consequences of gold mining, a gold standard looks like the right way to go.   
  
  




Of the many misinformed criticisms of the gold standard, none seems to me more wrong-headed than the complaint that the gold standard isn't even a reliable guarantee against serious inflation. The _RationalWiki_ entry on the gold standard is as good an example of this as any:   




Even gold can suffer problems with inflation.Gold rushes such as the California Gold Rush expanded the money supply and, when not matched with a simultaneous increase in economic output, caused inflation.The ""Price Revolution"" of the 16th century demonstrates a case of dramatic long-run inflation. During this period, western European nations used a bimetallic standard (gold and silver). The Price Revolution was the result of a huge influx of silver from central European mines starting during the late 15th century combined with a flood of new bullion from the Spanish treasure fleets and the demographic shift brought about by the Black Plague (i.e., depopulation).



Admittedly the anonymous authors of this article may not be professional economists; but take my word for it that the same arguments might be heard from any number of such professionals. Brad DeLong, for example, in a list of ""Talking Points on the _Likely_ Consequences of re-establishment of the Gold Standard"" (my emphasis), includes observation that ""significant advances in gold mining technology could provide a significant boost to the average rate of inflation over decades.""   
  
Like I said, the gold standard is hardly free of defects. But being vulnerable to bouts of serious inflation isn't one of them. Consider the ""dramatic"" 16th century inflation referred to in the _RationalWiki_ entry. Had that entries' authors referred to plain-old _Wikipedia_ 's entry on ""Price revolution,"" they would have read there that   




Prices rose on average roughly sixfold over 150 years. This level of inflation amounts to 1-1.5% per year, a relatively low inflation rate for the 20th century standards, but rather high given the monetary policy in place in the 16th century.



I have no idea what the authors mean by their second statement, as there was certainly no such thing as ""monetary policy"" at the time, and they offer no further explanation or citation. So far as I can tell, they mean nothing more than that prices hadn't been rising as fast before the price revolution than they did during it, which though trivially true says nothing about how ""high"" the inflation was by any standards, including those of the 16th century. In any case it was not only ""not high"" but dangerously _low_ according to standards set, rightly or wrongly, by today's monetary experts. Finally, though the point is often overlooked, the European Price Revolution actually began well in advance of major American specie shipments, which means that, far from being attributable to such shipments alone, it was a result of several causes, including coin debasements.   
  
What about the California Gold rush, which is also supposed to show how changes in the supply of gold will lead to inflation ""when not matched with a simultaneous increase in economic output""? To judge from available statistics, it appears that producers of other goods were almost a match for all those indefatigable forty-niners:  as Larry White reports, although the U.S. GDP deflator did rise a bit in the years following the gold rush,   




The magnitude was surprisingly small. Even over the most inflationary interval, the [GDP deflator] rose from 5.71 in 1849 (year 2000 = 100) to 6.42 in 1857, an increase of 12.4 percent spread over eight years. The compound annual price inflation rate over those eight years was slightly less than 1.5 percent.



Once again, the inflation rate was such as would have had today's central banks rushing to expand their balance sheets.   
  
Nor do the CPI estimates tell a different story. See if you can spot the gold-rush-induced inflation in this chart:   
  
  


![U.S. CPI](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/download-remote-images/www.alt-m.org/212978993417/U.SCPI3_-1024x575.jpg?itok=9iTd3O6t)



*Graphing Various Historical Economic Series,"" MeasuringWorth, 2015.   
  
Despite popular beliefs, the California gold rush was actually not the biggest 19th-century gold supply innovation, at least to judge from its bearing on the course of prices. That honor belongs instead to the Witwatersrand gold rush of 1886, the effects of which later combined with those of the Klondike rush of 1896 to end a long interval of gradual deflation (discussed further below) and begin one of gradual inflation.   
  
Brad DeLong is thus quite right to refer to the South African discoveries in observing that even a gold standard poses some risk of inflation:   




For example, the discovery and exploitation of large gold reserves near present-day Johannesburg at the end of the nineteenth century was responsible for a four percentage point per year shift in the worldwide rate of inflation–from a deflation of roughly two percent per year before 1896 to an inflation of roughly two percent per year after 1896.



Allowing for the general inaccuracy of 19th-century CPI estimates, DeLong's statistics are correct. But that ""For example"" is quite misleading. Like I said: this is the most serious instance of an inflationary gold ""supply shock"" of which I'm aware. Yet even it served mainly to put an end to a deflationary trend, without ever giving rise to an inflation rate substantially above what central banks today consider (rightly or wrongly) optimal. As for the four percentage point change in the rate of inflation ""per year,"" presumably meaning ""in one year,"" it's hardly remarkable: changes as big or larger are common throughout the 19th century, partly owing to the notoriously limited data on which CPI estimates for that era are based. Even so, they can't be compared to the much larger jumps in inflation with which the history of fiat monies is riddled, even setting hyperinflations aside. Keep this in mind as you reflect upon Brad's conclusion that   




Under the gold standard, the average rate of inflation or deflation over decades ceases to be under the control of the government or the central bank, and becomes the result of the balance between growing world production and the pace of gold mining.



Alas, keeping matters in perspective–that is, comparing the gold standard's _actual_ inflation record, not to that which might be achieved by means of an ideally-managed fiat money, but to the _actual_ inflation record of historic fiat-money systems, is something many critics of the gold standard seem reluctant to do, perhaps for good reason.   
  
While we're on the subject, nothing could be more absurd than attempts to demonstrate the unsuitability of gold as a monetary medium by referring to gold's unstable real value in the years _since the gold standard was abandoned_. Yet this is a favorite debating point among the gold standard's less thoughtful critics, including Paul Krugman:   




There is a remarkably widespread view that at least gold has had stable purchasing power. But nothing could be further from the truth. Here’s the real price of gold — the price deflated by the consumer price index — since 1968:



Compare Professor Krugman's chart to the one in the previous section. Then ask yourself (1) Has gold's price behaved differently since 1968 than it did before?; and (2) Why might this be so? If your answers are ""Yes"" and ""Because gold and paper dollars are no longer close substitutes, and gold is now widely used to hedge against depreciation of the dollar and other fiat currencies,"" you understand the gold standard better than Krugman does. But don't get a swelled head over it, because it really isn't saying much: Krugman is one of the observations that sits squarely on the upper right end of y = α + β(x).   
  
  




The complaint that a gold standard doesn't rule out inflation is but a footnote to the more frequent complaint that it suffers, in Brad DeLong's words, from ""a deflationary bias which makes it likely that a gold standard regime will see a higher average unemployment rate than an alternative managed regime."" According to Ben Bernanke ""There is…a high correlation in the data between deflation (falling prices) and depression (falling output).""   
  
That the gold standard tended to be deflationary–or that it tended to be so for sometimes long intervals between gold discoveries–can't be denied. But what certainly _can_ be denied is that these periods of slow deflation went hand-in-hand with high unemployment. Having thoroughly reviewed the empirical record, Andrew Atkeson and Patrick Kehoe conclude as follows:   




Deflation and depression do seem to have been linked during the1930s. But in the rest of the data for 17 countries and more than 100 years, there is virtually no evidence of such a link.



More recently Claudio Borio and several of his BIS colleagues reported similar findings. How then (you may wonder), did Bernanke arrive at his opposite conclusion? Easy: he looked only at data for the 1930s–the worst deflationary crisis ever–ignoring all the rest.   
  
Why is deflation sometimes depressing, and sometimes not? The simple answer is that there is more than one sort of deflation. There's the sort that's caused by a collapse of spending, like the ""Great Contraction"" of the 1930s, and then there's the sort that's driven by greater output of real goods and services–that is, by outward shifts in aggregate supply rather than inward shifts in aggregate demand. Most of the deflation that occurred during the classical gold standard era (1873-1914) was of the latter, ""good"" sort.   
  
Although I've been banging the drum for good deflation since the 1990s, and Mike Bordo and others have made the specific point that the gold standard mostly involved inflation of the good rather than bad sort, too many economists, and way too many of those who have got more than their fare share of the public's attention, continue to ignore the very possibility of supply-driven deflation.   
  
Of the many misunderstandings propagated by economists' tendency to assume that deflation and depression must go hand-in-hand, none has been more pernicious than the widespread belief that throughout the U.S. and Europe, the entire period from 1873 to 1896 constituted one ""Great"" or ""Long Depression ."" That belief is now largely discredited, except perhaps among some newspaper pundits and die-hard Marxists, thanks to the efforts of G.B. Saul and others. The myth of a somewhat shorter ""Long Depression,"" lasting from 1873-1879, persists, however, though economic historians have begun chipping away at that one as well.   
  
  




Speaking of 1873, after claiming that a gold standard is undesirable because it makes deflation (and therefore, according to his reasoning, depression) more likely, Krugman observes:   




The gold bugs will no doubt reply that under a gold standard big bubbles couldn’t happen, and therefore there wouldn’t be major financial crises. And it’s true: under the gold standard America had no major financial panics other than in 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, 1907, 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933. Oh, wait.



Let me see if I understand this. If financial crises happen under base-money regime X, then that regime must be the cause of the crises, and is therefore best avoided. So if crises happen under a _fiat_ money regime, I guess we'd better stay away from fiat money. Oh, wait.   
  
You get the point: while the nature of an economy's monetary standard may have some bearing on the frequency of its financial crises, it hardly follows that that frequency depends mainly on its monetary standard rather than on other factors, like the structure, industrial and regulatory, of the financial system.   
  
That U.S. financial crises during the gold standard era had more to do with U.S. financial regulations than with the workings of the gold standard itself is recognized by all competent financial historians. The lack of branch banking made U.S. banks uniquely vulnerable to shocks, while Civil-War rules linked the supply of banknotes to the extent of the Federal government's indebtedness., instead of allowing that supply to adjust with seasonal and cyclical needs. But there's no need to delve into the precise ways in which such misguided legal restrictions to the umerous crises to which Krugman refers.  It should suffice to point out that Canada, which employed the very same gold dollar, depended heavily on exports to the U.S., and (owing to its much smaller size) was far less diversified, endured no banking crises at all, and very few bank failures, between 1870 and 1939.   
  
  




Since Keynes's reference to gold as a ""barbarous relic"" is so often quoted by the gold standard's critics, it seems only fair to repeat what Keynes had to say, a few years before, not about gold _per se_ , itself, but about the gold-standard era:   




What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August, 1914! The greater part of the population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of comfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this lot. But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages… He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighboring office of a bank or such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But, most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.



It would, of course, be foolish to suggest that the gold standard was entirely or even largely responsible for this Arcadia, such as it was. But it certainly did contribute both to the general abundance of goods of all sorts, to the ease with which goods and capital flowed from nation to nation, and, especially, to the sense of a state of affairs that was ""normal, certain, and permanent.""   
  
The gold standard achieved these things mainly by securing a degree of price-level and exchange rate stability and predictability that has never been matched since. According to Finn Kydland and Mark Wynne:   




The contrast between the price stability that prevailed in most countries under the gold standard and the instability under fiat standards is striking. This reflects the fact that under commodity standards (such as the gold standard), increases in the price level (which were frequently associated with wars) tended to be reversed, resulting in a price level that was stable over long periods. No such tendency is apparent under the fiat standards that most countries have followed since the breakdown of the gold standard between World War I and World War II.



The high degree of price level predictability, together with the system of fixed exchange rates that was incidental to the gold standard's widespread adoption, substantially reduced the riskiness of both production and international trade, while the commitment to maintain the standard resulted, as I noted, in considerably lower international borrowing costs.   
  
Those pundits who find it easy to say ""good riddance"" to the gold standard, in either its classical or its decadent variants, need to ask themselves what all the fuss over monetary ""reconstruction"" was about, following each of the world wars, if not achieving a simulacrum at least of the stability that the classical gold standard achieved. True, those efforts all failed. But that hardly means that the ends sought weren't very worthwhile ones, or that those who sought them were ""lulled by the myth of a golden age."" Though they may have entertained wrong beliefs concerning how the old system worked, they weren't wrong in believing that it _did_ work, somehow.   
  
  




But how? The once common view that the classical gold standard worked well only thanks to its having been carefully managed by the Bank of England and other central banks, as well as the related view that its success depended on international agreements and other forms of central bank cooperation, is now, thankfully, no longer subscribed to even by the gold-standard's more well-informed critics. Instead, as Julio Gallarotti observes, the outcomes of that standard ""were primarily the resultants [sic] of private transactions in the markets for goods and money"" rather than of any sort of government or central-bank management or intervention. But the now accepted view doesn't quite go far enough. In fact, central banks played no essential part at all in achieving the gold standard's most desirable outcomes, which could have been achieved as well, or better, by systems of competing banks-of-issue, and which were in fact achieved by means of such systems in many participating nations, including the United States, Switzerland (until 1901), and Canada. And although it is common for central banking advocates to portray such banks as sources of emergency liquidity to private banks, during the classical gold standard era liquidity assistance often flowed the other way, and did so notwithstanding monopoly privileges that gave central banks so many advantages over their commercial counterparts. As Gallarotti observes (p. 81),   




That central banks sometimes went to other central banks instead of the private market suggests nothing more than the fact that the rates offered by central banks were better, or too great an amount of liquidity may have been needed to be covered in the private market.



  




To the extent that central banks did exercise any special influence on gold-standard era monetary adjustments, that influence, instead of helping, made things worse. Because an expanding central bank isn't subject to the internal constraint of reserve losses stemming from adverse interbank clearings, it can create an external imbalance that must eventually trigger a disruptive drain of specie reserves. During liquidity crunches, on the other hand, central banks were more likely than commercial banks to become, in Jacob Viner's words, ""engaged in competitive increases of their discount rates and in raid's on each other's reserves."" Finally, central banks could and did muck-up the gold standard works by sterilizing gold inflows and outflows, violating the ""rules of the gold standard game"" that called for loosening in response to gold receipts and tightening in response to gold losses.   
  
Competing banks of issue could be expected to play by these ""rules,"" because doing so was consistent with profit maximization. The semi-public status of central banks, on the other hand, confronted them with a sort of dual mandate, in which profits had to be weighed against other, ""public"" responsibilities (ibid., pp. 117ff.). Of the latter, the most pernicious was the perceived obligation to occasionally set aside the requirements for preserving international monetary equilibrium (""external balance"") for the sake of preserving or achieving preferred domestic monetary conditions (""internal balance""). As Barry Ickes observes, playing by the gold standards rules could be ""very unpopular, potentially, as it involves sacrificing internal balance for external balance."" Commercial bankers couldn't care less. Central bankers, on the other hand, had to care when to not care was to risk losing some of their privileges.   
  
Today, of course, achieving internal balance is generally considered the _sine qua non_ of sound central bank practice; and even where fixed or at least stable exchange rates are considered desirable it is taken for granted that external balance ought occasionally to be sacrificed for the sake of preserving domestic monetary stability. But to apply such thinking to the classical gold standard, and thereby conclude that in that context a similar sacrifice of external for internal stability represented a turn toward more enlightened monetary policy, is to badly misunderstand the nature of that arrangement, which was not just a fixed exchange rate arrangement but something more akin to an multinational monetary union or currency area. Within such an area, the fact that one central bank gains reserves while another looses them was itself no more significant, and no more a justification for violating the ""rules of the game,"" than the fact that a commercial bank somewhere gained reserves at the expense of another.   
  
The presence of central banks did, however, tend to aggravate the disturbing effects of changes in international trade patterns compared to the case of international free banking. Central-bank sterilization of gold flows could, on the other hand, lead to more severe longer-run adjustments, as it was to do, to a far more dramatic extent, in the interwar period.   
  
  




I know I'm about to skate onto thin ice, so let me be more precise. To say that ""The gold standard caused the Great Depression "" (or words to that effect, like ""the gold standard was itself the principal threat to financial stability and economic prosperity between the wars”), is at best extremely misleading. The more accurate claim is that the Great Depression was triggered by the collapse of the jury-rigged version of the gold standard cobbled together after World War I, which was really a hodge-podge of genuine, gold-exchange, and gold-bullion versions of the gold standard, the last two of which were supposed to ""economize"" on gold. Call it ""gold standard light.""   
  
Admittedly there is one sense in which the _real_ gold standard can be said to have contributed to the disastrous shenanigans of the 1920s, and hence to the depression that followed. It contributed by failing to survive the outbreak of World War I. The prewar gold standard thus played the part of Humpty Dumpty to the King's and Queen's men who were to piece the still-more-fragile postwar arrangement together. Yet even this is being a bit unfair to gold, for the fragility of the gold standard on the eve of World War I was itself largely due to the fact that, in most of the belligerent nations, it had come to be administered by central banks that were all-too easily dragooned by their sponsoring governments into serving as instruments of wartime inflationary finance.   
  
Kydland and Wynne offer the case of the Bank of Sweden as illustrating the practical impossibility of preserving a gold standard in the face of a major shock:   




During the period in which Sweden adhered to the gold standard (1873–1914), the Swedish constitution guaranteed the convertibility into gold of banknotes issued by the Bank of Sweden. Furthermore, laws pertaining to the gold standard could only be changed by two identical decisions of the Swedish Parliament, with an election in between. Nevertheless, when World War I broke out, the Bank of Sweden unilaterally decided to make its notes inconvertible. The constitutionality of this step was never challenged, thus ending the gold standard era in Sweden.



The episode seems rather less surprising, however, when one considers that ""the Bank of Sweden,"" which secured a monopoly of Swedish paper currency in 1901, is more accurately known as the Sveriges Riksbank, or ""Bank of the Swedish Parliament.""   
  
If the world crisis of the 1930s was triggered by the failure, not of the classical gold standard, but of a hybrid arrangement, can it not be said that the U.S. , which was among the few nations that retained a full-fledged gold standard, was fated by that decision to suffer a particularly severe downturn? According to Brad DeLong,   




Commitment to the gold standard prevented Federal Reserve action to expand the money supply in 1930 and 1931–and forced President Hoover into destructive attempts at budget-balancing in order to avoid a gold standard-generated run on the dollar.



It's true that Hoover tried to balance the Federal budget, and that his attempt to do so had all sorts of unfortunate consequences. But the gold standard, far from forcing his hand, had little to do with it. Hoover simply subscribed to the prevailing orthodoxy favoring a balanced budget. So, for that matter, did FDR, until events forced him too change his tune: during the 1932 presidential campaign the New-Dealer-to-be assailed his opponent both for running a deficit and for his government's excessive spending.   
  
As for the gold standard's having prevented the Fed from expanding the money supply (or, more precisely, from expanding the monetary base to keep the broader money supply from shrinking), nothing could be further from the truth. Dick Timberlake sets the record straight:   




By August 1931, Fed gold had reached $3.5 billion (from $3.1 billion in 1929), an amount that was 81 percent of outstanding Fed monetary obligations and more than double the reserves required by the Federal Reserve Act. Even in March 1933 at the nadir of the monetary contraction, Federal Reserve Banks had more than $1 billion of excess gold reserves.



Moreover,   




Whether Fed Banks had excess gold reserves or not, all of the Fed Banks’ gold holdings were expendable in a crisis. The Federal Reserve Board had statutory authority to suspend all gold reserve requirements for Fed Banks for an indefinite period.



Nor, according to a statistical study by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Christina Romer, did the Fed have reason to fear that by allowing its reserves to decline it would have raised fears of a devaluation. On the contrary: by taking steps to avoid a monetary contraction, the Fed would have helped to allay fears of a devaluation, while, in Timberlake's words, initiating a ""spending dynamic"" that would have helped to restore ""all the monetary vitals both in the United States and the rest of the world.""   
  
  




Just as ""paper"" always beats ""rock"" in the rock-paper-scissors game, so does managed paper money always beat gold in the rock-paper monetary standards game economists like to play. But that's only because under a fiat standard _any_ pattern of money supply adjustment is possible, including a ""perfect"" pattern, where ""perfect"" means perfect according to the player's own understanding. Even under the best of circumstances a gold standard is, on the other hand, unlikely to achieve any economist's ideal of monetary perfection. Hence, paper beats rock. More precisely, paper beats rock, _on paper_.   
  
And what does this impeccable logic tell us concerning the relative merits of gold versus paper money in practice? Diddly-squat. I mean it. To say something about the relative merits of paper and gold, you have to have theories–good ol' fashioned, rational optimizing firm and agent theories–of how the supply of basic money adjusts under various conditions in the two sorts of monetary regimes. We have a pretty good theory of the gold standard, meaning one that meshes well with how that standard actually worked. The theory of fiat money is, in contrast, a joke, in part because it's much harder to pin-down central bankers' objectives (or any objectives apart from profit-maximization, which is at play in the case of gold), but mostly thanks to economists' tendency to simply assume that central bankers behave like omniscient angels who, among other things, understand the finer points of DSGE models. That may do for a graduate class, or a paper in the _AER_. But good economics it most certainly isn't.   




***



I close with a few words concerning why it matters that we get the facts straight about the gold standard. It isn't simply a matter of winning people over to that standard. Though I'm perhaps as ready as anyone to shed a tear for the old gold standard, I doubt that we can ever again create anything like it. But getting a proper grip on gold serves, not just to make the gold standard seem less unattractive than it is often portrayed to be, but to remove some of the sheen that has been applied to modern fiat-money arrangements using the same brush by which gold has been blackened. The point, in other words, isn't to make a pitch for gold. It's to make a pitch for something –anything– that's better than our present, lousy money.

"Seventeen years ago, the Middle East was a more hopeful place. Newspapers were filled with accounts of peace negotiations. Israel was in the midst of withdrawing its troops from southern Lebanon, in advance of an   summit at Camp David. It was Bill Clinton’s last year as president, and expectations were rising that he would broker the comprehensive peace agreement that had eluded his predecessors. I lived in Israel, my first assignment as an American diplomat. During my time there, I eagerly traveled across the region, taking advantage of what I realize now was a period of exceptional openness. As I neared the end of my assignment, there was only one neighboring country I had not visited: Syria, a dictatorship frozen in time and overflowing with archaeological sites. With the prospect of peace on the horizon, I was determined to visit before it became a major tourist destination. So back in April 2000, after some nimble arranging, I traveled across Syria for a week and returned to Israel satisfied with my journey. And then as I was stationed in other countries and on other continents, the trip to Syria faded into background. Years would go by without my remembering it. Then in 2016, the trip flooded back as the Syrian civil war unleashed its fury on Aleppo, my favorite of the cities I visited. I was seized with a fever to remember more. From my current vantage point  —   42 years old, the father of three young children  —   the trip seemed ludicrous. Did I really backpack through Syria while hiding my status as an American diplomat? Of course then, it would have seemed just as ludicrous to imagine that events in Syria would become a horrific tragedy and that borders would clang shut around the world, starting with our own. As news reports about Aleppo grew worse last summer, my daily life in Chicago bumped along. It was humid, rainy and hot. Tomatoes grew like weeds and vines dangled from every bush, trying to stretch into new territory. But my mind kept returning to that trip long ago. At first I found little evidence of it in boxes of my past: no pictures or journal entries. To help jog my memory, I ordered a copy of the 1999 Lonely Planet Syria guide I had used. When it arrived in the mail, I opened to the introduction and read a passage that is now cruelly out of date: “Along with Jordan,” Syria is “probably the single most safe country for travelers in the whole of the region. The closest you’ll come to being hijacked is to be dragged off by a friendly local to drink tea and chat. ” As I paged through the guidebook, details started to return. At the time, Syria refused entry to those with Israeli stamps in their passports, but I had both tourist and diplomatic passports, which helped circumvent this problem. I flew from Tel Aviv to Amman and prepared to enter Syria with my tourist passport. My diplomatic passport, filled with Israeli border stamps and residency permits, lay hidden at the bottom of my duffel bag. In Amman, I went straight to a bus depot, where I found a taxi about to leave for Damascus. It was not really a taxi  —   just a driver and his car, a   version of UberPool. But the driver spoke a little English and confirmed that he was leaving for Damascus right away. That was enough for me. I crammed inside with three other men, and we left Amman. I started to worry about a   later when we made an unscheduled stop in a deserted village. The driver and the other passengers, who seemed to know each other, loaded the trunk with boxes. It looked suspicious. We started up again, heading for the border. Evening turned to night. Wedged between silent men in the back of the car, my thoughts kept returning to those boxes in the trunk. Had I somehow chosen a smuggler’s car for my crossing into Syria? Not good, especially with an American diplomatic passport hidden in my bag. The Jordanian countryside grew desolate, nothing but empty land as far as the eye could see. I panicked, and wondered whether I should open the car door and fling myself out. Luckily, I did not. Instead, I took out a package of Fig Newtons, bought at the American Embassy commissary in Tel Aviv. I opened the package theatrically and offered biscuits to everyone in the car. The effect was immediate. Perhaps they just needed sugar. Or maybe they had never tasted Fig Newtons. Whatever the reason, the mood changed in a heartbeat. Smiles flashed in the darkness, the radio was turned up, and   Arabic filled the car, interspersed with the words “Fig Newton. ” A few minutes later, we passed through Jordanian border control and approached the Syrian crossing, a large,   building in the distance. We parked nearby everyone climbed out with the air of people who had done this type of thing before. I got out too, but trailed behind, unsure of what to do. Then the young man who had been sitting to my right turned around and looked at me. Possibly sensing my unease, he waited for me to catch up, smiled and said “Fig Newton!” I nodded eagerly. He reached for my hand, held it tight, and we walked together like that to the Syrian border. Men holding hands in a demonstration of friendship was common during my time in the Middle East, but it was new to me. For a second I was uncertain, but then, as we walked toward the border in the dark, I felt grateful and hoped my hand was not too sweaty. My friend joked with the border guards and looked at me with a certain amount of affection. I heard “Fig Newton” in the middle of a stream of Arabic. They stamped our passports, and we were through. It was after midnight when we arrived in Damascus. The city was quiet, as was the car  —   we had all become sleepy. We waved silent goodbyes. I left them the package of cookies, walked to a small   hotel and passed out on the thin mattress. For the next few days, I explored the old cities of Damascus and Aleppo. I bought souvenirs. I ate frozen ice and watched the groaning water wheels in the city of Hama. I visited ancient houses where the walls were being used as cattle pens. There was more to see, and I vowed to return. On the way back to Jordan, I took an   bus and avoided the drama of my entry. Upon my return to Tel Aviv, I put my souvenirs in boxes and started preparing for my next diplomatic assignment, to Haiti. Years passed and my memories of the trip to Syria faded away, replaced by the steady accretion of other life experiences. In recent months, I finally found the box containing mementos and letters from that era, and discovered a brass door knocker bought in a Damascus antique shop. It is in the shape of a hand with long, elegant fingers clenching what appears to be a pomegranate. I promptly installed it on the door of my study. Amid holiday cards, letters from my   grandmother, and an inexplicably saved candy wrapper, I found a blank postcard depicting the dictator Hafez   and his two sons, their heads floating in a murky green background. I also found my diplomatic passport  —   the one filled with Israeli stamps that had been hidden at the bottom of my duffel bag. Other memories appeared in vivid bursts. A rug merchant’s store, tucked into one of the Aleppo souk’s narrow passageways. Rugs in piles tens of feet high, covering every available space. They even covered his desk. In his sales pitch, the merchant said that the rug I had chosen could function as a “” framing any room to enhance its appeal. It sounded convincing, though I still do not really understand what it means. Then I remembered the oud. Walking into my wife’s office, I found the curved instrument that looks like a pear cut in half. As I held it in my arms I suddenly could picture the store in Aleppo where I bought it. The merchant was an older man, instantly wary when he saw me push open the door. We spoke in halting French. I pointed to an oud that I liked and asked him about it. He described it in basic, nonflowery terms. The gist was  —   it is an oud it was made in Aleppo. I bargained to get the price down. He looked crestfallen, so I quickly agreed to the original price. Then I left. The encounter took maybe five minutes. Afterward, I walked along Aleppo’s boulevards and admired the tall apartment buildings that seemed like the very heart of the city. Like the door knocker and the postcard showing the Syrian dictators, this oud had traveled with us to every diplomatic assignment  —   to Haiti, to Paris, to New York, to Canada. Now it sits in our apartment in Chicago. It has left its case several times, and has never been played properly. I thought of the old man who sold it to me, and wondered whether he might have made it. It was like the completion of a thought that began 17 years ago. Again and again, I see him standing up in the   store as the bell chimes, ready to meet whoever walks through the door. The memory is so vivid that it could have happened hours ago. Something like this happened once to my father. One evening we were watching the rain pour down thick and straight. He leaned back in his chair and sank into himself for a minute. Then he looked at me and said, “The smell reminds me of Africa. ” He was talking about the rain splattering into the soil, humus lifting up in waves from the ground. I could tell from his expression that he was swimming in memories.   years had melted away and he was back in Ivory Coast as a young Peace Corps volunteer, if only for an instant. Both of us had experienced the lifelong impact of travel, the way that it can echo for decades. My trip to Syria lasted only a few days, and yet it has apparently attached to my life like a barnacle. It clings to me, mostly forgotten, but once in a while it asserts its presence. The result is an upswelling of memory so strong that it feels like time travel. It is the umami of life, infusing ordinary days with unexpected flavor. Memories of travel can linger for a lifetime. But it gets even better. Memories bestow the same benefits as the original trip: They build empathy, broaden perspectives, and remind us, again and again, of our common humanity. They help rattle the cage of assumptions we build through the years. Most of all, they are a gift we give to ourselves  —   a transfer of spirit from our younger,   versions to the people we are right now."

FOCUS writes that The Swedish King is active when it comes to climate protection, drives a hybrid car, eats little meat and “tries to save energy in the Palace“. Carl XVI Gustaf says:
That’s not very easy in such an old house.“
According to Wikipedia:
The interior of the palace consists of 1,430 rooms of which 660 have windows. The palace contains apartments for the Royal families, representation and festivities such as the State Apartments, the Guest Apartments and the Bernadotte Apartments. […] A comprehensive renovation of the facade began in 2011, to repair weather damaged parts made from sandstone. The repairs are estimated to cost approx. 500 million crowns (about US $77 million) during a period of 22 years.”
The Wikipedia site has lots of photos of the interior and exterior of the King’s humble and low energy abode.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCaught at climate denial? Leonardo DiCaprio and model Kelly Rohrbach split
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin. Note: Quotes by DiCaprio translated from the German)
On December 30, 2015, the Bauer Media Group made an important announcement with a press release:
Leonardo DiCaprio in TV movie: “My partner has to believe in climate change.”
Hamburg (ots) – In ‘The Revenant’ (Release: 6 January 2016) Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of a hunter set in the year 1823 where he fights to survive in the wilderness. To make the movie as realistic as possible, director Iñárritu rolled the film in the most remote and harsh conditions. ‘We were constantly struggling with the cold temperatures”, complained DiCaprio in a talk with TV Movie (Edition 1/2016, EVT 30 December 2015). ‘Foremost our face and hands suffered under the extreme cold. At times the temperatures hovered around -40°C.’
One uncomfortable experience was the eating of bison liver. ‘That was pretty extreme, but of course it doesn’t compare to what they had to do in the wilderness back then,’ says the 41-year old. ‘But I already knew beforehand what I was in for. I didn’t expect I would have much fun during the filming.’ Shooting at other locations in other parts of the world were nicer. ‘Among the most impressive was a trip to the Amazon. It is beautiful there,’ admires DiCaprio. As a friend of nature and environmentalist, ecological commitment is a must in a relationship: ‘I could never be together with someone who doesn’t believe in climate change.’
Advisory to editors:
The complete interview with Leonardi DiCaprio appears in the TV Movie (Issue 1/2016, EVT 30 December 2015). The press release is free to publish with the provision of the source: ‘TV Movie’. For editorial questions, contact Rüdiger Rapke, Editor, TV Movie, Telephone: (+49) 40/3019-3666.”
Erdbeerlounge.de suspects DiCaprio recently split up with model Kelly Rohrbach because he discovered her climate denial:
Solo again? Leonardo DiCaprio: climate change the reason for calling it off?
With Leonardo DiCaprio things just refuse to work out on matters surrounding love: Now his relationship with model Kelly Rohrbach supposedly has failed. Were opposing views on climate change the reason for suddenly splitting? DAccording to Leo, it is a criterion for an immediate split.”

"As the effects of climate change rapidly alter communities, economies and natural systems, the need to advance new solutions to what may be the most pressing biological challenge of our time has never been more urgent. One important part of the puzzle involves unlocking the natural genetic diversity of plants to identify those species and populations best able to cope with changing conditions. Just as researchers have used genetics to improve food production, it can also provide solutions that maintain biodiversity and protect the services provided by native ecosystems. Genetics holds the potential to benefit native systems that range from prairies to pine forests and coral reefs. Plants are well known to possess extensive genetic variation in drought and temperature tolerance, water-use efficiency, and other traits that can prove critical for surviving climate changes and avoiding extinction. Changing climatic conditions not only affect the plants themselves, but also other organisms that influence plant communities. For example, changing conditions may increase pest and pathogen outbreaks or allow an invasive species to move into an area that was previously inhospitable. Importantly, plants also exhibit genetic variation in their responses to pests and invasive species that can be used to mitigate their negative effects. The use of genetics will become increasingly important in regions suffering from climate change. For example, in western US, drought and higher temperatures have doubled the rate of tree mortality since 1995, with mortality rates accelerating over time. Pinyon pine, an iconic and dominant species in the West, has suffered nearly 100% mortality at sites in Colorado and Arizona, where climate change has made trees more susceptible to bark beetle outbreaks that in turn result in increased wildfires. Fortunately, plant genomes – all of an organism’s genetic information – are a vast storehouse of genetic variability that can be used to help prevent the loss of species suffering from climate change. New technology and research platforms are making it possible for researchers to identify those individuals and populations that will survive in the climates of the future and in the face of the myriad cascading effects of climate change. Genetics-based environmental research is already helping to restore damaged and degraded landscapes. For more than 30 years, a consortium of researchers has examined how genetic variation in the cottonwood tree can affect entire communities of organisms from microbes to mammals. This research has been involved with a 50-year, US$626 million effort on the lower Colorado River that shows major genetics-based differences in the success of different populations that the Bureau of Reclamation and other agencies are using to restore riparian habitat. From such combined restoration-research experiments, scientists can learn which genetic lines are most likely to survive future climates. Understanding a plant’s response to climate conditions requires the integration of diverse sciences to examine how changing conditions influence the plant through its life history and that of its offspring. Plant species become adapted to local conditions over thousands of years, meaning that what is locally adapted today could do poorly tomorrow as the climate changes. Thus, genetics-based research can help identify those individuals that possess superior traits that will allow them to survive in a future climate. This type of research involves interdisciplinary teams of climate-change scientists, biologists, geneticists, modellers and engineers who are using and developing new technologies and research platforms to unlock the vast stores of information within plant genomes. One of these advances is the Southwest Experimental Garden Array, or SEGA, a US$5m facility which was made possible with support from the National Science Foundation, Northern Arizona University and diverse public and private land owners. SEGA is a new genetics-based climate-change research platform that allows scientists to quantify the ecological and evolutionary responses of species exposed to changing climate conditions. SEGA will create a system of 10 gardens along a steep elevation gradient in northern Arizona. Because temperature and moisture predictably change with elevation, these gardens reflect climate differences – ranging from desert to alpine forest – that mimic the effects of climate change. By planting the same plant species and genotypes in different environments, scientists can identify which ones perform best and are most likely to survive changing conditions. SEGA is the first research platform of its kind in the world, but it must be transferred to, and replicated by, global partners, if the potential benefits of genetics-based approaches are to be realised on a broader scale. Similarly, this approach requires the education of a new generation of scientists trained in diverse disciplines – individuals who can collaborate on complex biological problems involving whole communities of organisms. Despite the enormous challenges, we live in a time when knowledge and technology can be used to ensure the survival of whole ecosystems and the people who depend upon them. Genetics-based approaches seek to harness the natural genetic variation that exists in wild-populations to restore damaged natural systems and mitigate climate and other global change impacts. While native ecosystems are being challenged as never before, the use of genetics offers new solutions that hold great promise. This article first appeared on LiveScience."

The commentary points out that some of the main elements of today’s environmental and climate movement sweeping across Europe were and are common among fascism and Nazi ideology.
In a nutshell: Yes, it’s good to be concerned about the environment, but let’s not get fanatic about it.
The relationship between the fascism and the green movement are well established, though maybe not very well known. The root of green is in fact quite brown. This is one aspect of the green movement that many environmentalists prefer not to bring up.
Donnerwetter.de tells readers:
The core and fulcrum of modern ecologists and climate fascists is the view that mankind is the enemy of nature, and that we are all guilty of destroying nature. Nature stands for the ‘Good’ and the ‘Precious’, while man plays no role.
Rules of nature in the form of a falsely understood Darwinism are applied to mankind so that social responsibility no longer plays a role.
The rules for human interaction are taken from nature. Subjection to a ruling ‘race’ is accepted as a given. Nature above all and everyone: This way of thinking is very common among the extreme animal and nature protection parties.
Until the romanticists rediscovered nature in the 19th century, it had been considered more as a danger – as wilderness in which one could quickly starve and die. Today many ecologists see only the romantic side of nature; perhaps because man has been so dominant in crowding it out.”
“Carrying capacity” of “less than a billion people”
Donnerwetter continues:

Finally, fascist ideologies are used when it comes to the world’s population. To be more precise, for reducing humanity to its level of ‘sustainability’. In Germany many hold views such as ‘There are too many’ and ‘war and selection are needed’ and even don’t shy away from expressing it publicly.”
This reminds us how once the high profile director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, also advisor to the Vatican and Chancellor Angela Merkel, once said that the “carrying capacity” of the earth was “less than a billion people“. Sadly many climate scientists and activists seconded this personal population-hostile observation.
Climate friendly veganism/vegetarianism popular among Nazis
One major component of the green environmental movement is vegetarianism/veganism. These diets, comprising little or no animal-based foods, today are being increasingly heralded as climate friendly, and moral with respect to animal welfare and nature protection. It turns out that the promotion of these dietary practices and beliefs is nothing new as vegetarianism was the preferred choice of Nazi leaders and their ideology. The Israeli-based Haaretz here wrote recently: “The Nazis were Vegans, Too“. As reader the comments show, environmentalists and granola eaters were outraged Haaretz would remind us of that inconvenient psychosis.
Nazis ate organic
At WND here Ellis Washington writes how the Nazis were avid organic eaters, writing that Hitler had been inspired by his favorite composer Richard Wagner who “argued in an 1891 essay that meat-eating and race-mixing were the twin causes of man’s alienation from the natural world. Wagner demanded a ‘true and hearty fellowship with the vegetarians, the protectors of animals, and the friends of temperance.'”
Recently reader Stefan B. sent NTZ an article from a 1937 newspaper, Der Schwarze Korps, which extoled the virtues of vegetarian diets.

Among the propaganda in the full page feature stories shown above is a comparison between plant-eating horses, which are said to physically outperform flesh- eating dogs. It also notes that the raising of livestock for food requires far more agricultural land than food from grains, etc., i.e. the very same arguments we hear over and over again from environmental elitists today.
Of course being a proponent of organic or vegetarian diets alone does not automatically make one a (potential) fascist. What does send up a red flags, however, is how such a person views mankind’s place on the planet, i.e. as a legitimate inhabitant or as a pest that needs to be harshly dealt with. Too often it is the latter.

"During the “polar vortex” that recently swept the US, Chicago’s Lincoln Park Zoo was forced to bring its polar bear indoors as it was “too cold” for a bear acclimated to Chicago’s “normal” winters (where temperatures of -20°C are not uncommon). As if on cue, a chorus of media pundits and politicians sang the end of global warming.  We should all know better of course. Fluctuations in the weather, like the recent shift in the polar vortex that brought Arctic deep-freeze to much of the US, will continue, and even be magnified, as the earth steadily warms. Laws of physics require the world to warm as long as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations rise. And while North America experienced deep freeze, much of the rest of the world sweltered under record heat, and the globe’s average temperature continued to rise. For wild polar bears, the continuing rise of the earth’s temperature is a problem. During 30 years of studying these bears in Alaska, I documented positive and then negative trends in their status. In the early 1980s I discovered Alaska’s great white bears had recovered from the excessive hunting that ceased in the 1970s. By the middle of the last decade, however, I witnessed dramatic changes in the sea ice, with increasingly obvious negative effects on the bears.  As had previously been documented in Canada’s Hudson Bay, we noticed reduced stature and physical condition of some sex and age groups.  More importantly, survival rates especially of young bears were declining. Although female bears continued to give birth, more and more of their cubs were starving to death before reaching their first birthday. Clearly, this was a trend that could not be sustained. In September of 2007, after exhaustive analysis of all of the available data, my colleagues and I predicted that we could lose two thirds of the world’s polar bears by the middle of this century — perhaps all of them by 2100. That prediction led to the listing of polar bears as a Threatened Species under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) – the first species listed under the ESA due to human-caused global warming. Polar bears occur in 19 populations spread across the vast Arctic expanse. They will not all respond to a warming world in exactly the same way or at the same time. Some already feel the effects others may not for years. But the near-term variation in effects of warming should not distract us from the ultimate certainty that polar bears will disappear without our help.   According to the fossil record, polar bears have specialised to catch seals from the surface of sea ice for more than 120,000 years. They cannot make a living anywhere else. Nobody claims pandas would suddenly take up eating fish if there is a bamboo failure, or that orangutans will adapt if their old growth forests are converted to coffee and palm oil plantations. Similarly we cannot expect polar bears to suddenly start making a living in an Arctic where the critical habitat is fast fading. Even those bears living in the farthest north reaches of their range will ultimately lose the sea ice habitat on which they depend if the warming is allowed to continue. In 2010, my colleagues and I published a paper showing that preventing the disappearance of polar bears is all about reducing our use of fossil fuels and halting the rise in global temperatures. We showed there is still time to save polar bears.  We can solve this problem, but for each year we delay action, the challenges become more daunting. Because they depend on a habitat that literally melts as temperatures rise, polar bears are truly an early hallmark of human-caused climate change. The prospect of the polar bear’s demise also is a signal that we need to think differently about this conservation challenge. Past efforts to protect threatened species included “on the ground” measures such as fighting poachers, or building fences around important habitat. We cannot, however, build a fence to protect the ice from rising temperatures. Polar bear conservation cannot be done in the Arctic. It requires each of us to do what we can to minimise our dependence on fossil fuels. This means walking and biking instead of driving, insulating our homes, and turning the thermostat down in winter and the air-conditioning off in summer. But putting these changes in place, in time, requires policy-level leadership. Society’s reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable, and is presently maintained only because we are deferring its associated costs to future generations. Policies that require we pay the true costs of using ancient carbon, such as implementing emissions trading schemes and raising the social cost of carbon, could save the polar bear from extinction. More importantly, it would level the commercial playing field, making renewable energy and other sustainable practices more competitive. The resulting competition, in turn, would create jobs and preserve a climate that will sustain not just polar bears but the rest of us as well. Because without fundamental change the polar bear’s fate, while it may come sooner, will ultimately also be ours."
"**There are regular onions, and then there are onions too sexy for Facebook, a Canadian seed and garden supply store recently discovered.**
The Seed Company by EW Gaze, in St John's, Newfoundland, had wanted to post a seemingly innocent advert for Walla Walla onion seeds on Facebook.
But to their surprise, it was rejected for being ""overtly sexual"".
In a statement on Wednesday, the social media company apologised for the error made by its automated technology.
The ad flagged by Facebook showed Walla Walla onions, known for their size and sweet flavour, piled in a wicker basket with some sliced onion on the side.
It took store manager Jackson McLean a moment to realise what the issue was with the posting, he said.
Then he figured out that ""something about the round shapes"" could be suggestive of breasts or buttocks.
He knew his customers would find the ad rejection funny, and posted the photo, along with the automated Facebook message warning ""listings may not position products or services in a sexually suggestive manner"", to the company page.
Mr McLean said some clients have been posting images of potentially suggestive carrots and pumpkins in reply.
He also appealed the decision to Facebook.
""We use automated technology to keep nudity off our apps, but sometimes it doesn't know a Walla Walla onion from a, well, you know,"" Facebook Canada's head of communications, Meg Sinclair, told BBC.
""We restored the ad and are sorry for the business's trouble.""
The company is in the process of digitising its whole inventory to make shopping online more accessible amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mr McLean said, and that included boosting some advertisements, like the onion one, on Facebook.
The Walla Walla onions, ""an older onion variety"", had recently brought back in stock by customer request, and are now selling fast due to their newfound notoriety, he said.
""We've sold more in the last three days than in the last five years,"" said Mr McLean, adding they are also now listed under ""sexy onions"" on the company website."

A dear friend sent me a note the other day that I thought was prescient, as it relates to the alarmism side of climate, where we see fear stories being propagated by the media on an almost daily basis. Many of the fears spread by climate alarmism pander to the base emotions of people.
So with permission, I repeat it here.
Fears are all subject to the climate, just sometimes it’s an emotional climate.

Chinese president Xi Jinping discarded term limits and is preparing to rule for life like an emperor of old. Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el‐​Sisi is preparing to follow Xi’s example as his supporters propose similarly amending the constitution and allowing him to become a modern pharaoh.



Five years ago General el‐​Sisi staged a coup, arrested the elected president, Mohamed Morsi, killed hundreds of pro‐​Morsi demonstrators, and jailed tens of thousands of opponents, critics and demonstrators. Having suppressed all serious opposition, el‐​Sisi took over as president and in 2014 staged a faux election, winning more than 97 percent of the vote over minor opposition.



El‐​Sisi staged an electoral repeat in March. This time several would‐​be opponents, including with military backgrounds, sought to oppose him, but he arrested or intimidated them all. For instance, Abdel Moniem Aboul Fotouh, a 2012 presidential candidate, was detailed along with fifteen party members and placed on the official terrorism list. Sami Anan, el-Sisi’s predecessor as army chief of staff, was arrested, and a top member of his campaign, Hisham Geneina, el-Sisi’s former anti‐​corruption chief, was sentenced to five years in prison.



This process winnowed the opposition field to a self‐​professed supporter, who said he was “not here to challenge the president” (and was pushed into the race by el-Sisi’s minions). Of course, the Egyptian president denied any connection to the remarkable string of bad luck which afflicted his potential opponents. His spokesman said that “neither Sisi’s morals nor his dignity let him prevent any other person from running.”



El‐​Sisi abandoned the pretense of a free vote not because he might lose—his officials would be counting the votes, after all—but to prevent even a small split within the military and development of any political opposition. Unsurprisingly, el‐​Sisi again took an enviable 97 percent of the vote. However, despite the regime threatening fines, job loss, police raids, and more for those who failed to vote and promising benefits including bribes, financial prizes, trips, food, and community grants and projects for those who did, total turnout was just 41 percent, down six points from the previous poll. Seven percent of ballots cast were spoiled. A website republished a _New York Times_ article on the government’s election machinations, only to be fined and closed.





Washington cannot make Egypt free, but it should stop enthusiastically embracing and subsidizing those who hold an entire country in bondage.



Thus have ended the hopes and dreams surrounding the 2011 revolution.



There was much to criticize about the brief presidency of Islamist Mohamed Morsi elected in 2012, but he was no tyrant. To the contrary, he failed to control the bureaucracy, police, or military. Antagonistic businessmen sought to create economic chaos. The police refused to protect his party’s headquarters from a mob. He was ousted after Saudi Arabia funded street protests and promised aid to el‐​Sisi if the latter seized control. The revolutionary regime that was supposed to liberate Egypt morphed into the dictatorship that it had replaced, just like in George Orwell’s Animal Farm.



Freedom House rates Egypt as not free, near the bottom on both political rights and civil liberties. The group’s latest report explained: “Serious political opposition is virtually nonexistent, as both liberal and Islamist activists face criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Terrorism persists unabated in the Sinai Peninsula and has also struck the Egyptian mainland, despite the government’s use of aggressive and often abusive tactics to combat it.”



Egypt’s civil liberties rating dropped “due to the approval of a restrictive law on nongovernmental organizations and a crackdown on activity by labor unions that are not recognized by the government.” Only government‐​controlled unions were recognized by the government and last December a new law dissolved all independent ones. NGOs also “have faced mass closures as well as harassment in the form of office raids, arrests of members, lengthy legal cases, and restrictions on travel.” Unsurprisingly, the “media sector is dominated by progovernment outlets, as most critical or opposition‐​oriented outlets were shut down in the wake of the coup.”



Little is private or protected. Explained Freedom House: “The security services have reportedly upgraded their surveillance equipment and techniques in recent years so as to better monitor social media platforms and mobile phone applications. Pro‐​government media figures and state officials regularly call for national unity and suggest that only enemies of the state would criticize the authorities. These pressures have led to more self‐​censorship and guarded discussion among ordinary Egyptians.”



The political system is rigged. Minorities face discrimination that prevents them from even the limited political participation of the general population. But as the latest presidential vote demonstrated, politics is only for show. Freedom House noted that el‐​Sisi “has ruled in a style that entrenches military privilege and shields the armed forces from accountability for their actions.” At the same time, “corruption is pervasive at all levels of government.”



There is no system of justice. The government extended its control over the courts. Moreover, explained Freedom House: “A series of mass trials in recent years have resulted in harsh sentences, including life imprisonment or the death penalty, based on negligible evidence.” Additionally, thousands of civilians have been sent to military courts for conviction, er, “trial.”



Amnesty International’s 2017–2018 report is equally negative. Among the highlights, human‐​rights NGOs were silenced, freedom of assembly and expression was denied, arbitrary arrests and detentions were common, extrajudicial disappearances and executions were standard operating procedure, trials were unfair, freedom of labor and religion were denied, and much more.



Reported Amnesty International: “The authorities used torture and other ill‐​treatment and enforced disappearance against hundreds of people, and dozens were extrajudicially executed with impunity. The crackdown on civil society escalated with NGO staff being subjected to additional interrogations, travel bans and asset freezes. Arbitrary arrests and detentions followed by grossly unfair trials of government critics, peaceful protesters, journalists and human‐​rights defenders were routine. Mass unfair trials continued before civilian and military courts, with dozen sentenced to death. Women continued to be subjected to sexual and gender‐​based violence and were discriminated against in law and practice. The authorities brought criminal charges for defamation of religion and ‘habitual debauchery’ on the basis of people’s real or perceived sexual orientation.”



Human Rights Watch titled its January report “Egypt: Untamed Repression?” Never mind el-Sisi’s protestations of fidelity to democracy and human rights. Reported Human Rights Watch: “Al-Sisi’s government during 2017 observed few boundaries on its untamed repression of all forms of dissent.” The regime “introduced a host of repressive laws, reinstated the abusive state of emergency, and sent thousands of civilians to military courts that, along with civilian courts, issued scores of death sentences in flawed trials.”



The list of abuses is long: intolerance toward dissent, “near‐​absolute impunity for abuses by security forces,” mass roundups, arbitrary detention, torture, property seizures, and use of military tribunals against civilians, stifling the independent sector, and “disappearing” critics, almost four hundred in the space of a year. In the latter case people are arrested and then simply vanish, sometimes later resurfacing in government custody.



Zubeida Ibrahim spoke to BBC about the disappearance of her daughter. Early in March she was arrested and her lawyer, Ezzat Ghonim, disappeared. Ghonim was Amnesty International’s North Africa campaigns director. AI also cited three democracy/​opposition activists similarly kidnapped by the el‐​Sisi regime in February.



Last fall Human Rights Watch published a detailed report on the government’s use of torture: “Since July 2013, when Egypt’s military overthrew the country’s first freely elected president, torture has returned as the calling card of the security services, and the lack of punishment for its routine practice has helped define the authoritarianism of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s administration.” The document included accounts from numerous detainees who had been tortured by Egyptian security forces.



Even the State Department, despite President Trump’s bromance with his Egyptian counterpart, painted a grim picture. According to the State Department’s human‐​rights report last year, which spanned fifty‐​nine pages, “the most significant human‐​rights problems were excessive use of force by security forces, deficiencies in due process, and the suppression of civil liberties.” Among the specifics: Use of preventive custody and military courts, unlawful killings, torture, “restrictions on freedoms of expression and the media, as well as on the freedoms of assembly and association,” disappearances, “harsh prison conditions,” politicized court verdicts, “restrictions on academic freedom” and civil society, corruption, infringement of religious liberty, and “impunity for security forces.”



The State Department released its latest iteration of the report in mid‐​April, which critics complained watered down some criticisms of some U.S. allies. However, the Egypt section, though three pages shorter, appeared to be no less negative. State cited pervasive “arbitrary arrest and detention,” usually in awful conditions. The report also pointed to “numerous reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings, including incidents that occurred while making arrests or holding persons in custody, during disputes with civilians, or while dispersing demonstrations.”



El‐​Sisi surpassed Mubarak by destroying the independent sector. Last year the regime implemented legislation criminalizing the operations of NGOs focused on human rights and micromanaging the work of all others. Even mundane administrative decisions require regime approval. Among the groups killed by el‐​Sisi: the Al‐​Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture, which both exposed the government’s reliance on torture and helped those tortured by the state. I visited the center four years ago, which is when staffers told me that the abuses were worse than under Mubarak.



Egypt has become a prison state. Reported HRW in September 2016, “between Morsi’s overthrow and May 2014, Egyptian authorities arrested or charged at least 41,000 people, according to one documented count, and 26,000 more may have been arrested since the beginning of 2015, lawyers and human rights researchers say. The government itself has admitted to making nearly 34,000 arrests.” That was as of two years ago.



In February, author Mona Eltahawy compared el‐​Sisi to Vladimir Putin and cited more recent estimates by the Arab Network for Human Rights Information estimated: 2,332 death sentences, sixty thousand political prisoners, seventeen new prisons, 7,513 civilians tried by the military, five hundred Egyptians banned from international travel, fifty‐​four journalists imprisoned, and 465 internet sites blocked (which has since surpassed five hundred).



Cairo was ill‐​prepared for the flood of prisoners. New prisons could not be constructed fast enough and living conditions remain awful. In Tora Maximum Security Prison, wrote HRW: “Authorities have banned inmates from contacting their families or lawyers for months at a time, held them in degrading conditions without beds, mattresses, or basic hygienic items, humiliated, beaten, and confined them for weeks in crammed ‘discipline’ cells—treatment that probably amounted to torture in some cases—and interfered with their medical care in ways that may have contributed some of their deaths.”



El‐​Sisi justifies every arrest, abuse and suppression of basic liberties as necessary to fight terrorism, which, however, has expanded as his brutality has increased. Outlawing the Muslim Brotherhood decapitated the more moderate leadership, fractured the organization, and left some members believing that nonviolence no longer was an option. As ever more Egyptian families see loved ones and friends unjustly imprisoned and mistreated, resistance and instability are likely to grow.



Indeed, knowledgeable observers worry about the long‐​term consequences of repression. _Washington Post_ reporter Sudarsan Raghavan in early April wrote that el-Sisi’s “outsize economic and political ambitions are at the same time breeding resentment within large segments of the general population and, some analysts say, inside Egypt’s highly influential military.” The armed forces once were beyond public suspicion. But now, noted George Mason University’s Abdallah Hendawy, “hundreds of journalists, activists, bloggers, and even some politicians, both in and outside the country, have become increasingly critical of the military overreach.” H. A. Hellyer of the Atlantic Council worried that “by closing the space for expressing dissent openly, the possibility is that something far more chaotic than 2011 becomes more likely.” Similarly, Philip Crowley, who served in the Obama State Department, warned that “the seeds of the revolution are budding in Egypt right now.”



Alas, the United States and other Western governments have gone soft on Egyptian repression because they value stability more than liberty. They assume that only obsequious support can preserve Egypt as an ally. However, Cairo is not going to war upon Israel, whether or not Washington subsidizes el-Sisi’s dictatorship. Interdicting traffic through the Suez Canal would be self‐​defeating for any Egyptian government. And the regime would retain significant incentive—access to spare parts and training for U.S.-supplied weapons, for instance—to maintain positive contacts with the West.



However, New York University’s Alon Ben‐​Meir dismissed the possibility of democracy succeeding in Egypt and reported that “Egyptian officials prefer that concerns over human rights violations be addressed behind the scenes in order to not embarrass and weaken el-Sisi’s position in the eyes of the public.” No doubt. From their perspective, the less said the better.



However, pious private complaints, of which there have been many, evidently have had no impact. El‐​Sisi is the primary architect of what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al‐​Hussein, has called a “pervasive climate of intimidation.” Egyptian officials reflexively dismiss all concerns as lies, misinformation, or “fake news”—even as the human‐​rights climate has rapidly deteriorated.



In March Raghavan reported that “over the past year, al‐​Sisi has intensified an assault on basic freedoms.” Hendawy noted how repression accelerated before the presidential vote, destroying the democratic façade within which “political parties, social movements, and political dissidents were all allowed to play a limited role within certain bounds” even under Mubarak. In March el‐​Sisi called criticism of the military and police treason. Before the election the government’s chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, threatened to punish journalists for any criticism of the regime which allegedly hurt the nation’s “reputation.” As the election approached he targeted foreign journalists, who he said were “forces of evil” for their negative stories.



America’s leverage is limited. Last year the United States held up nearly $300 million in economic and military assistance, but to no effect. Washington could stop the additional $1.3 billion going to the Egyptian military annually, but that would not change Cairo’s policy, since el‐​Sisi is receiving large‐​scale transfers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Still, by doing so Washington would stop underwriting regime repression.



However, the Trump administration prefers to embrace dictatorship. On election day U.S. charge d’affaires Thomas Goldberger sounded like he was employed by el‐​Sisi: “As Americans we are very impressed by the enthusiasm and patriotism of Egyptian voters.” Vice President Mike Pence visited Cairo and offered embarrassingly obsequious comments, opining that el‐​Sisi “said to me again that his dedication is to all of the people of Egypt.”



Ben‐​Meir argued for dropping human rights and focusing on economic development: “Every country that has contributed financial aid to Egypt, including the United States, EU, and Gulf states, should substantially increase their aid” to assist Cairo. He presumed the regime would use the money well, which represents the triumph of hope over experience. El‐​Sisi has pushed a cavalcade of dubious expensive “investments,” including a second capital, nuclear power plant, and greatly expanded “New Suez Canal.”



Worse, additional aid would strengthen Cairo’s repressive rule. Today no action is too small for the regime to punish: posting a cartoon of el‐​Sisi with Mickey Mouse ears on Facebook earned one man a three‐​year prison term. A pop star recently was sentenced to six months in prison for calling the Nile River “dirty,” which was taken as an insult to the state—even though the river is, well, dirty, as I have seen from personal observation.



Foreign policy inevitably involves occasional tough moral compromises. However, the end of the Cold War has reduced pressure on Washington to ignore the cruel brutality of client regimes. In cases like Egypt, America is complicit in grotesque and widespread violations of human rights. That repression makes future violence more likely when political change inevitably occurs, and ensures that the United States will be targeted by those who suffered under what Vice President Pence lauded as a “strategic partnership” of “great importance to the American people.” Washington cannot make Egypt free, but it should stop enthusiastically embracing and subsidizing those who hold an entire country in bondage.

"**The Conservatives halved the amount of money they spent on Facebook ads at last year's general election, new figures show.**
The party spent Â£2.1m on the social media platform at the 2017 election compared with Â£1m in 2019.
Overall, Boris Johnson's party spent Â£16.5m on campaigning - Â£2.1m less than Theresa May in 2017.
The Electoral Commission has not yet released spending figures for Labour and the Lib Dems.
The watchdog said its normal reporting process had been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and it would be releasing spending figures for the other parties as soon as they are ready. It did not give a date for the next batch of figures.
The figures released on Wednesday showed that the Scottish National Party spent just over Â£1m and Plaid Cymru spent Â£183,914.
The Independent Group for Change, whose two candidates, former Tories Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry, lost their seats, spent Â£29,556.
The UK Independence Party saw a dramatic drop in spending, from Â£273,104 in 2017 to Â£8,761 last year.
Figures from the Brexit Party and the Green Party have also yet to be published.
Several non-party groups campaigning for and against Brexit are included in the latest release.
On the Remain side, Gina Miller's Remain United tactical voting campaign spent Â£199,581. Best for Britain, which also ran a tactical voting site, spent Â£422,498 and Led By Donkeys, a crowdfunded campaign, spent Â£458,237.
On the Leave side, City financier and former Tory donor Jeremy Hosking spent Â£484,248.
Momentum, the campaign group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party, spent Â£500,458.
Further figures from non-party groups are expected in the coming weeks, when a fuller picture will emerge.
Like all the big parties, the Tories use Facebook to micro-target voters in marginal seats with hundreds of specially-tailored messages - in 2019 these were often about Boris Johnson's plans for the NHS.
But there appears to have been a switch back towards broader, less targeted online advertising last year.
The Tories spent Â£1.2m on Facebook ads in 2015, helping the party to secure an unexpected Commons majority. They ramped up spending on the site in 2017, a year in which they lost their Commons majority.
The party continued to increase the share of its advertising budget spent online last year, which accounted for 63% of Â£3m spent.
But it reduced the amount spent on Facebook ads and increased its spending with Google from Â£562,154 to Â£879,091.
The Tories are reported to have spent more than any UK political party in history with YouTube, which is owned by Google, in the run up to polling day, including banner ads on the site's home page.
But the party spent more on unsolicited mail to voters - Â£5.9m - than it did on advertising, the figures show.
The Electoral Commission figures also reveal how Tory workers fed themselves during the campaign, with Â£22,735 spent with food delivery service Uber Eats, Â£1,972 on Pizza Hut, Â£1,867 at Tesco and Â£1,492 at Marks and Spencer."

Ryan Bridge gives climate protestors a piece of his mind over their annoying habit of lecturing us all about how [we must act now to save the planet](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/at-least-it-wasnt-poo-then-again-maybe-thats-next/), whilst ignoring the same imperative themselves.



At the weekend climate protesters poured oil over the steps at Simon Bridges’ electorate office, defacing his private property. 



Last week, it was Timaru where they boarded a support vessel, blocking it from leaving to work at a rig off the coast of Taranaki. 



It’s all in the name of saving the Earth – but what is it really? 



It’s a flagrant disregard for private business, for commercial enterprise and basic property rights. 



And what happens? 



The police sit by, smile and wave. 



They should be rounding them up and putting them in handcuffs. 



They are too busy intimidating and threatening licensed firearms owners.



What’s more, these people are hypocrites. 



The protesters are wearing makeup, they had cellphones, they had hot showers in the morning. 



I think they used toothbrushes – although, those reports are unconfirmed at this stage. 



There were cosmetics, there were computers. They all need oil. 



They’re using and relying on the very products they’re railing against. 



You know what it is? They just hate corporates, they hate business. That’s all they’re really campaigning against – basic successful commerce. 



Yep, especially when they coin terms like “justice-based economy”, whatever that means.



If they really cared, they’d stop using their toothbrushes. God forbid. 



But I have an idea which might just solve all our problems – why don’t we go and put them on an island where there is no business, no oil, no enterprise – and see how fun their lives really are.



In fact, it really could solve all our problems. Perhaps this is the reality show that will save TV3. _I’m a Climate Evangelist – Get Me Out of Here_.



It’ll be a ratings bonanza.



Yes, yes it would.

 **George**



I’m not one to rave on about “the good old days”, but during the past year, I have become more and more disillusioned with my fellow beings, especially the young. I know we were all young once and assumed we had all the answers. Of course, most of our declarations would not stand the scrutiny of our elders. It was expressed as the exuberance of youth. We would grow out of our cockiness when we confronted the challenges adulthood presented. The real world would slap us across our faces and demand we return to planet Earth. And most of us did. This occurred because our elders recognised our youthful presumptions for what they were and thankfully ignored us. It now appears that some moronic adults are searching for guidance from these same generational upstarts. In fact, it is worse than that: these same generational upstarts are accessing positions of power and through their juvenile ineptitude are destroying our country.



In my day I, along with the vast majority of high school leavers, went straight into employment and we usually started on the end of a broom. We advanced up the ranks as our potential was recognised, or for some, the broom remained their constant companion. Promotion was not gifted it was earned. The very few who went to university or training college were committed to a predetermined professional career. They became fully trained doctors, nurses, lawyers and school teachers. The rest of us kept the wheels of commerce turning. Yes, they were “the good old days”. Order within the ranks. When the vast majority of us entered the workforce we adhered to disciplines that soon removed our insolence. We had entered the world of adulthood. Today so many of our young skip this natural progression into adulthood by choosing to remain in the womb of the university set. They achieve perceived qualification through meaningless degrees that are practically worthless in the real world. They would never be seen on the end of a broom. They are educated apparently. So much so, one became Prime Minister of New Zealand. A position not earned but gifted. She has a degree in communications yet struggles to assemble a coherent sentence which hasn’t been written by others.



Now we have the UN fawning over a [sixteen-year-old juvenile nitwit](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/does-greta-thunberg-know-modern-climate-change-is-not-unusual-quite-natural/) who is still at high school. This is insane. Put a broom in her hand, pay her minimum wage, and if she has any potential she will progress. In the meantime, I will dream about “the good old days” when this child would have been ignored and sent to her room.

"The last fully intact ice shelf in the Canadian Arctic has collapsed, losing more than 40% of its area in just two days at the end of July. The Milne Ice Shelf is at the fringe of Ellesmere Island, in the sparsely populated northern Canadian territory of Nunavut.  “Above normal air temperatures, offshore winds and open water in front of the ice shelf are all part of the recipe for ice shelf break up,” the Canadian Ice Service said in a tweet earlier this week. “Entire cities are that size. These are big pieces of ice,” said Luke Copland, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa who was part of the research team studying the Milne Ice Shelf. The shelf’s area shrank by about 80 sq km. By comparison, the island of Manhattan in New York covers roughly 60 sq km. “This was the largest remaining intact ice shelf, and it’s disintegrated, basically,” Copland said. The Arctic has been warming at twice the global rate for the last 30 years, due to a process known as Arctic amplification. But this year, temperatures in the polar region have been intense. The polar sea ice hit its lowest extent for July in 40 years. Record heat and wildfires have scorched Siberian Russia. Summer in the Canadian Arctic this year in particular has been 5C above the 30-year average, Copland said. That has threatened smaller ice caps, which can melt quickly because they do not have the bulk that larger glaciers have to stay cold. As a glacier disappears, more bedrock is exposed, which then heats up and accelerates the melting process. “The very small ones, we’re losing them dramatically,” he said, citing researchers’ reviews of satellite imagery. “You feel like you’re on a sinking island chasing these features, and these are large features. It’s not as if it’s a little tiny patch of ice you find in your garden.“ The ice shelf collapse on Ellesmere Island also meant the loss of the northern hemisphere’s last known epishelf lake, a geographic feature in which a body of freshwater is dammed by the ice shelf and floats atop ocean water. A research camp, including instruments for measuring water flow through the ice shelf, was lost when the shelf collapsed. “It is lucky we were not on the ice shelf when this happened,” said researcher Derek Mueller of Carleton University in Ottawa, in a 2 August blogpost. Ellesmere also lost its two St Patrick Bay ice caps this summer. “We saw them going, like someone with terminal cancer. It was only a matter of time,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado. The vanishing was confirmed last month, when Nasa satellite shots of the region revealed a complete lack of snow and ice, said Serreze, who studied the caps as a graduate student on his first trip to the Arctic years ago. At the time, he said, the caps had seemed like immovable parts of the geography. “When I was there in the 1980s I knew every square inch of those ice caps,” he said. “You have the memories. It’s like your first girlfriend.“ Meanwhile, another two ice caps on Ellesmere – called Murray and Simmons – are also diminishing and are likely to disappear within 10 years, Serreze said."
"It seemed like another normal day for José Rivera. His mother dropped him off at his school in San Salvador, hugging him tightly as she told him she would see him at the end of the day. But there was one detail that, even then at age 6, José thought was strange: She was crying. His mother, Flor de Maria Rivera, never returned to pick him up. A week later, he learned that his mother had left for the United States, to lay the groundwork for creating a better life for her family. Over the next 11 years, José and his younger brother, Juan, were raised by their grandmother. “I didn’t say goodbye because it would have been too difficult,” Ms. Rivera, 35, said in a recent interview. “I might have changed my mind. ” She worked in El Salvador as an elementary schoolteacher. She loved her job, but her meager salary was not enough to support the family  —   the boys’ father had abandoned them soon after Juan was born  —   especially after the death of her father, who often pitched in financially to help her. When Ms. Rivera arrived in New York City in 2005, she worked three different jobs. She never expected to stay in the United States for so long. “The first five years were almost unbearable,” she said. “I thought about the kids every day, cried every day. ” There was a time that Ms. Rivera nearly caved in and considered buying a plane ticket home, but she said her family discouraged her. As difficult as the separation was, Ms. Rivera took solace in knowing that the money she sent home helped her children and family. The thousands of miles between her and her family, she said, was a price worth paying to provide for them. Over the years, Ms. Rivera kept in touch with her sons via Skype a few times a week. As the boys grew older, new dangers emerged. José started to receive threats from gang members who wanted him to help traffic drugs. Ms. Rivera said a major reason she hesitated to ask for her sons to join her was her fear of the perilous journey they would have to take. But the idea of her sons remaining in El Salvador, tempted and threatened by gangs, became unthinkable. José and Juan left El Salvador early one morning in November 2014, on what ended up being a nearly   journey by car and by foot, guided by a smuggler. Each time they crossed another border  —   El Salvador to Guatemala, Guatemala to Mexico and Mexico to the United States  —   they traversed a river, some with frightening rapids. The scariest part of their journey was when they were robbed at knife point. That December, the Rivera brothers were apprehended by the United States border patrol officers in Texas and sent to a center run by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement. There they came in contact with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. José and Juan were sent to New York, where they were reunited with their mother for the first time in more than a decade. Juan leapt from his chair at the sight of her. José, dubious and anxious, stayed seated, arms folded. Ms. Rivera looked different. She had lost a lot of weight. The last time they saw each other, he had to look up to make eye contact. Now they were the same height. “There’s a lot of change,” Ms. Rivera said, turning to look at José. “He is a man, a younger man, but a man. ” It was an adjustment for the family, not only for José and Juan, now 17 and 12, to acclimate to a new country, but also for the family to adjust to being around one another. Her sons grew up around their more lenient grandmother, while Ms. Rivera acknowledged she can be harder on her boys. “I’m strict with me, for myself, and I’m strict with them,” Ms. Rivera said. She works full time as a waitress in Brooklyn and also works part time cleaning apartments, which earns her a total of about $622 each week. Her rent is $1, 500 a month. The family lives in a   apartment in Brooklyn. Ms. Rivera sleeps in the small bedroom, while José and Juan initially shared a foldout couch. In October, Catholic Charities used $800 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy each brother a twin bed. For the brothers, adjusting to schools has been a challenge, especially for José, who has struggled to learn English. “We knew the basics, like the colors, a little bit of the letters,” he said. “When I try to speak, I find difficulty, because it’s hard to find the words I want to say. ” And bullying is rampant, both brothers said. They are often teased by classmates about their immigration status. José said that some students had told him that if he did not help them with their homework, they would report him to immigration officials. “I’m here to make a better life, and make money and take care of my family,” he said. “And when they say that, I feel angry and sad. ” The brothers hold special immigrant juvenile status, intended for abused, neglected or abandoned juveniles. They are in the process of applying for permanent residency. Both plan to stay focused on their studies, as their mother has requested. Their lives are full of uncertainties, and fears have taken new forms. But at least they are together."

"Women in hijabs and men in jeans strolled along Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on Saturday night beneath the signs of stores and restaurants written in Arabic. It would have seemed a typical Saturday night in one of New York’s largest   neighborhoods. Except that inside those storefronts and cafes, there was worry, disbelief and emergency meetings, prompted by President Trump’s executive orders that temporarily banned   and green card holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Among those countries was Yemen. At the   Social Center, 20   business and community leaders from across the city met to share information in Arabic and English about friends and relatives detained at airports across the United States. Everyone knew someone, or was connected with someone on social media who was affected. They decried the president’s executive orders. “Trump grew up in Queens, Yemenis were his neighbors,” Kaled Alamarie, 44, said. “That’s his New York. ” Mr. Alamarie came to the United States when he was 10. He is a Giants season ticket holder and works for the city’s Department of Environmental Protection. His brother, Amrr, 24, was born in New York and is a director of the John Adams High School STEM Academy in Ozone Park, teaching math, science and technology. “What drew me out today is that I have an immigration case pending for my wife,” Amrr Alamarie said. His wife, from Yemen, has been unable to get a visa to the United States for two years and now does not know when that will happen. They have a    daughter. “It’s hard not seeing myself living that American life,” he said. Yemen is embroiled in a war between rebels aligned with Iran known as Houthi and Saudi   fighters that forced the closure of the United States embassy in Sana in 2015. For Yemenis seeking American visas, most have had to go to Malaysia or Djibouti to wait. Under President Barack Obama, some Yemenis had their United States passports confiscated in Sana. “Everybody’s afraid,” said Zaid Nagi, 38, who came straight from the protest at Kennedy International Airport to the emergency meeting. “What kind of guarantee do we have if they don’t honor a visa they issue themselves? Or a birth certificate? Where do they draw the line?” Anas Alhajj, 26, said he was involved in student uprisings in Sana. He received asylum, and now works for a Yemeni newspaper based in Bay Ridge. He said he is worried that his status could be revoked. “You have to understand where we came from, there’s a lot of hardship, dictatorships,” Kaled Alamarie said. “In their mind, they’re thinking that they’re going to disappear, just like they disappear in Egypt, in Yemen. They just don’t believe it. ” The meeting was organized by Debbie Almontaser, the president of the board of directors for the Muslim Community Network and a national board member of the     Committee. “If you know people who are at the airports, let them know to refuse to go back on the plane and not to sign any documents. Ask for a lawyer,” she said to the group of men around the table. “Fear,” she said earlier in the day, “is reverberating through our community. ” But there was also pride. Ibrahim Qatabi, a legal assistant at a nonprofit, said that his   came by boat to the United States from Yemen. He then worked in Buffalo for the railroad. Mr. Qatabi’s grandfather worked for the Ford Motor Company. “And now to be treated as a   citizen?” said Mr. Qatabi, 37, who works for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “We’re not refugees,” he said. “The people who were rejected today are relatives of U. S. citizens. ” Mr. Qatabi said he worried about the psychological effect this order, which has been described as a Muslim ban, could have. “What we worry about more than ever is that Trump’s executive orders will embolden and encourage people to be racist, to openly discriminate against minorities, against people who come from the Middle East and especially these seven countries. ” But one neighborhood activist in the   community in Bay Ridge was conspicuously absent. She said she thought the temporary ban was good policy. Kathy Khatari, an   who married into a   family and is a proud Muslim, said that she fully supported Mr. Trump  —   cheers him, in fact. Ms. Khatari said: “Who cares, as long as we know who we are letting in. Do you know an ordinary Yemeni from someone from ISIS? No  —   because we don’t. I’ll take inconvenience for safety. ” Yemen was the site of the first counterterrorism raid that Mr. Trump authorized, an attack of Qaeda headquarters that had killed an estimated 14 Qaeda fighters and one American commando, the Pentagon said on Sunday morning. For those in Bay Ridge, the fighting seemed so distant. The manager of the popular Yemen Café on Fifth Avenue, Nasser Alsubai, 28, disagreed about the imminent danger, or implication that people seeking to come to the United States from these seven countries were terrorists. He is a United States citizen, naturalized after he came to New York at age 6. “Any Yemeni family that you find here in America are all working hard to support family in Yemen,” Mr. Alsubai said. “How is going to make things better toward his agenda?” he added of Mr. Trump. “He’s going to make us go back in time. Like the camps with the Japanese. We’re fighting all over the world for every single country to have democracy, but we’re not doing it here. ”"
"The Dutch city of Arnhem is digging up asphalt roads and creating shady areas around busy shopping districts after concluding that the consequences of global heating are unavoidable. Under a 10-year plan for the city unveiled on Wednesday, a new layout is proposed to better prepare residents for extreme weather conditions such as downpours, droughts and intense heatwaves.  The council has decided that 10% of the asphalt must make way for grasses and other plants to better dissipate heat and improve the city’s absorption of rainfall. A goal has been set for 90% of rainwater to be absorbed into the soil rather than running off into the city’s sewers. Trees will be planted alongside a network of roads to provide cover from the sun and new “cooling down” spots, complete with ponds and covered areas, will be constructed near busy squares and shopping centres. Much of the Netherlands sits below sea level and all the county’s urban centres have been asked to do climate stress tests to see how they might adapt to more erratic rainfall patterns, heatwaves and periods of high and low river flows. Alderman Cathelijne Bouwkamp said the city was leading the way but that the council would also provide grants to residents who proposed ways they might collect rainwater or who installed green roofs. In its drive to remove 10% of the city’s asphalt, underused roads will be targeted and the municipality is investigating whether recycling or reselling the material will be possible. Bouwkamp said the city would continue to reduce its carbon emissions as part of the plan. “The energy transition is there to ensure that the city remains liveable in the future,” she said. “We must also adapt to the climate change that is taking place now. Flooding, heat and drought are increasing.” The Dutch government has pledged to reduce the Netherlands’ greenhouse gas emissions by 49% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and to secure a 95% reduction by 2050."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
There’s a new survey out by the Pew Research Center folks that’s getting lots of press. Much of the coverage mentions the following claim that the claimed 97% consensus is real but it’s only 87%. The survey reports a:
• 37-percentage point gap over whether climate change is mostly caused by human activity – 87% of AAAS scientists say it is, while 50% of the public does.
So what’s not to like? Well, the first oddity of the study is that we have absolutely no guarantee that the scientists are … well … scientists.

The study was done “in collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)”. Here’s the description from the Pew Center of the method used:
The survey of scientists was conducted online with a random sample of 3,748 U.S.-based members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from September 11 to October 13, 2014. AAAS is the world’s largest general scientific society, and includes members from all scientific fields. Founded in 1848, AAAS publishes Science, one of the most widely circulated peer-reviewed scientific journals in the world. Membership in AAAS is open to all.
Sounds good … until you realize that not only is membership in AAAS “open to all”, but in addition anyone who subscribes to Science magazine is a member of AAAS … and for years Science magazine has been a strong supporter of the hypothesis that “climate change is mostly caused by human activity”, whatever that might mean.
So we are already dealing with a self-selected group of people, many of them not scientists, who read a magazine that for years has strongly supported the “anthropogenic global warming” (AGW) hypothesis.
But wait … it gets worse. For starters, you’d think that the Pew Research folks would have made a selection of scientists that weren’t subscribers to a magazine that has an axe to grind. And you’d also think that they would have picked … well … scientists.
But failing both of those, once the Pew Center folks had foolishly chosen to sample from AAAS members, surely they would make their own random selection of the AAAS membership? … well, think again. Their methods section cited above goes on to say:
A simple random sample of AAAS members was selected for participation by the staff of AAAS.
At this point, I’ve got to assume that the good folks at Pew have lost the plot entirely. They let the staff of the AAAS, a group which by and large seems to have swallowed the climate koolaid without demur, choose a “random sample” of which “scientists” the Pew folks would interview. Yeah, that’s the ticket, that inspires confidence …
And it gets worse yet, because the self-selection increases:
A total of 19,984 members were mailed a letter requesting participation in the survey.
And out of those, how many were actually sampled?
A total of 3,748 members completed the survey for an overall response rate of 18.8%.
Then there’s the matter of the poorly worded question. They asked if “climate change is mostly due to human activity”, with 87% of “scientists” saying yes versus 50% of citizens. I hate this kind of vague question, with no time frame on it, no definition of “climate change”, and no definition of “mostly”. For example, the IPCC defines “climate change” as being human caused … but under the general definition, the climate has been changing forever. This means that the well is poisoned before we even start. And what period of time are they talking about? The last ten years, during which there has been no statistically significant warming? The last century? The period since industrialization? And is 51% “mostly” or not? A vague question like that means nothing even if the rest of the survey had been handled perfectly.
I gotta say … I used to respect the Pew Research folks, and I’ve looked at their methods in other studies without finding much that seemed odd.
But this survey? On my planet, this one goes directly into the circular file … at the end of all of that, I gotta figure that their study is 87% horse feathers, and 13% unicorn-generated methane …
Best to all, and don’t believe everything you read.
w.
AS ALWAYS: If you disagree with someone, please have the courtesy to QUOTE THE EXACT WORDS YOU DISAGREE WITH so that all of us can understand the exact nature of what you object to.
And in the interests of full disclosure, I am a member of AAAS … but somehow they didn’t ask my opinion. I figure my invitation got lost in the mail …

"**Animal charities have warned against ""extremely irresponsible"" breeders selling kittens and puppies on Facebook, as demand increases over lockdown.**
Facebook guidelines state animals cannot be sold between private individuals.
But a BBC investigation has revealed puppies and kittens are being advertised through the platform.
Charities warned the animals may be sick, too young or it could be a scam.
The RSPCA called these sellers ""extremely irresponsible"".
""We know that there are lots of unscrupulous breeders and sellers out there who exploit social media and classified websites in order to sell puppies and kittens without arousing suspicion,"" a spokesperson said.
People should consider adopting from a rescue centre first, or follow its advice on buying dogs and cats \- including seeing where the animal was bred, the charity added.
In closed Facebook groups, some pedigree breeds were advertised for over Â£1,000.
One public post advertised ""long-haired doll-face Persian"" kittens as ""ready to go"" and asking interested buyers to get in touch.
Some kittens and puppies were also offered for ""worldwide delivery"".
One post, selling ragdoll kittens, specified gloves and a mask must be worn on collection, due to Covid-19 restrictions.
""A Â£150 deposit (non-refundable) will secure the kitten, updated pics until collection day,"" it added.
Facebook said it was investigating examples the BBC had sent, and encouraged users to report any posts they saw.
""We do not allow the sale of animals on Facebook including in private groups, and when we find this type content we take it down,"" a spokesperson added.
This comes as coronavirus lockdown has led to an increased demand for new pets.
In April, The Kennel Club, one of the UK's biggest dog welfare organisations said searches for puppies on its website had doubled between February and March as the restrictions were announced.
Prices of kittens and puppies sold online have risen into the thousands.
But scam reporting service Action Fraud said con artists were advertising online with pictures of pets to buy, and asking for a deposit even though they had none to sell.
Victims had lost more than Â£280,000 in two months, it said.
Meanwhile, charities including Battersea Dogs Home, Cats Protection and the RSPCA have also warned against people rushing into getting a new pet.
There are concerns that as life returns to normal and people spend less time at home, pets will be abandoned.
""The pandemic has created the ideal conditions for unscrupulous pet sellers to thrive, as they appear to have a credible reason for not allowing buyers to view the kitten with their mother first,"" Cats Protection's head of advocacy, Jacqui Cuff, said.
""Sadly, we fear there are many underage kittens being sold on Facebook by vendors who are impatient to make a quick profit. These kittens can go on to have serious, life-threatening illnesses or be so poorly socialised that they're not suitable as pets.""
Many new kittens or puppies come from farms, in inhumane conditions, which is why its important to view the animal with its mother.
One of the challenges for Facebook was that this activity happened in closed groups and it relied on individual users to report it, the Pet Advertising Advisory Group said.
It has published a list of minimum standards for websites that sell animals - including automated removal of adverts with blacklisted words, banning vendors who post illegal adverts and including a recent photograph of the animal.
The group said it had met Facebook to discuss the ""illegal and inappropriate adverts"" but as the platform does not filter posts before they are published, ""it is unlikely that Facebook could or would"" apply the same standards."
"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NoaaA) has predicted an “extremely active” hurricane season in the US in an already record-breaking year for storms. Noaa’s Climate Prediction Center said there could be up to 25 storms which have sustained winds of 39mph or greater. Storms which hit this threshold are named by the agency. In a normal year, there are usually two storms before August which are named. This year, there have already been nine named storms, a record which makes 2020’s hurricane season one of the busiest on record in the US. Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at the Climate Prediction Center, said the combined intensity and duration of all storms during the season is predicted to be much higher than the threshold for an “extremely active” season. “We’ve never forecast up to 25 storms,” Bell said in a press briefing. “So this is the first time.” The previous high was in 2005, when the agency predicted a maximum of 21 named storms. Of the 25 possible named storms, Noaa estimates seven to 11 could become hurricanes, which have winds of at least 74mph. The agency also forecast that three to six storms could become major hurricanes, with winds of 111mph or more. The hurricane season ends on 30 November. Noaa said there is an 85% chance it will be an above-active season, an increase from the May prediction. “This year, we expect more, stronger, and longer-lived storms than average,” Bell said in a statement. The NoaaA forecast does not predict which of the hurricanes will make landfall, because those predictions rely mostly on short-term weather patterns. The increase in predicted hurricanes is attributed to warmer than usual sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, combined with the wind conditions. There is also growing evidence that warming in the atmosphere and upper ocean, caused by human activity, is creating conditions more suitable for more destructive hurricanes. Residents in areas more vulnerable to hurricanes have been encouraged to review their preparation plans for a possible storm, and to account for the effects of Covid-19 in that plan. This week, when Hurricane Isaias was heading towards South Carolina, health officials there advised people to add face masks and cleaning products to their preparations kits because of the virus. Officials also encouraged people who may need to evacuate to find hotels to go to, or family and friends to stay with, to avoid staying at a shelter, where socially distancing would be in place but is still an environment where the coronavirus could spread more easily."

Even if you think, as I do, that the past week’s great gay rights war was 90% hype — the religious exemption laws in Indiana and Arkansas, even before they got amended, were by no means the bar to future discrimination suits that many backers hoped and opponents feared — one take‐​away is still a bit amazing: America’s big businesses have emerged as a hugely effective ally of gay rights.



That is a very big deal that will reshape this crucial cultural cause, and perhaps others, for years to come.



How did this happen, what does it mean and will it last?



For those whose attention was elsewhere this week, here’s what happened:



Like 27 other states, Indiana and Arkansas have no general laws banning discrimination against gay people in private employment or so‐​called public accommodations, although some cities in Indiana do have local ordinances to that effect.





In Indiana, Arkansas and around the country, Apple, Walmart and other corporations are turning the same‐​sex marriage tide.



This week, Republican legislatures in both states enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) laws, which — among many other impacts in areas of the law unrelated to discrimination — might someday be invoked by florists, photographers or caterers reluctant on religious grounds to participate in a gay marriage celebration.



A national outcry ensued, fed by cable news and social media, and late this week both Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson yielded to the pressure, requesting and getting legislative “fixes” making it clear that neither law would have such an effect. (Contrary to some news reports, the revised laws did not ban such discrimination, but simply made clear that should such disputes emerge under local ordinances or, perhaps, future state laws, the RFRA would not serve as a defense.)



Previous gay‐​rights blowbacks have been led by people holding signs and chanting slogans.



This one was different. In both states, the rapid turnabout was a direct result of business pressure. Yes, celebrities jumped in with opinions, cable pundits blustered and several liberal governors and mayors, including New York’s own Andrew Cuomo, went so far as to cut off “non‐​essential” travel by state employees to Indiana. (Because Indiana would never respond in kind by banning employee travel to New York, right?)



But that grandstanding was mostly a sideshow: The really effective pressure on the two states came from the business sector.



In Arkansas, Walmart, whose headquarters has single‐​handedly put the state on the world business map, publicly declared that it wanted the RFRA bill fixed or vetoed. Indiana’s law drew collective fire from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Cummins Engine, drugmakers Lilly and Roche Diagnostics and online powers Angie’s List and Salesforce, a San Francisco company with large Indiana operations.



The Indy‐​based NCAA weighed in to the same effect — no small thing in perhaps the nation’s most sports‐​mad state — as did Florida‐​based motorsports giant NASCAR (NASCAR!), which expressed itself “disappointed” at the law’s passage.



Out‐​of‐​state business leaders joined in, and by no means just the usual Apple‐​and‐​Starbucks avant garde. “Madness” and “idiocy” were the terms used by the CEO of Marriott, a company that has famously thrived from a base in middle America under Mormon‐​led management. (In a perhaps not entirely unrelated sign of the times, Utah itself now has a gay rights law).



Some companies even talked of avoiding conventions in Indiana or forgoing expansion there. Governments boycotting businesses is one thing, but how often do you hear of businesses boycotting governments — and midwestern U.S. states at that, not faraway tyrannies?



In 2012, social conservatives rushed to support Chick‐​fil‐​A after reports that its owner strongly opposed same‐​sex marriage. This year, saw a fascinating flip‐​side phenomenon: In red states, businesses, typically a conservative force, led, and people followed.



* * *



These developments might come as less of a shock if you’ve followed the rapid engagement of American business with the gay issue. Last month, 379 companies and employer organizations signed on to an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a constitutional right to same‐​sex marriage, including — just to sample the A’s — Accenture, Aetna, AIG, Amazon, American Airlines, American Express, Apple and AT&T.



This has been building for a while, for economic reasons as well as social ones. As Reuters recounts, Wal-Mart’s stand reflects “more than a decade of evolving policy” at the retailer, which now scores 90 of a possible 100 points on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index.



In general, decades of “diversity” efforts within large employers have led most of them to be comfortable with internal institutions such as LGBT employee groups, which mostly take a collaborative rather than adversarial approach toward management to engage it in outreach efforts. A key argument is employee recruitment — young and high‐​skilled talent is more likely to want to go with employers seen as with or ahead of the times, or to be openly LGBT itself.



The same goes for the intangibles of consumer and public image. One reason advertising tilts toward younger consumers is that the perceptions of companies and brands people form in their teens and twenties tend to carry on long afterward. And rightly or wrongly, being perceived as unwelcoming of gays is now seen as almost a pure signifier of “stuck in old ways” — not where most companies want to be.



Even as corporate America has engaged with pro‐​gay constituencies, its relations with groups opposing gay rights have mostly ranged from non‐​existent to acrimonious. Groups like the American Family Association, Family Research Council and National Organization for Marriage have long been known for wildly unsuccessful boycott and shaming efforts against gay‐​friendly companies like General Mills and Disney, which seems to have done little to keep their co‐​thinkers from going right on buying Cheerios and visiting Disney World.



So there was nothing new this week when impassioned denunciations of big business and its influence rang through some social‐​conservative websites over the Indiana and Arkansas situations. Thus FRC president Tony Perkins, ever the voice of moderation, likened big business to the corrupters of Judas, charging it with encouraging public officials to “take the silver” and neglect their religious loyalties.



The complaint couldn’t have been more futile. In many ways, it was being identified with advocates like him that doomed the two laws in their original form.



In some parallel universe, bills like Indiana’s could have been pitched with a pluralist and moderate appeal: Until quite recently, after all, RFRAs themselves were seen as something of a bipartisan progressive cause and the group of law professors and religious scholars active in the push for state RFRA bills includes more than a few moderates, liberals and libertarians who themselves favor same‐​sex marriage and gay rights laws.



In our actual universe, on the other hand, where perception is nine‐​tenths reality, the Indiana effort was seen as the pet project of hard‐​liners that the state’s business community didn’t care for and didn’t want to have seen as representing the state.



One of the most damaging viral images was that of a ceremony in which Mike Pence was seen signing the initial bill into law surrounded by figures circled and identified as long‐​time bitter opponents of gay rights. Pence himself floundered on TV when asked to defend the bill, unable to finesse the gap between the culture war themes that had helped fuel its passage at home and the more moderate arguments that might have swayed national viewers.



* * *



So is business sentiment now going to put its full weight behind the cause of gay rights, as some are already imagining?



It’s not that simple. To begin with, not every controversy is going to happen in a state as exquisitely sensitive as Indiana and Arkansas to business climate reputation arguments.



What’s more, it’s much easier to rally opinion against a law that’s seen as taking a step in the wrong direction than to rally for positive steps that might take a while to accomplish. “Lawmaker introduces bill to do outrageous thing” is good for a hundred thousand social media shares even if you’ve never heard of the lawmaker and the bill has scant chance of passage.



“Lawmaker fails to support worthwhile new bill” is a zero‐​share story. People respond to the sense of being attacked, and not all stories will play like this one.



Finally, most big companies are fundamentally conflict‐​averse; they’re trying to get past the culture war as it affects their companies, not fight it. And they know the genie of social‐​media controversy is not a tractable spirit obedient to anyone’s summons.



Outrage can blow up in unexpected ways.



When a small‐​town Indiana pizzeria owner truthfully answered a reporter’s inquiry by saying she was happy to serve gay customers but would have qualms about catering a gay wedding, her mom‐​and‐​pop business got hit by a classic social‐​media pile‐​on that included fake Yelp reviews and even threats of violence. No sane business — especially a big one — would want to get within miles of such mob‐​driven ritual shaming.



It might be tricky, in fact, to keep getting the symbolic point across while not alienating the majority of the public that — according to most polls — in fact opposes fines and penalties for bakers, florists and photographers that hold religious objections to entering into gay‐​marriage celebrations. (One Oregon bakery faces a $150,000 fine for not doing so.) In February, an AP poll found that by 57% to 39%, the public believes that “wedding‐​related businesses with religious objections should be allowed to refuse service to same‐​sex couples.”



A Marist poll, which specifically mentioned the penalties under such laws, found an even wider gap of more than 2 to 1 in favor of the conscience rights; Pew, using a different wording, has found public opinion to be about equally divided.



There’s even an ironic hint of contradiction in that businesses like Salesforce and Angie’s List vigorously assert their own liberty — but not necessarily their opponents’ — to refrain from trading with those whose morality offends them.



“Freedom should mean freedom for everyone” has been one of the most effective rallying cries in advancing same‐​sex marriage, but it sits uncomfortably with laws that deny freedom of association to small town businesspeople trying to lead their lives by their own lights.



But those questions lie ahead, complicating what this week revealed to be a dramatically changed landscape. For now, go ahead and savor the historic moment, and, yes, the symbolism. One of the most powerful forces shaping our world — American‐​style capitalist enterprise — is actively trying to look out for the interests of gay people. Meanwhile, progressives who rail against the way business throws its weight around to influence public policy are finding that when it’s happening for a cause you like, maybe it’s not so bad.

"WASHINGTON  —   One American commando was killed and three others were wounded in a fierce firefight early Sunday with Qaeda militants in central Yemen, the military said on Sunday. It was the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump since he took office, and the commando was the first United States service member to die in the yearslong shadow war against Al Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate. Members of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 carried out the surprise dawn attack, and the military said that about 14 Qaeda fighters were killed during a nearly hourlong battle. A Qaeda leader  —   a    of Anwar   the   cleric and top Qaeda leader in Yemen, who died in a drone strike in 2011  —   was believed to have been killed. After initially denying that there were any civilian casualties, American officials said they were assessing reports that women and children had died in the attack. The military’s Joint Special Operations Command had been planning the mission for months, according to three senior American officials. Obama administration aides had deliberated extensively over the proposed operation, weighing the value of any information that might be recovered against the risk to the Special Operations forces plunging into hostile territory. But administration officials ultimately opted to hand the decision on the mission to their successors. Mr. Trump, who has vowed to increase pressure on militant groups worldwide, was quickly persuaded that the rewards were worth the gamble, and he authorized the mission last week, military officials said. Commandos waited for a moonless evening on Saturday to exploit their advantage of fighting at night. As helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones provided cover, the commandos carried out the attack against the home of the Qaeda leader in the rugged mountainous region of Bayda Province, a part of Yemen that has been a focal point of United States military operations over the past month. The main target was computer materials inside the house that could contain clues about future terrorist plots. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the raid “successful” and said that it had captured “important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world. ” He also lamented the loss of the American service member “in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. ” The military’s Central Command said in an earlier statement on Sunday that “similar operations have produced intelligence on Al Qaeda logistics, recruiting and financing efforts. ” In previous raids in Iraq, Syria and Somalia, commandos have recovered laptop computers, thumb drives and cellphones that yielded important information about militant leaders’ locations, activities and associates. A United States military aircraft helping with the operation experienced a “hard landing” near the site of the raid, resulting in injuries to two other service members, military officials said. That aircraft, identified by a senior American official as an Osprey that was evacuating the troops wounded in the firefight, was unable to fly after the landing and was deliberately destroyed by American airstrikes. The wounded troops and the Osprey’s crew were lifted to safety by another American aircraft. American officials and analysts said the Qaeda leader who was believed to have been killed was Abdulrauf al Dhahab. The raid took place in Yemen around the time that Mr. Trump was signing a directive in Washington on Saturday afternoon ordering Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise within 30 days a more aggressive plan to defeat the Islamic State. The Islamic State was born from Al Qaeda’s branch in Iraq, but the two terrorist organizations are now sworn rivals not only in Iraq and Syria, but also in other hot spots like Yemen and Afghanistan, where both groups have affiliates. Because Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, American military planners had begun drafting classified options to present to the new commander in chief. Some of those options, like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians, could also be applied to attacks against Qaeda fighters and Islamic State insurgents. There were no immediate indications that the rules of engagement had been loosened for the mission in Yemen, military officials said. The Central Command’s statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed. A local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a. m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life. A Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years. The Yemeni official said that at least eight women and seven children, ages 3 to 13, had been killed in the raid. Qaeda supporters said that Mr. Awlaki’s young daughter was among the dead and denied that any senior Qaeda leaders had been killed, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications. Faisal Mohamed, a Bayda official whose two sons witnessed the attack, said it severely damaged a school, a health facility and a mosque. “I was on the way back to town when they called and said that there were Americans everywhere, so I knew I should not go,” Mr. Mohamed said by phone from nearby Marib Province. “My kids told me that the sky was crowded with helicopters and that they saw people jumping out of planes. ” “The last thing they said to me was that the whole town is devastated now,” Mr. Mohamed said. Just over a week ago, United States drone strikes killed three other men suspected of being Qaeda operatives in Bayda Province, the first such killings reported in the country since Mr. Trump assumed the presidency. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group’s branch in Yemen, has long been seen by American intelligence and counterterrorism officials as among the most dangerous branches of the global terrorist network, and the one posing the most immediate threat to United States territory. The group’s leaders have sought in at least three cases to detonate bombs hidden aboard American commercial jetliners. All of those plots were thwarted. The raid on Saturday night was the latest in a series of Special Operations drone strikes and ground attacks in Yemen in recent years. In November 2014,   Special Operations commandos and Yemeni troops rescued eight hostages being held in a remote part of eastern Yemen by Al Qaeda’s affiliate there. After landing, the commandos hiked some distance in the dark to a mountainside cave, where they surprised the militants holding the captives. A month later, in December 2014, United States commandos stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended in tragedy, with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him."
"PARIS  —   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sunday’s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benoît Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would “make France’s heart beat,” bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls’s 41 percent. “Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,” Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. “Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,” he said. Mr. Hamon’s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamon’s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, François Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. France’s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mélenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande’s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamon’s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande’s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoît Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. “We have a perspective we have something to do, to build,” Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollande’s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France’s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). “We have someone that trusts us,” Mr. Kekenbosch said, “who says: ‘I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald’s on provisional contracts for 4 years. ” Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader."

During the John Key led government we saw Labour here in New Zealand blame stupid voters for being hoodwinked into voting for that nice Mr Key. That behaviour led to ignominious defeat under Phil Goff and again under David Cunliffe. 



National is now exhibiting the same delusion, that the voters were stupid and look what they’ve done. 



Most voters know precisely what they are doing and only a fool blames stupid voters, yet that is precisely what is happening in the UK, as [the blame game begins ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/18/labours-retreat-tories-fascists-insulting-predictable/)after Labour’s dreadful showing last week:



According to the Labour Party, the defeat they suffered last Thursday is far, far worse than previously imagined. Their leader, manifesto and policy on Brexit were not just comprehensively rejected, but in the view of virtually every Labour MP and grassroots activist, they were rejected in favour of an “extreme right wing” party.



Boris Johnson, so this consensus goes, heads the most extreme government, not just in the post-war period, or in living memory, but as [Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/john-mcdonnell-says-will-not-part-next-shadow-cabinet/) put it, “the most extreme right-wing cabinet we’ve ever seen in the political history of this country.” The problem for Labour is that this judgment applies not just to the new government, but to everyone who voted Conservative.



Such accusations have been made so regularly and so consistently that no one in Leigh or Wakefield or Bolsover could possibly be under any illusion about the true nature of Johnson’s Conservative Party. And yet they still voted for it. So the question must be asked: **how did so many ordinary working class voters go from supporting Labour for generations to voting “extreme right wing” in such a short space of time?** What made ordinary working class people – and this is according to Labour’s own assertions, mind – so intolerant and extreme, so right wing? Why do they want to [sell the NHS to Donald Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/03/doesnt-media-scrutinise-corbyns-lies-nhs/)?



If asked, **Labour will say that the voters were duped by clever marketing men.** They were **too stupid to see Boris Johnson for what he is.** As more sensible voices are pointing out, **lecturing the very people whose support you need about their stupidity is very rarely a path to electoral glory.** But is it really credible to claim that the country has opted to sign up to a new iteration of the British National Party? Most people who voted Tory last week, especially those who did so following a lifetime of voting Labour, would respond none too politely to such an accusation, if those making it had the courage to make it personally rather than via Twitter or TV interviews.



[Sigh] It seems that the morons in Labour have still not realised that a terrorist-hugging, anti-Semite, communist idiot isn’t the best choice for leading a party.



It is, of course, palpable nonsense to suggest that Boris Johnson’s government is further to the right that its recent predecessors, and even more ridiculous to claim it’s more Thatcherite than Thatcher. This all hails from the “Everyone I disagree with is Hitler” school of Leftist thought.



I’m not sure how protecting the NHS, spending more in education and embracing climate change myths is hard right-wing, but there you go that’s what Labour is saying.



So why the constant claims of extremism? Partly it’s a defensive, tit-for-tat reaction to the accusations levelled against Corbyn and his closest advisers. The result of the general election has pretty much drawn a line under who believed what in that respect. But it’s also a sign of Labour’s – and the wider Left’s – lack of imagination and, perhaps, an even more worrying lack of vocabulary.



It is easy to attack extremists. Any of us could do it in our sleep. We know what extremists believe and we know we have reasons to fear them. We can flick through any history book and easily identify those whose views were dangerous and which caused the greatest damage to humanity when left unchecked. But how to attack and undermine opponents who are much closer to you on the political spectrum than you care to admit?



… 



**If the results from last Friday morning haven’t convinced them, then I’ll put it in black and white: voters don’t believe Boris Johnson is an extremist.** Is that plain enough for them? Maybe they’ll be proved right in time. Maybe Johnson is a secret fascist, just waiting for his chance to instal [sic] an unelected junta.



But while we wait with bated breath for that peculiar turn of events, w **hat will Labour do? Continue with this pointless stream of invective and insult towards a man who is much more popular than any single individual on the Labour benches?** Continue to imply that not only did the working class “betray” Labour but are probably measuring themselves up for black shirts as we speak? Or will they catch themselves on and start opposing the government for what it does rather than for what Labour, without a shred of evidence, thinks it might one day do?



A new approach is obviously needed. And it should start by not treating us as fools. We knew what we were voting for and it was not extremism. For a party whose leader supped with terrorists and anti-Semites throughout his career, for MPs who sought to install that leader in a Number 10 despite their reservations (reservations only being aired now, safely after the polls have closed) the accusation of extremism is both poignant and deeply ironic.



In New Zealand John Key was widely mocked by Labour, yet he maintained a higher approval rating than St Jacinda can manage. Labour still think John Key was evil **despite him keeping every single welfare initiative implemented by Helen Clark in place** , and even extending some of them. In the UK the same demonisation of Boris Johnson will see UK Labour consigned to the opposition benches for a very long time.



Will our own National party see the folly in this sort of behaviour themselves, or will they continue to egg on supporters with the mistaken belief that voters were stupid? Time will tell.

This has something to do with extraordinary events often crowding out uneventful ones – and standing out. As time progresses the extraordinary events tend to get overly weighted and distort the memory.
Balz Rittmeyer and Marc Fehr at this site here present a couple of charts from the Swiss Meteorological Office depicting the frequency of white Christmases (December 24-26) occurring in Zurich, Switzerland, putting to rest the often asserted claim “we don’t get white Christmases like we used to“.
The following chart uses green trees to depict snowless Christmases, white trees to depict white Christmases, and half green/half white to show Christmases where at least one day had at least 1 cm of snow.

Rittmeyer and Fehr write:
Is climate change to blame for seldom occurrence of white Christmases nowadays? No. A look at the statistics shows that in earlier times there wasn’t more often snow on December 24, 25 or 26.”
Zurich is located at the base of the Alps at some 400 meters above sea level. Clearly in the 1930s Zurich saw a number Christmas holidays with snow on the ground. But note how in the 1940s Zurich saw 9 consecutive Christmases in a row without snow – by far the record. This year it appears that Zurich will reach 5 years in a row – yet still far short of the 1940s record. Arguably the last 15 years have been a bit on the light side, but so was the period from 1941 – 1960.
First 1843 London Christmas cards depicted no snow
Rittmeyer and Fehr also write that the misconception of more frequent snowy Christmas days is in part due to early idyllic postcard and book images of Christmas, such as those we often see on today’s Christmas greeting cards. They report that the first Christmas cards printed in London in 1843 showed no snow (citing Swiss climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann). It wasn’t until later, beginning in 1860, after Englishmen started spending the Christmas holidays in the Swiss mountains did images of snow appear on greeting cards in London.
Also analyses of snow on Christmas day in Germany also show no trend as well.

"Over the past decade, Umeshwar Singh Amra has witnessed his homeland descend into a battleground. The war being waged in Hasdeo Arand, a rich and biodiverse Indian forest, has pitted indigenous people, ancient trees, elephants and sloth bears against the might of bulldozers, trucks and hydraulic jacks, fighting with a single purpose: the extraction of coal. Yet under a new “self-reliant India” plan by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to boost the economy post-Covid-19 and reduce costly imports, 40 new coalfields in some of India’s most ecologically sensitive forests are to be opened up for commercial mining.  Among them are four huge blocks of Hasdeo Arand’s 420,000 acres of forest in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, which sit above an estimated 5bn tonnes of coal. It marks a significant shift. The coal industry in India is state-owned, but this auction of 40 new coal blocks will see the creation of a privatised, commercial coal sector in India. Among those bidding for it are India’s rich and powerful industrial giants, including the $14bn (£11bn) Adani group run by the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who operates India’s largest coal power plants and has close ties to Modi. The coal auction has already proved controversial at both the local and political level. At least seven of the coal blocks up for auction were previously deemed “no go” areas for mining due to their environmentally valuable status and about 80% of the blocks are home to indigenous communities and thick forest cover. Four state governments – West Bengal, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh – have written to Modi in opposition or raised legal objections to the auction, and one coal block, which overlapped with the Tadoba tiger reserve in Maharashtra, has already been removed. Amra, who is an Adivasi, a term used to describe India’s indigenous people, was one of nine local sarpanchs  – village leaders – who recently wrote to Modi demanding a stop to the auction in Hasdeo Arand. He said: “If the government gave me the option to give up my life in exchange for no more mining happening in the forest, I would do it in a second.” Amra has seen first-hand the environmental devastation wreaked by open-cast coal mines. In 2011, two vast open-cast mines were excavated on the forest’s peripheries, ripping up the fragile land and filling the surroundings with pollution, smoke, heat, noise and poison. Crime rose drastically in the area and the elephants that lived in the forest, disoriented by the new hostile conditions, became aggressive, leading to dozens of deaths. The prospect of more significant blocks of the forest, the largest in India, being handed over to private mining operations was more than Amra could bear. Five villages will be destroyed and more than 6,000 mainly indigenous people displaced, as well as thousands of hectares of trees, torn down for mines and roads. “If more mining happens everything will change; the natural resources will be gone, our way of life will disappear, everything will be under threat,” he said. “We are tribal people, we cannot go out and live in the cities and no amount of money can ever compensate us. There is no forest like this in the world – cut it down and it can never be replaced.” While across the world governments have geared towards a “green recovery” post Covid-19 – the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said recently there was “no good reason for any country to include coal” in recovery plans – India is putting fossil fuel at the forefront of its strategy to turn the pandemic into economic opportunity. “Why cannot India be the world’s largest exporter of coal?” asked Modi as he announced the coal auction project. Yet with its 45% ash content, making it some of the most polluting coal in the world, there is unlikely to be an international market for Indian coal. In addition, many major factories in India cannot run on “dirty” domestic coal, meaning they will still need to import it from abroad. There is also a question of necessity. While India is the world’s second largest consumer of coal, and annually imports 247m tonnes, costing more than $20bn (£15bn), India’s electricity demand is forecast to fall by up to 15% over the next five years due to the economic reverberations of Covid-19. Meanwhile, a report this week by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air concluded that the current state-run coal mines of India already have capacity to produce 20% more coal than the expected demand in 2030. Environmental activists also question why India cannot be weaned off foreign coal through a gradual increase in investment in domestic renewable energy, such as solar. This month, Modi inaugurated Asia’s largest solar farm in the state of Madhya Pradesh. India is the world’s cheapest producer of solar power and the cost of constructing a new solar plant is 14% less than that of a building a new coal plant. With proper investment, it has been estimated that the solar energy industry could generate as many as 1.6m jobs in India by 2022, far more than would be generated by domestic coal. But India’s joint secretary for coal, Maddirala Nagaraju, said that all the country’s projections showed that demand for coal would increase and insisted that increased domestic coalmining was the “cheapest way of meeting the energy needs of the people”. “We are the country with the fourth largest coal reserves in the world and we need to provide energy security for over a billion people: coal is the only way,” said Nagaraju. He conceded that there would be “costly trade-offs” in opening up protected forest areas for mining, but said this had the support of local communities who “want the land to be acquired because they get high compensation packages”. He added: “Yes, some people have objected, but the mining will bring a lot of development, employment and money to these areas. How else will we develop these Adivasi people in central India?” Among the prominent opponents to the project is the former environment minister, Jairan Ramesh, who also wrote a letter to Modi condemning coal auctions. It was during his time in office that a survey was carried out in 2010 on India’s biggest coalfields and determined that 30% were “no-go areas” due to their biodiversity or resident tiger or elephant populations. Yet since Modi came to power in 2014, that 30% has been reduced to about 5%. Ramesh alleged this was a direct result of pressure from the powerful corporate coal lobby, Adani in particular. The Adani group is contracted to operate two of the mines currently open in Hasdeo Arand, and has been pushing to expand mining operations in the forest for years, even reportedly offering microloans to local tribal people in order to win their support. “Adani is behind this,” claims Ramesh. “He is one of the most influential forces on the government.” “Modi poses as a great environmental champion globally but his track record is one of complete loosening of environmental laws and regulations,” Ramesh added. “The corporate lobbies are just too powerful and in the name of ease for businesses, environment has become the biggest casualty.” The Adani group rejected the allegations as baseless and politically motivated. A spokesperson said the company: “Has always strived to provide balanced and affordable energy supply to an energy-deprived population of 1.3 billion people whose per capita energy consumption is less than half the world’s average and almost one-tenth of many of the developed economies. “The Adani Group has been a leading contributor to India’s vision for a balanced energy mix and an enabler of India’s leadership in meeting its [Paris agreement on climate change] target.” It said it aimed to become the world’s largest renewable energy company by 2025. • This article was amended on 18 August 2020.

For those of us waiting patiently for Jacinda Ardern to de-laminate and fall apart at the seams, this week has seen the Prime Minister ticking yet another “walk on water” box.



Just when we begin to see the writing on the wall, as this disastrous government of imbeciles stumbles from appalling [disaster to appalling disaster](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/labours-fail-series-a-surfeit-of-ministerial-misadventure/) with broken promise after broken promise. With ministers showing levels of ineptitude never before seen in this country’s history. With Green philosophy and climate change nonsense captivating their thinking because they’re not clever enough or are simply too lazy to do the research. 



With all the dastardly things they’ve managed to get wrong, their leader continues tiptoe through the droppings with none of it sticking and then, out of the blue, yet another mysterious masterstroke.



Jacinda Ardern yesterday stepped up to the mark and said what needed to have been said years ago with regard to the Erebus disaster. In a joint presentation with Air New Zealand which included a note from Her Majesty the Queen, Ms Ardern delivered an unequivocal, sincere and complete apology to all the families.



Finally, this puts to rest once and for all the outrageous suggestion that has lingered all these years, that the accident was the fault of the captain or crew, originally floated by the then Inspector of Air Accidents whose experience might well have been more appropriate to light aircraft than wide bodied commercial jets.



Justice Mahon seems to also have been vindicated despite Muldoon throwing him under a bus all those years ago and despite the controversy. Many always believed he was completely correct in declaring he’d been forced to listen to “an orchestrated litany of lies”. 



The company changed the flight co-ordinates and Captain Collins, a thorough and meticulous man who took pride in his professionalism, was entitled to expect that the aircraft would be on the course he had been briefed on.



The aircraft wasn’t where it was supposed to be – flying straight up McMurdo Sound where there was unlimited flat terrain ahead. They were, in fact, some 30 kilometres further south on a direct course to Mt Erebus and the rest is history.



In making a public apology on the 40th anniversary of this tragedy, the Prime Minister has finally delivered closure for many people and not before time. She has done the right thing and come out looking like a glossy magazine cover photo covered in that magical fairy dust we all thought was flittering away in the wind.



The “great unwashed” will remember occasions like this where Ms Ardern is absolutely at her best and will probably completely [forget all the disasters.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/a-long-list-of-failures-scandals/)



Poor Simon Bridges continues to look very average while the PM hits just enough boundaries to keep her very much in the game. 



Hot on the heels of a [disastrous poll result](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/national-slips-under-40-and-no-one-likes-simon-bridges-latest-poll/) and a not so well received [policy release about gangs,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/strike-force-raptor-unit-proposed-to-tackle-gangs/) the National Party seem unable to get any traction at all.



It won’t be far from game, set and match if she is able to keep this up and if the opposition is unable to find something that resonates soundly with the electorate.

Haiti is a tragic failure. For a long time one of the Americas’ poorest nations, the country suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010. Then, last month, the government of the neighboring Dominican Republic decided to return home hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants who are currently residing and making a decent living in the country. With the presidential election around the corner, Haitians will have an opportunity to choose new, more promising, leadership.



Ultimately, however, it will be the individual Haitians who will have to make a success of their lives.



In 2013, Haiti’s per capita income ranked 161st out of 181 countries surveyed. Adjusted for purchasing power parity, it was $1,648 per year — poorer than the failed African state of Zimbabwe. Life expectancy was 63 years and infant mortality 57 per 1,000 life births. World averages for life expectancy and infant mortality are 70 and 26 respectively.





Ultimately, Haiti’s salvation will not come from the discredited political class, but from the efforts of individual people to improve their lives and the lives of their families.



The failure of Haitian development is remarkable. Having declared independence in 1804, Haiti is one of the oldest independent and self‐​governing nations in the Americas. Yet, it has never built the institutions that would enable it to prosper. According to the World Bank, Haiti’s rule of law ranked 197th out of 211 countries surveyed, and corruption ranked 194th out of 208 countries surveyed.



The country also has benefited from decades of international goodwill. The United States has been pumping foreign aid into Haiti for decades. Then came the devastating earthquake of 2010 and some 13 billion additional dollars poured into the small Caribbean nation of 10 million people. While some of it undoubtedly helped those in need, earlier this year an NBC journalist visiting Haiti wondered, “The disconnect between the massive amount of private and public aid and the poverty, disease and homelessness that still plague the country raises a question that critics say is too difficult to answer: Where did all that money go?”



Haiti’s failure is all the more remarkable considering that the country shares the island of Hispaniola with a much more successful neighbor — the Dominican Republic. In 2013, the Dominican Republic’s income per capita was $11,796 or 7 times that of Haiti’s. The Dominican Republic’s life expectancy and infant mortality were 73 and 23 respectively. The country outperformed Haiti in terms of the rule of law and corruption. Importantly, the Dominican Republic is both more economically free, according to the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World report, and easier to do business in, according to the World Bank’s Doing Business report, than Haiti.



It is partly for that reason that, historically, Haitians sought work in the Dominican Republic. According to estimates, some 460,000 Haitian migrants recently lived in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic government’s recent decision to send most of those Haitian migrants back home will likely exacerbate the already strained humanitarian situation in Haiti.



But the return of the migrants also could provide a much‐​needed impetus for reform. Haiti has a semi‐​presidential system of government, with the president appointing the prime minister and setting the direction of government policies. The next presidential election will be in October, and 56 men and women are vying for the job.



One of the candidates is Michelet Nestor — the son of a street vendor and a butler, born in an impoverished Port‐​au‐​Prince township that lacked both potable water and latrines. Having worked for five years as a policeman, Nestor obtained a law degree from Loyola University in New Orleans. Today, he is the CEO of a private staffing company, president of an education foundation and runs a local charity.



As Nestor put it to me during a recent interview, “Haiti is often perceived by the international community as a failed state. Given the constant misappropriation of funds by the government, there is a lot of distrust between it and the people it claims to serve. To take Haiti forward, we need to instill a climate of fiscal accountability and transparency, with our people, the press and the Diaspora being able to monitor and better participate in a modern system of collaborative governance.”



Whoever wins the next election, the long‐​suffering people of Haiti have a right to demand and to expect an end to corruption and a government that understands the importance of economic freedom and welcoming business environment. Ultimately, Haiti’s salvation will not come from the discredited political class, but from the efforts of individual people to improve their lives and the lives of their families.

"It’s been established that enjoying green spaces in otherwise grey urban areas can lead to improved mental health for city-dwellers. But new research has revealed how surprisingly quickly those benefits appear, and how long they last. Research from the University of Exeter’s European Centre for Environment and Human Health found that people living in towns and cities with more parks and gardens tend to report greater well-being than those without. But it also revealed that relocating to a greener part of town led to improvements in their mental health that lasted for at least three years. There are other life changes that influence mental health, and many of those do so gradually, or else seem to be only short-lived. Job promotion and marriage boost well-being in the short term, for example, and financial windfalls can lead to gradual improvements. But these new findings indicate that simply increasing the ratio of green to grey in urban neighbourhoods is likely to provide benefits that are not only immediate, but which continue to deliver benefits long afterwards. The research, just published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, used data from the British Household Panel Survey, a long-running household survey project, based in Essex. We analysed five consecutive years of mental health questionnaires, answered by people who had relocated to a different residential area between the second and third years. Two groups of people were tracked: 600 who moved to greener urban areas, and 470 who moved to areas that were less green. While the group who moved to greener suburbs showed significant improvements for all three years after their relocation, there was not a corresponding decline in mental health for those who moved to less green areas. There was, however, a decline in the mental health of these people in the year before they moved. It’s not clear whether this was some degree of dread at the anticipated relocation, or whether it was declining well-being that lay behind the decision to relocate. Studying people who relocate from one area to another can offer insights into the effects of town planning decisions that alter the make-up of city neighbourhoods. It’s hard to design and carry out experiments that involve the radical “re-greening” and “de-greening” of our cities to see what effects these processes have. But we can get important clues by looking at the average effects that result from the loss or gain of green space after someone has moved home. The benefits we’ve observed have implications for planning policy, which aims to improve public health through urban design. Our findings suggest that improved mental health is not the result simply of the novelty of living in a greener area, which might wear off quickly. Creating parks and green corridors in our increasingly urban landscapes could represent good value-for-money public health services, delivering long term benefits to community health. How good is green space for urban residents? An earlier study published in Psychological Science estimated the effects on mental health delivered by a 1% difference in urban green space, also working with Household Panel Survey data from England and controlling for the effects of personality. The study found that living in an area with high rather than low green space was equal to roughly a third of the benefit of being married, and a tenth of the benefit of having a job.  Importantly, in estimating the effects of green space, the team accounted for other factors which can influence mental health, such as the individuals’ income, family and employment circumstances. They also accounted for area factors which may overlap with urban greenness, such as the socio-economic profile of the neighbourhood. Depression and depressive disorders are now the leading cause of disability in middle to high income countries – mental health is a critical public health issue of modern times. And it’s quite possible this trend is related to how quickly the world’s population is moving to the city: in the world’s more developed regions, more than three-quarters of the population live in urban environments, with the reduced access to the natural world that brings. So while these studies don’t show that relocating to a greener area will definitely increase happiness, the findings fit with other experimental work that shows how short spells in a green space does improve people’s mood, and cognitive functioning. Our findings join those from earlier epidemiological studies that clearly demonstrate the link between health benefits and green space."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week’s print edition of Der Spiegel features an interview with Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the Director of the climate doomsday Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), and advisor to Pope Francis.
Hat-tip: Reader Stefan B.
8°C of warming
When asked if society is headed for trouble, Schellnhuber warns that if we continue burning fossil fuels as before, then “we will end up with 4 or even 8°C of warming” and that “we will find ourselves in an extremely dangerous world“.
Only 20% chance humanity will save itself
In the interview he says that “on bad days I get really depressed” and that humanity finds itself in the “race of its life“. He tells Spiegel that the planet is going to take some hard hits, but that it still isn’t too late to avert total damage. Throughout the interview Schellnhuber’s pessimism at time takes on weird, surrealistic dimensions. In his book, Spiegel writes, Schellnhuber sees only a 20% chance the world will succeed in putting the brakes on climate change.
State must intervene
In the interview Schellnhuber harshly criticizes the UN climate process, describing the conferneces as Kafkaesque events that keep postponing the rescue of the world. He says we have to wonder “if there is any intelligent life on the planet“.
He sees little chance of curbing the fossil fuel industry quickly enough, yet holds out hope that divesting from fossil fuel companies might do the trick:
If for example some influential investors pulled their money out of the coal, oil and gas industry because they felt it no longer had a future, then we would get an avalanche dynamic that could cause the old system to quickly implode on itself.”
Wow! And all the human casualties resulting from that scenario be damned, Schellnhuber seems to be saying.
Throughout the interview Schellnhuber calls on the state to use its might to massively intervene in the free market and industry, e.g. especially the automotive industry. He hopes that governments will soon require carmakers to meet punishingly high emission standards and in this way force them to produce electric cars instead.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In the interview Schellnhuber tells Spiegel that (when he isn’t flying all over the world to places like Australia in a jet) he gets around in an i3 by BMW. Sounds pricey. He tells Spiegel he wonders why people still drive the dirty cars powered by combustion engines.
Worse than thought 5 or 10 years ago
When asked if scientists have been too shrill with their warnings and if he is perhaps being too alarmist, Schellnhuber responds:
Precisely because I, as an expert, know that we have very little time to stop a global tragedy, I have to raise my voice. […] Unfortunately the situation looks more dramatic than what we perceived it to be five or ten years ago.”
Here Schellnhuber claims already the West Antarctic Peninsula has already begun to collapse.
When asked if he tends to jump on the alarmist prognoses that suit his concept regarding storm frequency, Schellnhuber denies that he does, but adds, “but my physical intuition tells me that storms, especially in connection with thunderstorms, will be more severe all over the world if more energy gets pumped into the atmosphere. Nature will decide who is right.”
Schellnhuber also tells Spiegel he does not see any global temperature pause whatsoever in the temperature datasets. But he does admit the globe cooled for awhile after 1945 and that no one knows why.
Moon stations on earth
At the end of the interview Schellnhuber piles on the global warming doom hyperbole, warning that a world that is 7 or 8 degrees warmer will be almost uninhabitable and that “we will be building moon stations on earth“, citing today’s Persian Gulf and its completely artificially climatized urbanization – and with “bizarre medical consequences“. He adds:
Even though in Abu Dhabi where the sun shines the whole year, the residents there suffer from a massive lack of exposure to light. Nowhere else on earth are there so many people with vitamin D deficiency, which leads to rickets and other things.”
At 65, it’s time for Schellnhuber to also have himself checked for possible Vitamin deficiencies, and to go into retirement. He’d do science a big favor.

What do the Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation, World Association of Girl Guides, the Solar Energy Industries Association, the Maryknoll Sisters of Dominic, Women in Europe for a Common Future and the University of East Anglia have in common? They’ve all just come back from a beano in Peru!
Along, that is, with 1342 other organisations.

The UK Government sent 36 delegates, while British universities managed 32 more. Even the Buddhists managed to send 10, including their Weather Risk Specialist, Mr Ming Peng.
Greenpeace, WWF, Christian Aid, FOE and Oxfam together despatched 148 people. Has nobody told them about duplication of effort? Are those who donate to such charities really happy to see their money lavished on nonsense like this?
Even the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University (!) thought it worth sending 7 delegates. I thought they were not bothered about earthly affairs!
The list goes on. (Well I expect you guessed that already!).
Wait for it – the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation sent their Chair, yes, Bianca, along with her research assistant.
As well as sending journalists, the BBC also sent 2 staff from BBC Media Action, described as the BBC’s international development charity. (More on them later).
At a conservative estimate of £5000 per head, the cost of participating must have been in the region of £50 million. Heaven knows what the carbon footprint was.
Well, I suppose it’s better than working. See you all in Paris next year!

 ** _Congress should_**



• recognize and publicly acknowledge that the purpose of trade is to increase the size of the economic pie;  
  
• recognize and publicly acknowledge that trade barriers are regressive taxes that reduce real incomes and raise living costs;  
  
• recognize and publicly acknowledge that trade barriers increase the cost of production for businesses in the United States and make them less competitive with producers in other locations;  
  
• recognize and publicly acknowledge that greater access to imports — not greater access to export markets — is the primary conveyor of trade’s benefits;  
  
• recognize and publicly acknowledge that production and export subsidies distort markets and benefit the few at a cost to the many;  
  
• recognize and publicly acknowledge that investment in domestic value‐​added activities is more important to U.S. growth and employment than is reducing foreign market barriers to U.S. exports;  
  
• recognize and publicly acknowledge that “Buy American” provisions in various federal procurement laws and regulations that preclude use of foreign‐​made products and prohibit bidding from foreign companies result in the waste of tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer resources every year and contribute to budget deficits and the continuous demand for more taxes;  
  
• eliminate tariffs on imports of intermediate goods — if not on all imported products — to reduce production costs and remove impediments to investment in downstream, importusing, domestic industries;  
  
• reform — if not repeal — the U.S. antidumping law to mitigate the effects of import duties on downstream, import‐​using, domestic industries;  
  
• pass legislation requiring a comprehensive audit of the U.S. regulatory, tax, and policy environments to identify redundancies, inefficiencies, and systemic problems that artificially raise the cost of doing business and deter investment in U.S. value‐​added activity;  
  
• reform — if not repeal — the Jones Act to reduce excessively high U.S. transportation costs; and  
  
• ratify the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership and pursue other forms of trade liberalization.



Imagine how impoverished we would be if we each lived in isolation, making our own clothes, building our own shelters, hunting and harvesting our own food. Forget leisure or luxuries; all of our time would be consumed trying to produce bare necessities just to subsist. The purpose of exchange is to enable each of us to focus our productive efforts on what we do best. Thus, instead of allocating small portions of our time to the impossible task of producing each of the necessities and luxuries we wish to consume, we each specialize in an occupation and exchange the monetized output we produce most efficiently for the goods and services we produce less efficiently. That way we are able to produce and consume more output than we could in the absence of specialization and trade. The larger the size of the market, the greater is the scope for specialization, exchange, and economic growth.



Free trade is the extension of free markets across political borders. Enlarging markets in this manner — to integrate more buyers, sellers, investors, and workers — enables more refined specialization and economies of scale. Those, in turn, lead to greater wealth and higher living standards. When goods, services, capital, and labor flow freely across borders, Americans can take full advantage of the opportunities of the international marketplace.



The benefits of trade come from imports, which deliver more competition, greater variety, lower prices, better quality, and continuing innovation. Opening foreign markets is a valuable part of trade policy because larger markets allow for greater specialization and economies of scale, but real free trade requires liberalization at home. The real benefits of trade are measured by the value of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports — the so‐​called “terms of trade.” When we transact at the local supermarket, we seek to maximize the value we obtain by getting the most for our dollars. In other words, we want to import more value from the local merchant than we wish to export. In our daily transactions, we seek to run personal trade deficits.



But when it comes to trading across borders or when our individual transactions are aggregated at the national level, we seem to forget these basic principles and assume that the goal of exchange is to achieve a trade surplus. We forget that trade barriers at home raise the costs and reduce the amount of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports. But, as Adam Smith famously observed, “What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.”



U.S. trade barriers hurt U.S. citizens, as consumers, taxpayers, workers, producers, and investors. Americans would be better off if we simply undertook our own reforms — on tariffs, regulations, and other artificial impediments to commerce — without regard for what other governments do. Congress has the authority to remove U.S. trade barriers, so the fact that many barriers remain implies that policymakers think U.S. citizens are unworthy of the freedom to make their own economic choices. Free trade is about the freedom of people to transact as they wish, when they wish, with whom they wish, and without politicians and bureaucrats as gatekeepers.



Although tariffs and other trade barriers have been reduced considerably since the end of World War II, U.S. policy continues to accommodate egregious amounts of protectionism. We have “Buy American” rules that restrict most government procurement spending to U.S. suppliers, ensuring that taxpayers get the smallest bang for their buck. We have heavily protected services industries, such as air transportation and shipping, that drive up the cost of everything. We have apparently interminable farm subsidies; quotas and high tariffs on imported sugar; and high tariffs on basic consumer products, such as clothing and footwear. We have energy export restrictions, the market‐​distorting cronyism of the Export‐​Import bank, and antidumping duties that strangle downstream industries and tax consumers. We have regulatory protectionism masquerading as public health and safety precautions, protectionist rules of origin and local content requirements that limit trade’s benefits, and restrictions on foreign investment. The list goes on.



In our globalized economy, expanding the size of the market not only means more customers, it means more competition for U.S. consumers’ dollars, more providers of intermediate goods, more opportunities for supply chain collaboration, greater variety, innovation, and so on. When trade barriers come down, the factory floor can span borders and oceans, and production can be organized in new and more efficient formats. The result is more value creation and greater wealth.



Globalization means that companies have growing options with respect to where and how they produce. So governments must compete for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local workforce is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions; and so on.



In most tradable industries, global production sharing has become the norm. In 2015, about half of the value of U.S. imports was industrial supplies, other intermediate goods, and capital equipment — the purchases of U.S. businesses, not end‐​user consumers. According to estimates from the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, over two‐​thirds of the value of global trade flows in 2015 was intermediate goods trade.



Increasing global interdependence is reflected in a variety of other statistics, as well. For example, only about 50 percent of the value of U.S. imports from China reflects Chinese labor, materials, and overhead. The other half consists of value added in other countries. When it comes to high‐​technology products, Chinese value added is much lower — less than 5 percent for the “Assembled in China” Apple iPhone.



Meanwhile, more than 30 percent of the content value of a Boeing Dreamliner is imported or produced by foreign‐​owned companies in the United States. The largest steel producer in America is Arcelor‐​Mittal, a majority Indian‐​owned company with headquarters in Luxembourg. American icon General Motors produces and sells more automobiles in China than in the United States; Ford Motor Company has more production and assembly operations outside the United States than within it; Chrysler is an Italian company; and more than half of U.S. auto production occurs in foreign nameplate factories across the United States. In fact, there is over $1 trillion of foreign direct investment in U.S. manufacturing operations — the most foreign investment in any country’s manufacturing sector — and more than 6 million Americans work for foreign‐​headquartered companies in the United States.



Electoral campaigns are often rife with misinformation about trade, free trade, free trade agreements, and U.S. trade policy. Members of Congress should feel a responsibility to distill fact from fiction and to set the record straight for the American public. A rejection of trade and international cooperation in favor of protectionism and retrenchment would be a costly mistake — as history reminds us. Members of Congress should be aware of the most common trade fallacies and be able to refute them.



 _Trade Is Not a Zero‐​Sum Game_



Too often trade is portrayed as a competition between Team USA and the foreign team. According to that narrative, exports are Team USA’s points; imports are the foreign team’s points; the trade account is the scoreboard; the deficit appearing on that scoreboard means the United States is losing at trade; and it’s losing because the foreign team cheats.



But trade does not lend itself to sports metaphors. It is not a zero‐​sum game with a winning and losing team. Trade is a mutually beneficial endeavor that occurs between people — not countries — seeking to obtain value. Aggregated trade statistics are just the culmination of billions of daily transactions between people cooperatively pursuing the satisfaction of their needs and wants.



 _The Trade Deficit Does Not Reflect Trade Policy Failure_



The objective of trade policy is not to secure a trade surplus, but to create the conditions that enable individuals to specialize in the most refined capacities, create greater value, exchange larger surpluses, and achieve stronger economic growth. Those are the mechanisms through which the wealth of nations expands.



The United States has run trade deficits for 41 straight years and, as the issuer of the world’s preferred reserve currency, may always run trade deficits. Those deficits reflect favorable global perceptions of the quality of U.S. investments. There is no leakage of economic activity associated with running trade deficits because the excess dollars that go abroad to purchase more from foreigners than foreigners purchase from Americans comes back to the United States in the form of investment. That investment undergirds U.S. economic activity, which supports jobs.



The data strongly suggest that there are positive correlations between the magnitude and direction of the trade deficit and the magnitude and direction of economic output. The same goes for the relationship between the trade deficit and U.S. employment. Looked at another way, if the goal of trade policy is to achieve a trade surplus, then by extension the goal of trade policy is slower economic growth, even contraction.



 _U.S. Manufacturing Is Thriving in the Global Economy_



One of the most persistent fallacies is that international trade killed U.S. manufacturing. The problem with the assertion is that U.S. manufacturing is thriving — as it always has. By any relevant measure — output, value added, revenues, exports, imports, investment, research and development expenditures — U.S. manufacturing remains a global “powerhouse.” With respect to most of those metrics, year after year (except during recessions), the sector sets new records.



Manufacturing’s share of the U.S. economy peaked in 1953 at 28.1 percent; today, manufacturing accounts for only 12.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). But in 1953, U.S. manufacturing value added amounted to $110 billion, compared with a record $2.1 trillion in 2015. A sector that produces, today, more than six times the value in real terms what it produced when it was the engine of the U.S. economy, can hardly be described as declining.



Of course, employment in the manufacturing sector peaked at 19.4 million workers in 1979 and has been on a downward trajectory ever since. But that is something to celebrate, not lament. Producing more output with fewer inputs is the objective of economic activity. These so‐​called “productivity gains” are the wellspring of wealth creation and higher living standards. It is a sign of manufacturing strength, not weakness, that fewer workers are required on the production line today. If 10 workers were needed to produce 1,000 widgets per day last year, but use of a new machine enabled 5 workers to produce the same number of widgets per day this year, then that productivity improvement amounted to a doubling of output per worker. Still, to reap the full benefits of that productivity gain, the talents of the 5 displaced workers must be redeployed elsewhere in the economy. Thus, it is incumbent upon policymakers to remove the impediments to labor market adjustment that slow or prevent displaced workers from finding new jobs in new firms in new industries.



U.S. manufacturing attracts more foreign direct investment than any other country’s manufacturing sector. After 12 straight years of net growth, the stock of foreign direct investment in U.S. manufacturing surpassed $1 trillion in 2014. By comparison, the stock of foreign direct investment in China’s manufacturing sector — the world’s second largest manufacturing investment destination, which is now famously rife with overcapacity — is less than half that of the U.S. stock.



 _Outsourcing Is Good for the U.S. Economy_



People tend to think of outsourcing, or outward foreign direct investment, as a substitute to domestic value‐​added activity. The quintessential example is that of a factory closing somewhere in the Rust Belt and being rebuilt in Mexico or China, rafter by rafter, bolt by bolt to produce for export back to the United States. U.S. companies invest abroad for a variety of important reasons, but serving U.S. demand from those foreign locations is not prominent among them. Over 90 percent of the value of output from foreign affiliates of U.S.-based companies is sold in foreign markets.



Most outward investment is made to serve purposes that cannot be fulfilled practicably or cost‐​effectively in the United States. Reaching potential foreign customers without having any physical presence in their countries, for example, would be a difficult task. There are several reasons to invest abroad that are highly unlikely to be successfully replicated from within the United States. They include marketing to foreign customers, getting better acquainted with foreign product preferences, having retail locations to serve demand abroad, performing postsale and other customer‐​service activities, tapping into local expertise, and diversifying market‐​specific risks.



Outward investment is essential for U.S.-based companies to compete effectively in the global economy. In reality, outsourcing is overwhelmingly complementary to U.S. value‐​added activity, not a substitute for it.



 _Small and Medium‐​Sized Businesses and Lower‐​Income Americans Are the Primary Beneficiaries of Trade_.



The myth that trade disproportionately benefits big multinational corporations and high‐​income individuals is another assertion that fails to hold up to the evidence. Trade barriers increase the costs of goods and services to businesses and the cost of living for consumers. Trade barriers are costs. A tariff or other barrier to trade is much more likely to deter a small or medium‐​sized firm than a large sophisticated firm from engaging in international trade. Likewise, the cost of a tariff constitutes a much higher percentage of a lower‐​income family’s budget than a higher‐​income family’s budget. It is a regressive tax.



The Gilded Age adage that “the tariff is the mother of the trust” is still quite apt today. Protectionism always has and always will serve to protect incumbent business interests from competition.



 _Eliminate Tariffs on All Intermediate Goods_



At great expense to producers, consumers, and taxpayers, the U.S. government maintains “protective” tariffs on thousands of imported products, including many items not even produced domestically. To mitigate those costs, Congress has, on occasion, suspended the duties on some of these products through the passage of so‐​called “miscellaneous tariff bills.” These bills temporarily suspend duties on certain, noncontroversial products — usually intermediate goods, such as chemicals, electronic components, and mechanical parts — that are not manufactured domestically but that U.S. producers need to generate their own output. The impact of these bills is limited by their temporary nature, by the requirement that there be “no domestic production,” and by the caveat that the suspended duty must not reduce tariff revenues by more than $500,000.



The last miscellaneous tariff bill provided an estimated $748 million of import tax relief. However, in 2014, U.S. Customs collected nearly $45 billion in duties, taxes, and fees levied on imports, with approximately $27 billion collected on imported intermediate goods. That amounts to nothing more than a tax on U.S. value creators.



Recognizing that downstream import‐​consuming industries account for a greater share of U.S. GDP, employ more workers, pay more taxes, and are more innovative than the protected firms in upstream industries that produce raw materials, Congress should permanently eliminate import duties on all intermediate goods, regardless of the existence of domestic production. Otherwise, Congress should expect duties on products like sugar, steel, magnesium, polyvinyl chloride, and other crucial manufacturing inputs to continue to chase companies to foreign shores — where those inputs are less expensive — and deter foreign companies from setting up shop stateside.



 _Reform the Antidumping Law to Mitigate Collateral Damage on U.S. Import‐​Consuming Firms_



Antidumping proceedings involve more than a dispute between a domestic industry and its foreign competition. They also involve a conflict of interests between the relief‐​seeking U.S. industry and its U.S. customers. Those U.S. customers — usually other producers — are given no quarter under the law. If the petitioning industry can demonstrate that it has suffered “material injury” on account of less than fair value imports, duties are imposed — regardless of the impact on the downstream‐​consuming industries and the economy at large.



That is hardly a recipe for rational policymaking. Antidumping duties on products such as magnesium, saccharine, polyvinyl chloride, and hot‐​rolled steel may please their domestic producers, who are freed to raise prices and reap larger profits. But those same duties are costly to U.S. producers of auto parts, food products, paint, and appliances, who consume those products as inputs in their own manufacturing processes.



Since 2000, close to 90 percent of all U.S. antidumping measures involved imposing duties on imported intermediate goods. Yet the statute forbids the administering authority from considering the economic impact of antidumping restrictions on those downstream, import‐​consuming firms or on the economy at large. The antidumping law should be changed to give producers in consuming industries legal standing to participate meaningfully in antidumping proceedings; to require the administering authorities to conduct an analysis of the economic impact of prospective antidumping duties on downstream industries and the economy at large; and to deny imposition of duties if the estimated costs exceed a certain threshold.



 _Require an Audit of U.S. Regulatory, Tax, and Policy Environments_



In the global competition to attract investment from the world’s best companies, the United States has some enormous advantages. For many decades, the United States has been the world’s premier destination for foreign direct investment. But in recent years, the United States has been slipping in a number of important investment‐​location decision criteria. Accordingly, its share of global foreign direct investment declined from 39 percent in 1999 to 21 percent in 2015.



Congress should formally recognize that the United States is competing with the rest of the world to attract investment in domestic value‐​added economic activities, and that success in that regard requires maintenance of smart domestic policies. Accordingly, Congress should pass legislation requiring a comprehensive audit of the U.S. regulatory, tax, and policy environments to identify redundancies, inefficiencies, and systemic problems that artificially raise the cost of doing business and deter investment in U.S. value‐​added activity.



Foreign direct investment is a verdict about the efficacy of a country’s institutions, policies, and potential. Given the importance of foreign direct investment to economic growth, understanding its determinants and crafting policy accordingly are matters of good governance and common sense. As Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) put it, “If we want the U.S. to be the very best place in the world to do business, we need to take a close look at what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong, and how we can eliminate barriers that diminish investment in the U.S.”



 _Repeal the Jones Act_



Congress should finally repeal the nearly 100‐​year‐​old Jones Act, which has been a spectacular failure. It has resulted in the near total decimation of the U.S. shipbuilding industry and increases in the costs of shipping, infrastructure projects, and other forms of transportation — all of which have raised the costs of production and retail prices in the United States for the benefit of a few protected interests. Among the act’s unjustifiable provisions is a ban on foreign shipping between U.S. ports, which is estimated to raise the costs of shipping by $2.8 billion (1996 dollars) annually, according to an International Trade Commission report. However, the indirect costs of using less‐​efficient transportation modes and routes (highway and rail) — including traffic delays, infrastructure erosion, environmental degradation, and higher costs of federal and state procurement projects — adversely affect U.S. GDP as well. Removing Jones Act restrictions to permit greater competition in maritime shipping (as well as air and rail transport) would reduce costs and prices, increase efficiencies, and help the United States remain competitive as a destination for investment.



 _Ratify the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership_



The Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a comprehensive trade and investment agreement between the United States and 11 other Pacific‐​Rim nations, which reduces tariffs and other impediments to trade and investment. Its value as an agreement to create greater wealth and higher living standards by more closely integrating 12 economies accounting for 40 percent of global GDP is indisputable. But there is an even bigger picture to consider.



The TPP is the first step in the process of reestablishing the primacy of nondiscrimination and other tenets of the U.S.-led, post‐​WWII liberal economic order. It is a blueprint for securing U.S. geoeconomic and geopolitical interests now and into the future by refreshing the rules of international trade law and accommodating those institutions to a multipolar, 21st‐​century global economy.



 _Work with the President to Ensure that Other Trade‐​Liberalizing Initiatives Are Pursued_



Other trade initiatives worthy of continued pursuit include the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the World Trade Organization’s Trade in Services Agreement, and the U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty.



Although progress in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations has been slowed by a variety of factors (including the United Kingdom’s likely departure from the European Union), the objective of removing trade barriers between the United States and Europe, as envisaged by the negotiations thus far, would likely yield large dividends for the U.S. economy. Likewise, the negotiations in the World Trade Organization to reach an agreement on services liberalization, if successful, would reduce impediments to competition from foreign service providers in the U.S. market, while creating greater opportunities for U.S. services firms to compete abroad. Finally, the ongoing negotiations with China over a bilateral investment treaty could very well reach a conclusion in the coming year, opening new sectors of the Chinese economy to U.S. investment and vice versa. However, the process could take longer. Either way, congressional support for an eventual investment treaty with China would demonstrate commitment to broadening economic opportunities for Americans, as well as interest in keeping the bilateral relationship on solid ground.

 **T & L**



I’ve taken the time, as it’s made itself available to me, to go through the [11,000+ signatories](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/11258-scientists/) of so-called scientists and I have picked out those who identify as being located in New Zealand. I’ve subjected them all to internet searches. I’ve found that most are scientists of some sort and most have PhDs, so, one can reasonably conclude, most are intelligent.



Most are located in universities, and many are in the NZ Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd. But MOST have **no qualifications nor experience nor research in climate, weather or meteorology.** So, like you and me and Uncle Tom Cobbley and all, theirs are just opinions based on what others have told them. As for me, every single one of the most intelligent and honest people I know (and the intelligence and the honesty have to both be present) have told me that **anthropogenic global warming is a fraud.**



My internet search revealed that most of the university academics are located in ecology/environment departments. They are greenies so it is highly likely that they vote for the Green Party. Although it might be quite irrelevant, many of the university dons were not born nor raised in New Zealand.



As has been pointed out by Canadian and Australian critics, this “document” is an online item, widely distributed among the academic community for [anyone to sign](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/taking-the-mickey-out-of-the-other-11257/), each being called a scientist. **If I’d signed, I’d be counted as a scientist.**



Below is my list of the New Zealand signatories. I’ve left off those that are irrelevant.



In total, **184 signatories** are identified as being located in New Zealand. Of those, my searches identified **13** as scientists involving themselves in the subject, which is ONLY **7%.**



Those 13 are:



Jonathan Tonkin, who has a PhD in Ecology, is reported as saying that global climate and land-use changes are rapidly altering the environment for ecological systems.



“I’m trying to forecast what ecosystems will look like in the future and modelling approaches to ecosystems. The problem is that, with the rate the environment is changing, historical tools we have used **aren’t capable of predicting the future.”**



In view of the Canadian and Australian findings, it’s probably reasonable to apply the 7% relevancy to the total signatories. That would reduce the 11,000 scientists to 770 relevant scientists which is **quite a difference.**



I’m not sure that TV news would headline with “770 scientists around the world warn of untold suffering if the climate emergency is not addressed!” Anyway, isn’t there a consensus of 97% of the world’s climate scientists? Where are their signatures? Are there only 794 climate scientists in the world?

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite a week of bitter cold temperatures, central and western Europe has had a relatively mild winter this year.
Other parts of the northern hemisphere, however, have not been as lucky. For example Southeastern Europe, Central and Eastern Asia have seen massive waves of bitter cold and heavy snow. Climate Depot here tallies up the damage.
Now there are emerging indications that central and western Europe may need to brace for more bitter cold and treacherous winter conditions starting in early February.
German weather and climate analysis site wobleibtdieerderwaermung here writes that leading models are looking at a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) over the Arctic over the coming days, which in turn will very likely lead to another powerful cold wave this winter for Western and Central Europe.
The German site writes that currently calculations for the stratosphere at approx. 30 km altitude appear as follows:

ECMWF projection for pressure (geopotential) and temperature of the upper stratosphere from 23 January – 1 February 2016. Source: www.geo.fu-berlin.de/met/ag/strat.html. 
The wobleibtdieerderwaermung site writes (my emphasis):
An SSW will cause the polar circulation to become disrupted and possibly even split. This process in the stratosphere also causes the circulation in the troposphere over the entire northern hemisphere to be changed: The westerly drift over the north Atlantic gets interrupted by a blocking high pressure region and allows polar air to flow in over central and western Europe from the north and east.”

There is a large body of literature out there showing strong links between low solar activity, stratospheric warming and cold European winters.
The wobleibtdieerderwaermung site writes that both models of the ECMWF and NOAA/GFS agree that most likely there will be strong westward drift over the North Atlantic to Central Europe in late January 2016.

ECMWF prognosis for the Arctic polar circulation 150 hPa from 23 January to 31 January 2016. The polar circulation is strongly disrupted and is dipolar. The core of the larger southern circulation lies over northern Norway and shows a strong westerly flow that leads us to expect unsettled weather. Source: www.geo.fu-berlin.de/met/ag/strat.html.

GFS prognosis for the Arctic polar circulation 100 hPa (16,000 0m) from 24 January to 3 February 2016.  The polar circulation is strongly disrupted and is dipolar. The core of the larger, right circulation lies off northern Norway and shows a strong westerly flow that leads us to expect unsettled and stormy weather. Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/stratosphere/emcz.
The pattern, the German site writes, will deliver lots of snow at the higher elevations in Germany, especially in the Alps. Moreover a strong westerly drift is a good sign for a split of the jet stream. The site wobleibtdieerderwaermung writes that should the model prognoses come true, then the chances are good for the third cold snap of the 2015/16 winter in western and central Europe.
Naturally there’s a lot of speculation and uncertainty involved in forecasts beyond a week, sometime even those beyond just a few days. If one thing is certain, it is that Europe’s weather never fails to deliver surprises.

Now that the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations have concluded, a lot of people across the political spectrum are going to have insightful and intelligent things to say about the agreement. Their analyses may argue for opposing positions, but the public will be better off and more informed for having listened to any of them. On the other hand, some opponents of the deal will rely on baseless fearmongering.   
  
Fear of the unknown is a natural (and largely beneficial) human extinct. When people feel like they don’t understand how something works, they’re more likely to imagine that it does something horrible. This is why opponents of trade liberalization constantly exaggerate the secrecy of negotiations why they focus their rhetoric on things like transnational corporate agendas, loss of national sovereignty, or lower food safety—things that most people don’t understand very well but are afraid of.   
  
Most often, fantastic predictions about the consequences of free trade arguments are put forward by the Left. They have claimed that the TPP will kill dolphins, allow corporations to bypass government regulations, cause global warming, or force us all to eat GMOs. None of this is true, but anti-trade groups are making fairly persuasive arguments based on inaccurate and exaggerated claims.   
  
Anti-trade groups on the political right use similar methods. The easiest target for these groups has been apprehension among conservative voters over the intentions of President Obama, focusing on things like immigration and gun control. Conservative protectionists adopted the term “Obamatrade” to refer—interchangeably, in order to profit from confusion—to the TPP, trade promotion authority, and even the WTO. During the debate earlier this year over trade promotion authority, a number of politicians fell for the simplistic but inaccurate argument that TPA would enable Obama to secretly liberalize America’s immigration laws.



The most recent right-wing, anti-trade boogieman is the idea that the TPP will enable Obama to implement the Paris climate treaty without getting approval from Congress. Unfortunately, this theory has gained traction among respectable commentators. Most publicly, the _National Review_ ’s Kevin Williamson, an eloquent advocate for genuine free trade, cited the back door climate treaty theory as a reason free traders should oppose the TPP.   
  
Since it’s already doing real damage to the public debate over the TPP, let me explain the theory and why it’s wrong. The source of the theory appears to be an article at americanthinker.com that was predictably picked up by Breitbart.com. I’ve quoted the relevant parts below:   




It turns out that Senator Jeff Sessions was correct when he said that the treaty creates a new legislative body called the “Commission,” a term meant to invoke the European Commission, known for its recent decision to require that all the countries of the European Union take in Moslem [sic] refugees from the Middle East.   
  
. . .   
  
Chapter 20, the environmental chapter of the TPP, already requires compliance with previous multilateral environmental agreements that have been negotiated. So, the terms of the climate treaty will likely be incorporated into the TPP when the Commission first meets after the TPP passes. This is more or less specified in Article 20.4 which states:   






When President Obama finished negotiating the Iran Nuclear Deal, he went first to the UN Security Council, not to Congress, to get the deal approved. More or less the same thing could happen with the multilateral environmental agreement that Obama negotiates in Paris. It will be incorporated into the TPP, whether Congress agrees with its terms or not.



In summary, they’re claiming that the TPP creates a Commission that could amend the TPP at Obama’s urging to incorporate the climate agreement without Congressional approval, and so if Congress approves the TPP, it will open the door for Obama to unilaterally implement the climate treaty.   
  
The theory relies on flatly inaccurate readings of the TPP’s text to concoct a complex conspiracy where none exists.   
  
First, the “TPP Commission” is not a powerful legislative body that can alter the TPP agreement. It is just a name for a meeting of the members’ representatives. Chapter 27 of the TPP envisions the Commission meeting regularly to discuss certain topics. It is not and will never become a supranational government unaccountably changing U.S. laws.   
  
Second, U.S. obligations under the TPP cannot be amended without Congress’s approval. Chapter 30 of the agreement explains that any amendments must be “approved in accordance with the applicable legal procedures of each Party.” That means it must be **_ratified by Congress_**. The TPP doesn’t enter into force for the United States until it’s ratified by Congress, and amendments must follow the same procedures. The TPP is not a conspiracy to bypass the U.S. Constitution.   
  
Finally, Article 20.4 in the Environment Chapter does not require the United States to abide by any international environmental agreements. It merely states that each party “affirms” its commitments under such agreements. The provision is legally meaningless hortatory fluff. In fact, one of the biggest complaints about the TPP from environmental activists is that it does not do what this theory claims. The last four U.S. free trade agreements before the TPP did require parties to abide by their environment commitments under other treaties subject to dispute settlement. The TPP intentionally does not.   
  
The back door climate treaty theory may be well designed to scare conservatives who already distrust President Obama into opposing the TPP, but it is not supported by a well-reasoned argument.   
  
Needless to say, these sorts of exaggerations and conspiracy myths don’t help the debate. There are, in fact, plenty of things actually in the TPP that free market advocates should oppose, though they may not be sufficient reasons to oppose the whole package.   
  
How can you tell the difference between a reasonable complaint and a false one? For starters, keep reading the Cato blog! Cato scholars have been and will continue to highlight the positives and negatives of the TPP and free trade agreements generally.   
  
But also, everyone should be especially skeptical of complaints that build on existing narratives—like Obama’s executive overreach—that are unrelated to trade policy. These may be attempts to misdirect the debate away from relevant issues—like whether free trade is good—where popular opinion lines up with supporting the TPP.

"Most people say “I’m sorry” many times a day for a host of trivial affronts  —   accidentally bumping into someone or failing to hold open a door. These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, “No problem. ” But when “I’m sorry” are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship. I admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing, especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive. But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who, for whatever reason, is offended by something I said or did or failed to do, regardless of my intentions. I also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient. After learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed, I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility. Without offering any excuses, I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect. I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness, merely that I hoped we could have a civil, if not friendly, relationship going forward, then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam. Expecting nothing in return, I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done. My relief was palpable. I felt as if I’d not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend, which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed. About a week later I learned that, according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner, the wording of my apology was just what the “doctor” would have ordered. In the very first chapter of her new book, “Why Won’t You Apologize? ,” Dr. Lerner points out that apologies followed by rationalizations are “never satisfying” and can even be harmful. “When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology,” she wrote, it’s an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message. The best apologies are short and don’t include explanations that can undo them. Nor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology. The offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression. Forgiveness, should it come, may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated. “It’s not our place to tell anyone to forgive or not to forgive,” Dr. Lerner said in an interview. She disputes popular thinking that failing to forgive is bad for one’s health and can lead to a life mired in bitterness and hate. “There is no one path to healing,” she said. “There are many roads to letting go of corrosive emotions without forgiving, like therapy, meditation, medication, even swimming. ” Hardest of all, Dr. Lerner said, is to forgive a nonapologetic offender, like my aunt whom I had loved dearly and who served as my second mother after mine died. But when I, raised Jewish, married a Christian, she refused to come to the wedding and never apologized for the intense hurt her absence had caused. Although I made several attempts to restore the relationship, she always managed to deflect them, and to this day, more than half a century later, I cannot forgive her. The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the person’s reaction to it. Saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns “I’m sorry” into “I’m not really sorry at all,” the psychologist wrote. As to why many people find it hard to offer a sincere, unfettered apology, Dr. Lerner pointed out that “humans are   for defensiveness. It’s very difficult to take direct, unequivocal responsibility for our hurtful actions. It takes a great deal of maturity to put a relationship or another person before our need to be right. ” Offering an apology is an admission of guilt that admittedly leaves people vulnerable. There’s no guarantee as to how it will be received. It is the prerogative of the injured party to reject an apology, even when sincerely offered. The person may feel the offense was so enormous  —   for example, having been sexually abused by a parent  —   that it is impossible to accept a mea culpa offered by the abusive parent years later. Righting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members, who may be inclined to cite history  —   he was abused by his father, or she was raised by a distant mother  —   as an excuse for hurtful behavior. “History can be used as an explanation, not an excuse,” the psychologist said. “It should involve a conversation that allows the hurt party to express anger and pain if an apology, however sincere, is to heal a broken connection. ” As she wrote: “Nondefensive listening [to the hurt party] is at the heart of offering a sincere apology. ” She urges the listener not to “interrupt, argue, refute, or correct facts, or bring up your own criticisms and complaints. ” Even when the offended party is largely at fault, she suggests apologizing for one’s own part in the incident, however small it may be. Dr. Lerner views apology as “central to health, both physical and emotional. ‘I’m sorry’ are the two most healing words in the English language,” she said. “The courage to apologize wisely and well is not just a gift to the injured person, who can then feel soothed and released from obsessive recriminations, bitterness and corrosive anger. It’s also a gift to one’s own health, bestowing   integrity and maturity  —   an ability to take a cleareyed look at how our behavior affects others and to assume responsibility for acting at another person’s expense. ” Beverly Engel, the author of “The Power of Apology,” relates how her life was changed by a sincere, effective apology from her mother for years of emotional abuse. “Almost like magic,” she wrote, “apology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it  —   blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier. ”"

In [part one ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/society-is-screwed-up-part-one/)of this series, I dealt with the woke society. In this article, I will talk about the politically correct nonsense that has in fact, been around for some decades. Wokeness and political correctness have a certain similarity. They both invoke a climate where one is expected to follow certain rules with regard to the way we are supposed to view society and how we refer to people within society. 



Advocates of the process of political correctness argue that our perception of other people, is greatly influenced by the language we hear used about them. The use of strictly politically correct language, they argue, helps to prevent marginalisation and social exclusion of various identity groups as a result of the use of careless or malicious language against them. This means that people, in today’s society, are now under stress, as they are worried about opening their mouths for fear of saying the wrong thing.



We who oppose this nonsense, do so primarily on the basis of freedom of speech. History tells us that a high price was paid on at least two occasions for this God-given right. As the education curriculum now contains very little of this history, it may be that the Millennials and Gen Z don’t appreciate this to the extent that ‘OK Boomers’ do. In England, rather than students being taught about English history, they might learn about ideas, beliefs and attitudes of people in the past from various social, cultural, ethnic and religious perspectives.



There are numerous examples of PC speech being taken to ridiculous lengths. It was very much in vogue in England twenty years ago when Greater Manchester Police were handed a document entitled _[The Power of Language](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1356233/Police-officers-told-to-mind-their-language.html)_. Words not to be used included accident black spot, policeman, fireman, chairman, manning the phone, and cripple. Instead of cripple, they were told to say disabled, although they were warned that even the word disabled might offend some people. 



Today, even everyday words are fraught with danger. For example, using the word ‘marriage’ might offend people with a live-in partner. A woman complained to the BBC when she heard an announcer refer to a piece of music by Claude Debussy as “The Cakewalk”. Of course it’s “The [Golliwogs](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/calls-to-tar-and-feather-yet-another-tall-poppy/) Cakewalk”, but according to the BBC, in musical circles the shorter version was always used because it was quicker to say.



Then there’s the question of race and colour and religion to think about. If you’re white and Christian, you must be very careful before making a comment as more often than not, someone from one of those groups will be offended by it. (If it’s [anti-Semitism](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/australian-jews-sound-warning-on-leftist-anti-semitism/) though, that’s perfectly acceptable and anything goes). 



Those, who we have to stress over accidentally offending when commenting, appear to be [able to pass judgment](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/now-theyre-coming-for-the-white-women/) without having to worry about culpability. Why? Is it because they are always seen as victims in society? Why do they put up with it? Why do they countenance the verbal claptrap that the likes of Swarbrick and Marvelly spout? The ‘follow us because we know best’ brigade. Instead of helping people, they’re achieving exactly the opposite. They’re ensuring that people stay where they are, in their little societal box, devoid of hope and aspiration.



Political correctness has also affected Western police forces. A uniformed PC (Police Constable) cannot execute his duties as he used to due to political correctness in society. A clip round the ear or a whack on the backside is no longer tolerated. Today it is more than likely that the PC will end up in the dock rather than the young offender. And here’s a classic. The Council for Awards in Children’s Care has declared that pre-schoolers should never be told that they are naughty or silly or bad. You address them by saying “I don’t like the way you’re doing that.” Presumably, this applies whether the child is kicking the dog, destroying the furniture or setting fire to grandma. All of this happened in England as far back as twenty years ago.



Discipline as we ‘OK Boomers’ knew it has been tossed onto the politically correct scrap heap, and who can say society is better for it. Instead of worrying about offending all and sundry it might be better to consider reinstating some of the things that have been discarded in the name of the madness that is political correctness. We might then get back to the more egalitarian society that we ‘OK Boomers’ grew up in. It wasn’t perfect, but in my view, it was a damn sight better than what we’ve got now.



The politically correct brigade needs to start treating everyone as equal on all levels of society and do their best to incentivise people to achieve a better lifestyle and standard of living. It’s high time these humourless people got a life and cheered themselves and others up as well. As I said in my previous post, by just viewing Question Time you don’t have to know which side the Left are sitting on. One just has to look at the faces.



My next post will cover climate change.

=====================================
Last time I spoke to common sense, I was told that lights are devices used to shed light – when it’s dark outside. But apparently not any more – at least in one German town. It seems that street lamps there have become devices that are powered by sunlight in the daytime, but don’t work at night (when most people have difficulties seeing).

German ZDF public television recently had story about how this summer the town of Gescher in the Muensterland region of North Rhine Westphalia installed new solar powered street lamps for the handsome sum of 28,000 euros (roughly $32,000). The 5 lamps are supposed to illuminate a 1500-meter stretch of a bicycle/pedestrian path to make it safe for children on the way to a sports facility.
The don’t work at night when they’re supposed to!
But the ZDF reporter tells us there’s just one small problem with the solar powered streetlamps:

…the new designer lamps have one very decisive disadvantage: When it’s nighttime in Muensterland, the expensive lamps unfortunately remain dark.”
Residents are shaking their heads at the botched investment, calling the project “senseless”, “a waste” and “absurd”.
ZDF tells viewers that during the day the sun was supposed to charge up the street-lamps batteries which in turn would power the lamps at night. But that just doesn’t seem to function. The lamps remain mostly dark at night. One resident comments: “They should just install a sensible line with sensible lamps. But the city just doesn’t listen“.
Gescher burgermeister Thomas Kerkhoff doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about. He defends the installation of the lamps, telling ZDF television:
For the exterior area of our sports facility we wanted to offer our bicycle riders, citizens and children a safe path, and thus five lamps are better than no lamps.”
Better (even if they don’t function).
This is just one example of many of the absurdity that can occur when green madness sweeps over the collective intelligence.

"Beneath the lush forests of the Amazon is a whole different level of diversity that new research says may be one of the keys to understanding how to stem the global impacts of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest is known as one of Earth’s hotspots for diversity. It contains at least 40,000 plant species, 5,500 animal species and 100,000 insect species. These have been a great source for the discovery of new medicines, with at least 120 approved for use. Despite its great plant and animal diversity, it is one of the least understood ecosystems for its microbial diversity. There are 100 million microorganisms in a single gram of forest soil, making them the largest repository in the world of novel genes. These microbes are essential to nutrient recycling. They decompose dead organic matter, through a process called mineralisation, releasing mineral nutrients that plants absorb through their roots, allowing the forest to grow. As trees grow, they capture carbon dioxide from the air through the process of photosynthesis, and, in the Amazon, this process occurs at impressive levels. Owing to its size, the forest absorbs 1.5 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year – making it the largest terrestrial sink of this greenhouse gas.  Large amounts of nitrogen are needed to achieve the Amazon’s role as a carbon sink. In the rainforest, that comes primarily from the natural process of nitrogen fixation performed by microbes called diazotrophs. They break apart molecules of nitrogen that is essential for all living things. But, up until now, no one has looked at how the function of these microbes changes when a rainforest is converted to a pasture, something that is happening at an alarming rate in many parts of the Amazon. In work published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, we found a surprisingly large shift in microbial community composition when rainforests became pastures, confirming earlier studies. This may have major implication on how nutrients are cycled in the new ecosystem. Any changes to the nitrogen cycle are likely to affect the carbon cycle and the forest’s capacity to sequester carbon dioxide. The process of deforestation is causing an addition of 1.6 billion tons of CO2 to the atmosphere per year, substantially increasing greenhouse gases. While these findings reinforce the toll deforestation is having, they also offer some hope. Our examination revealed that approximately 50% of Amazon’s abandoned pastures are going through secondary forest formation. It is a process that happens mostly by chance, and when it happens diazotrophic communities tend to return to similar composition of the former forest. The results imply that there is still time to conserve the immense genetic diversity of microbes as sources of new antibiotics and absorbers of carbon dioxide. Also, using our results, we can start devising new methods to aid the recovery of disturbed ecosystems – imagine a cocktail of microbes added for ecosystem restoration.  If nothing else, our research makes one thing clear: in the Amazon, the invisible microbes do as much as the now-disappearing trees to help our environment."
"**WhatsApp is introducing a ""disappearing messages"" option that will erase chats from the phone of both the sender and recipient after seven days.**
The Facebook-owned app, which has two billion users worldwide, said the setting would help keep chats private.
But it said recipients would still be able to screenshot or forward any messages, photos or videos that they wanted to keep.
The option will appear for WhatsApp users by the end of November.
In a blog, the company said messages could be set to expire after seven days to offer ""peace of mind that conversations aren't permanent, while remaining practical so you don't forget what you were chatting about"".
In April 2019, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to make several changes to the social network to offer users more privacy.
One of his proposed changes was offering more ""ephemeral"" ways to share content, including disappearing messages.
The company also hopes to integrate its messaging platforms, making WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger interoperable.
Rival messaging app Snapchat, which has provided inspiration for a number of Facebook's features, was built on the principle of disappearing messages.
""Remarkable that this was so long in coming to WhatsApp, given that it launched Status (also a disappearing feature) back in 2017, that ephemeral is huge, and that this is Facebook we are talking about,"" said Ingrid Lunden, a journalist for Tech Crunch, on Twitter."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Tuesday nominated Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, elevating a conservative in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to succeed the late jurist and touching off a brutal, partisan showdown at the start of his presidency over the ideological bent of the nation’s highest court. Mr. Trump announced his selection during a   evening ceremony that unfolded in prime time at the White House. He described Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge based in Denver, as “a man who our country really needs, and needs badly, to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. ” “Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support,” Mr. Trump said, standing beside the judge and his wife, Louise, as White House officials and Republican lawmakers looked on. “It is an extraordinary résumé  —   as good as it gets. ” But Democrats  —   embittered by Republican refusals for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama’s choice to succeed Justice Scalia, and inflamed by Mr. Trump’s aggressive moves at the start of his tenure  —   promised a showdown over Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. Joined by liberal groups that plotted for weeks to fight Mr. Trump’s eventual nominee, leading Democrats signaled they would work to turn the Supreme Court dispute into a referendum on the president, and what they contend is his disregard for legal norms and the Constitution. Conservatives and business groups cheered Judge Gorsuch, calling his record distinguished and his qualifications unparalleled. The announcement came at a particularly tumultuous moment in an extraordinarily chaotic beginning to Mr. Trump’s presidency. Just a day earlier, he dismissed the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his   immigration order that started a furor across the United States over what critics condemned as a visa ban against Muslims. “Now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights and will stand up to a president who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,” Mr. Schumer said. He said he would insist that Judge Gorsuch meet the   threshold needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster for his confirmation to move forward. That would either require eight Democrats to join the Senate’s 52 Republicans to advance the nomination, or force Republicans to escalate a parliamentary showdown  —   as Mr. Trump has already urged them to do  —   to change longstanding rules and push through his nominee on a simple majority vote. Republicans and conservative groups signaled they relished a war over Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. “I hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an    vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four   nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. He noted that the Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch without opposition in 2006 to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Carrie Severino, the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that immediately started a $10 million campaign to defend Mr. Trump’s nominee, said the coalition would mount intensive campaigns in crucial states to “force vulnerable senators to choose between obstructing and keeping their Senate seats. ” If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would become the 113th justice and take a seat held not only by Justice Scalia, but also by Justice Robert H. Jackson, perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court. As an Episcopalian, Judge Gorsuch would be the only Protestant seated among five Catholics and three Jewish jurists. He would restore the    split between conservatives and liberals on the court, returning the swing vote to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose rulings have fallen on both sides of the political spectrum. At 49, Judge Gorsuch (pronounced  ) is the youngest nominee to the Supreme Court in 25 years, underscoring his potential to shape major decisions for decades to come. In choosing him, Mr. Trump reached for a reliably conservative figure in Justice Scalia’s mold, but not someone known to be divisive. Mr. Trump, who recognized Justice Scalia’s wife, Maureen, in the audience as he announced his choice, heaped praise on the “late, great” jurist, saying his “image and genius was in my mind throughout the   process. ” Judge Gorsuch said he was humbled by his “most solemn assignment. ” “I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country,” he said. He also praised Justice Scalia as “a lion of the law. ” The announcement reopened the bitter wounds that dominated the political battle last year over Mr. Obama’s nominee for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans refused to even consider  —   much less support  —   his nomination in the thick of a presidential campaign. A Colorado native who was in the same class at Harvard Law School as Mr. Obama, Judge Gorsuch is known for his   measured opinions that are normally, though not exclusively, conservative. He holds a doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar, and was a Supreme Court law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Kennedy. That Judge Gorsuch has a personal connection to Justice Kennedy is no accident. By choosing a familiar figure, several officials said, the White House is sending a reassuring signal to Justice Kennedy, 80, who has been mulling retirement. Choosing a more ideologically extreme candidate, the officials said, could have tempted Justice Kennedy to hang on to his seat for several more years, depriving Mr. Trump of another seat to fill. Still, Judge Gorsuch’s conservative credentials are not in doubt. He has voted in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, who invoked religious objections for refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to their female workers. And he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than the legislature to achieve policy goals. “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives,” he said on Tuesday. “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ” Judge Gorsuch is the son of Anne Gorsuch Burford, who became the first female head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, outside Washington, before going to Columbia University. There had been some speculation that Mr. Trump would choose someone with a less elite background for the court. The other finalist for the post, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and helped pay for his education by driving a taxi. The White House stoked suspense over Mr. Trump’s court choice in the hours before announcing it. A senior Trump administration official said both Judge Gorsuch and Judge Hardiman were summoned to Washington for the nomination ceremony. But only Judge Gorsuch appeared at the White House gathering shortly after 8 p. m. In an allusion to the intense foreshadowing he and his team did to encourage interest and speculation over the pick, Mr. Trump interrupted his own announcement to marvel at his showmanship: “So was that a surprise?” the president said after announcing Judge Gorsuch’s name. “Was it?” As he looked out into an audience that Democrats had refused to join  —   several senior lawmakers declined his invitation to attend the East Room ceremony  —   the president expressed hope that he could avoid a partisan battle. “I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once, for the good of the country,” Mr. Trump said. But progressive groups had already gathered at the steps of the Supreme Court to protest a nominee they predicted would be extreme. Nan Aron of the   Alliance for Justice called Judge Gorsuch “a disastrous choice,” adding that his record showed “no sign that he would offer an independent check on the dangerous impulses of this administration. ” Conservatives were as ardent in their support. Tom Fitton, the president of the   group Judicial Watch, called Mr. Trump’s nomination “a major step in the right direction in defining his presidency and moving the Supreme Court away from dangerous and destructive judicial activism. ”"

 _I found this open letter on Facebook. It is a fascinating read._



 **Greta Thunberg** :



You have declared yourself a leader and said that your generation will start a revolution. You have comported yourself as a credentialed adult and climate change activist who has fearlessly addressed politicians and world leaders. You have dropped out of school and declared that there isn’t any reason to attend, or any reason for you to study since there will be no future for you to inherit. You have, rather than attend your classes, been leading Friday Climate Strikes for all students in your generation across the globe. Your attendance at oil pipelines has been striking. There, you unequivocally declare that all oil needs to remain in the ground where it belongs.



I shall, therefore, against the backdrop of your activism, address you as an adult rather than as a child.



In September of 2019 you crossed the Atlantic in a “zero carbon” racing yacht that had no toilet and electric light on board. You made an impassioned plea at the United Nations in which you claimed that, “we have stolen your dreams and our childhood with our empty words.” You claimed that adults and world leaders come to young people for answers and explained in anger: “How dare you!” You claimed that we are failing you and that young people are beginning to understand our betrayal. You further declared that if we continue to fail your generation: “We will never forgive you.”



You have stated that you want us to panic, and to act as if our homes are on fire. You insist that rich countries must reduce to zero emissions immediately. In your speeches you attack economic growth and have stated that our current climate crisis is caused by “buying and building things.” You call for climate justice and equity, without addressing the worst polluter on the planet China; the country that is economically annexing much of Africa and Latin America. You dare not lecture Iran about its uranium projects — because that’s not part of the UN’s agenda, is it?



You proclaim that we need to live within the planetary boundaries, to focus on equity and “take a few steps back” for the sake of all living species. You resent the hierarchical distinctions between human and animals and entertain no qualitative distinction between a monkey, a malaria-infested mosquito and a snarling hyena. You mouth slogans such as: “We have set in motion an irreversible chain reaction beyond control,” and you advocate for universal veganism on the Ellen DeGeneres show. You do not buy new clothes, and you don’t want the rest of us to either. You want us all to stop flying in jet planes without giving us an alternative as to how we would re-transform our financial and trading systems—to say nothing of our personal enjoyment of the world—without regression to a primeval era. Few can afford to cross the Atlantic in a $6M zero carbon yacht financed by rich people who made their wealth by the very means you condemn as loathsome.



There are a few things that we, the rational adults of the world who are not bowing to you like guilt-ridden obsequious Babbitts need to say to you, Greta.



First, we did not rob you of your childhood or of your dreams. You are the legatee of a magnificent technological civilization which my generation and the one before it and several others preceding it all the way to the Industrial Revolution and the Renaissance, bequeathed to you. That growth-driven, capitalist technological civilization has created the conditions for you to harangue us over our betrayal. It is a civilization that eradicated diseases such as small pox from the word, and that lifted millions out of abject poverty in a universe you think is dying and decaying. It assured you a life expectancy that exceeded that of your ancestors. Most likely by focusing on economic growth which you demonize, and scientific advancement, that civilization will further enhance a robust quality of life and health for your descendants.



Here is a hard truth to ponder, Greta: if the great producers of this world whom you excoriate were to withdraw their productivity, wealth and talents—in short—their minds from the world today, your generation would simply perish. Why? Because as children you have done nothing as yet, with your lives besides being born. This is what we expect of children until such time as they can be producers by learning from their elders. You are understandably social and ecological ballast. You are not yet cognitively advanced to replicate the structures of survival of which you are the beneficiaries.



Children are important installments on the future. We have invested in you. It is you and your smug generation which think they have nothing to learn from the older ones who are failing themselves. Whom do you expect to employ the majority of you if you have neither the job credentials or life competency skills to navigate the world? The future unemployable-skipping- school-on-Friday obstreperous children?



The truth, as one anonymous blogger aptly put it, is that your generation is unable to work up to forty hours per week without being chronically depressed and anxious. Its members cannot even decide if they want to be a boy or a girl, or both, or neither, or a “they.” They cannot eat meat without crying. I might add that your generation needs “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as pre-conditions for learning in school. Its members have a pathological need to be coddled and protected from the challenging realities of life. Your generation is the biggest demander and consumer of carbon spewing technological gadgets and devices. An hour without any of them and too many of you succumb to paralyzing lethargy. Your generation is the least curious and most insular set of individuals one has ever encountered. Your hubris extends so far that you think you have nothing to learn from your elders.



Yes, we have betrayed you: by capitulating the world of leadership to bored, attention-deficit children who spout bromides, platitudes and slogans that a rudderless and morally relativistic culture accepts because a significant number of its denizens have become intellectually bankrupt and morally lazy.



The logical endpoint of your ecological vision would see us living in primeval conditions eking out an existence in jungle swamps in which we would regard poisonous snakes and man-eating tigers as our moral equals. We would have to adapt ourselves to nature rather than adapt nature to meet our needs, like all members of civilized civilizations do. Your vision would see us foraging for mushrooms and plants without knowing which were inimical to our digestive systems. Under your system we would swelter from heat, die from rampant plagues and starvation because there will be no air-conditioning units, no sophisticated plumbing and irrigations and sewer systems, no anti-bacterial soap made from animal matter, no pesticides and chemicals to sanitize our food and drinking supplies: just one primordial swamp of human putrefaction.



If civilization is left in the hands of your ecofascist supporters we will be living in grass huts, drinking animal feces infested water, and shrinking in fear from polar bears instead of killing them for food when they attack us.



Greta, living in complete harmony with nature is the death of creativity. Understand this. All great civilizations were forged in the crucibles of proper exploitation of the earth. Those who lived on land with oil and did nothing with it never had a right to it in the first place. Non-usage of God’s resources is the cardinal sin because it results in the un-development of our human capabilities, and makes us indistinguishable from beasts.



Your generation needs to be taught the morality of wealth creation, rather than only parasitically benefiting from it. The only revolution you will lead is one into nihilism and civilization regression. You need to learn about the moral case for fossil fuel. You owe it to yourself to understand how as, Kathleen Hartnett White has detailed, the harnessing of the vast store of concentrated energy in fossil fuels allowed mankind, for the first time in human history, to escape intractable constraints and energy limits that had left all but the very privileged in total poverty and depravity. Before the Industrial Revolution all societies were dependent on a very limited flow of solar energy captured in living plants for subsistence needs such as food, fuel and shelter.



But we, the creative enterprisers, will not go back to the Dark Ages. Your philosophy can be summed up as follows:



What was good for my anthropoid ancestors is good for me. Do not rock the boat, or even build one as that will require cutting down a tree. Do not disrupt nature. Do not dare to see the earth as rightfully belonging to us. We don’t have the right to use our brains in a manner that can transform our needs into a material form. Let’s conveniently forget that production is the application of reason to the problems of survival. Let’s all diminish the grandeur of man and his luminous potential. Crush the Thomas Edisons of this world.



The apocalyptic world vision you hold has been a strip landing for those who have hated progress throughout history. Your apocalyptic predictions have been made for millennia, and, we’re still here. We will still be here long after you’ve grown up and we have forgiven you for skipping classes, thereby lowering the intelligence quotient of an entire generation

Guest post by Jim Steele, director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University.
Based on NOAA’s 2014 Arctic Report Card, the past 2 decades of ice loss in Greenland has slowed dramatically in 2013-2014. In contrast to Velicogna’s (2014) previously published average mass loss of 280 +/-58 gigatons/year using GRACE satellite data, or the maximum loss of 570 gigatons in 2012-2013, there was only an insignificant loss of 6 gigatons from June 2013 to June 2014, or mere 1% of the previous year’s loss. A loss of 360 gigatons translates into a 1 millimeter rise in sea level, therefore the 2013-2014 sea level rise should be 1.3 mm less than the year before. And based on historical analyses, Greenland will likely begin gaining mass in the coming years.
In Vanishing Ice Most Likely All Natural (transcipt here) I argued that Greenland’s glaciers would soon stabilize and sea ice in the Barents Sea would soon recover based on trends in the transport of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic. Although a one-year recovery is much too short a period from which to derive reliable projections, it is exactly what natural climate dynamics predict.
Based on GRACE satellite gravity estimates (illustrated in the graph below on the left) and hydrographic measurements (graph on right), Greenland’s lost ice has correlated best with the pulses of warm Atlantic water that entered into the Irminger Current that flows to the west around Greenland, delivering relatively warm water to the base of Greenland’s marine terminating glaciers. (Temperatures of the Irminger warm pulse are represented by the numbers graph on the right.) Marked by the red arrow most of Greenland’s ice loss has happened in the southeast region, precisely where the brunt of warm subsurface waters entered the Irminger Current. Accordingly Kahn (2014) reported between 2003 -2006 that 50 % of the total ice loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet occurred in southeast Greenland, and thinning and calving of just 2 glaciers (marked HG) and (KG) accounted half of that loss. Thinning and calving are driven primarily by submarine melting. Although NOAA highlights Greenland’s surface melt rates, Rignot (2009) report that rates of iceberg discharge and rates of “submarine melting are two orders of magnitude larger than surface melt rates.” 

Researchers have measured the inflow of warm Atlantic waters along a line between Scotland and the Irminger Sea (A. below) and have determined how that water was partitioned between flows entering the Irminger Current and the flows entering the basins that feed the Barents Sea. Using satellite altimetry to measure changes in sea level, Chafik (2014) reported the flow of warm Atlantic waters into the Irminger Current had increased significantly between 1992-1998 (B. below), but over the past 18 years the volume of warm water has been declining. Accordingly researchers had reported that large glaciers, like the Jakobshavn with submarine grounding points, had been stable or advancing between the 1960s and early 1990s. Then coincident with the arrival of a warmer water via the Irminger Current, the glaciers abruptly began retreating. Since 1997 the loss of Greenland ice accelerated culminating in the widely trumpeted loss of 570 gigatons in 2012-2013, which was opportunistically portrayed as evidence of CO2 warming.

Because the inflow of warm water has been waning since the late 1990s, it suggested that accelerated loss of ice would soon wane as well. Based on the drop in sea level (B. above) the volume of intruding warm Atlantic water has decreased by 10%. If the previous pulse of warm water has been the driving force for retreating Greenland glaciers and melting Barents Sea ice, then that reduced inflow predicts Greenland’s glaciers should soon stabilize while Barents Sea ice begins to recover. Indeed 2014 also witnessed an increase in Barents Sea ice. Likewise NOAA’s 2014 Arctic Report card also stated the “coverage of multiyear ice in March 2014 increased to 31% of the ice cover from the previous year’s value of 22%.” Suggesting more ice is surviving the melt season. In addition the mean sea-ice thickness in multiyear ice zone along northwest Greenland has increased by 0.38 m.
But why did the loss of Greenland ice continue to accelerate after the initial 90s pulse of warm water intrusions? The warm intruding Atlantic water is saltier and denser and flows between 100 and 900 meters below the surface. The weight of the glaciers have depressed the continental shelf so it slopes towards the shore (similar to the condition illustrated below for Antarctica’s Amundsen Sea glaciers.). When pulses of warm water are strong enough to rise over the shelf’s outer ridge, that warm dense water then flows downward to the grounding point of the glacier and remains there until a new equilibrium is established via basal melting and a retreating grounding point. Increased basal melting also increases calving of the floating ice shelf and the loss of buttressing power that inhibits the glaciers’ seaward flow. The end result is the glaciers accelerate seaward, causing dynamic thinning, increased calving, and a large loss of ice mass that continues until a new equilibrium is established. The continued reduction of warm water inflows and the dramatic reduction of lost ice mass in 2014, now suggest the glaciers are no longer adjusting to the previous warm water intrusions.

Before the Little Ice Age (LIA), Greenland’s glaciers, like the Jakobshavn, were smaller than seen in the present day (Young 2011). During the Little Ice Age between ~1400 and 1850, glaciers grew to their maximum Holocene extent. That LIA advance correlates with 1) lower solar flux, 2) decreased inflows of warm Atlantic water, and 3) a more persistent negative North Atlantic Oscillation. Although topographical features of Greenland’s glaciers will cause each glacier to adjust in a unique manner, overall the recent decrease in solar flux approaching LIA levels, the current decline in warm water inflows, and the current trend to a more persistent negative North Atlantic Oscillation all suggest that Greenland will begin accumulating ice mass over the next decade.
In Ocean Gyre Circulation Changes Associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
Curry (2001) created a Transport Index illustrating the correlation between the pole-ward transport of warm tropical water and the North Atlantic Oscillation. As seen in their illustration, there was a rapid increase in the pole-ward transport during the 80s and 90s when the NAO was in an increasingly positive phase. In general agreement but supplemented by other atmospheric dynamics, Barrier (2014) suggest increased transport is due to the spin-up of the subtropical gyre during the persistent positive NAO and reduced transport follows a spin-down during persistent NAO- conditions.

 
So why didn’t Greenland’s glaciers begin retreating earlier during the 1980s and 90s? When the NAO is positive, both the sub-Tropical gyre (STG in the illustration below) and the sub-Polar gyre (SPG) speed up and expand. While the spin-up of the sub-Tropical gyre transports more tropical water pole-ward, in contrast the expanded sub-Polar gyre limits how much warm water will enter the Arctic seas. This quasi-blocking effect causes more warm water to be re-circulated equator-ward and stored in the sub-Tropical gyre. The amount of warm water entering the Irminger Current is particularly limited because the sub-Polar gyre also shunts the pole-ward transport to the east towards the Barents Sea. When the NAO first enters a negative phase the sub-Polar gyre contracts towards the west, allowing more warm water to enter the Irminger Sea.

Statistical studies have debated the correlation between retreating Arctic ice and the negative NAO because it generates a confounding short term warming trend that is contradicted by the longer cooling trend suggested for the LIA as well as observed during the 1960s and 70s. But that contradiction is easily explained by the effects of an expanding and contracting sub-Polar gyre (SPG). The initial contraction of the SPG during the early negative NAO allows more warm water to enter the Arctic. However the negative NAO also implies a spin-down of the subtropical gyre and therefore a drop in the pole-ward transport of warm tropical waters. Thus as the negative NAO persists, the initial warm pulse into the Arctic is exhausted and followed by cooling trend decades later. A similar scenario was reported by Bengtsson (2004) in The Early Twentieth-Century Warming in the Arctic—A Possible Mechanism to explain the rapid 1930s and 40s warming of the Arctic and retreat of Greenland glaciers that persisted into the early phase of the negative NAO. With all things considered, the evidence strongly suggests we will soon witness a similar natural cycle and a rebound in the Greenland’s ice.

"The broadcaster Chris Packham has lost his case against HS2 in the court of appeal. Environmentalists say the high-speed rail project is leading to irreversible destruction of ancient habitats and woodlands.  Packham said the case for HS2 should be revisited despite Friday’s ruling against him. The judgment refused permission on two grounds for a judicial review into the cabinet’s decision to give the multibillion pound project the “green signal” in February. Packham believes the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on public finances and the need for a green recovery has undone the business and environmental case for HS2. “Obviously we are deeply disappointed by today’s ruling. But the fact is, we are a world away from the place we were when we issued the original claim for judicial review,” he said.  “Covid-19 has turned the state of the UK finances and the public’s attitudes towards climate change upside down. People now see that a scheme for a railway which will tear up the countryside so that we can shave a few minutes off a journey time makes no sense in the contemporary workplace.” In the 51-page judgment, three lord justices of appeal refused Packham’s appeal against his earlier refusal of a judicial review. The first of Packham’s two grounds of appeal concerned the question of whether the cabinet was correctly advised on the existence and extent of environmental information before it when considering the report of the Oakervee review.  The second was that the government failed to take account of the effect of the project on greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature rise between now and 2050, in the light of its obligations under the Paris agreement and the Climate Change Act 2008. On the first ground, the judges ruled that the environmental impacts of HS2 had been assessed in detail through the parliamentary process and the cabinet’s decision-making could not have been made without proper regard to those conclusions. On the second, the court held that because the decision arising out of the Oakervee review was not subject to any form of statutory scheme, the government was at liberty to select the issues on which it was advised by the review and that it was not constrained by the act or by any policy of its own. The court held that it can be taken that the government was fully aware of its commitments under the Paris agreement and responsibilities under the act and to have taken those commitments and responsibilities into account. Packham’s solicitor, Carol Day of Leigh Day solicitors, said: “This is a very disappointing judgment. Most people would assume that when the government makes a commitment to tackle climate change under international and domestic law, that commitment will be both fully understood and fully considered in all of its decision-making.  “However, today’s judgment suggests a less demanding approach can be lawful. Our client believes this is wrong and is pursuing the possibility of an appeal.” A spokesperson for HS2 Ltd said: “From the outset HS2 Ltd has taken our commitment to the environment extremely seriously. The act of parliament gives us the legitimacy to carry out work to build the railway, and licenses from Natural England and approvals from the Environment Agency ensure that we have the right safeguarding in place to protect wildlife and other natural assets. “All leading environment organisations agree that climate change is the biggest future threat to wildlife and habitats in the UK. By providing a cleaner, greener way to travel, HS2 will help cut the number of cars and lorries on our roads, cut demand for domestic flights, and help get Britain to net zero carbon emissions.  “Today is a good day for the long term future of Britain’s natural environment.”"
"**Several countries around the world are considering regulating social media - but what might that look like?**
A new report has put forward a tranche of ideas that its authors say could end the ""informational chaos that poses a vital threat to democracies"".
One of its suggestions is that social networks should be required to release details of their algorithms and core functions to trusted researchers, in order for the technology to be vetted.
It also suggests adding ""friction"" to online sharing, to prevent the rampant spread of disinformation.
The report was published by the Forum for Information and Democracy, which was established to make non-binding recommendations to 38 countries. They include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, South Korea and the UK.
Among those contributing to the report were Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, and former Facebook investor Roger McNamee - a long-time critic of the social network.
Free expression group Article 19 and digital rights groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation were also consulted.
One of the core recommendations is the creation of a ""statutory building code"", which describes mandatory safety and quality requirements for digital platforms.
""If I were to produce a kitchen appliance, I have to do more safety testing and go through more compliance procedures to create a toaster than to create Facebook,"" Mr Wylie told the BBC.
He said social networks should be required to weigh up all the potential harms that could be caused by their design and engineering decisions.
The report also suggests social networks should display a correction to every single person who was exposed to misinformation, if independent fact-checkers identify a story as false.
Other suggestions include:
It also included some proposals that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube already do voluntarily, such as:
The three businesses were sent a copy of the report on Wednesday and the BBC invited them to comment.
Twitter's head of public policy strategy, Nick Pickles, said: ""Twitter is committed to building a safer internet and improving the health of the public conversation. We support a forward-looking approach to regulation that protects the Open Internet, freedom of expression and fair competition in the internet sector.
""Openness and transparency is central to Twitter's approach, as embodied by our public API, our information operations archive, our commitment to user choice, our decision to ban political advertising and label content to provide more context and information, and our disclosures in the Twitter Transparency Report.
""However, technology companies are not all the same, and nor is technology the only part of the media ecosystem. It is essential to ensure a whole of society response to tackle these important issues.""
In an interview with BBC News, Mr Wylie said the report's recommendations had been designed to protect individuals' free expression.
The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.
**Whenever social media regulation is proposed, there are concerns about stifling free speech. Don't your proposals pose such a risk?**
In most Western democracies, you do have the freedom of speech. But freedom of speech is not an entitlement to reach. You are free to say what you want, within the confines of hate speech, libel law and so on. But you are not entitled to have your voice artificially amplified by technology.
These platforms are not neutral environments. Algorithms make decisions about what people see or do not see. Nothing in this report restricts your ability to say what you want. What we're talking about is the platform's function of artificially amplifying false and manipulative information on a wide scale.
**Who defines what counts as misinformation?**
I guess this gets down to something fairly fundamental: do you believe in truth? There are some objectively disprovable things spreading quite rapidly on Facebook right now. For example, that Covid does not exist and that the vaccine is actually to control the minds of people. These are all things that are manifestly untrue, and you can prove that.
Our democratic institutions and public discourse are underpinned by an assumption that we can at least agree on things that are true. Our debates may be about how we respond or what values we apply to a particular problem, but we at least have a common understanding that there are certain things that are manifestly true.
**Would regulation stifle the free flow of ideas and people's right to believe whatever they wanted?**
If we took the premise that people should have a lawful right to be manipulated and deceived, we wouldn't have rules on fraud or undue influence. There are very tangible harms that come from manipulating people. In the United States, the public health response to Covid-19 has been inhibited by widespread disinformation about the existence of the virus or false claims about different kinds of treatment that do not work.
Do you have a right to believe what you want? Yes, of course. No-one that I know of is proposing any kind of sort of mind or mental regulation.
But we have to focus on the responsibility of a platform. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube create algorithms that promote and highlight information. That is an active engineering decision.
When the result is an inhibited public health response to a pandemic or the undermining of confidence in our democratic institutions, because people are being manipulated with objectively false information, there has to be some kind of accountability for platforms.
**But Facebook says it does work hard to tackle misinformation and doesn't profit from hate speech.**
An oil company would say: ""We do not profit from pollution."" Pollution is a by-product - and a harmful by-product. Regardless of whether Facebook profits from hate or not, it is a harmful by-product of the current design and there are social harms that come from this business model.
**Before the US election, Facebook and Twitter laid out what they would do if a candidate declared victory early or disputed the result. We have seen both apply context labels to President Donald Trump's tweets. Do you think they were more prepared for the 2020 election?**
It is clear that Facebook really hasn't done enough planning.
Look at the groups that are bubbling up every single day that are spreading disinformation about ""cheating"" in the US election and promoting all kinds of other conspiracy theories about the Biden campaign. This was a foreseeable outcome.
The way Facebook approaches these problems is: we'll wait and see and figure out a problem when it emerges. Every other industry has to have minimum safety standards and consider the risks that could be posed to people, through risk mitigation and prevention.
**If you regulated the big social networks, would it push more people on to fringe ""free speech"" social networks?**
If you have a platform that has the unique selling point of ""we will allow you to promote hate speech, we will allow you to deceive and manipulate people"", I do not think that business model should be allowed in its current form. Platforms that monetise user engagement have a duty to their users to make at least a minimum effort to prevent clearly identified harms. I think it's ridiculous that there's more safety consideration for creating a toaster in someone's kitchen, than for platforms that have had such a manifest impact on our public health response and democratic institutions.
**What about other issues such as the way ""perfect"" images on Instagram can affect mental health and body image?**
This is a product of a platform that is making recommendations to you. These algorithms work by picking up what you engage with and then they show you more and more of that.
In the report, we talk about a ""cooling-off period"". You could require algorithms to have a trigger that results in a cooling-off period for a certain type of content.
If it has just spent the past week showing you body-building ads, it could then hold off for the next two weeks. If you want to promote body building, you can.
But from the user's perspective, they should not be constantly bombarded with a singular theme."
"**A beauty therapist who helps cancer patients has been banned from posting pictures of her work on Facebook ads.**
Vicky Morgan, from Wadebridge in Cornwall, is trained to draw tattoos for women and men who have lost their breasts through a mastectomy.
But Facebook has censored her adverts, saying pictures of nipples, or areola, were ""sexual content and nudity"".
Ms Morgan said it was ""disappointing and frustrating when I'm reaching out to amazing breast cancer survivors"".
After working as a beauty therapist for 18 years, she has diversified into tattoo treatment for cancer patients who have had their breasts removed.
Her work would involve tattooing areola on a woman's reconstructed breasts if they have had surgery or, in the case of women without reconstructed breasts and men, on to flat skin.
Pictures of her new line of work on artificial reconstructed breasts have been uploaded on her Facebook page without any problems.
But when she tried to promote pictures of her work with paid-for ads, they were rejected.
Ms Morgan said: ""I understand the need for them to be strict when it comes to adverts which may cause offence but feel there should be provisions in place when it comes to posts made to help people by offering services that are in the paramedical field, like mine.
""This is for breast cancer survivors who may need my services to help them claim back their confidence and make them feel like themselves again post-mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery.""
A Facebook spokesperson said the site allowed images of post-mastectomy areola tattoos on a page or profile but not within advertising.
""We do not allow people to run ads which include adult content, including nudity or implied nudity, because ads are governed by a stricter set of policies,"" they said.
""We recognise the important work Vicky is doing and hope she continues to use the platform to promote this."""
"NAIROBI, Kenya  —   It started out in Washington. Then it went to Jakarta. Then across Africa. One version even showed up on Facebook. Within hours, a State Department dissent cable, asserting that President Trump’s executive order to temporarily bar citizens from seven   countries would not make the nation safer, traveled like a chain letter  —   or a viral video. The cable wended its way through dozens of American embassies around the world, quickly emerging as one of the broadest protests by American officials against their president’s policies. And it is not over yet. By 4 p. m. on Tuesday, the letter had attracted around 1, 000 signatures, State Department officials said, far more than any dissent cable in recent years. It was being delivered to management, and department officials said more diplomats wanted to add their names to it. The State Department has 7, 600 Foreign Service officers and 11, 000 civil servants. The letter had been evolving since this weekend, when the first draft emerged. It was edited as it moved along, with some diplomats adding words and others striking out passages. For example, one diplomat suggested this sentence should simply end on “lasting shame”: “The decision to restrict the freedom of   in the United States and foreign nationals who wanted to travel to or settle in the United States during the 1940s has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country. ” Some officials who were trying to sign the document on Tuesday said it was not clear who was in charge or who was collecting signatures. The letter was passed through official State Department email accounts and on government time  —   several diplomats said union rules allowed them to work on dissent memos on the clock. “Policy dissent is in our culture,” said one diplomat in Africa, who did not want to speak publicly before the letter was released. “We even have awards for it. ” The letter, which harshly took apart the executive order, said the visa ban would “alienate allies” and “hurt America economically. ” Foreign travelers inject nearly $250 billion into the American economy, the letter said, supporting more than one million jobs. Some diplomats said they joined the dissent by sending an email saying “I’m in” or “Please add my name as a signer” along with their full name, title, position and post. The letter was apparently circulated through informal networks of diplomats and not through any State   email list. One diplomat on vacation in the United States said he received the letter from a colleague in another part of the world who was not connected to the drafters and was simply passing it along. The diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could, but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from, he was not sure how many would actually sign it. Most people in the State Department have never seen anything like this, the diplomat said. He said dissent memos were reserved for major policy issues, not for little grumbles like bad food in the embassy cafeteria. That diplomat also requested anonymity, saying that Foreign Service officers were not supposed to criticize American policy publicly and that he did not want to open himself up to accusations that he had violated the rules. That could threaten his job, he said, especially in such a polarized environment. This is exactly what the dissent channel, as it is called, was intended for. Starting in 1971 during the Vietnam War, the channel encourages department officials to voice their criticisms internally through a process of sending a memo or a cable to the secretary of state expressing their concerns and suggesting solutions. The final part of the visa ban memo lays out detailed alternatives, including increased vetting for specific nationalities. State Department rules are supposed to protect dissenters from being retaliated against, and last year several dozen diplomats signed a dissent memo criticizing American policy on Syria. But however officially tolerated, several veteran diplomats said dissent was still risky. When it comes to ambassadorships, the selection process is highly competitive  —   and highly subjective  —   and the diplomats said it would be impossible to prove why someone had been blocked from a coveted post. Previous dissent could easily be used against the person. Some State Department officials said on Tuesday that they would not sign the letter because of those risks. While one said he disagreed with the visa ban, he considered it his job to enforce American government policies whether or not he agreed with them. Other diplomats said the letter did not mean that dissenters would disobey the visa ban. The intent was to try to change the policy so the ban would be lifted, they said. The diplomat who said he would not use a dissent memo to complain about cafeteria food said that he had been torn when the United States invaded Iraq because he was strongly against the war, but that he did not know how to express his concern. He said he was just starting out at the time. The visa ban, he said, “was such obviously bad policy” that he was trying to find a way to sign the dissent letter. He also said that many diplomats were using the letter as a vehicle to express broader concerns about the way the Trump administration has appeared to sideline the State Department. The diplomat spoke in defense of refugees, saying that the tiny percentage from, say, Somalia who had been approved for resettlement in the United States had been scrutinized by several agencies and were among the most vulnerable of very vulnerable people. Now, many are stuck in limbo in transit centers. The diplomat also criticized Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who said on Monday that State Department officials who did not agree with Mr. Trump’s agenda “should either get with the program or they can go. ” He called that “bullying at the highest levels. ”"

My name is Andrew Grossman. I am an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute and a litigator in the Washington, D.C., office of Baker & Hostetler LLP. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing those of the Cato Institute, my law firm, or its clients. 



What an agency lacks in statutory authority, it can often make up for with chicanery, urgency, and force. That is the basis of EPA’s “Clean Power Plan” regulations for power plants’ greenhouse‐​gas emissions. The chicanery here is a “sue and settle” legal settlement that the agency struck with its allies committing it to proceed with regulation and providing artificial urgency to do so. That artificial urgency, in turn, was key to push the regulations out the door, rush an incredibly complex and expensive rule through standard regulatory review processes, steamroll any potential political opposition, and put pressure on the states to begin compliance activities immediately. And that is how the agency has used force—requiring states to achieve massive emissions reductions at a breakneck pace—to coerce the states and utilities into action during the proposal stage, with the apparent intention to irreversibly alter investment and retirement decisions before any court has the opportunity to pass on the lawfulness of its actions.



This is not how the regulatory process is supposed to work in a country founded on the principles of the rule of law and federalism. It also raises serious concerns regarding the horizontal separation of powers. Congress, after all, is supposed to be the one making decisions of deep economic and political significance.



The focus of this hearing is the “sue and settle” phenomenon, which got this whole regulatory proceeding underway and continues to support the agency’s drive. “Sue and settle” raises serious concerns about the conduct and resolution of litigation that seeks to set agency regulatory priorities and (in some instances) actually influences the content of those regulations. Since the House Judiciary Committee first directed its attention to the problem of collusive settlements in 2012,1 there have been a myriad of hearings and reports focusing on this problem, as well as the introduction of legislation to constructively address it. This is heartening. But the response from some in government and from the outside groups that pursue settlements has not been to debate the merits or discuss solutions, but simply to assert that there is no problem and that litigation brought for the very purpose of setting agency priorities has no real impact. That is not so. Recent examples show that the problem is real, it is serious, and it is, if anything, getting worse. Based on precedent and the incentives faced by agencies in the waning months of a presidency, there is a real risk over the next year and a half that the current administration may attempt to employ collusive settlements and consent decrees to bind its successor. Continued oversight by this subcommittee and those with jurisdiction over the relevant agencies will be crucial in the months ahead.



Congress and legal experts have given considerable thought on how to alter the incentives and the legal environment that facilitate collusive settlements. Over the past three years, Members of the House and Senate have developed several bills that seek to carry out the principles identified in my 2012 testimony on abuses of settlements and consent decrees. The most comprehensive of those bills, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, passed the House in the previous Congress, and (as reintroduced this Congress) has drawn strong support in the Senate. Although there is little prospect that any substantial regulatory reforms will become law in this Congress—why would the President sign a bill abolishing a technique that has proven so useful to his administration?—now is the time to lay the intellectual and political groundwork for an aggressive first‐​one‐​hundred‐​days regulatory reform agenda for the next administration.



 **I.** **An Overview of “Sue and Settle”**



Typically, the federal government vigorously defends itself against lawsuits challenging its actions. But not always. Sometimes regulators are only too happy to face collusive lawsuits by friendly “foes” aimed at compelling government action that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to achieve. In a number of cases brought by activist groups, the Obama Administration has chosen instead to enter into settlements that commit it to taking action, often promulgating new regulations, on a set schedule. While the “sue and settle” phenomenon is not new, dating back to the broad “public interest” legislation of the 1960s and 1970s, what is new is the frequency with which generally applicable regulations, particularly in the environmental sphere, are being promulgated according to judicially enforceable consent decrees struck in settlement. The EPA alone entered into more than sixty such settlements between 2009 and 2012, committing it to publish more than one hundred new regulations, at a cost to the economy of tens of billions of dollars.2



In the abstract, settlements serve a useful, beneficial purpose by allowing parties to settle claims without the expense and burden of litigation. But litigation seeking to compel the government to undertake future action is not the usual case, and the federal government is not the usual litigant. Consent decrees and settlements that bind the federal government present special challenges that do not arise in private litigation. This happens in all manner of litigation, and is not confined to a particular subject matter. Settlements binding federal actors have been considered in cases concerning environmental policy, civil rights, federal mortgage subsidies, national security, and many others. Basically, settlements may become an issue in any area of the law where federal policymaking is routinely driven by litigation.



But they are especially prevalent in environmental law, due to the breadth of the governing statutes, their provisions authorizing citizen suits, and the great number of duties those statutes arguably impose on the relevant agencies.



 **II.** **Implications for Democratic Governance and Accountability**



Judge Frank Easterbrook provides a compelling account of the ways that government officials may use consent decrees to obtain advantage—over Congress, over successors, over other Executive Branch officials—in achieving their policy goals:



The separation of powers inside a government—and each official’s concern that he may be replaced by someone with a different agenda—creates incentives to use the judicial process to obtain an advantage. The consent decree is an important element in the strategy. Officials of an environmental agency who believe that the regulations they inherited from their predecessors are too stringent may quickly settle a case brought by industry (as officials who think the regulations are not stringent enough may settle a case brought by a conservation group). A settlement under which the agency promulgated new regulations would last only for the duration of the incumbent official; a successor with a different view could promulgate a new regulation. Both parties to the litigation therefore may want a judicial decree that ties the hands of the successor. It is impossible for an agency to promulgate a regulation containing a clause such as “My successor cannot amend this regulation.” But if the clause appears in a consent decree, perhaps the administrator gets his wish to dictate the policies of his successor. Similarly, officials of the executive branch may obtain leverage over the legislature. If prison officials believe their budget is too small, they may consent to a judgment that requires larger prisons, and then take the judgment to the legislature to obtain the funds.3



The abuse of consent decrees in regulation raises a number of practical problems that reduce the quality of policymaking actions and undermine representative government. In general, public policy should be made in public, through the normal mechanisms of legislating and administrative law and subject to the give‐​and‐​take of politics. When, for reasons of convenience or advantage, public officials attempt to make policy in private sessions between government officials and (as is often the case) activist groups’ attorneys, it is the public interest that suffers. Experience demonstrates at least five specific consequences that arise when the federal government regulates pursuant to a consent decree or settlement:



In some instances, aggressive deadlines contained within settlements, as was the case with EPA’s Mercury Rule, may provide the agency with a practical excuse (albeit not a legal excuse) to play fast and loose with the Administrative Procedure Act and other procedural requirements, reducing the opportunity for public participation in rulemaking and, substantively, likely resulting in lower‐​quality regulation. Although a settlement deadline does not excuse an agency’s failure to observe procedural regularities, courts are typically deferential in reviewing regulatory actions and are reluctant to vacate rules tainted by procedural irregularity in all but the most egregious cases, where agency misconduct and party prejudice are manifest. In practical terms, members of the public and regulated entities whose procedural rights are compromised by overly aggressive settlement schedules can rarely achieve proper redress.



 **III.** **The High Costs of Sue and Settle: Recent Examples**



By design, sue and settle facilitates expensive, burdensome rules. First, as described above, it allows agency officials to evade political accountability for their actions by genuflecting to a judicially enforceable consent decree that mandates their action. As a result, officials face less pressure to moderate their approaches to regulation or to consider less burdensome alternatives. This, in turn, presents the risk of collusion and still more‐​burdensome rules that would be politically untenable but for a consent decree. Second, due to skirting of the notice‐​and‐​comment procedure, officials may not even be aware of alternatives. Third, even when alternatives do present themselves, officials may lack the time to analyze and consider them—assuming, of course, that alternative approaches are not barred altogether by one or another provision of the consent decree. In sum, it may be expected that the rules resulting from consentdecree settlements will be, on the whole, less efficient, more burdensome, and more expensive than those adopted through the normal rulemaking process.



This has been borne out in recent practice:



Relying in part on the settlement agreement, EPA’s proposal included an aggressive timetable for implementation that requires states to begin major preparations now and is already affecting planning and investment decisions in the energy sector.14 According to reports, EPA’s final rule mirrors its proposal, with no legally material changes. Even so, it will take months—possibly as long as two years from the release of the initial proposal—for the courts to even preliminarily review EPA’s very questionable exertion of authority. In the meanwhile, states and utilities are being forced to make decisions regarding plant upgrades and retirements, the construction of new capacity as required by the regulation, new transmission capacity, and state legal authority. One might have expected these kinds of issues to be aired and addressed during the regulatory review process, but it was extremely abbreviated compared to that for rules of similar complexity and importance— another likely consequence of the settlement agreement’s false urgency.



In short, whether or not EPA is ultimately found to have authority to regulate existing power plants—a challenge to any final rule is inevitable—the agency will have used the settlement agreement to achieve much of what it sought to do: force the retirement of coal‐​fired generation.15



Some would wave away these examples—as well as those in my 2012 testimony and 2014 Heritage Foundation monograph23—as saying little about the impact of settlement agreements. On the facts, that is a difficult position to maintain. Each of these examples illustrates how settlements can affect agency priorities and, in certain instances, the substance of their decisions. Even a recent Government Accountability Office report that claimed, based on comments by EPA staff, that settlements have only a “limited” impact on EPA rulemaking recognized that they do “affect the timing and order in which rules are issued”—in other words, the agency’s priorities.24 With statutes as capacious as the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act, agency priorities determine the regulatory agenda. 



Agency priorities are particularly important now, in the waning days of the Obama presidency. This administration has been aggressive in the pursuit of its policy goals through non‐​legislative means, upsetting settled understandings regarding executive power and statutory constructions to implement policies that it has been unable to convince Congress to enact.25 The agency officials responsible for carrying out this agenda have every incentive to attempt to force it on their successors through the use of settlements and consent decrees. There is precedent: in its final months, the Carter Administration entered into settlements that served to tie the hands of Reagan Administration officials on major policy question, including construction of public works, issuance of environmental regulations targeting particular industries, and education funding, among others.26 Vigorous oversight is necessary to ensure that the next administration, which may have very different priorities than this one, is not stymied in its ability to exercise its policy discretion and is not bound by its predecessor’s unwise policy choices.



 **IV. Opportunities for Reform**



Congress can and should adopt certain common‐​sense policies that provide for transparency and accountability in settlements and consent decrees that compel future government action. Any legislation that is intended to address this problem in a comprehensive fashion should include the following features, with respect to settlements that commit the government to undertake future action that affects the rights of third parties:



These principles are reflected in the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, H.R. 712 and S. 378. That bill represents a leap forward in transparency, requiring agencies to publish proposed settlements before they are filed with a court and to accept and respond to comments on proposed settlements. It also requires agencies to submit annual reports to Congress identifying any settlements that they have entered into. The bill loosens the standard for intervention, so that parties opposed to a “failure to act” lawsuit may intervene in the litigation and participate in any settlement negotiations. Most substantially, it requires the court, before approving a proposed consent decree or settlement, to find that any deadlines contained in it allow for the agency to carry out standard rulemaking procedures. In this way, the federal government could continue to benefit from the appropriate use of settlements and consent decrees to avoid unnecessary litigation, while ensuring that the public interest in transparency and sound rulemaking is not compromised.



Other proposed legislation focuses on settlements under specific statutory regimes. For example, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Settlement Reform Act31 would amend the ESA to provide, in cases seeking to compel the Fish and Wildlife Service to make listing determinations regarding particular species, many of the procedural reforms contained in the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, such as broadening intervention rights to include affected parties and allowing them to participate in settlement discussions. In addition, as particularly relevant in this kind of litigation, the bill would require that notice of any settlement be given to each state and county in which a species subject to the settlement is believed to exist and gives those jurisdictions a say in the approval of the settlement. In effect, this proposal would return discretion for the sequencing and pace of listing determinations under the ESA to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which would once again be accountable to Congress for its performance under the ESA.



Similarly, the Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013,32 which was introduced in the last Congress and passed the House, would have amended the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to remove a nondiscretionary duty that EPA review and, if necessary, revise all current regulations every three years and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act to remove a 1983 listing deadline that has never been fully satisfied.33 The effect of these amendments would have been to reduce the opportunity for citizen suits seeking to set agency priorities under these obsolete provisions.



These bills suggest that, rather than proceeding in a piecemeal fashion, Congress may wish to consider a more comprehensive approach that limits the ability of third parties to compel Executive Branch action. Suing to compel an agency to act on a permit application or the like is different in kind from seeking to compel it to issue generally applicable regulations or take action against third parties. As Justice Anthony Kennedy has observed, “Difficult and fundamental questions are raised” by citizen‐​suit provisions that give private litigants control over actions and decisions (including the setting of agency priorities) “committed to the Executive by Article II of the Constitution of the United States.”34 Constitutional concerns aside, at the very least, the ability to compel agency action through litigation and settlements gives rise to the policy concerns identified above, suborning the public interest to special interests and sacrificing accountability.



The sue‐​and‐​settle phenomenon is facilitated by the combination of broad citizen‐​suit provisions with unrealistic statutory deadlines that private parties may seek enforced through citizen suits. According to William Yeatman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, “98 percent of EPA regulations (196 out of 200) pursuant to [Clean Air Act] programs were promulgated late, by an average of 2,072 days after their respective statutorily defined deadlines.”35 Furthermore, “65 percent of the EPA’s statutorily defined responsibilities (212 of 322 possible) are past due by an average of 2,147 days.”36 With so many agency responsibilities past due, citizen‐​suit authority allows specialinterest groups (whether or not in collusion or philosophical agreement with the agency) to use the courts to set agency priorities. Not everything can be a priority, and by assigning so many actions unrealistic and unachievable nondiscretionary deadlines, Congress has inserted the courts into the process of setting agency priorities, but without providing them any standard or guidance on how to do so. It should be little surprise, then, that the most active repeat players in the regulatory process—the agency and environmentalist groups—have learned how to manipulate this situation to advance their own agendas and to avoid, as much as possible, accountability for the consequences of so doing.



Two potential solutions suggest themselves. First, a deadline that Congress does not expect an agency to meet is one that ought not to be on the books. If Congress wants to set priorities, it should do so credibly and hold agencies to those duties through oversight, appropriations, and its other powers. In areas where Congress has no clear preference as to timing, it should leave the matter to the agencies and then hold them accountable for their decisions and performance. What Congress should not do is empower private parties and agencies to manipulate the litigation process to set priorities that may not reflect the public interest while avoiding the political consequences of those actions. To that end, Congress should seriously consider abolishing all mandatory deadlines that are obsolete and all recurring deadlines that agencies regularly fail to observe.37



Second, Congress should consider narrowing citizen‐​suit provisions to exclude “failure to act” claims that seek to compel the agency to consider generally applicable regulations or to take actions against third parties. As a matter of principle, these kinds of decisions regarding agency priorities should be set by government actors who are accountable for their actions, not by litigants and not through abusive litigation.



 **V. Conclusion**



Settlements that govern the federal government’s future actions raise serious constitutional and policy questions and are too often abused to circumvent normal political process and evade democratic accountability. Congress can and should address this problem to ensure that such consent decrees are employed only in circumstances where they advance the public interest, as determined by our public institutions, not special interests.



I thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify on these important issues.

State Sen. Eddie Lucio, D‐​Brownsville, and Reps. Byron Cook, R‐​Corsicana, and Gilbert Peña, R‐​Pasadena, have all proposed bills to create a guest worker program for Texas.



A Texas‐​based visa would allow the state to regulate migrant workers according to its own needs and cut out the feds. Regulators in D.C. don’t know what’s best for Texas.



Unemployment in Texas has been below the national average for eight straight years. Texas has created 413,000 jobs in the last 12 months — impressive for a state of only 26 million people. Low taxes and few regulations have allowed the Texas economy to flourish.



The Mercatus Center at George Mason University ranks Texas first in labor market freedom, while _Forbes_ praised Texas for its economic climate and growth prospects.





It’s time that Texas shows the country how to manage a migrant worker program.



A Texas‐​based guest worker visa system would have several advantages over a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all national program.



The first would be flexibility. Migrants are tied to a single employer under most current federal visas, opening up the possibility of abuse and low pay.



A Texas‐​based migrant worker program could allow migrants to switch employers to create competition for workers, pay increases and to prevent the abuse of captive workers.



The best check on an abusive employer who underpays his employees is the ability to quit.



Texas could learn from countries that have similar policies, like Canada and Australia.



A recent Cato Institute policy analysis written by Brandon Fuller and Sean Rust argues that these provincial and state‐​based migration systems are created and managed based on local economic conditions — to great benefit.



The main lesson of their research is that states can react better and more quickly while the feds are often flat‐​footed.



Year‐​round migrant agricultural workers would help boost Texas agriculture.



A Texas visa for construction workers would aid the expansion of fast‐​growing cities.



There is an important role for the federal government in regulating migration, and that system could work alongside any new Texas‐​based guest worker visa.



But federal governments everywhere are insensitive to local demands. States are better suited to manage guest worker programs in addition to the federal programs.



Even immigration skeptics like Sen. Jeff Sessions, R‐​Ala., acknowledge the benefits of the Canadian system. Sessions recently stated that he “had occasion to talk with the Canadian official in charge of their immigration system,” and that he “like[d] what they did.”



When Sessions and writers at Cato can come to a middle ground on immigration, Texas legislators should take note.



The Texas visa would be self‐​funded through fees on migrants and the employers who hire them.



Migrants are also consumers and renters who will contribute to the government budget through sales and property taxes.



There are existing bans on migrant workers receiving welfare, but these proposals go a step further, requiring them to waive all access to public benefits.



A Texas‐​based guest worker visa program is a federalist approach to migration suited to the state’s unique circumstances.



It’s time that Texas shows the country how to manage a migrant worker program.

The Thai people voted for the latest constitution pushed by the reigning military junta. Unfortunately, General/​Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s dictatorship made a no vote as hard as possible. The Thai people may suffer for years more under this clownish yet brutal caudillo.



Thailand long was characterized as the land of smiles: a friendly people, warm climate, and informal atmosphere all beckoned backpackers and businessmen alike. But politics has become less hospitable in recent years.



In 1932 the all‐​powerful king was turned into a constitutional monarch. However, military coups were frequent and the court, along with the military, bureaucracy, and business, long dominated democratic politics. Well‐​connected elites prospered while the rural poor languished, seemingly forgotten by their own government.



That came to a dramatic end in 2001 when flamboyant business mogul Shinawatra Thaksin (the latter his given name, by which he is known), ran a populist campaign and won the support of the long‐​suffering rural poor. The usual governing elites refused to accept their loss of control and complained about his spend, spend, elect, elect policies, a staple of modern democracy. Thaksin was charged with corruption, but his adversaries, including in the military, also appeared to do well while supposedly doing good. In contrast, his government’s most serious misbehavior, some 2000 extra‐​legal killings in Thailand’s drug war, was largely ignored.





Thailand’s only hope for the future is to end Generalissimo Praytuth’s starring role in the country’s political comic opera.



An extended, often violent political struggle ensued, culminating in a coup in 2006. The military’s constitutional rewrite preserved democracy, albeit with elite‐​dominated commissions, courts, and other institutions designed to thwart the popular will. Despite the military’s hopes, however, Thaksin’s allies (he was in exile abroad) regained power in the next election.



Members of the opposition remained frank about their hostility toward giving Thaksin’s voters any say in the nation’s future. Acting as a modern variant of Mussolini’s Blackshirts, his opponents made the country ungovernable and invited military intervention. While refusing to back prime ministers allied with Thaksin against violent street mobs, in 2010 the military shot down scores of Thaksin supporters who protested the forced ouster of the government they had voted into office.



But this soft coup only led to a large majority voting for Thaksin’s sister, Yingluck, in the election that followed a year later. So the opposition again deployed mobs in a successful attempt to destroy democracy. When she called another election which the Thaksin‐​friendly Puea Thai Party was certain to win, the opposition Democrat Party demonstrated that its name was an oxymoron by refusing to contest the poll. Worse, anti‐​government protestors blocked voting. In May 2014 Gen. Prayuth seized power, while proclaiming that he had a “democratic heart.”



However, he channeled George Orwell when establishing the National Council for Peace and Order. The anodyne name mimicked the fraudulent titles promulgated by the Burmese military to cover its brutality. The Thai junta challenged anyone who called it a junta or said it took power in a coup. The NCPO also engaged in the usual repression accompanying a military putsch: banned public protests, prohibited political meetings, seized radio and televisions stations, censored print media, blocked websites, threatened dissidents, detained critics, and tried opponents in military courts.



So far more than 1300 people have been detained for “attitude adjustment” and even more have been charged with criminal offenses. More than 1600 people have been tried in military courts, not noted for procedural fairness. Those punished include academics, students, politicians, and journalists. The junta dropped charges against officials indicted in the 2010 massacre of pro‐​Thaksin demonstrators while filing criminal charges against his sister for the political offense of pork barrel politics.



Although many detainees were released after promising to eschew criticism of the military dictatorship, others were held incommunicado and likely tortured, though anyone reporting such incidents faces prosecution. For instance, Amnesty International has taken up the cause of three activists arrested in July for exposing torture and other ill‐​treatment by the army and police; they have been charged with criminal defamation and computer crimes. In July the regime filed criminal charges against 25‐​year‐​old Naritsarawan Kaewnopparat for seeking justice for her uncle, a military conscript beaten to death by other soldiers in 2011.



The junta also has targeted opponents with Thailand’s oppressive lese‐​majeste laws. Although the king criticized criminalization of virtually any discussion of the monarchy, the military treats even harmless comments as threats to “national security.” Freedom House observed: “The charges have been used to target activists, scholars, students, journalists, foreign authors, and politicians.” Sentences tend to be long—two recent ones involving Facebook messages ran 28 and 30 years—and scores of cases are pending.



Earlier this month the government charged 40‐​year‐​old Patnaree Chankij for responding to a private Facebook message critical of the monarchy with “ja,” the equivalent of “yeah,” meaning either yes or noncommittal, depending on the context. For this word she faces trial before a military court and a possible 15‐​year‐​sentence. The charge likely is intended to silence her son, Sirawith Seritwat, a student member of both the New Democracy Movement and Resistant Citizen group, which oppose military rule.



The brutality of generalissimo Prayuth’s rule cannot be disguised by his cartoonish nature. The dictator‐​in‐​training appears to be a character in a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera. One of his first acts was to send service personnel out to play music and dance while proclaiming the return of happiness to Thailand. He penned a song on the subject and hosts a weekly television show in which he lectures the nation. All the while he appears to be genuinely befuddled, even shocked and outraged, that the people do not adore him and follow his orders without question.



The human rights group Freedom House reports that Thailand has regressed from “partly free” to “not free.” Human Rights Watch concluded: “Thailand’s military junta has used dictatorial power to systematically repress human rights throughout the country.” (For its trouble, HRW’s website was blocked in Thailand.)



In its latest human rights report the State Department was blunt and comprehensive. The NCPO had imposed an interim constitution and decrees “severely limiting civil liberties, including restrictions on freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.” People could not choose their government and security forces often abused human rights, while largely enjoying “official impunity.”



Moreover, added State, other “human rights problems included arbitrary arrests and detention; poor, overcrowded, and unsanitary prison and detention facilities; restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and association; corruption;” and limits on worker rights. Also evident were insufficient protection for “vulnerable populations.”



Perhaps most shocking is how Bangkok leapfrogged backward over Burma, which is now freer than Thailand. After decades of brutal misrule, the Burmese military yielded much control. Although the civilian government has yet to gain full authority, the Burmese people are mostly free to speak and write; in last fall’s election they gave the opposition an overwhelming majority in parliament. None of these is true of life under Thailand’s NCPO.



Alas, Generalissimo Prayuth and his minions were not content with the usual repression. The regime broke new ground in treating almost everything as a prohibited protest. People were detained for placing duct tape over their mouths, making the Hunger Games three‐​finger salute, holding papers and placards with anti‐​coup messages, and aiding those arrested. Nor is that all. The military also detained people for standing, eating, wearing black on the king’s birthday, holding blank paper, selling goods decorated with Thaksin’s face, reading George Orwell’s 1984 in public, publicizing a poem on democracy, playing the French national anthem “La Marseillaise,” and talking to journalists.



Another prohibited act was wearing t‐​shirts with political slogans and other messages interpreted as political. I’ve worn my Lord Acton t‐​shirt, with his aphorism about power’s corrupting effect, all over the world, including in China. But I have not taken it to Thailand since the coup, despite (or because of) its obvious truth, and the likely military reaction thereto.



Last year the dictator‐​wannabe complained about critics of the first draft of a new constitution—to succeed the 19 others used since 1932, when the monarchy was first limited. People were “harsh” towards him and had no right to comment. He added ominously, “I will have to be harsh in return.” In December generalissimo Prayuth whined that newspapers “made me lose my manners and have ruined my leader image.” His outrage burned: “I will shut them down for real. I cannot allow them to continue their disrespect.” Yet he insisted that he was restrained in using his authority since, he informed journalists, he had the power to shoot them! His comments did not convince skeptics.



To General/​Prime Minister Prayuth’s credit, he quickly gave up his democratic pretenses. In March 2015 he proclaimed: “Our country has seen so much trouble because we have had too much democracy.” The problem? Thaksin and his allies won five straight elections. The generalissimo originally promised a new vote within 15 months, which was last August. But he quickly pushed that deadline back. Then last summer after an advisory panel rejected the military’s first constitutional try, the NCPO continued on, taking its time to produce another version no less dictator‐​friendly.



In essence, the military would continue to dominate the state. There would be elections, but those chosen would not rule. Complained Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch, the constitution “essentially enshrines the abuse of power and impunity.” Indeed, the referendum “is a redo of a military coup, using fear and intimidation to force Thai people to grant an extension of their control of power.” Even past juntas generally appointed technocrats to office, allowed dissent, and returned power to the people. Generalissimo Prayuth has taken a far more repressive approach on every particular.



While allowing a nominally free vote on its “roadmap to democracy,” the military did everything else possible to force the population to ratify its continued rule from the shadows. The regime promulgated propaganda in the name of explaining the document. Conscripts were deployed to promote a yes vote.



Most important, anyone opposing the constitution, whether online, in print, or in public, faced up to ten years in prison. In his finest dictatorial form, General/​Prime Minister Prayuth declared that the Thai people “have no rights to say that they disagree” with him: “I don’t allow anyone to debate or hold a press conference about the draft constitution. Yet they still disobey my orders. They will be arrested and jailed for ten years. No one will be exempted, not even the media.” No longer any pretense of a having “democratic heart!”



Journalists admit avoiding reporting on the referendum to avoid causing official offense. One of the courageous activists willing to take a stand, Rangsiman Rome, co‐​founder of the New Democracy Movement, told the Guardian that “The main thing [the draft constitution] represents is the NCPO, the main thing it will do is prolong the power of the NCPO.” At least 120 people, including former cabinet ministers and parliamentarians, were arrested for criticizing the document. The youngest defendant was an eight‐​year‐​old girl charged with obstruction for tearing down a poster because she liked its (pink) color. The generalissimo’s minions were not amused.



The military used its nationwide gag order to disguise the fact that the document was a blueprint for continued repression. Even former Prime Minister Ahisit Vejjajiva, who originally acted as an enabler of dictatorship, criticized the draft document for violating people’s liberties and failing to confront corruption. He and others who initially favored military rule came to understand that the generals intended to take power for themselves, not the old elites.



The majority may have supported the constitution as the quickest way back to nominal civilian rule, but only nominal. General/​Prime Minister Prayuth, with his Gilbert and Sullivan routine, will remain in power in the background. Moreover, the junta will argue that a yes vote ratified its severe violations of human rights. Finally, constitutionalizing the suppression of the Thai people’s civil and political liberties will be the most destabilizing step of all. Refusing to allow people to choose their path, warned former cabinet minister Chaturon Chaisang, means “there will be conflict in the future.”



No one knows what happens next. Some speculate that the military plans to stay in charge indefinitely to manage the long expected royal transition from the sickly but revered king to healthy but unpopular crown prince. That shift is almost certain to add another element of instability to Thai politics.



Thailand’s only hope for the future is to end Generalissimo Praytuth’s starring role in the country’s political comic opera. Then the contending factions need to accept the legitimacy of each other and work together. Thailand needs a new constitution, but not one which creates a camouflaged dictatorship. Rather, the Thai people should reduce state, and especially military, power and decentralize government authority. By reducing the importance of controlling the national government, Thais could more easily live in relative political peace.



Until then, the U.S. and Europeans should deal with General/​Prime Minister Prayuth’s NCPO when they must, but avoid doing anything to unnecessarily legitimize the junta. The generalissimo undoubtedly would whine and the regime might push for closer relations with China, but Washington should not allow itself to be held hostage by a repressive junta controlled by an unstable narcissist. America cannot rest its security upon such a dubious partner.



The future of Thailand should be up to the Thai people, and not only those carrying guns. Unfortunately, Generalissimo Prayuth was successful in manipulating the referendum to legitimize his dictatorship. Freedom for the Thai people will come only when they are able to push him aside. Hopefully their final victory will not be too long in coming.

"**The chief executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Google faced more than three and a half hours of questions from US senators on Wednesday.**
At present, the companies cannot be sued over what their users post online, or the decisions they make over what to leave up and take down.
Some politicians have raised concerns this ""sweeping immunity"" encourages bad behaviour.
But the chief executives say they need the law to be able to moderate content.
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pichai were summoned before the Senate after both Democrats and Republicans agreed to call them in for questioning.
Senators are worried about both censorship and the spread of misinformation.
And some industry watchers agree the legislation - known as Section 230 - needs to be revisited.
""[It] allows digital businesses to let users post things but then not be responsible for the consequences, even when they're amplifying or dampening that speech,"" Prof Fiona Scott Morton, of Yale University, told the BBC's Tech Tent podcast.
""That's very much a publishing kind of function - and newspapers have very different responsibilities.
""So we have a bit of a loophole that I think is not working well for our society.""
As the hearing began, Mr Zuckerberg vanished, unable to connect to the committee meeting - something Republican senator Roger Wicker called a ""most interesting development"".
But after a brief recess, Mr Zuckerberg told politicians he supported changes to the rule ""to make sure it's working"".
Section 230 is the main legal protection preventing social networks being sued.
It means websites themselves are not generally responsible for illegal or offensive things users post on them.
They are treated as neutral middlemen - like newspaper sellers rather than the editors that decide what goes in the paper.
Originally seen as a way to protect internet providers such as BT or Comcast, it has become the main shield for huge sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which cannot possibly review every post from their users before publication.
But politicians say Section 230 is outdated.
Democrats take issue with the spread of lies online without consequences for the sites.
Republicans say big tech is using its moderation powers to censor people it does not agree with - making editorial calls rather than staying neutral.
And both sides agree they want to see the social networks held accountable.
Mr Dorsey told the committee Section 230 ""is the most important law protecting internet speech"" and its abolition ""will remove speech from the internet"".
But he found himself faced with pointed questions over the implementation of Twitter's policies about what it removed or labelled misinformation.
Asked why Twitter would label a post from US President Donald Trump about the security of mail-in ballots but leave posts by Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that threatened violence against Israel unlabelled, Mr Dorsey replied the Iranian leader's tweets were considered ""sabre rattling"", which did not violate its terms of service.
Mr Dorsey also found himself facing questions from Republican senators over Twitter's limiting of a New York Post article about Joe Biden's son.
""The New York Post isn't just some random guy tweeting,"" Republican Ted Cruz said.
""Who the hell elected you and who put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?""
Mr Zuckerberg, meanwhile, revealed a ""private meeting"" with the FBI had warned firms to be wary of leaked material.
He said that Facebook, and he ""assumed"" the other companies, had been warned about a possible ""hack and leak operation in the days or weeks leading up to this election"".
The FBI ""suggested that we be on high alert and sensitivity, that if a trove of documents appeared that we should view that with suspicion that it might be part of a foreign manipulation attempt,"" he said.
On Section 230, Mr Zuckerberg told the committee Section 230 encouraged free expression and ""helped create the internet as we know it"".
But he added: ""The internet has also evolved.
""And I think that Congress should update the law, to make sure that it's working as intended.""
Mr Pichai, though, fiercely defended the law.
""Our ability to provide access to a wide range of information is only possible because of existing legal frameworks like section 230,"" he said.
""The United States adopted Section 230 early in the internet's history.
""And it has been foundational to our leadership in the tech sector.""
Both President Trump and his election rival Joe Biden have called for the removal of Section 230, though for different reasons.
But some Democrats used their time to criticise the entire hearing, positioned so close to the election, as a political ploy.
""I've been an advocate of reform of Section 230 for literally 15 years,"" senator Richard Blumenthal told the committee, referring to his time as a state attorney general.
""But frankly I am appalled that my Republican colleagues are holding this hearing literally days before an election, when they seem to want to bully and browbeat the platforms here to try and tilt them towards President Trump's behaviour.
""The timing seems inexplicable.""
His colleague Brian Schatz, refusing to ask any questions of the three chief executives, ""because this is nonsense"", said: ""What is happening here is a scar on this committee and the United States Senate.
""We have to call this hearing what it is.
""It's a sham."""

 **David Wojick**



[ _David Wojick_](http://www.cfact.org/author/dwojick/) _contributes Posts at the_[ _CFACT_](http://www.cfact.org/) _site. He is a journalist and policy analyst working at the intersection of science, technology and policy._



If you hold your nose and look closely there is some pretty funny stuff going on at the UN climate summit in Madrid. It is hard to hold your nose and laugh at the same time, but if you want to be UN watcher it is a necessary skill. I have been doing it for a long time, but then I have a big nose to hold on to while rolling with laughter.



First off there are the national delegations. International travel is expensive so you would figure the richest countries would send the biggest delegations, right? You would be wrong.



By far the biggest delegation is from tiny Côte d’Ivoire, with a whopping 348 delegates. Only a handful of these could possibly attend the negotiating sessions. Second biggest is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 293, still a staggering figure. The other Congo is fifth with 165, exceeded only by Spain and Brazil, which are rich.



The big guns like France and Germany, which are within driving distance of Madrid, have just 124 and 102 delegates. The U.S., which is still a member pending official resignation, sent 78 delegates. Surprisingly this is up from just 44 at COP 24.



Also amusing are the registration totals: 13,643 people representing specific countries or groups, 9,987 more from observer organizations – especially business groups and numerous green non-governmental organizations – and 3,076 journalists. There is a lot of luxury (and carbon intensive) tripping here, especially for the journalists as there is almost nothing to write about for the folks back home. The travel and lodging for all these folks must run to tens of million dollars.



What these funny numbers mean I have no idea. It may have something to do with who expects to make big bucks out of the UN climate racket. Africa in general has been very aggressive in this regard, which may explain their big numbers.



Speaking of African aggression, that is the next funny story, which is about the Cop 25 agenda. Before the conference can officially start there has to be universal agreement on the agenda. So setting the agenda itself often requires a lot of wheeling and dealing. I have seen Entire UN conferences that never got beyond trying to set the agenda.



In the COP 25 case there was a great stew over something called special status. The Paris Accord confers this status on just two groups of nations, supposedly because they are especially threatened by nasty climate change, or sea level rise, or something. There are huge compensation implications here.



One group is the Small Island Developing States or SIDS. There are 38 of these, including 16 in the Caribbean, including Cuba. The other group is the 47 Least Developed Countries (LDCs), most of which are either in Africa or Southeast Asia.



Well, the Africans came into Madrid and said they wanted an agenda item about giving the entire African continent special status. They were led by Egypt, which is certainly not an LDC. Honduras then jumped in and said that in that case they wanted South America to be given special status. It got really funny when Nepal then said that mountainous countries should also be special. Saudi Arabia then proposed that Arab nations be a special needs group.



It quickly became clear that if any new group was going to get special status, then an unlimited number of combinations of nations would also demand it. At this point the issue was dropped, hopefully with the laughs it deserved, so COP 25 could proceed.



Then too, at an early meeting of heads of delegations, everyone said they wanted to resolve the contentious issues with emission trading, which is the big target issue at COP 25, worth billions of dollars.



This superficial agreement was widely reported as a sign of progress, but hey, these are diplomats. What else would they say, that they did not want to resolve the issues? Of course not. They just each want to resolve the issues their country’s way. So this proud proclamation was merely laughable.



As an aside, my favourite example of diplomatic language is when the diplomat says “in that case we will have to consider our options” and it is a threat of war. A lot of UN speak is equally cryptic, but well understood by the other diplomats. This is why the COP negotiators argue endlessly over individual words. Simple words mask deep meanings.



Perhaps the funniest thing of all was the way the UN leadership took to mouthing hysterical voices in their opening statements. Keep in mind that the grand goals of the hysterics (Greta, XR, AOC, etc.) are completely different from those being pursued by the UN moderates.



The UN secretary general has warned that the world is “at the point of no return,” whatever that means. Return to what he did not say. The head of the treaty that this COP is a COP to said that humanity itself was at stake. And so it went speech after speech, waving the emergency flag while knowing full well that no big action was on this COP’s agenda. This was hypocrisy at its UN finest (and there is a lot of competition).



Some skeptics get mad at everything the alarmists do, but I prefer to laugh when I can and COP 25 has an abundance of funny stuff going on. Just hold you nose.

"During his first 11 days in office, President Trump has provided news outlets with plenty of material, at all hours of the morning and night. But his maelstrom of activity  —   the bold executive orders, the fiery Twitter posts, the brazen speeches  —   has also exposed, and perhaps exacerbated, ideological differences. For those devouring news about the administration, the choice of narratives has become starker, with brighter lines drawn around the content. For the readers and viewers, it’s follow the narrative of your choice, and be wary of the great chasm between. Over the weekend, as protesters descended on airports across the country in response to Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, fissures began to emerge even among   news organizations. On Monday, the divide only widened. And not everyone behaved predictably. Bill O’Reilly, the outspoken Fox News host, expressed skepticism about the rollout of Mr. Trump’s plan and called it “a mistake” to rush it. While he did make some effort to defend Mr. Trump, he was also somewhat moderate in one segment. “It is certainly responsible and logical for a new president to institute updated protections for this country by ordering specific temporary immigration actions,” Mr. O’Reilly said. “However, it’s also responsible for a federal judge to order that foreigners with the proper credentials already issued not be punished. There should be room for    decision making. ” He even invoked the Statue of Liberty to make his point. Some of Mr. O’Reilly’s guests were also critical. Karl Rove said of Mr. Trump that “the controversy is hurting him more than the controversy is helping him. ” Brit Hume said it was handled “very clumsily. ” And Charles Krauthammer said it was introduced in the “most amateurish, botched way. ” But, in more typical form, Mr. O’Reilly also focused on what he said he perceived to be Mr. Trump’s political calculation, adding that much of the country was “getting fed up with the   people. ” By late Monday, order on Fox News had been fully restored. In his opening monologue, Sean Hannity followed a familiar trope, criticizing the mainstream news media for “freaking out and completely misrepresenting” the immigration ban. The Trump administration, he said, was trying to “set the record straight, but the media won’t listen. ” The Wall Street Journal, part of the Rupert   News Corporation, delivered a scathing editorial on Monday denouncing Mr. Trump’s “blunderbuss” policy. But on Tuesday, some journalists at the publication were frustrated after a note from the editor in chief, Gerard Baker, instructed editors to avoid the phrase “seven majority Muslim countries” when writing about the order. “It’s very loaded,” Mr. Baker wrote Monday night in the note, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times (and reported earlier by BuzzFeed). “The reason they’ve been chosen is not because they’re majority Muslim but because they’re on the list of countries Obama identified as countries of concern. Would be less loaded to say ‘seven countries the U. S. has designated as being states that pose significant or elevated risks of terrorism. ’” The note caused concern among some editors and reporters in the newsroom as inappropriate interference. In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Journal said Mr. Baker’s note was “part of a larger conversation discussing   developments as a story was being edited on deadline. ” In the same email chain, she said, Mr. Baker also pushed to include more comments from critics of Mr. Trump’s policy. On Tuesday, Mr. Baker sent a memo to employees saying there was “no ban on the phrase ‘  country’” but that the publication should “always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban. ” The unrest was only the latest manifestation of greater concern among a faction of reporters and editors at The Journal who are dissatisfied with what they view as sympathetic coverage of Mr. Trump. Mr. Baker has maintained that the publication is committed to fair reporting. Elsewhere in the news and entertainment empire of the Murdoch family, there was a more pointed response to Mr. Trump’s immigration policy. In a memo to employees of 21st Century Fox on Monday evening, James and Lachlan Murdoch suggested they did not fully support Mr. Trump’s executive order. “21CF is a global company, proudly headquartered in the U. S. founded by  —   and comprising at all levels of the business  —   immigrants,” they wrote. “We deeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of America’s strength. ” Among   organizations, the tone in the last few days has been predictably defiant and jubilant, reflecting their position on the conservative spectrum. Several seized on Mr. Trump’s accusation that Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had shed “fake tears” over the ban. The Federalist, a   web magazine, published an article under the headline, “No, Trump’s Immigration Order Isn’t Racist or Reminiscent of the Holocaust. ” After Mr. Trump fired Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, on Monday night for refusing to carry out his immigration order, Breitbart News went with the spirited headline, “You’re Fired: Trump Fires AG for ‘Betrayal. ’” The conservative Daily Caller called Ms. Yates’s decision a “brazen act of defiance that cost her the post. ” On Tuesday afternoon, Breitbart readers may have been surprised to see the site covering protests  —   but the blaring headline would have quickly showed the organization’s focus. “Trump Supporter Knocked Unconscious at Portland Airport Protest,” the site wrote."

The paper Purkey et al. (2014) Relative contributions of ocean mass and deep steric changes to sea level rise between 1993 and 2013 was recently accepted for publication at the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans.  The abstract reads (my boldface):
Regional and global trends of Sea Level Rise (SLR) owing to mass addition centered between 1996–2006 are assessed through a full-depth SLR budget using full-depth in-situ ocean data and satellite altimetry. These rates are compared to regional and global trends in ocean mass addition estimated directly using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) from 2003–2013. Despite the two independent methods covering different time periods with differing spatial and temporal resolution, they both capture the same large-scale mass addition trend patterns including higher rates of mass addition in the North Pacific, South Atlantic, and the Indo-Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, and lower mass addition trends in the Indian, North Atlantic, South Pacific, and the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean. The global mean trend of ocean mass addition is 1.5 (±0.4) mm yr-1 for 1996–2006 from the residual method and the same for 2003–2013 from the GRACE method. Furthermore, the residual method is used to evaluate the error introduced into the mass budget if the deep steric contributions below 700, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 m are neglected, revealing errors of 65%, 38%, 13%, 8% and 4% respectively. The two methods no longer agree within error bars when only the steric contribution shallower than 1000 m is considered.
The full paper (preprint) is here.
I suspect the high rate of sea level rise east of Indonesia the Philippines (shown in the trend map below from the University of Colorado) is the reason the North Pacific trend discussed in the paper is so high with respect to the South Pacific.  That pocket of exceptional sea level rise in the western tropical North Pacific looks suspiciously like an ENSO residual (the residuals from a series of off-equatorial Rossby waves returning leftover warm water from El Niño events).  I’ve always wanted to remove that portion of the data to see its impact on global sea levels.

Sea Level Map from University of Colorado.
I recently expressed my opinion about sea level in the post Maybe It’s Time We Stopped Wasting Money Studying a Problem And Spent That Money Adapting to It.  I’ll let you provide additional comment on this paper.

UPDATE:  Please read the paper carefully.  The 1.5mm/year trend is the MASS component.  In other words, it’s the TOTAL rate of sea level rise MINUS the STERIC (thermal and saline) component.

The recent UFC women’s championship fight between loud-mouthed, über-cocky Rhonda Rousey (28) – the defending champion – and mild-mannered challenger Holly Holm is yet another example that vividly illustrates why consensus over the outcome of any complex future event among so-called “experts” is often not worth the paper it’s printed on. Like in climate change here too there was universal certainty as to who the winner would be, all based on expert assessments and lots of hype. Boy, were they wrong.
Over 90% certainty Rousey would win, odds 14-1
Before the fight experts were virtually dead-sure Rousey would win, and even do so handily. Betting outlets set the odds at a whopping 14-1. Rousey seemed invincible, almost to the point that challengers were called crazy to even dare enter the same ring with her, and so were people who bet against her.
At best it was said that Holm could only hope to hang in there as long as possible and maybe survive a round or two. In in her three previous matches Rousey disposed of her three opponents in short order – in a total of less than 70 seconds. But ultimately that success may have fed Rousey’s sense of invulnerability and overconfidence, and thus led to her demise.
The predictions, projections and expert opinions all turned out to be totally wrong. Precisely the opposite happened, as in the second round Rousey went down hard after a kick to the head, knocked out cold before she even hit the floor. Before that Holm had methodically dismantled her with a series of vicious blows. Holly Holm had done what no one imagined possible, even making the job look almost effortless. There was no lucky punch involved. The quiet girl from New Mexico humiliated the cocky loudmouth in short order.
As the video below shows, Rousey was totally outclassed. After just 6 minutes the massive favorite Rousey was out cold.

A lack of maturity
Not only was Rousey outclassed, but she completely lacked class, letting her success go to her head. In a way she personifies everything that is wrong with the American youth: ill-mannered, loud-mouthed, and annoyingly cocky.
Her downfall was her lack of respect for her opponent. This she clearly demonstrated with zero sportsmanship during the weigh-in and her refusal to touch gloves at the start of the bout. She bought into the media clear favorite hype, really believing she was 14 to 1 better than Holm, so making herself the victim of her own hyper-inflated ego. She was in a state of delusion.
Later, after the fight, Holm was asked about Rousey’s pre-fight cockiness and attitude. Being the classy and well-mannered lady she is, she attributed Rousey’s antics to the emotions that naturally boil up in the lead-up to a fight, and so held nothing against it. Here Holm was being too polite. Part of being a world-class athlete is having the ability to keep your emotions in check and to maintain a cool head. Here it’s obvious that Rousey had not yet developed emotionally to that point. That same immaturity led her to believe she was something she was not.
As her fame grew, so did her big mouth, ego and abrasive in-your-face attitude. Hopefully for Rousey her humiliating defeat to Holm will serve as a lesson in sportsmanship, maturity, respect and class. It’s a lesson she sorely needed.

Pope Francis has finished his U.S. visit and his message went well beyond the Catholic faithful. As he declared in the recent encyclical _Laudato Si_ , he was addressing “every person living on this planet.”   
  
  
The Pontiff’s predominant appeal is spiritual, not political. His commitment to the poor and our shared world is obvious. Most people yearn for meaning in their lives which no government can provide.   
  
  
However, the papal visit generated controversy because Pope Francis appears to be a man of the Left.   
  
  
Of course, religious imperatives may have political implications. For instance, Christian Scripture and church tradition require concern for the poor and environment. But there is no specific “Christian” answer to the many social ills.   
  
  
Unfortunately, the Holy Father sometimes blurs the line between the spiritual and the political. The Pope overestimates the wisdom and efficacy of politics while minimizing the power and virtue of markets.   
  
  
Consider environmental issues. Stewardship is an important Christian responsibility. However, the relationship between humans and the world around them always has been complex.   
  
  
The pontiff assumes the worst regarding the environment. Yet much of the environmental news actually is quite good.   
  
  
Important environmental problems remain, of course. However, capitalism helps answer even the toughest questions. For instance, greater economic development and innovation provide the means to solve often complex problems. Markets also promote efficient trade‐​offs, highlighting the benefits and costs of various policies.   
  
  
Yet in _Laudato Si_ the Pontiff appeared to suggest the common good yields only one correct environmental standard. However, facts are not a matter of faith.   
  
  
For instance, the consensus that the climate is warming does not extend to how much and how fast temperatures are likely to rise, as well as how great the likely social impact and how best to cope with those effects. Even if one believes temperatures are rising and the consequences will be serious, there still are many possible solutions.   
  
  
The most cost‐​effective strategy is adaptation, adjusting to specific problems. What is best is a matter of man’s wisdom rather than God’s commandment.   
  
  
When markets do not operate and property rights do not exist, some government action is necessary to ensure environmental protection. Nevertheless, policymakers must recognize the inherent infirmities of politics. There is no guarantee that increasing the power of parliaments, bureaucracies, and courts will solve environmental or other social problems.   
  
  
Yet the Pope in _Laudato Si_ largely ignored the government’s own woeful environmental record. Not everyone who claims to represent the common good does so; politicians and environmentalists are no more virtuous than businessmen and conservatives.   
  
  
Perhaps the most important trade‐​off ignored by the Pope is the importance of the free economy in providing wealth and opportunity—which improves the chance of living a fulfilling life—for the poor and disadvantaged.   
  
  
Thus, while the pontiff’s moral judgments deserve respect, his economic opinions warrant less consideration. His formative economic experience came in Argentina, a statist kleptocracy which enshrined injustice. The principal lesson from Argentina and similar systems should be the importance of rejecting political restrictions on the economy.   
  
  
As I wrote for the American Spectator: “Economic liberty, that is, freedom to work, invest, trade, and create is an outgrowth of the wondrous creativity with which God has infused mankind.” Still, the pontiff helpfully reminded us that there is far more to life than economic growth.   
  
  
Pope Francis deserved a warm welcome in the U.S. He is an important moral and spiritual leader who speaks to people’s deepest human needs.   
  
  
However, Americans should respond more skeptically when the pontiff moves from spiritual to political matters. His status as the Vicar of Christ gives him no special qualification as a political pundit.

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
In his post Schmidt and Sherwood on climate models, Andrew Montford of BishopHill commented on the new paper by Schmidt and Sherwood A practical philosophy of complex climate modelling (preprint). I haven’t yet studied the Schmidt and Sherwood paper in any detail, but in scanning it, a few things stood out. Those of you who have studied the paper will surely have additional comments.
DO CLIMATE MODELS SIMULATE GLOBAL SURFACE TEMPERATURES BETTER THAN A LINEAR TREND?
The abstract of Schmidt and Sherwood reads (my boldface):
We give an overview of the practice of developing and using complex climate models, as seen from experiences in a major climate modelling center and through participation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). We discuss the construction and calibration of models; their evaluation, especially through use of out-of-sample tests; and their exploitation in multi-model ensembles to identify biases and make predictions. We stress that adequacy or utility of climate models is best assessed via their skill against more naïve predictions. The framework we use for making inferences about reality using simulations is naturally Bayesian (in an informal sense), and has many points of contact with more familiar examples of scientific epistemology. While the use of complex simulations in science is a development that changes much in how science is done in practice, we argue that the concepts being applied fit very much into traditional practices of the scientific method, albeit those more often associated with laboratory work.
The boldfaced sentence caught my attention. A straight line based on a linear trend should be considered a more naïve method of prediction. A linear trend is a statistical model and it is definitely a whole lot simpler than all of those climate models used by the IPCC. So I thought it would be interesting to see if, when and by how much the CMIP5 climate models simulated global surface temperatures better than a simple straight line…a linear trend line based on global surface temperature data.
Do climate models simulate global surface temperatures better than a linear trend? Over the long-term, of course they do, because many of the models are tuned to reproduce global surface temperature anomalies. But the models do not always simulate surface temperatures better than a straight line, and currently, due to the slowdown in surface warming, the models perform no better than a trend line.
Figure 1 compares the modeled and observed annual December-to-November (Meteorological Annual Mean) global surface temperature anomalies. The data (off-green curve) are represented by the GISS Land-Ocean Temperature Index. The models (red curve) are represented by the multi-model ensemble mean of the models stored in the CMIP5 archive. The models are forced with historic forcings through 2005 (later for some models) and the worst-case scenario (RCP8.5) from then to 2014. Also shown is the linear trend (blue line) as determined from the data by EXCEL. The data and models are referenced to the full term (1881 to 2013) so not to skew the results.

Figure 1
Over the past decade or so, the difference between the models and the data and the difference between the trend and the data appear to be of similar magnitude but of opposite signs. So let’s look at those differences, where the data are subtracted from both the model outputs and the values of the linear trend. See Figure 2. I’ve smoothed the differences with 5-year running-mean filters to remove much of the volatility associated with ENSO and volcanic eruptions.

Figure 2
Not surprisingly, in recent years, the difference between the models and the data and the difference between the trend line and the data are in fact of similar magnitudes. In other words, recently, a straight line (a linear trend) performs about as well at modeling global surface temperatures as the average of the multimillion dollar climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report. From about 1950 to the early 1980s, the models perform better than the straight line. Now notice the period between 1881 and 1950. A linear trend line, once again, performs about as well at simulating global surface temperatures as the average of the dozens of multimillion dollar climate models.
Obviously, the differences between the trend line and the data are caused by the multidecadal variability in the data. On the other hand, differences between the models and the data are caused by poor modeling of global surface temperatures.
For those interested, Figure 3 presents the results shown in Figure 2 but without the smoothing.

Figure 3
SCHMIDT AND SHERWOOD ON SWANSON (2013)
The other thing that caught my eye was the comment by Schmidt and Sherwood about the findings of Swanson (2013) “Emerging Selection Bias in Large-scale Climate Change Simulations.” The preprint version of the paper is here. In the Introduction, Swanson writes (my boldface):
Here we suggest the possibility that a selection bias based upon warming rate is emerging in the enterprise of large-scale climate change simulation. Instead of involving a choice of whether to keep or discard an observation based upon a prior expectation, we hypothesize that this selection bias involves the ‘survival’ of climate models from generation to generation, based upon their warming rate. One plausible explanation suggests this bias originates in the desirable goal to more accurately capture the most spectacular observed manifestation of recent warming, namely the ongoing Arctic amplification of warming and accompanying collapse in Arctic sea ice. However, fidelity to the observed Arctic warming is not equivalent to fidelity in capturing the overall pattern of climate warming. As a result, the current generation (CMIP5) model ensemble mean performs worse at capturing the observed latitudinal structure of warming than the earlier generation (CMIP3) model ensemble. This is despite a marked reduction in the inter-ensemble spread going from CMIP3 to CMIP5, which by itself indicates higher confidence in the consensus solution. In other words, CMIP5 simulations viewed in aggregate appear to provide a more precise, but less accurate picture of actual climate warming compared to CMIP3.
In other words, the current generation of climate models (CMIP5) agrees better among themselves than the prior generation (CMIP3), i.e., there is less of a spread between climate model outputs, because they are converging on the same results. Overall, however, the CMIP5 models perform worse than the CMIP3 models at simulating global temperatures. “[M]ore precise, but less accurate.” Swanson blamed this on the modelers trying to better simulate the warming in the Arctic.
Back to Schmidt and Sherwood: The last paragraph under the heading of Climate model development in Schmidt and Sherwood reads (my boldface):
Arctic sea ice trends provide an instructive example. The hindcast estimates of recent trends were much improved in CMIP5 compared to CMIP3 (Stroeve et al 2012). This is very likely because the observation/model mismatch in trends in CMIP3 (Stroeve et al 2007) lead developers to re-examine the physics and code related to Arctic sea ice to identify missing processes or numerical problems (for instance, as described in Schmidt et al (2014b)). An alternate suggestion that model groups specifically tuned for trends in Arctic sea ice at the expense of global mean temperatures (Swanson 2013) is not in accord with the practice of any of the modelling groups with which we are familiar, and would be unlikely to work as discussed above.
Note that Schmidt and Sherwood did not dispute the fact that the CMIP5 models performed worse than the earlier generation CMIP3 models at simulating global surface temperatures outside of the Arctic over recent decades. Schmidt and Sherwood simply commented on the practices of modeling groups. Regardless of the practices, in recent decades, the CMIP5 models perform better (but still bad) in the Arctic but worse outside the Arctic than the earlier generation models.
As a result, the CMIP3 models perform better at simulating global surface temperatures over the past 3+ decades than their newer generation counterparts. Refer to Figure 4. That fact stands out quite plainly in a satellite-era sea surface temperature model-data comparison.

Figure 4
CLOSING
Those are the things that caught my eye in the new Schmidt and Sherwood paper. What caught yours?

"Advertising of sports utility vehicles, which emit more greenhouse gases than other cars, should be banned so the UK can meet its climate goals, a report has said. The large increase in numbers of SUVs in the UK and around the world is the second-largest contributor to the increase in global emissions since 2010, according to the International Energy Agency. The size, weight and drag of SUVs means they consume more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than the average car. But manufacturers are spending millions advertising the vehicles and increasing their share of the UK car market, according to the report by the New Weather Institute thinktank and climate charity Possible. In the UK last year more than 150,000 new cars sold were over 4.8 metres long, too large to fit in a standard parking space. What is an SUV? Once known as the Chelsea tractor, SUV stands for sports utility vehicle. There are no hard and fast rules about which cars qualify as SUVS, but a common theme is they incorporate design elements of off road vehicles. How popular are they? In 2010 about 200,000 SUVs were registered in the UK. In 2019 nearly 1 million were registered. About 40% of annual car sales in the UK today are SUVs, compared with less than 20% a decade ago. What environmental problems do they cause? Their increased size, weight and drag leads to higher fuel consumption and CO2 emissions than ordinary cars. Between 2010 and 2018, SUVs doubled their global market share from 17% to 39%, sending their annual emissions to more than 700 megatonnes of CO2. SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010 after the power sector, according to the IEA. The IEA says if consumers’ appetite for SUVs continues they would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars. What else is wrong with SUVs? They are also more dangerous, especially to pedestrians and cyclists. There were demands in Berlin last year to ban them from inner cities after the driver of an SUV killed four pedestrians. Drivers are also more at risk- they are 11% more likely to die in a crash than those driving ordinary cars, partly as their height makes the vehicles more likely to roll. So why are they so popular? Car companies are pushing SUV sales to maximise profits, say campaign groups. Analysts say that Ford makes most of its profits from sales of large SUVs and pickup trucks, and breaks even or loses money on sales of smaller models. All major auto brands are driving rapid sales growth across their SUV ranges, and this is taking place in all regions of the world. Data cues that push advertising include apparent increased need for SUV models, such as having children, receiving a promotion or moving home.       SUVs make up more than 40% of new cars sold in the UK – while fully electric vehicles account for less than 2%. Globally, there are more than 200m SUVs, an increase of 35m in 2010, accounting for 60% of the increase in the global car fleet since 2010. The report, Upselling Smoke, found the global trend of rapidly increasing sales of bigger and more polluting SUVs was jeopardising climate goals. It calls for a tobacco-style advertising ban on cars with average emissions of more than 160gCO2/km, and any cars exceeding 4.8 metres in length. This would cover the dirtiest third of cars sold in the UK, the report says. Andrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute, said: “We ended tobacco advertising when we understood the threat from smoking to public health. “Now that we know the human health and climate damage done by car pollution, it’s time to stop adverts making the problem worse. In a pandemic-prone world, people need clean air and more space on town and city streets.” He said adverts promoting the biggest and worst emitting SUVs were in effect “upselling pollution”. The report says the money spent on advertising by car companies – £1.2bn in the UK last year and $35.5bn (£26.6bn) across the world – is increasingly focused on pushing SUV vehicles. In the two years from September 2016 to 2018, Ford went from a roughly 50/50 split in its US advertising spend between cars and SUVs/pickup trucks, to allocating 85% of its ad spend to the latter. The report draws parallels between smoking and SUVs: “Tobacco causes damage to the consumers, and tobacco companies benefit from the way that they hook their most loyal customers … SUVs are marketed as providing protection for drivers, [but] their physical size, weight and pollution levels create a more dangerous and toxic urban environment for both drivers and pedestrians.” The UK has committed to a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Government plans for CO2 emissions standards for new cars in the UK after Brexit have been designed to align closely with those of the EU, which commit manufacturers to delivering a 37.5% reduction in CO2/km by 2030. But the report says the rise in SUV sales is jeopardising the climate goals. “The UK government’s plan for reaching net zero emissions relies on British drivers quickly switching away from buying traditional petrol and diesel cars to cleaner electric vehicles instead. “That is now starting to happen, but there’s a problem: we’ve been switching to buying SUVs even faster, and as a result the average carbon emissions of a new car sold in the UK have been going up instead of down for the past four years.” The report says ending advertising for very high-carbon vehicles will remove a driver behind their growing market share. The move would also force manufacturers to concentrate their advertising spend on smaller, more fuel efficient cars and fully electric versions of higher-end models, it says. The UK Energy Research Centre said meeting UK climate commitments meant immediate action was needed to counter the rapid increase in sales of larger cars. Robbie Gillett, a campaigner at Possible, said: “Whilst millions of us are trying to reduce our carbon footprints to tackle the climate crisis, we have a multibillion-pound car and advertising industry aggressively marketing highly polluting vehicles – many of which are literally too big for UK streets. “Their misleading ads promise us freedom and escape – but the reality of urban road conditions is grinding traffic jams, toxic air pollution and spiralling carbon emissions from road transport that will trash our climate goals. Let’s create space to breathe and space to think – free from the advertising pressures of big polluters.”"

Planet Earth, i.e, the world, is falling off its axis. Funnily enough, it’s the people most affected by it that are the ones causing the problems. It’s not the [“OK Boomers”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/chloe-swarbrick-basic-climate-change-facts-ok-boomer/) Ms Swarbrick was talking about recently. Definitely not. It’s the Millennials and Gen Z that Ms Marvelly was on about. These people are so woke, so pc, so riddled with guilt over climate change nonsense, and so obsessed with transgender and other like issues that, without realising it, they are screwing up their own lives. Their actions, determined by their thought processes, are in fact screwing up society as a whole.



So who are these people? If you were to define them with a broad brush they largely make up the Left of politics. A lot of them possess personalities that would be better left at the front door when they leave for work in the morning. An alternative would be to go to _The BFD_ and look at a few cartoons of [SonovaMin ](https://thebfd.co.nz/author/sonovamin/)and [Boomslang](https://thebfd.co.nz/author/boomslang/) prior to departing, but with personality bypasses which most on the Left have been unfortunate to inherit, that probably wouldn’t work. Watching the Government benches in Question Time is proof enough of this. What a sad, miserable, bedraggled, incompetent bunch they look.



Let’s start with woke. Woke as a political term refers to an awareness of issues concerning social and racial justice. It is derived from the African-American vernacular English expression “stay woke”, whose grammatical aspect refers to a continuing awareness of these issues. This is perhaps why being woke is akin to driving down a one-way street, because it always only appears to involve certain sections of society and people of colour. The aforementioned cartoons are a good place to start. On Thursday some good examples were right here on _The BFD._ Those poking fun at white people, no matter how offensive, are by and large not commented on. But change the colour of the people from white to brown or black and all hell breaks loose. Along come Mr Foon and Ms Ardern exploding in self-righteous indignation.



Why? Why do people of colour deserve this special treatment? The answer is they don’t. Society has become conditioned to either accept or been brainwashed into thinking this is the correct thing to do. Who by? Those on the Left pedlling this sort of nonsense, that’s who. What these people are in fact doing, though they are not bright enough to see it, is doing coloured people a disservice. Instead of saying we are all equal and we all have the same abilities they go along with the rhetoric of many people of colour who see little hope. The Government should be encouraging these people, not taking the easy option and consigning them to welfare at our expense.



Right now in the Democratic presidential nomination race, Kamala Harris has pulled out for reasons which are to do with campaign finances. But that hasn’t stopped calls that it is purely racist and in the next debate there will be only white faces. So what? This is how it’s panned out, nothing more and nothing less. We then look at the impeachment circus and again there are complaints that there are no black faces on the committee. For whatever reason, that’s how it is. But think about it, isn’t it interesting that the Left of politics always champion these people and then proceed to treat them like dirt.



It’s happening right here with this Government. The Maori caucus, useless though they are, are being walked all over and simply taken for granted. Last weekend they were [unhappy that a white woman was elected over a coloured Union man](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/labours-choice-of-president-upsets-maori/). Was this, in fact, white v brown, was it male v female or was it Union v non-Union? Who would really know but in today’s world, it could have been any one of them. It’s another good illustration of how far society has screwed itself up. If they properly WOKE up, Maori would realise National, in practical terms, have done far more for them over the years than Labour. Good luck telling the likes of Willie Jackson that.



This is where National has to do a Trump and find a way, as he has done, to resonate with the “coloured” population. Unfortunately, I don’t see that happening under the current leadership. These people, nine times out of ten, will vote Labour as they haven’t been sufficiently enthused through a charismatic leader from the other side who can convince them to see an alternative and more aspirational way.



I’ll deal with political correctness in my next post.

Despite the predictable screeching of the climate cultists, ghoulishly trying to pump up the tyres of their clapped-out bandwagon by hitching it to the current NSW bushfires, the fact remains that it ain’t climate change wot dun it. The biggest proximate cause is the devastating drought which has gripped parts of Australia for years – and which even [climate scientists concede](http://joannenova.com.au/2019/08/prof-andy-pitman-admits-droughts-are-not-worse-and-not-linked-to-climate-change/) is not linked to climate change.



But there also remains the possibility that the drought conditions have been exacerbated by “green tape”: land use and vegetation clearing rules which have allegedly stifled mitigation strategies which might not have prevented bushfires, but very likely stopped them reaching the catastrophic scale that they have.



Claims that “green tape’’ worsened an already “difficult and dangerous’’ fire season will be investigated at a special ­inquiry that will probe the state’s bushfire hazard-­reduction strategies, including land clearing and burn-offs. The federal government has bowed to pressure to investigate if the ongoing deadly fire season was fuelled by a failure to properly manage vegetation in national parks, forests and on private properties.



The newly launched bushfire inquiry will consider if governments at all levels have enough power to require ­landholders to reduce fire risks on their properties, and will investigate the science behind bushfire management activities and the impact of severe blazes.



Committee chair Liberal National MP Ted O’Brien said the inquiry was an “opportunity to better understand” how laws, mitigation strategies and the engagement of emergency services could impact fires.



“The committee understands people will have very passionate views about this, particularly in light of the current bushfire season,” he said.



“We look forward to hearing all views and assessing all the evidence put before us.”



NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro was among a number of National Party politicians who blamed “green-left ideology” for the unprecedented fires in recent weeks.



While an inquiry into green tape is certainly welcome, there is also a whiff of suspicion that this may well just be an arse-covering exercise for the NSW government.



Certainly, the plain evidence is that hazard reduction work has been dangerously down-scaled in recent years. Hazard reduction works in NSW in 2018/19 were over 30% lower than in 2012/13. Other years have been even worse: in 2016/17, reduction works were 70% lower than their 2012/13 peak. What must be established is: is this government negligence, prudence in the face of drought conditions, or the strangulation of good land management by green tape?



At the same time, there was a massive reduction in funding for the Rural Fire Service (RFS) last year – although, to be fair, much of that “cut” was a return to normal funding after a huge cash splash the year before on one-off, massively expensive equipment like 737 water bombers. So, despite opportunistic green tub-thumping about a “75 percent funding cut”, in reality, the true funding cut was a much more modest 4.8%.



Meanwhile, premier Gladys Berejiklian denies cutting ranger numbers.



“Since 2017, we’ve increased by 144 the number of staff in National Parks and Wildlife,” Ms Berejik­lian told the ABC. “What you’re hearing is not necessarily facts and I’m talking about the facts.



“I strongly refute those claims. Since 2017 we’ve increased the number of full-time employees.”



But what does “the number of staff” actually mean?



Environment Minister Matt Kean conceded to The Australian on Wednesday that the state had cut the number of rangers, who are involved in hazard-reduction burns, from 264 to 220, but denied the government was not doing enough […]



Mr Barilaro told 2GB that not enough was being done about ­hazard-reduction burns but it was “not correct” that ranger numbers had been cut.



“National Parks’ approach has been to lock it up and it hasn’t worked,” Mr Barilaro said […]“We still live with Bob Carr’s legacy — lock up the forests and let them burn.”



The likely truth is that the NSW bushfires are a perfect storm of naturally-occurring drought, government incompetence and environmentalist ideology. In fact, just about the only thing it **can’t** be blamed on is climate change.

"Five years ago, Volkswagen admitted to using software that ensured its cars were on their best behaviour when tested but could produce more pollution at other times. Court cases followed and public confidence in diesel collapsed. Across Europe VW vehicles were recalled. Simple modifications were made: new software for 1.6 and 2.0 litre engines and new air intakes on 1.6 litre models. But did it make any difference?  Research starting in 2012 King’s College London, and then the University of York, shone light beams across UK roads and measured exhaust from 23,000 vehicles that met Euro 5 standards. Analysis showed a more than 30% decrease in the nitrogen oxides from 1.6 and 2.0 litre VW vehicles. Non-VW cars stayed the same but many were found to have cleanup systems that were optimised for the legal test temperature, especially the General Motors (Vauxhall) and Renault group, but performed less well at other times. It will be many years before these diesels leave the fleet. Legal limits for nitrogen dioxide were set for 2010 but most towns and cities are still failing. Should manufacturers follow VW and recall old cars for engine and software modifications to reduce the health burden from polluted air?"

The US Constitution vests authority in Congress to collect duties and to “regulate commerce with foreign nations.” But over the course of the 20th century, Congress delegated some of that authority to the president through legislation. Although the purpose was, ultimately, to facilitate the process of _reducing_ tariffs, President Donald Trump has systematically weaponized a few statutes to serve a small‐​minded, protectionist, “America First” trade policy.



Since taking office, Trump has misappropriated his authority to launch six investigations under three seldom‐​invoked trade laws. Five of those investigations have led to the president imposing or announcing tariffs on imports of more than 1,500 products (steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar‐​panel components, and, mostly, Chinese technology products) valued at about US$100 billion. A new investigation into whether imports of automobiles and parts constitute a national‐​security threat could lead to sanctions on another US$300 billion of imports. Taking into consideration the likelihood of commensurate retaliation against American exporters, US$800 billion of US trade — or about 20 percent of total US trade in goods — could be ensnared in a trade war by year’s end. And that assumes no new cases or an escalating tit‐​for‐​tat.



The last 13 presidents of the United States — going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who signed into law the watershed Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934 — considered trade to be mutually beneficial for their fostering of economic growth and good relations among nations. Those presidents aimed to avoid trade wars and committed their administrations to reducing barriers, respecting the rules, and supporting the institutions of trade.





US President Donald Trump has single‐​handedly set fire to the global rules‐​based trade order that Washington was so instrumental in establishing after the Second World War.



Trump sees the world differently. He has departed from more than 80 years of US trade policy continuity, charting a new and deeply troubling course. Although Trump is not the first president to blame foreign trade practices for problems real and imagined, he may be the first to believe that protectionism is essential to making America great. He is certainly the only head of state ever to tweet that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” Trump’s trade policy is motivated by a toxic blend of ignorance, petulance and nationalist grievance.



 **Keeping the Wrong Kind of Score**



More than anything else, economic fallacies inform this president’s trade views. Unlike his predecessors, he sees trade not as a win‐​win proposition, but as a zero‐​sum game with distinct winners and losers. Exports are Team America’s points; imports are the foreign teams’ points; the trade account is the scoreboard. Since the board shows a large overall deficit, and many bilateral deficits with individual countries, the US is losing at trade — and it’s losing because Trump’s predecessors were bad negotiators and because the foreign teams cheat. But in those US trade deficits, Trump also sees leverage.



Countries registering surpluses, Trump reckons, are more dependent upon the US market than US exporters are on theirs, making the threat of tariffs — even trade wars — an effective and powerful tool to compel foreign governments to cave in to his demands. Yet, so far, there has been very little acquiescence to those demands. Under the threat of steel tariffs and US withdrawal from their bilateral trade agreement, South Korea opted to put out the fire by agreeing to limit its exports of steel and raise its quota on imports of US automobiles. Other countries with economic heft, however, are fighting back.



In any case, while it might be true that the US would be less weakened than other countries by a trade war — after all, the US economy depends less on trade than almost every other country: imports plus exports account for 27 percent of US gross domestic product compared to a world average of 53 percent — the damage to the US economy would be considerable nonetheless. Cavalierly inviting a trade war because US “casualties” would be lighter than, for example, China’s or Europe’s, betrays a worrying absence of understanding of how trade and the global economy really work.



Most global trade is in intermediate goods — the purchases of producers, who have decentralized and diversified their operations to improve efficiencies, reduce costs and compete more effectively. Whereas in the 20th century, most of a company’s production and assembly took place in one location, often under one roof, the factory floor has since broken through those walls and now spans borders and oceans. Taxing imports today is akin to erecting a wall through the center of that 20th century assembly line, impeding production and raising costs in similar fashion. That helps explain the preponderance of opposition among US manufacturers to Trump’s trade tack. US tariffs raise their costs, and the resulting retaliation from foreign governments will reduce their export revenues, squeezing profits from both ends.



In 2017, US goods imports totaled US$2.2 trillion — of which US$1.1 trillion were purchases of raw materials, intermediate goods and capital equipment — and US goods exports totaled US$1.5 trillion. If Trump were to impose, for example, a 10 percent across‐​the‐​board tariff on all imports, producer costs would rise by roughly US$110 billion (or 10 percent of US$1.1 trillion). Commensurate retaliation abroad would reduce US export revenues by roughly US$150 billion (or 10 percent of US$1.5 trillion). Together, the increased costs and reduced revenue would amount to a US$260 billion reduction in manufacturing‐​sector profits. Last year, the US manufacturing sector’s profits were US$550 billion, so a 10 percent import levy alone could end up cutting profits nearly in half. When Trump claims that protectionism will revitalize manufacturing and bring back jobs, one can only wonder where he thinks the investment will come from without the profits his tariffs will chase away.



 **False and Misleading**



Trump’s trade policy is driven by misleading statistics and the fallacious narrative that trade destroyed US manufacturing. Trump pines for the days when US industry was unrivaled in the world, accounting for a larger share of the US economy, and employing a significant chunk of the labor force. Manufacturing’s share of the US economy peaked in 1953 at 28.1 percent and has been on a downward trajectory ever since. In 2017, that share was only 11.6 percent of GDP.



But in 1953, US manufacturing’s value‐​added amounted to US$110 billion, whereas in 2017, it reached a record high of US$2.24 trillion. A sector that today produces more than six times the value in real terms than it produced when it was of much greater significance to the US economy can hardly be described as declining. The sector employs about two‐​thirds the number of workers as it did at its peak of 19.4 million in 1979, but that reflects massive increases in output per worker, which is attributable primarily to the adoption of new technologies.



Trump seems to believe that manufacturing is the only part of the economy that matters — or the only part of the economy, full stop. When citing trade balances, the president and his advisors simply ignore US services, where the US is most competitive and growing fastest. It’s as if Google and Amazon, financial services and insurance companies, tourism and intellectual property licensing don’t exist. Last year, US services exports amounted to US$800 billion and generated a US$250 billion trade surplus.



For a nation whose consumers spend twice as much on services than on goods, and where 90 percent of the workforce is employed outside the manufacturing sector, the obsession with manufacturing is misplaced. But even Trump’s concerns about manufacturing are reserved for just a few heavy industries, such as steel and automobiles. He fails to recognize — or at least his policies fail to reflect — the diversity of industries within manufacturing, many of which are worried about the pain from Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. For every US$1 that steel producers add to GDP, steel users add US$29; for every one job in steel production, there are 46 in steel‐​using industries. While Trump wants credit for “protecting” the steel industry with a 25 percent import tariff, he and his advisers downplay the adverse impact on steel‐​consuming producers.



 **Incoherent Uncertainty**



Although it’s difficult to discern any coherent trade‐​policy strategy, the administration’s incoherent strategy seems to be to intentionally foment a climate of uncertainty. Some suggest the policy dissonance is intended to distract the public from the president’s mounting domestic legal and ethical woes, but the persistent noise may be conducive to the administration’s goal of repatriating global supply chains.



Trump has sought to deter US companies from investing abroad. His tweet‐​shaming of US firms that were considering establishing assembly operations in Mexico, and his threats of 35 percent taxes on re‐​importation into the US dissuaded a few from moving forward with their plans. Trump’s repeated threats to withdraw the US from the North American Free Trade Agreement; his insistence that any revised NAFTA agreement should require that products contain more US content to qualify for preferential treatment; and his demand for a five‐​year sunset clause under which NAFTA would automatically terminate unless the parties affirmatively agree to extend its terms are all designed to create uncertainty. Why?



Trump fears that trade agreements, which extend preferential access to the US market, encourage investment diversion and outflows from the US to the economies of its trade agreement partners. And he believes that by convincing the world that US trade barriers could rise at any moment, foreign companies will want to hedge their bets by investing in the US — inside the tariff wall. It may sound cynical and self‐​defeating, but this kind of thinking permeates the strategy sessions of America First nationalists, who like to think the specter of President Ronald Reagan’s threatened tariffs on automobiles induced Honda to build the first foreign automobile plant in the US in 1982.



Either way, things have changed since then. The US is still the world’s top destination for foreign direct investment, but its share of the global stock of FDI has decreased from 39 percent to 17 percent during the first two decades of the 21st century. The determinants of investment are diverse and many, and the number of viable destinations competing for that investment has increased as countries have developed. Obviously, the size of the market is important, but so are many other factors, including ease of access to supply chains, respect for the rule of law, policy predictability, and certainty in the business and regulatory climate.



Trump is betting that by making policy less predictable and creating an environment of “regime uncertainty,” investment will flow into the US. Not only is the success of that approach doubtful, but the objective itself — attracting investment — is at odds with the president’s primary goal, which is to reduce the trade deficit. When Americans buy more goods and services from foreigners than they sell to them (trade deficit), then they also sell more assets to foreigners than they buy from them (capital surplus). Increasing inflows of investment and reducing the trade deficit cannot happen at the same time, hence the conclusion of policy incoherence.



 **Anger as Policy**



A sense of grievance also permeates the America First narrative. Trump and several of his advisors see the US as a benevolent giant, having selflessly provided the resources, security and generosity of spirit to rebuild Western Europe, East Asia and the rest of the free world after the Second World War. Under the US security umbrella, the rest of the West took advantage of America’s kindness, took more from the till than they put in, skirted the rules to obtain artificial advantages in certain industries, adopted policies to promote their own interests at the expense of the US industrial base, became economic rivals and began to adopt views about foreign policy and geopolitics that weren’t in lockstep with the US government’s. Or so the story goes.



Expectations that other governments will acquiesce to US foreign and economic policy positions and accept the premise of American exceptionalism predominate this mindset. That the US isn’t treated with deference within the international trading system, especially by the World Trade Organization’s Dispute Settlement Body, for its selfless leadership in establishing the rules and institutions of trade is an affront to Trump and his advisors. This premise is the well‐​spring of Trump’s outrage in learning that Canada, Mexico, the European Union and China would even consider retaliating against the US for imposing punitive tariffs on steel, aluminum and technology products.



The Trump administration’s concerns about China’s mercantilist industrial policies have some validity, but its approach to resolution has been an unmitigated disaster. The US doesn’t need China to agree to buy US$200 billion more US exports per year. Reducing the bilateral trade deficit is a silly, misguided objective.



Instead, the US should be pursuing deeper, enforceable commitments from China that it will operate within the letter and the spirit of the rules‐​based trading system. The way to do that is to stand shoulder‐​to‐​shoulder with like‐​minded governments and demonstrate to Beijing that certain behavior won’t be tolerated. Instead, the Trump administration has done the opposite. It pulled out of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord, it picked fights with allies by hitting them with steel and aluminum tariffs, it transgressed WTO rules to impose sanctions unilaterally and it isolated the US as an international scofflaw. These missteps must be reversed, if that’s still possible.



Those who subscribe to Trump’s points of view — that trade is an “Us versus Them” proposition — probably think that the president is doing the right thing in subverting the institutions of global trade and provoking trade wars. More sycophantic supporters consider Trump’s strategy to be ingenious. Apologists who know better say that the president is merely fulfilling his campaign promises — and how refreshing is it that a politician is making good on his promises! All are complicit in the unenlightened, provocative and possibly unhinged trade policy that Trump has wrought.

The past few weeks have seen broad‐​based community outrage from extremely disturbing incidents involving current or former police officers in the killing of 44‐​year‐​old George Floyd in Minneapolis, 26‐​year‐​old Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and 25‐​year‐​old Ahmaud Arbery near Brunswick, Georgia. In all cases, the victims were African‐​American and the events have spotlighted the role of racism in policing.



In the immediate aftermath—which exploded during the week of May 25th—there were both peaceful and violent protests, destruction of private and public property, and additional injury in Minneapolis, Louisville, Atlanta, and far beyond. There is no question that the short‐​run costs to each city and its residents will be enormous.



Poor underlying race relations between the police and community has long‐​term costs, too, an issue that I explored with my colleague Tim Harris in a study published in Journal of Housing Economics in 2018. In the study, we explored whether poor underlying race relations in an area might create a chilling effect on homeownership for minorities. We focused on home ownership—an easily measured outcome in many data sets—because it is related to the decision to “plant one’s roots” and invest in a community. It has been argued that home ownership is associated with both private benefits (such as wealth accumulation and better child outcomes) as well as community benefits (such as investment in social capital). Given the illiquidity of homeownership, it can be thought of as a longer‐​term investment for many people.



From 2012 onward, there were a series of high‐​profile events in the U.S. related to police brutality which highlighted racial tension. Using Google Trends, we characterized a locality’s underlying racial climate based on search interest in these charged events. We used data from the American Community Survey prior to any of these flare‐​ups and showed that the ownership decision for black people is responsive to the underlying racial climate; African‐​American homeownership in localities with the most charged racial climates was 5.6 percentage points lower than in the least charged racial climates.



Our findings, insofar as our measure captures problems with the criminal justice system, suggest that some recent proposals with bipartisan support to reform policing and sentencing may have larger social benefits beyond those directly aggrieved. Reforms in police tactics—such as additional training, body cameras, and the use of outside agencies to investigate misconduct—have broad‐​based support. Improving policies has the potential to improve race relations and consequently increase investment in communities through homeownership.

"Turning wood and agricultural waste into biofuels is one step closer to being a truly green process, according to a recently published study in the journal Science. James Dumesic of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues report a new method of extracting energy from any type of organic material, and they achieve this without using large amounts of acid or costly chemicals.  Biofuels are obtained from the carbon present in plants. In contrast to fossil fuels, which take millions of years to form, plants are can be replenished quickly. They are also seen to be carbon neutral, because the carbon they release when burnt has been offset by the amount they absorbed whilst growing.  First-generation bioethanol, a common type of biofuel, is made from the starch and sugars present in corn or sugarcane. These two components can be readily transformed into fuel by microbes. But given that these crops can be used for food too, the United Nations found that using them for making fuel is having a negative effect on the world’s food supply. To avoid this problem, second-generation biofuels are being sought from plants that can be grown on land not suited for food production. But the problem with these crops is that most of their carbon is trapped in cellulose, a polymer which is resistant to fermentation and that has to be broken down into smaller sugar units that are soluble in water. Producing biofuels is a four-step process: acquiring the biomass, breaking it down to individual sugars, fermenting the sugars using microbes into desired biofuel and separating all the components to make the fuel usable. Each step can be improved to make the process more effective. Dumesic’s method targets the second step, which has so far proved to be harder to optimise. So far the process of deconstructing cellulose has required toxic chemicals and a lot of energy. Dumesic’s team make that process easier by using the chemical gamma-valerolactone (GVL), which can be easily recovered at the end, making the process a lot greener. GVL loosens the cellulose, but it doesn’t completely break it down into the component sugars. That is achieved with small quantities of acid. The second critical part in the new method is to use liquid carbon dioxide at the end of the process to separate and recycle the GVL for the precious syrup. Sugars can then be used for the microbial fermentation that converts the biomass to biofuel. Other attempts to optimise the second step have involved the development of enzymes, which are proteins that do a specific task, in this case breaking down cellulose. This has been an efficient process too, and many industrial enzymes exist today. But the cost of production of enzymes can be high. In contrast, GVL is cheap. “Our approach is complementary to existing methods for biomass conversion,” Jeremy Luterbacher, the study’s lead author, said. “We find that GVL acts as the ideal solvent to convert plants to sugars without the use of concentrated acids, enzymes or other expensive alternatives.”  Luterbacher and his colleagues predict that, because it can be recycled at low energy costs, the minimum selling price of a gallon of bioethanol can be brought down from US$3.40 to US$3.23, which may not seem like a lot but on an industrial scale 5% reduction is a significant saving. “Apart from biofuels, the sugars can also be converted into other molecules usually obtained from fossil fuel sources” Luterbacher said. GVL itself can be made from the sugars too, making the whole process greener and an attractive alternative to currently used methods."
"During the warm periods between ice ages stretching from 500,000 to 200,000 years ago, the southern parts of Britain were occupied by a species of ancient human, Homo heidelbergensis. These hunter-gatherers were quite sophisticated in where they chose to live or camp, always mindful of where good food could be found. Unfortunately they left little evidence of their occupation except for very rare butchery sites, strewn with cut-marked bones. But they did leave thousands of stone tools, particularly Acheulian knapped-flint hand-axes. In a paper published in the journal PLOS One, my Southampton colleagues Laura Basell, Sian Robinson, Graham Burdge and I analysed data from archaelogical sites on either side of the English Channel to examine whether their location could be linked to areas where there was once a rich variety of food. These sites are concentrated in the middle-lower reaches of river valleys, with most being upstream of, but relatively close to, the estimated tidal limits of sea levels of the time. They include Dunbridge in Hampshire, Swanscombe near Dartford, and the Somme Valley in France. Due to the effects of geological processes over such huge spans of time, only a few of these sites are exactly where they were hundreds of thousands of years ago. Even so the rest have only moved by a few tens of metres. So by comparing the sites’ locations to a database of plants and animals known throughout the region at the time we can estimate the food available to them. Just how well were our early ancestors’ nutrient needs met by the food available in what was then an almost entirely forested region? We looked at the availability of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) and essential micronutrients such as vitamins A, B6, B12, and C, folic acid, iodine, iron and zinc. The advantage of these sites included better access to foods that provided all these critical dietary elements, including sources such as raw liver and bone marrow, eggs, fatty beaver tails, highly nutritious eels, root vegetables such as wild carrots, cabbage, watercress, and leafy green vegetables. This will have maintained the population’s health and maximised reproductive success, and may even have contributed to increasing their cultural complexity.  Downstream floodplains are shown to be the optimum locations in the nutritional landscape for a broad diet. In fact such places may have been seen as good, or healthy or “special” places, explaining the high number of artifacts built up by repeat visits or occupation. Stone tools are found in small numbers along the entire length of river valleys and hill tops across southern England and northern France, which shows that these hominins travelled throughout the landscape. But the best explanation for the high concentration of stone tools found only in these downstream locations is that they provided the best foods – particularly those in short supply in what was then a entirely forested landscape. Combined with other benefits on site such as flint for tool-making, beavers pelts for fur clothing, and safety on small islands in river channels from predators such as big cats, the high nutrient diversity made these locations the optimal locations in northwest Europe. So there was perhaps a symbiotic interaction in the ecological niches found at these floodplain sites between these early hominins, horses and deer attracted to the grassland at the edges of forests, freshwater fish and eels, and beavers. It seems that this pattern of occupation coupled with low population densities was fundamental to the Palaeolithic diet. Here, in the occasionally glaciated higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere – the very edge of the world at the time – it allowed our early human ancestors to expand beyond their homelands and into these less productive regions for over half a million years. It seems that the nutritional benefits to be had at these locations led them to be used as central points, from which a healthy variant of the Palaeolithic diet allowed the hominins to extend their reach through the landscape. While we have very little information on their lifespan, their site distribution suggests they had a balanced diet and did not suffer from many of the “diseases of civilisation” that appear after the adoption of agriculture."
"Britain is a nation of birders. Thanks to TV shows such as the BBC’s Springwatch, bird feeding and watching is more popular than ever. More than half the UK adult population goes to feed the birds at least once a week. The British Trust for Ornithology recently asked members of the public to survey the number and variety of birds in their garden. Participants were asked to record the first arrival of each bird species to their garden feeder, one hour after daybreak. They were also asked to record how many sources of artificial light were within 50m of their home, and exactly how near they were. So not only was the trust able to collect valuable data on the distribution of bird species, but it was also a useful exercise to increase public awareness of a much-overlooked environmental pollutant: light. My research, in partnership with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas and Eco-Explore, has examined the impact of artificial light at night on the behaviour of freshwater fish. Why, many people have asked me, do fish care about street lighting? They care because it alters the natural pattern of light and dark in their ecosystem, affecting their daily behaviour, and that of their prey. Light pollution is among the fastest growing man-made pollutants of the natural environment, and surveys such as these highlight the need to address it. Over the past 60 years, the number of outdoor lights across the UK has drastically increased. There are more than 7.5m lights lining motorways and illuminating residential streets, a figure that increases by 3% annually in the UK and by 6% around the world. But despite how many artificial lights there are and how quickly they are proliferating, the recognition that light can be a problem has come only recently. There are major gaps in our knowledge about its effects on most animals. From the limited science we have, it’s been suggested that artificial lighting affects the behaviour and even physiology of a huge number of species groups. For example, by disorienting sea turtle hatchlings, affecting the choice of nest and breeding success of birds, or causing physical changes in the eyes of salamanders. Many organisms have been affected by humans’ widespread disturbance of the natural patterns of light and dark. Most streetlights in the UK are low-pressure sodium lamps (LPS). These produce light at a narrow band on the visible spectrum, about 590nm, which is yellowish in colour. These are steadily being replaced by a variety of new technologies, purportedly for cost savings or environmental reasons. However, while these lights may be more eco-friendly to run, the brighter, whiter light they produce may be more intrusive to nocturnal species. According to a seminal review by the Royal Commision for Envionmental Pollution in 2010, which set the agenda for light pollution research, the shift from LPS to more modern lighting is not just down to bean counting local councils. The narrow band of light produced by LPS allows only poor colour discrimination, which makes it hard for us to see. High-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, which produce a wider spectrum of light more suitable for human vision, are commonly used alternatives. HPS lamps are also more compact, and so are easier to shield to reduce light bleeding in unwanted directions. Two other types of lamps considered next generation replacements for street lighting are metal halide and light-emitting diode (LED). These are extremely energy efficient and have a long lifespan, with LED lights able even to be powered by solar or wind energy generators. According to a recent study in the Journal of Environmental Management, the spectral properties of different types of lamps determines the degree to which their light pollution infiltrates their surroundings. The effects of streetlights on the photoreceptors of a human eye were used as a model. The degree to which the lamps were said to be pollutants was dependent on the level of response seen in the photoreceptors of human eyes – the more intrusive an individual would find the light, the more polluting it was said to be. The study found that the LPS lamps now being replaced were the least polluting, while new LED lamps were the most polluting due to the blue cast of their light. So the move from LPS and HPS to next generation lamps seems likely to generate more light pollution, with greater environmental effects. As most of Britain’s street lamps reach the end of their life and are due for replacement, the coming years present and excellent opportunity to try an minimise the environmental impact of these millions of artificial lights. How wildlife react to these new lights has not even been considered, as current studies are based on HPS/LPS lamps. It’s vital that we understand, before this new technology is rolled out countrywide, their ecological effects. So we shouldn’t restrict our studies and debates about street lights to just potential problems for humans, austerity-inflicted council cuts, and possible crime or accident rates. The lamps that light the way as we walk home at night affect the other species too – so before we make them even brighter, we should be trying to find out how."

Guest opinion: Prof Richard Betts, Dr Tamsin Edwards
Dr Tim Ball’s blog post “People Starting To Ask About Motive For Massive IPCC Deception” – drawing parallels between climate scientists and Hitler – doesn’t do anyone in the climate change debate any favours: in fact it seems a big (goose) step backwards. It’s especially frustrating to see him write this so soon after the productive dinner at Nic Lewis’s place, where the attendees agreed on the need to depolarise and detoxify the climate discussion. Anthony Watts wrote an extremely positive blog post about the evening, and there were many favourable comments from WUWT readers saying how great it was to have a more civilised conversation.
But here we see Tim sink to a new low, with Mein Kampf quotes and snide misrepresentation of the IPCC reports. Perhaps Tim hasn’t yet heard that many people on both sides of the discussion have moved on from the simple name calling of the past…. We were also disappointed that so few commenters below the post distanced themselves from his views. We hope this is merely selection bias, and that many of you are simply sighing and moving on to the next post.
For those that do endorse Tim’s views: we often see people who are sceptical of climate science and/or policy object to the term ‘Deniers’ (a phrase neither of us use). But it’s hard to see how anyone could justify taking offence at being called a Denier if they were happy to call other people Nazis. Especially when those people – professional climate scientists like us – are trying to engage in good faith discussions with Anthony and many others in the sceptical community.
We do understand that Anthony does not read all WUWT guest posts. We’re pleased that when we contacted him he added a disclaimer (albeit a somewhat ambiguous one) and offered us this chance to respond. We see this as a positive outcome of meeting in person at dinner. Certainly we would not be writing this without it.
As we understand it, Tim’s post does not at all reflect Anthony’s views.We therefore hope future WUWT guest writers adopt the civil and rational tone of the conversations we had that evening and do not remain stuck in the pointless, playground insults that do not help either climate science or its discussion.We invite our dinner companions from the 21st September (including Anthony) to add their views below. Personally, we think they will agree that Tim’s view is an out-of-touch relic.

Note from Anthony:

I agree that Dr. Ball’s post had some “over the top” rhetoric in it, and it is my error that the post was published without benefit of editorial actions. It does not reflect my views. My excuse is simply that I was distracted by an extreme challenge in my life at the time, and I didn’t get to vet the guest post as I normally would have. That won’t happen again. On the plus side, this issue illustrates why one of the most common ugly claims about WUWT, the claim of being in the pay of “big oil” or some NGO, can’t possibly be true. If that were true, I could have long ago hired an assistant editor and such missteps would not occur. While there are many things that the IPCC can be validly criticized for, some of which were in Dr. Balls post, parallels with Nazism is not one of them.
While there remain wildly disparate views about climate science, I see that there are people on both sides that are gravitating towards a more central and in my opinion, more reasonable view. Climate skeptics and climate advocates should do everything possible to help facilitate such dialog, otherwise all we have is just noise.  – Anthony Watts

"Extreme droughts are likely to become much more frequent across central Europe, and if global greenhouse gas emissions rise strongly they could happen seven times more often, new research has shown. The area of crops likely to be affected by drought is also set to increase, and under sharply rising CO2 levels would nearly double in central Europe in the second half of this century, to more than 40m hectares (154,440 sq miles) of farmland.  Central Europe suffered its biggest and most damaging drought on record in 2018 and 2019, which had two of the three warmest summer periods ever recorded on the continent. The summers were also much drier than average, and more than half of the region suffered severe drought conditions. Rivers and watercourses dried up, some crops were ruined and wildfires increased during these two years of extreme drought. The only other drought on record to come close, in 1949 and 1950, affected a land area about a third smaller. By comparing the conditions with weather records dating back to 1766, and using computer models of climate change, researchers from UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany, were able to forecast that moderate reductions in greenhouse gases from their current levels would halve the likelihood of such extreme droughts, and shrink the affected land area by nearly 40%. Rohini Kumar, one of the authors of the study, told the Guardian the findings were concerning. “The findings indicate that introducing measures to reduce future carbon emissions may lower the risk of more frequent consecutive drought events across Europe. On the one hand, we need to step up our efforts to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide, and at the same time deal with strategies to adapt to climate change.” Strong reductions in greenhouse gases would reduce the frequency of such extreme droughts to “a very negligible number”, said Kumar. The paper is published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The study adds to an increasing body of research showing the impacts of global heating on Europe. Previous studies have suggested that southern and central Europe will experience more drought, with one study projecting that European cities will become much hotter, with London forecast to have a climate more like Barcelona by 2050 and southern and central European cities seeing more extreme levels of heat. Constantin Zohner, of the Crowther Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who was not involved in the research, said the study showed the consequences of failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions.  “[These] findings are an important warning to the world that continued emissions will strongly exacerbate future drought events, threatening ecosystems, agriculture and human wellbeing,” he told the Guardian. “The study, once more, highlights the urgent need for climate action in order to maintain the functionality of ecosystems and ensure water supply to future generations.”"
"Reports of the third successive year of rising eel catches in France suggests the eel’s drastic decline in numbers has finally bottomed out. However it’s important to note that today’s catches are a tiny fraction, barely 5%, of those made 30 years ago. Exactly what led to this decline is hard to pinpoint, but a recent study suggests that their extraordinary, ocean-going lifecycle may be one element. Despite being well studied and considered by many as a delicacy, the European eel remains a most mysterious fish. Eels are inhabitants of European freshwaters and estuaries, but their journey starts more than 5,000km away off the east cost of North America, the waters of the Sargasso Sea. After hatching in the Bermuda Triangle, a place of legends, larval eels passively drift on the trans-Atlantic Gulf Stream current. After several years adrift, they eventually reach the European coasts, whose rivers, lakes and estuaries will be their playground for several decades. Upon sexual maturation, adult eels return to the Atlantic again, swimming back to their spawning ground to reproduce and die. After major yearly fluctuations observed in the 20th century, the number of young eels reaching the European coast collapsed in the 1980s, falling to 1% of average numbers in the past. The species is now considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the IUCN. Published in the journal Current Biology, our research focused on addressing this population collapse, to try to understand how and why it occurred, and what the consequences might be. While these questions on the fate of the eels are still largely unanswered, the combined effort of biologists and oceanographers did discover a possible link between the fluctuations of young eels numbers reaching Europe (known as eel “recruitment”), and the variation of major ocean currents. Under natural conditions, the abundance of eels that arrive in Europe depends on the variation of the North Atlantic currents. So the circulation of water in the eels’ spawning ground play a major role in the number of eels that successfully reach Europe. Using the latest oceanic model developed by GEOMAR and colleagues in Germany, we simulated oceanic currents observed during the 45-year period between 1960 and 2005. Seeding the model with eight million virtual eels, we compared their transatlantic progress predicted by our model with actual eel recruitment data collected since the 1960s. What we discovered was that the model’s predictions of eels reaching Europe matched the real numbers observed over around 20 years. A specific ocean pathway connecting the Sargasso Sea and the Gulf Stream is of vital importance. Our simulations revealed that any disturbance here has a severe impact on the chances of eel larvae successfully arriving in Europe’s continental ecosystems. Interestingly, these connecting currents are weather/wind-driven. This observed link between difficult currents for eels in the Sargasso Sea seemed to match their decline starting in the 1980s, supporting one of the possible theories that the ocean itself contributed to lay behind the collapse of eel recruitment. But after the collapse in stocks during the 1980s the model’s predictions fell out of step with recorded data. It’s possible that this synchronicity ended due to human pressures – overfishing, habitat destruction, barriers such as weirs and flood defences that prevent migration – or invasive parasites that infests the eel’s swim bladder and diseases. These pressures have potentially acted in concert with one another, preventing eel numbers from recovering naturally. Famously, eels are considered to be panmictic, that is, their pattern of mating is completely random, without any structure. But some genetic studies have controversially argued against this. Examining the genetics of the eels, our study suggests that female eels may faithfully return to certain regions of the Sargasso Sea. This could be interpreted as an evolutionary response to the highly variable oceanic environments. Females would return to spawn in locations that have granted them survival through the transatlantic migrations as larvae, to ensure the same success to their offspring. Males on the other hand would show no such interest in particular areas, and roam between female spawning sites. Our findings also raise awareness of re-stocking strategies, where freshwater streams and rivers with depleted or missing eel populations are re-populated with young eels captured where they are abundant. Interestingly a recent study has shown that eels moved in this way still maintain their bearings and migrate in the right direction. Further studies now have to focus on showing that ultimately the fitness of these eels and how well they succeed is also unchanged. In a world increasingly shaped by fast-developing human activities. it is essential to understand species’ evolutionary background and use this to develop suitable conservation measures. Eels are no exception, and the question of how human activities affect the waterways that are so vital to this fascinating species require us to look more closely at eel genetics. The eel genome contains the pages of the book of the species’ evolution and, ultimately, the key to its conservation and future."
"It seems unlikely that James Murdoch’s departure from the News Corporation board will make any difference to the outlook and style of the company’s Australian newspapers or its Sky News pay TV channel. James has been on the outer at the top of the Murdoch organisation since its UK subsidiary, News International, was disgraced in 2011 over the hacking of people’s phones. James was executive chairman of News International at the time.  The scandal not only caused Rupert Murdoch serious reputational damage, but it sank his bid to get total control of Britain’s satellite broadcaster, BSkyB. The parliamentary inquiry into the hacking found him not fit to run a major international company. The fallout marked the end of James’s rise at News. When, in 2007, he had been made chairman of BSkyB, executive chairman of News International, and chief executive of all News Corp operations across Europe and Asia, it seemed he was being groomed to succeed Rupert. But by the middle of 2012 it had all come crashing down. He resigned his jobs at BSkyB and News International, and was recalled to corporate headquarters in New York, retaining his position as CEO for Europe and Asia. Two years later, the elder son, Lachlan, was appointed to sit at the right hand of the father as non-executive co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc. As early as 1998, Murdoch had announced him as the heir-apparent but in 2005 Lachlan had quit, only to now return in triumph over his younger brother. James found himself in the humiliating position of co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, reporting to Fox chief operating officer Chase Carey. Through all these comings and goings of the boys, News Corp’s Australian media outlets carried on their strident climate-change denialism, their barracking for the conservative side of politics, their crude populism and their culture wars, in particular over Australian history. Sky After Dark has become Fox News lite. That tells us that whatever titles and positions are bandied about, Rupert remains in charge. During his career at News Corp, the one major issue on which James publicly differentiated himself from Rupert and Lachlan was climate change. In 2006, a year after the Kyoto protocol took effect, Rupert announced that James had persuaded him that anthropogenic climate change was real. In Australia, this played out at the 2007 federal election in a shift of support to Labor by some of the News Corp media, notably the Australian, Sydney’s Daily Telegraph and the Brisbane Courier-Mail. Labor, under the leadership of Kevin Rudd, campaigned strongly on the need for action on climate change, while the Liberal-National coalition under John Howard equivocated. This shift in editorial outlook did not last long. After the implosion of the Labor government, News Corp threw its weight exuberantly behind Tony Abbott, the man who said climate change science was “crap”. Aside from climate change, James’s public record shows him to share important aspects of his father’s and brother’s worldview. In 2009, he gave the James MacTaggart memorial lecture at the Edinburgh television festival, which commemorates the Scottish writer-director who died in 1974. In it he assailed the BBC in terms similar to those with which the Murdoch media in Australia assails the ABC: that it is a state broadcaster – as opposed to a public broadcaster; that it crowds out commercial media; that it is something public money should not be wasted on, and that it is a mouthpiece of the left. He also argued for a very materialistic concept of press freedom: that the only guarantor of press freedom was profit. This is a perversion of fundamental media ethics. While financial independence is certainly a necessary condition for press freedom, it is only half the story. CP Scott, as editor-proprietor of the [Manchester] Guardian, put the true position best. A newspaper has “a moral as well as a material existence”. It must make enough money to be independent, but it must also recognise it has a civic duty to provide society with reliable and impartial news. The James Murdoch view implies that the freedom guaranteed by profit belongs to the profiteer. News Corporation operates on that principle. Freedom of the Murdoch press is the freedom to publish what the proprietor agrees with. For proof, ask some of Rupert’s former editors: Harold Evans (the Times), Kelvin MacKenzie (the Sun), Bruce Guthrie (the Herald Sun). James might be gone, but the family philosophy lives on. • Dr Denis Muller is a senior research fellow at the Centre for Advancing journalism, University of Melbourne"

Heat waves becoming more prominent in urban areas, research reveals
For past four decades, global warming has been amplified in cities, warns UCLA geographer
From the University of California – Los Angeles
The frequency of heat waves has increased dramatically over the past 40 years, and the trend appears to be growing faster in urban areas than in less-populated areas around the world, a new study suggests.
“Our findings suggest that urban areas are experiencing a kind of double whammy — a combination of general climatic warming combined with the heat island effect, wherein human activities and the built environment trap heat, preventing cities from cooling down as fast as rural areas,” said Dennis Lettenmaier, a co-author of the study and a UCLA geography professor. “Everything’s warming up, but the effect is amplified in urban areas.”
Lettenmaier and his co-authors studied 217 urban areas across the globe and found that prolonged periods of extreme heat increased significantly in 48 percent of them between 1973 and 2012.
The results, which were published today in the journal Environmental Research Letters, show that about only 2 percent of those urban areas experienced a significant decline in heat waves. And the change was more dramatic at night: Almost two-thirds of the urban areas showed significant increases in the frequency of extremely hot nights.
“The fact that the trend was so much stronger at night underscores the role of the heat island effect in urban areas,” Lettenmaier said. “You have heat being stored in buildings and in asphalt, concrete and other building materials, and they don’t cool down as quickly as they would outside of the urban area. This effect was likely exacerbated by decreasing wind in most of the urban areas.”
The study is one of the first to focus solely on the extent of extreme weather in urban areas globally and to examine disparities between densely populated and less-densely populated areas.
Lettenmaier collaborated with researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Northeastern University and the University of Washington. The team obtained daily observations for rain, air temperature and wind speed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The researchers identified about 650 urban areas with populations greater than 250,000 and then refined the list to the 217 locales based on the areas’ proximity to weather stations with complete weather records and NOAA data — most were located at airports close to urban areas. Although the researchers would have liked to have more data for urban areas in Africa, Lettenmaier said the report provides as close as possible to a representative sample of changing weather conditions in the world’s cities.
For each of the locales in the study, the researchers identified extremes for temperature, precipitation and wind, calculated heat and cold waves, and pinpointed individual extremely hot days and nights.
The study defined heat waves as periods in which the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99 percent of days for the four-decade period and in which those temperatures were sustained for a consecutive period of six or more days. (The median length of heat waves was eight days.) It found that the average number of heat waves per year increased by over 50 percent during the period.
Of the five years with the largest number of heat waves, four were the most recent years for which data was available: 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Urban areas in South America experienced the greatest increase in frequency of heat waves, followed in order by those in Africa, Europe, India and North America.
Researchers also found other striking examples of climate change within urban settings. Sixty percent experienced a significant decline in extreme windy days, 17 percent experienced a significant increase in daily precipitation extremes, and 10 percent experienced a significant increase in maximum annual precipitation.
“Urban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area, but over half the world’s populations now live in them, so the trend is troublesome,” said lead author Vimal Mishra, an assistant professor of civil engineering at IIT Gandhinagar. “The combination of higher temperatures and lower wind in particular is not a good combination for human health and well-being. This should concern everyone.”
The increase in precipitation could damage cities’ infrastructure, which could also mean large economic losses, Mishra said.
Using a separate data set of 142 pairs of urban and non-urban areas, the researchers found that the frequency of heat waves grew 56 percent more quickly in urban settings than in surrounding areas that were less populated. Urban areas experienced 60 percent fewer extremely windy days than non-urban areas.
“In urban areas, buildings are disrupting the air flow, which affects not only the immediate area of buildings, but apparently the larger regional wind fields,” Lettenmaier said. “The reduction in wind may well be exacerbating the heat island effect.”

"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s immigration order barring refugees and citizens of seven countries from entering the United States unleashed chaos on the U. S. immigration system, prompting continuing protests and legal action, much of it by lawyers working   at airport arrival halls. A White House official appeared to reverse part of the order, saying that green card holders from the barred countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   would be allowed to enter “going forward. ” Here’s what we know and don’t know about the executive order. And here’s our full coverage of the Trump administration. _____ • Several European leaders rejected the refugee ban in blunt terms, and an array of Christian leaders denounced provisions that would favor Christian immigrants as discriminatory, misguided and inhumane. Even some top Republicans objected. Mr. Trump appeared to have more pleasant exchanges with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who hoped for reassurance that the U. S. would honor the refugee resettlement deal struck with the Obama administration. _____ • Myanmar was shaken by a rare and brazen assassination. The country’s most prominent Muslim lawyer, U Ko Ni, was shot dead at the airport in Yangon, after returning with a government delegation from a trip to Indonesia. He appeared to have been shot while in his family car, while holding his grandchild. A suspect was arrested, but no motive was immediately evident. _____ • As Japan moves to accommodate Emperor Akihito’s wish to give up the throne, many Japanese believe it is also time to clear the way for a woman to reign. It has been nearly 250 years since Japan had an empress. “Like Queen Elizabeth in England, if Princess Aiko becomes the emperor, things may change in society,” a woman in Kanagawa Prefecture said. _____ • And Roger Federer, 35, became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 45 years by defeating his longtime rival, Rafael Nadal, in an epic   final of the Australian Open. It was Federer’s record 18th tournament championship and his first since 2012. The victory came a day after Serena Williams, 35, defeated her sister Venus, 36, for her   23rd Grand Slam singles title, becoming the oldest female Australian Open winner in the current era. • Hong Kong’s monetary office says the city needs as many as 400 million more bank notes in circulation to handle Lunar New Year transactions and lai see distribution, which is valued at $1 billion. • Toshiba’s   from its   investment in a U. S. construction firm focused on nuclear power projects could rise to $4 billion to $7 billion, enough to put the    company’s future at risk. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Three people were killed when a boat carrying 31 people capsized in Sabah, Malaysia.   people, mostly Chinese tourists, have been rescued. [Bernama] • The Philippine government’s free distribution of birth control has pitted President Rodrigo Duterte against the Catholic Church, and not for the first time. [The New York Times] • An American commando was killed in a raid on Qaeda militants in Yemen, the first counterterrorism operation approved by President Trump. [The New York Times] •  North Korea appears to have resumed operation of a reactor used to produce plutonium for its nuclear weapons program, the think tank 38 North said. [Reuters] • The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, weighed in on a contentious issue, saying the U. S. Embassy “needs to be” in Jerusalem. “All embassies should come here,” he said. [The New York Times] • Thousands of Mongolians protested for the second time this winter to demand that the government address choking air pollution in the capital, Ulan Bator. [Associated Press] • Taliban militants are tapping new revenues sources beyond the opium trade, including collecting utility bills, as they take over increasingly large areas of Afghanistan. [The New York Times] • If you made a New Year’s resolution this year, there’s an 80 percent chance you’ve already given it up or you’re just about to. We want to help you stick with it  —   or revamp it into something you really want to achieve  —   so this month Smarter Living will offer tips, advice and motivation to help you. Every Monday in this space we’ll pose a new idea, offer advice for staying strong and ask you a question. Then every Thursday we’ll highlight a few of our favorite emails and offer a helping hand. To join in, email us at smarterliving@nytimes. com with the subject line “My resolution” and send us answers to the following three bullets. And, because this goes both ways, I’ll start us off: • Your name: I’m Tim Herrera, your Smarter Living Editor. • Your resolution and why you chose it (either the one you started with, or the one you really want to achieve): My resolution is to be better with money so I can save more and *gasp* maybe actually retire someday. • Two specific   within your resolution: In February, I’ll order delivery for dinner one fewer night per week, and I’ll stop buying one of my daily afternoon coffees (which I buy solely out of habit, but which cost me around $500 over the course of a year). • An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. •  A song spreading fast online in China offers a bit of relief for those who dashed home for the new year only to face relentless personal questions from their families. • And we review “Behemoth,” a documentary from Zhao Liang that finds horror and surrealism in Inner Mongolia, where migrant iron and coal workers are shown as cogs in China’s economic progress. Bruce Lee, the first superstar of   films, appeared to Western audiences in only five movies and a handful of TV roles before his early death in 1973. But his influence has never really stopped growing, and his legacy can be found in some remarkable places. Take, for example, the video that Tom Brady, the N. F. L. quarterback, recently posted online to motivate his team for the playoffs. It features Lee’s mantra “Be water, my friend. ” Or the impact he had on 1970s reggae music, appearing on album covers, like Lee Perry’s “Kung Fu Meets the Dragon,” and inspiring countless songs and artists, such as Dillinger. David Henry Hwang, the   playwright, devoted an entire play to Lee’s life, and called him the first “  male hero. ” This week, the Museum of Modern Art in New York is screening all five of Lee’s films in a series called “Eternal Bruce Lee. ” He’s been honored in museums from Hong Kong to California, not to mention the Bruce Lee Action Museum in Seattle. Despite all the fanfare, Lee still has an aura of mystery. Did you know he was the 1958   champion of Hong Kong? _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe most recent move by the “Green Mountain” state and the wind power industry is the latest sure sign of desperation and policy bankruptcy. It is designed to stamp out citizens’ democratic right to peacefully protest and organize to oppose.
Now that Vermonters are finally waking up to the fact that the state and the wind power industry are gang raping Vermont’s idyllic landscape and natural heritage for profit and insane ideology, their resistance to wind park projects in Vermont has (finally!) grown to formidable mass – and so much so that the Vermont Attorney General’s Office is now resorting to brute legal intimidation to get the opposition to wind to back down.
This is the sad state of the wind industry in Vermont. Not only does it need junk climate science, massive subsidies and feed-in tariffs to survive, but now it also needs raw legal intimidation by the state itself.
Criminal investigation – just because they oppose
Annette Smith, executive director of the wind energy opposition group “Vermonters for a Clean Environment“, has posted at her Facebook site “Victims of Industrial Wind” that her organization has received a letter from the Vermont Assistant Attorney General, alleging their opposition activities against wind farms involves, get this, the “unauthorized practice of law”. The Victims of Industrial Wind organization is “assisting people and towns in participating in the Public Service Board process“, the site writes.
What follows is a copy of the Assistant Attorney General’s letter:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





As the letter shows, Smith and her anti-wind advocacy organization are under investigation. Citizens actively participating in actions involved in peaceful protest and opposition now requires a license to practice law. This is absurd.
Obviously in Vermont if you want to protest the state, you first have to get a license to do so – from the state! If that is not tyranny, then what is?
Unarmed David vs Goliath
Vermont Digger here writes how Smith is aghast at the state’s aggressive move, characterizing it as “harassment”, “very intimidating” and “politically motivated”. Vermont Digger goes on to describe a legal environment where the state, in partnership with the powerful wind industry, is attempting to bulldoze and crush an opposition that is run on a shoestring and has no legal resources. Vermont Digger writes:
Smith said she represents people who too frequently have nowhere else to turn. Renewable energy developers hire talented attorneys against whom landowners near project sites have no other way of successfully representing themselves.”
The message Vermont is sending is clear: Get of our way, or we’ll squash you. This is a clear abuse of power by the Attorney General’s Office and a grotesque attempt to deny powerless citizens the democratic right to engage in opposition.

I’ve gotten a few complaints this week from some overly paranoid people that say they can’t see WUWT anymore in Firefox, but can in Safari. The problem seems to be related solely to a browser extension called “ghostery” which is somehow flagging Adobe Typekit (used to provide custom fonts on WordPress) as some sort of malware.
I suspect this happened all of the sudden due to some sort of “upgrade” that was automatically installed for Ghostery.
Adobe Typekit is used by thousands upon thousands of websites, it is completely safe. Just look at the list of major websites in the lower right that use it:

Personally, I think the Ghostery browser extension is a complete waste of time, as what it does is handled by other malware and AV programs installed in your computer, but some people insist on using it anyway and bizarrely demand that I change WUWT to accommodate them. Well folks, tough noogies, I can’t, I don’t have any control whatsoever over such things.
However, the end user does, and here is the simple solution to the problem:
Problem:
Ghostery browser extension is blocking Typekit
Solution:
Go to Options > Blocking Options > Trackers > Widgets and uncheck “Typekit by Adobe”.

"**There aren't many in the US who are sure there'll be an election result on the night.**
Due to unprecedented numbers of postal votes, there could be days - possibly weeks - between the end of voting and the declared result.
And in that period of uncertainty there are fears of civil unrest.
Both sides could claim victory, and misinformation about the result could be rife.
The worry is that anger, fake news and hate speech on social media could inflame tensions.
So what is Big Tech planning to do about it?
The nuclear option would be to close down their apps for a period of time.
This is what we know social media companies intend to do to prevent that from happening.
Twitter says after election day candidates will not be permitted to claim they have won the election before a declared result.
Twitter also says candidates can't tweet or retweet content that encourages interference with the election process.
What will it do if that happens? Well, Twitter says it will direct people to resources with accurate, up-to-date information about the election status.
That sounds like Twitter won't take down tweets or even necessarily suppress them. But the tweets will be labelled.
Crucially Twitter gives itself room to manoeuvre if things really kick off - they haven't ruled out going further.
Last month, Nick Clegg told the FT's Hannah Murphy there were some ""break-glass options available to us"" in extreme scenarios.
What are those options? Well Facebook won't say.
But the Wall Street Journal has reported that some of these plans include altering news feed algorithms to suppress viral posts that propagate violence or fake news.
They can also deactivate certain hashtags related to misinformation around the election result.
And they will lower the bar for what they remove.
These would be techniques that Facebook has used in other parts of the world like Sri Lanka and Myanmar.
These are on top of what Facebook is already doing - for example labelling misinformation on voting.
They have also teamed up with Reuters to supply accurate election results on the night and in the days after the election.
Reddit appears to go much further that Facebook or Twitter.
It says information that seeks to mislead or misrepresent the election results is not allowed and would be removed from the site.
Reddit also has an entire page committed to what happens after the election
The site will host a series of ""Ask Me Anything"" events from the day after the election.
Voting experts will be on hand to answer questions about the vote, and what people can expect in the coming days.
Google is working with the Associated Press (AP)â to provide authoritative election results.
So in the days after the election if you searched for ""Who won the election?"" Google search would direct you to AP's updated results.
Google has also said it will pause ads referring to the 2020 election, the candidates or its outcome after election day.
It says it's done this to limit the potential for ads to increase confusion post-election.
YouTube says it will not allow ""misleading claims about voting or content that encourages interference in the democratic process"".
It also says it will remove content falsely claiming that mail-in ballots have been manipulated to change the results of an election.
That too goes further than Twitter and Facebook.
It also says it will enforce pre-existing rules on content that promotes violence.
Snapchat is slightly different to other social media companies here.
It doesn't have a newsfeed as such and the nature of the platform makes it harder for misinformation to go viral.
Even so, Snapchat says it is reminding its ""stars"" whose content appears on its ""Discover"" section not to amplify false information about the election, even unintentionally.
The company has also said it has an internal task-force to ""vigorously protect our platform from being misused in any way"".
TikTok says it is working with independent fact checkers during the election period.
It says it will remove misinformation related to the 2020 election - including the vote itself.
It is also adding an election misinformation option to in-app reporting so that users can flag content.
TikTok said: ""In these momentous times, we're intent on supporting our community as we work to maintain the integrity of our platform.""
In short, all these social media companies are treating the election, and its aftermath, very seriously.
We may know in a few days whether these measures are enough."
"When prolonged periods of severe weather strike, two things often get the blame these days: climate change and the jet stream. Many have expressed concerns that the rapidly melting Arctic is now disturbing the jet stream, bringing more frequent bouts of wild weather. But potentially even more powerful changes are afoot in the tropics – and the consequences could be severe. The northern hemisphere’s jet stream is a current of fast-moving air encircling the globe from west to east in the middle latitudes – the zone between the baking tropics and the freezing Arctic. The strongest winds are about ten kilometres high, near the altitudes at which planes fly, but the bottom of the jet can reach all the way down to the ground, forming the prevailing westerly winds familiar to many. The southern hemisphere’s counterpart is what gives rise to the Roaring Forties – similarly treacherous winds between latitudes 40° and 50°. The jet forms a relatively sharp dividing line between the warm tropical and cold polar air masses. The strongest winds are concentrated in a band several hundred kilometres wide. But this band is not fixed. It meanders and snakes its way around the globe, sometimes touching the edge of the tropics and at other times scraping the polar regions As a result, the jet can have a wide array of impacts across the hemisphere. If it passes over your location, expect to be repeatedly bombarded by the whirling storms that are carried along by it. As a recent example, the severe flooding in the North of England in November 2019 arose in part from a shift of the jet, which put the UK right in the middle of a region where storms tend to grow. If the jet shifts to pass north of you, you’ll find yourself under the warm, dry zone of the atmosphere which lies south of the jet. This brings generally settled and pleasant weather in summer, but can set the scene for droughts and heatwaves. And if the jet moves south instead, you’ll be on its cold polar side, so you’d better hope this doesn’t happen too much during winter. The jet has always varied – and has always affected our weather patterns. But now climate change is affecting our weather too. As I explore in my latest book, it’s when the wanderings of the jet and the hand of climate change add up that we get record-breaking heatwaves, floods and droughts – but not freezes. The coldest weeks of any given winter will occur when the jet brings masses of cold air directly from the polar regions. But severe though this may feel, records show that similar events in past decades were even colder than they are now. While the jet is largely doing the same as it always has, the planet-heating greenhouse gases we’ve added to our atmosphere mean that invasions of polar air these days are just that bit milder. The flip side, of course, is that when the jet moves north in summer, bringing warm air from the south, we often have to endure temperatures beyond anything in living memory. It is clear and well understood how climate change and the jet can combine like this to cause truly extreme weather events. But whether climate change is directly changing the jet’s behaviour is a much harder question to answer. Some have suggested that the rapidly warming Arctic is weakening the jet, by reducing the temperature contrast between the tropical and polar air to either side of it. As a result, the jet meanders more to the north and south, and these meanders can remain fixed over one location for longer – as happened when the “Beast from the East” placed much of Northern Europe under a bitter chill. There are certainly some interesting ideas here, but many still do not find the logic compelling, and more convincing evidence from observations and computer models will be needed for these theories to become widely accepted. Scientists are however increasingly confident that important changes are afoot in the tropics. Driven by the vast quantities of energy pouring in from the Sun directly overhead, these are the great powerhouses of Earth’s climate. Indeed, the power of the tropics is evident in the worldwide weather disruption caused by El Niño events – subtle increases or decreases in temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, that in turn disturb the jet stream. Over the past few years, it has become apparent that at high altitudes, the Earth’s tropical regions are heating up more quickly than the rest of the world. At least partly because of this, the tropical regions of the atmosphere have been widening, expanding ever so slightly away from the equator, and impinging more on the jet stream.  We are in the early days of a great battle in the air above our heads between the Arctic and the tropics, for the future of the jet stream. At best, there might be a stalemate, leaving the jet stream distorted but otherwise unmoved. However, if one of the competitors outweighs the other, regional climate patterns could be severely altered as the climate zones shift along with the jet. It’s too early to say with any confidence which of these will win out, but many computer models predict the jet will shift a little towards the pole, consistent with a greater influence of the tropics.  In this case, we should expect to see the warm, dry regions at the edge of the tropics extend a little further out from the equator. The strongest impacts of this would likely be felt in regions such as the Mediterranean, which are already highly sensitive to fluctuations in rainfall. A northward jet shift would act to steer much needed rainstorms towards central Europe instead, leaving the Mediterranean at greater risk of drought. So, the jet may not become more erratic as the Arctic warms, but it may well change profoundly. And one thing is clear: the stress of increased temperatures and altered rainfall patterns from our destabilising climate will leave us even more vulnerable to the weather patterns brought by the whim of the wandering jet stream.

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
The title question is rarely, if ever, asked of people who are skeptical of human-induced global warming and climate change…for obvious reasons.  If persons are skeptical of a future filled with climate catastrophes, regardless of whether they are caused by nature or by emissions of manmade greenhouse gases, then there should be few reasons for them to be fearful of future climate.
For example: some persons may most fear the future possible rise in sea levels, understanding that surface temperatures are above the threshold at which the seasonal mass losses from glaciers and ice shelves exceed those of seasonal mass gains and that those temperatures have been above that threshold since the end of the last ice age; but they temper that concern with an understanding that even the UN’s political report-writing entity, the IPCC, acknowledges the oceans will continue their inland march regardless of whether or not we limit the emissions of manmade greenhouse gases…that it’s just a matter of time. (See Figure 13.27 on page 68 of 80 of Chapter 13 of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report.  The blue curve is for the “optimistic” RCP2.6 emissions scenario and the red curve is for the worst-case RCP8.5 scenario.)
What scares me?
My fears are that:

activist climate scientists and agenda-driven politicians who fund climate science have tainted all related fields with unjustifiable certainty of a future filled with pain and suffering,
to manufacture those predictions of gloom and doom, the sole focus of climate science has been and continues to be on human-induced, not naturally occurring, global warming and climate change,
the climate science community will come no closer to understanding the natural contributions to global warming and climate change until there is a total change of mindset, and
it will take decades of that completely new mindset to overcome the present groupthink.

With that said, what are your fears about global warming and climate change?

The debate over tariffs has mostly emphasized their impact on economic growth and jobs, which overlooks specific stories of suffering caused by President Donald Trump’s trade war.





These companies have been forced to take cost‐​cutting measures such as laying off employees or forgoing expansion.



Below are more than 200 examples of the damage done by Trump’s tariffs, aggregated with Republicans Fighting Tariffs. The victims and their stories differ, but the catalyst is the same.



Businesses of all sizes have seen their input costs rise because of tariffs. To maintain already slim profit margins, many of these businesses have no choice but to raise prices. Call this the “Trump tax.”



But not all businesses can offset tariff costs through price increases, because their customers are price sensitive and will simply take their business to a foreign competitor. These companies have been forced to take cost‐​cutting measures such as laying off employees or forgoing expansion.



Then there are the countless farmers and exporters who have seen their markets dry up as trading partners impose retaliatory tariffs.



As Bob Woodward’s new book reveals, Trump believes that “trade is bad.” The president has tweeted that “trade wars are good and easy to win.” These businesses, whose numbers will grow exponentially if Trump follows through on new tariff threats, would beg to differ.

"The storms which have battered the UK over recent weeks can be traced back to a strong front of contrasting temperature between particularly cold air over the north Atlantic, which has also brought extreme cold and snow to parts of the US,  and warmer air further south. The strong temperature contrast across the Atlantic leads to storms forming around the front, circulating and mixing air along the temperature gradient, trying to find an equilibrium of hot and cold air. You could think of this as like adding cold water to a hot bath, where at some point the cold water entering from the tap forms a “front” with the hot water, and must be mixed more evenly throughout the bath for a comfortable equilibrium. So a succession of deep Atlantic low pressure systems, steered by a strong high level jet stream in the upper atmosphere, where winds are also driven by strong contrasting temperatures, has brought very wet and windy weather to the UK over the last month. The run of stormy and wet yet mild weather has made this December feel very different to recent winters. In the UK, December 2013 was more than 1.5°C warmer than average, while December 2010 was more than 3.5°C colder than average as the entire country shivered in snow and freezing temperatures. In fact the wet and relatively mild weather arriving from the Atlantic is more typical of British weather. But the depth of the Atlantic lows this winter has been unusual. On Christmas Eve as cyclone Dirk made landfall in Scotland, the the barometric pressure recorded in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis was 936.8 millibar, the lowest recorded anywhere in the UK since 1886. At the University of Reading Met Department Observatory rainfall has also been quite unusual. A whole winter’s worth of rain, 162.3mm, has fallen in just three weeks. Only another 1.1mm of rainfall – which looks likely – would break the record for the wettest consecutive 24-day period at any time of the year, 163.3mm recorded in late October 2000. These very active weather depressions have wrought widespread damage and problems from wind and flooding. Winds have been strong, but not exceptionally so, with gusts of up to 90-100mph on the coast and 70mph inland. But the relentless rain has saturated the ground, and flooding has again been a major issue affecting many parts of the country. Southern and western coasts have also had to cope with inundations from the sea as, swept by the long run of strong winds across the Atlantic, strong sea surges boosted by high spring tides have challenged coastal flood defences. So why has this winter started off so stormy, while other recent winters have been much more calm, and others frozen? Of course, the variability of weather from year to year and month to month is normal for the UK – we all know how changeable our weather can be. Whether the storms hit us or miss us is due to the path of the high level jet stream. But there is an added level of complexity, because the storms themselves influence where the temperature gradient is strongest and the position of the jet stream (meteorologists call this “internal dynamics”). So it’s very hard to predict exactly where the storms will be beyond the next five to ten days. Interestingly, winter storms in the UK tend to arrive in ten or 20-year cycles. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s there were more frequent periods when storms tracked across the UK, bringing mild and wet weather. But during the 1950s and 1960s the opposite was true, with more years when storms missed the UK to the north or south, bringing colder, icier winters. A “stormy phase” doesn’t mean that every winter will be stormy, it just increases the chances. Superimposed on natural weather variations is climate change. It’s clear that over the past century the UK has warmed, as have many other regions. Between 1961-2006, winter temperatures rose on average by more than 1°C. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, providing fuel for heavier rainfall. There’s already evidence of heavier rainfall over the UK and Europe, increasing the risks of flooding. Sea levels are also rising as the oceans warm, and this will also add to coastal flood risk. Storminess itself is harder to predict and forecasts of future changes vary considerably between models. University of Reading scientists have looked at results from the latest suite of climate models and found indications of a slight increase in the number of UK storms, but climate model projections are quite uncertain in this regard. While we don’t know exactly if storms will become more frequent in coming decades, we do know that their impact is likely to become more severe when combined with the effects of a warming world and higher sea levels.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump fired his acting attorney general on Monday night, removing her as the nation’s top law enforcement officer after she defiantly refused to defend his executive order closing the nation’s borders to refugees and people from predominantly Muslim countries. In an escalating crisis for his    administration, the president declared in a statement that Sally Q. Yates, who had served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama, had betrayed the administration by announcing that Justice Department lawyers would not defend Mr. Trump’s order against legal challenges. The president replaced Ms. Yates with Dana J. Boente, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying that he would serve as attorney general until Congress acts to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. In his first act in his new role, Mr. Boente announced that he was rescinding Ms. Yates’s order. Monday’s events have transformed the confirmation of Mr. Sessions into a referendum on Mr. Trump’s immigration order. Action in the Senate could come as early as Tuesday. Ms. Yates’s order was a remarkable rebuke by a government official to a sitting president, and it recalled the   Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case. Mr. Boente was sworn in at 9 p. m. according to White House officials, who did not provide details about who performed the ceremony. In a statement, Mr. Boente pledged to “defend and enforce the laws of our country. ” At 9:15 p. m. Ms. Yates received a   letter at the Justice Department that informed her that she was fired. Signed by John DeStefano, one of Mr. Trump’s White House aides, the letter informed Ms. Yates that “the president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States. ” Two minutes later, the White House officials lashed out at Ms. Yates in a statement issued by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. “Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,” the statement said. The firing of Ms. Yates came at the end of a turbulent three days that began on Friday with Mr. Trump’s signing of his executive order. The action stranded travelers around the world, led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy. Ms. Yates, like other senior government officials, was caught by surprise by the executive order and agonized over the weekend about how to respond, two Justice Department officials involved in the weekend deliberations said. Ms. Yates considered resigning but she told colleagues she did not want to leave it to her successor to face the same dilemma. By Monday afternoon, Ms. Yates added to a deepening sense of anxiety in the nation’s capital by publicly confronting the president with a stinging challenge to his authority, laying bare a deep divide at the Justice Department, within the diplomatic corps and elsewhere in the government over the wisdom of his order. “At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,” Ms. Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers. Mr. Trump’s senior aides huddled together in the West Wing to determine what to do. They decided quickly that her insubordination could not stand, according to an administration official familiar with the deliberations. Among the chief concerns was whether Mr. Sessions could be confirmed quickly by the Senate. After Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, received reassurances from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, that the confirmation was on track, aides took their recommendation to Mr. Trump in the White House residence. The president decided quickly: She has to go, he told them. The official statement from Mr. Spicer accused Ms. Yates of failing to fulfill her duty to defend a “legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States” that had been approved by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. “It is time to get serious about protecting our country,” Mr. Spicer said in the statement. He accused Democrats of holding up the confirmation of Mr. Sessions for political reasons. “Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. ” Former Justice Department officials said the president’s action would send a deep shudder through an agency that was already on edge as officials anticipated an ideological overhaul once Mr. Sessions takes over. One former senior official said that department lawyers would be unnerved by the firing. Democrats, meanwhile, hailed Ms. Yates as a principled defender of what she thought was right. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that the “attorney general should be loyal and pledge fidelity to the law, not the White House. The fact that this administration doesn’t understand that is chilling. ” Mr. Boente has told the White House that he is willing to sign off on Mr. Trump’s executive order on refugees and immigration, according to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the United States attorney’s office in Alexandria, Va. where Mr. Boente has served as the top prosecutor since 2015. Mr. Boente, who has been a prosecutor with the Justice Department for 31 years, had no hesitation about accepting the acting attorney general’s job given his “seniority and loyalty” to the department, Mr. Stueve said in a telephone interview on Monday night. As acting attorney general, Ms. Yates was the only person at the Justice Department authorized to sign applications for foreign surveillance warrants. Administrations of both parties have interpreted surveillance laws as requiring foreign surveillance warrants be signed only by   Justice Department officials. Mr. Boente was   as United States attorney and, though the situation is unprecedented, the White House said he was authorized to sign the warrants. Ms. Yates’s decision had effectively overruled a finding by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which had already approved the executive order “with respect to form and legality. ” Ms. Yates said her determination in deciding not to defend the order was broader, however, and included questions not only about the order’s lawfulness, but also whether it was a “wise or just” policy. She also alluded to unspecified statements the White House had made before signing the order, which she factored into her review. Mr. Trump initially responded to the letter with a post on Twitter at 7:45 p. m. complaining that the Senate’s delay in confirming his cabinet nominees had resulted in leaving Ms. Yates in place. The 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre” led to a constitutional crisis that ended when Robert H. Bork, the solicitor general, acceded to Mr. Nixon’s order and fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor. Ms. Yates, a career prosecutor, is different because she is a holdover from the Obama administration. She agreed to Mr. Trump’s request to stay on as acting attorney general until Mr. Sessions is confirmed to be attorney general."

My name is Andrew Grossman. I am an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute and a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Baker & Hostetler LLP. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing those of the Cato Institute, my law firm, or its clients.



This Task Force’s work is both important and urgent. It is important because the actions of the Obama Administration, especially in President Barack Obama’s second term, threaten to permanently upend our constitutional separation of powers by arrogating to the Executive Branch powers that had previously been reserved to the Legislative Branch and subject to check by the Judicial Branch. Although apologists for this Administration can rightly claim that its aggressive use of executive power has continued trends in executive unilateralism that began in previous administrations, unwilling to engage a Congress wary of its policy priorities, it has pushed more forcefully to expand the limits of executive action beyond those recognized by its predecessors. And that, in turn, is why the issue of executive overreaching is so urgent. We simply do not know whether this President’s actions have established a new status quo, one that will be impossible for future presidents—no matter their political affiliation—to abandon in favor of the old understandings and arrangements. Indeed, we do not know whether future presidents will consider the Obama Administration’s executive actions to be a baseline for further, even more aggressive actions that depart still further from our constitutional separation of powers.



Interest in the issue of executive overreaching is not confined to the legal profession and the policy community. The use, abuse, and limits of executive power have been overriding issues of public concern in the current and previous administration. Many members of the public, as well as members of this body, question the legitimacy of numerous actions taken by the current administration, from circumventing Congress to “enact” immigration reform, to circumventing Congress to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and ban new coal‐​fired power plants, to circumventing Congress to repeal the work requirements that were the centerpiece of 1996’s welfare reform, to circumventing Congress to “rewrite” problematic provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.



Inevitably, reaction to individual examples of overreaching is colored by politics, with the President’s supporters often willing to suspend their wariness of executive unilateralism when it is deployed to achieve policy goals that they favor and his detractors sometimes quick to pounce on perceived abuses that do not always pan out. But that understandable division should not obscure the fact that the Obama Administration has launched us into a new era of executive administration by seizing the prerogative to make the kind of decisions of enormous economic, social, and practical significance that had heretofore been made by Congress—particularly in the area of domestic policy. The current President’s supporters should understand, no less than those who disagree with his policy agenda, that that placing so much power in the executive carries great risks, risks that ultimately outweigh the policy results that they now celebrate. How many of those who approve the unilateral actions of the Obama Administration would be content to see those same powers, or even greater ones premised on Obama‐​era precedents, exercised by an administration helmed by a President Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, or Bernard Sanders?



What’s really at stake here are not fleeting political victories, but the rights and liberties of all Americans. The Constitution provides for separation of powers to protect individual liberty1 and for checks and balances to confine each branch of government to its proper place and thereby enforce the separation of powers. Departing from the Constitution’s structure because doing so may be convenient in some mundane political dispute jeopardizes Americans’ political freedoms and individual liberties over the long term.



Congress is not powerless to reverse this trend, and it can and should work to assert and reclaim its place in the constitutional order. That will not be easy. It will require the fortitude to wield the power of the purse against executive prerogative and to conduct intensive and forceful oversight. It will also require thoughtful legislation to address the pathologies of our current arrangements that the current Administration has exploited so skillfully. And it will require rethinking the ways that Congress has—sometimes intentionally, sometimes inadvertently—facilitated executive overreaching through delegations of broad discretion.



Although there is little prospect that any substantial regulatory reforms will become law in this Congress—why would the President sign a bill abolishing techniques that have proven so useful to his Administration?—now is the time to lay the intellectual and political groundwork for an aggressive firstone‐​hundred‐​days regulatory reform agenda for the next administration. It is in that spirit that this testimony analyzes several instances of executive overreaching by the current Administration, identifies the means by which that overreaching was achieved, and then presents several modest proposals for reform to prevent future abuses and shore up the separation of powers.



 **I. Waiving Welfare Reform’s Work Requirements**



The centerpiece of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 was Section 407, which is entitled “Mandatory Work Requirements” and sets out an absolute requirement that state welfare programs achieve specific work‐​participation rates or forfeit federal funding. 



In a 2012 “Information Memorandum” to states, the Obama Administration Department of Health and Human Services encouraged states to submit proposals for state welfare programs that do not comply with Section 407’s work requirements, asserting that HHS has the authority to waive compliance with that provision. This episode reflects several themes in executive overreaching: circumvention of Congress to achieve policy goals, aggressive statutory interpretation to increase executive discretion, abuse of waiver authority, and reliance on lack of standing to avoid potential legal challenges.



**A. The 1996 Act Established “Mandatory Work Requirements”**



The 1996 Act replaced the failed Aid for Families with Dependent Children program, which perversely encouraged dependency on government by offering states additional federal funding as their welfare rolls grew. The new program, Targeted Aid for Needy Families (TANF), offered block grants to states with programs that met certain conditions. Foremost among these conditions were that states require able‐​bodied welfare recipients to engage in “work activities” and that each state achieve specified work‐​participation rates for welfare recipients.



Section 407 lays out these requirements in clear, imperative language. The statute contains two tables specifying minimum work‐​participation rates, one for all families receiving assistance and one for two‐​parent families receiving assistance.2 A state receiving TANF funding “shall achieve the minimum participation rate” specified in each table for each applicable year.3 For 2002 and thereafter, the applicable participation rates are 50 percent for all families and 90 percent for two‐​parent families.4 To prevent gaming, the statute even contains a provision specifying the precise method of calculating participation rates.5



The work requirements for welfare recipients are equally clear and equally mandatory. The statute provides that, “if an individual in a family receiving assistance…refuses to engage in work…, the State shall” either “reduce the amount of assistance” to that family on at least a pro rata basis or simply “terminate such assistance.”6 States can decline to impose a penalty for violations only in three circumstances: for “good cause,” for exceptions established by the state and approved by HHS, and for a single parent where childcare is otherwise completely unavailable.7 Such exceptions are not counted, however, in calculating states’ work‐​participation rates.8



It is apparent on the face of Section 407 that Congress was concerned that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which administers TANF, or states would attempt to evade the law’s strict work requirements. To prevent backsliding, it legislated in great detail, defining terms with specificity and setting hard caps on exemptions. For example, rather than leave the matter to administrative discretion, Section 407 enumerates 12 “work activities”—including subsidized and unsubsidized employment, onthe‐​job training, and vocational training—that satisfy the state and individual work requirements.9 It specified the number of hours per week that family members would be required to work to be considered “participating in work activities.”10 It put a hard cap of 30 percent on the proportion of a state’s welfare recipients who could participate in educational activities and still be counted as engaged in work.11 Finally, the law requires HHS to oversee and verify states’ compliance with all work requirements.12



In addition to the penalties for individuals refusing to work, the 1996 Act established penalties for states that did not comply with Section 407. States that failed to cut off or reduce assistance to such individuals would lose between 1 and 5 percent of their TANF funding in the subsequent year, amounting to millions of dollars.13 And states that failed to meet the minimum workparticipation rates specified in Section 407 would lose 5 percent of their federal funding in the subsequent year, increased by 2 percentage points for each year of non‐​compliance, up to 21 percent.14 In this way, Congress gave the work requirements real teeth.



 **B. The Obama Administration Asserts Authority To Waive Work Requirements**



On July 12, 2012, HHS issued an “Information Memorandum” to state welfare plan administrators regarding “waiver and expenditure authority un‐​der Section 1115.”15 Despite the prosaic title, the memorandum signaled a major shift in policy for HHS regarding the mandatory nature of the work requirements contained in Section 407.



HHS, the memorandum explained, “is encouraging states to consider new, more effective ways to meet the goals of TANF, particularly helping parents successfully to prepare for, find, and retain employment.”16 To achieve these goals, the memorandum announced that HHS would accept applications for waivers from TANF requirements “to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.” Specifically, “to improve employment outcomes,” HHS would exercise its Section 1115 waiver authority to “waive compliance” with Section 407 and authorize states to adopt different “definitions of work activities and engagement, specified limitations, verification procedures, and the calculation of participation rates.”17 The memorandum contained a single paragraph of legal analysis supporting HHS’s novel contention that it could waive any aspect of Section 407:



Section 1115 authorizes waivers concerning section 402.… While the TANF work participation requirements are contained in section 407, section 402(a)(1)(A)(iii) requires that the state plan “[e]nsure that parents and caretakers receiving assistance under the program engage in work activities in accordance with section 407.” Thus, HHS has authority to waive compliance with this 402 requirement and authorize a state to test approaches and methods other than those set forth in section 407, including definitions of work activities and engagement, specified limitations, verification procedures, and the calculation of participation rates.18



That same day, Representative Dave Camp and Senator Orrin Hatch sent a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting that she provide “a detailed explanation of your Department’s legal reasoning” underlying its assertion of authority to waive Section 407’s requirements.19



The Secretary responded a week later with a three‐​page letter explaining that “Republican and Democratic Governors have requested more flexibility in welfare reform” and, in particular, that governors of both parties had supported legislation in 2005 to broaden waiver authority.20



Accompanying Secretary Sebelius’s letter was a one‐​page attachment setting forth the Administration’s “Legal Basis for Utilizing Waiver Authority in TANF.” This document recapitulates the legal basis offered in HHS’s earlier Information Memorandum—i.e., that because Section 1115 authorizes waiver of requirements in Section 402, and because Section 402 mentions Section 407, Section 1115 authorizes HHS to waive Section 407.21



HHS, the Secretary’s letter further explains, “has long interpreted its authority to wave state plan requirements under Section 1115 to extend to requirements set forth in other statutory provisions that are referenced in the provisions governing state plans.” As an example, it mentions Wisconsin’s “Work Not Welfare” program, which included a waiver of rules related to the distribution of child support contained in Section 454, despite that Section 1115 only references the child support state plan provisions of Section 457 (which, in turn, references Section 454). Even if there were doubt as to this authority, the document continues, Congress has ratified HHS’s more expansive interpretation by declining to amend the statute.22



Finally, the document dismisses the argument that a separate provision, Section 415, precludes HHS from waiving Section 407’s work requirements, on the basis that this limitation applied only to the “former AFDC program” and “does nothing to restrict the Secretary’s waiver authority with respect to the current TANF program.”23



 **C. Legal Analysis: An Overreach**



By its own terms, Section 407 establishes a set of obligations on states accepting TANF funding from the federal government. It expressly conditions their entitlement to funds on satisfying specified “work requirements.” It contains no exception to its reach and no provision giving the Secretary of HHS authority to relax or waive its requirements. There can be no question but that, by default, it applies to all states accepting TANF funding. HHS does not dispute this point, nor could it.



The questions that HHS’s actions raise, however, are (1) whether the Secretary possesses authority, from some other statutory source, to excuse states accepting TANF funding from full compliance with Section 407’s requirements and (2) if so, whether that authority is limited by any other provision. As to the first question, HHS points to Section 1115’s waiver authority, but as is discussed below, that provision cannot be read to reach Section 407. As to the second, even if Section 1115 could be interpreted, standing alone, to authorize the waiver of Section 407’s requirements, that interpretation would ultimately have to be rejected in light of the more specific language of Section 415, which precludes the waiver of work requirements and confirms Congress’s intention that Section 407’s work requirements not be subject to waiver.



 **1\. Section 1115 Waiver Authority**



HHS argues that Section 1115 authorizes it to waive Section 407’s work requirements. It does not.



Section 1115 provides, in relevant part:



In the case of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of [various human welfare programs], in a State or States—(1) the Secretary may waive compliance with any of the requirements of section 302, 602, 654, 1202, 1352, 1382, or 1396a of this title, as the case may be, to the extent and for the period he finds necessary to enable such State or States to carry out such project[.]24



(Because it refers to U.S. Code provisions, rather than the organic statute, its reference to Section 602 corresponds to Section 402 of the Social Security Act.)



Section 402, in turn, defines what it means to be an “eligible state,” i.e., one that is eligible to receive a TANF block grant.25 In particular, it requires a state to “submit[] to the Secretary a plan,” in the form of a “written document that outlines how the State intends to” carry out various requirements for federal funding.26 Among other things, a state must outline how it intends to “[e]nsure that parents and caretakers receiving assistance under the program engage in work activities in accordance with section [407].”27



This provision, HHS argues, allows it to waive Section 407’s work requirements. But that contention must be rejected on three grounds.



The first, and simplest, is the negative‐​implication canon, or _expressio unius est exclusio alterius_ (the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others). Section 1115 lists seven provisions the requirements of which the Secretary may waive. Section 407 is not among them. Ergo, the Secretary has no authority to waive its requirements. The enumeration of statutory provisions subject to waiver manifests congressional intent to limit the Secretary’s discretion, not to allow her free reign over the entirety of Title 42.28



Second is the precise language and structure of Sections 402 and 407. Section 407 establishes freestanding requirements for state programs receiving TANF funding and does not depend on Section 402 for its effectiveness. Its text contains commands for states participating in TANF: they “shall achieve the minimum participation rate” and “shall reduce the amount of assistance otherwise payable” to a family whose members refuse to work.29 These provisions establish independent obligations on states participating in TANF and are effective irrespective of any requirement of Section 402. In other words, even had Section 402 omitted any reference to Section 407, they would still continue in force; a state would merely be relieved from “outlin[ing]” in a “written document … how the State intends to satisfy” any portion of Section 402.



This interpretation is confirmed by Section 402’s limited reference to Section 407’s requirements. As described above, Section 407 imposes two separate types of requirements for states: (1) that they attain certain “minimum participation rate[s]” and (2) that they impose penalties on any recipient of assistance (with certain exceptions) who “refuses to engage in work.”30 But Section 402 only refers to the latter requirement; it does not so much as mention the minimum participation requirements. Accordingly, those requirements cannot possibly be among the “requirement[s] of section [402]” that Section 1115 authorizes the Secretary to waive. And there is no basis in the text of Section 407 to distinguish between the two types of work requirements; both are specified in the same imperative language, as freestanding commands on participating states.31



Third is the distinction between Section 402, which is concerned with states’ discretion in carrying out their TANF programs, and other provisions (including Section 407) intended to deprive them of any discretion. Section 402 lays out the minimum contents for a state plan that is “eligible” for funding, requires that the plan be submitted in a “written document,” and requires the state to certify that it will carry out the provisions of the written plan.32 This mechanism allows the states discretion as to how they structure and operate their TANF programs, within the parameters allowed by the statute. That discretion may be broadened by Section 1115 waivers that relax Section 402 requirements.



But the statutory structure reflects that Congress did not intend to give the states such broad discretion with respect to all aspects of their programs and, in particular, with respect to work requirements. This is why minimum work‐​participation requirements are nowhere mentioned in Section 402; Section 407 affords states zero discretion as to whether they will meet these requirements, such that there is no reason for the states to “outline” their preferred policy choices. They have no choice, other than declining to seek TANF funds.33 Conversely, because states have some discretion as to how they intend to implement the individual work requirements for welfare recipients, they are required to outline how they intend to exercise that discretion.34 There is no basis in Section 402 to conclude, however, that their failure to do so—for example, if the outlining requirement is waived—somehow absolves them from carrying out the individual work requirements altogether.



To the contrary, Congress carefully and deliberately distinguished between areas where the states would have some discretion (and where waivers might be appropriate) and those where they would not (and waivers would be unavailable). This is apparent in comparing the broad and discretionconferring language of Section 402 with the absolute commands of Section 408, which specifies non‐​waivable “prohibitions” and “requirements,” and of Section 409, which specifies in comprehensive fashion penalties for states’ violation of TANF requirements. Section 408 contains a number of bedrock requirements for all state TANF programs, such as prohibiting assistance to families without minor children.35 Although containing three separate penalties for violations of Section 407’s work requirements, Section 409 does not impose penalties for any “requirement” of Section 402.36 Instead, it establishes a number of additional requirements for state TANF programs. As a result, states are not penalized for legitimate exercise of their discretion under Section 402, but they are for violations of the requirements of Sections 407, 408, and 409.



The history of Section 402 also shows that Congress intended this distinction. Prior to the 1996 Act, Section 402 contained all requirements for state welfare programs, while providing the states substantially less flexibility in the structure and operation of their programs. It opened with the command that “[a] State plan for aid and services to needy families with children must …” and proceeded through the subsequent nine pages of the official U.S. Code to enumerate in excruciating detail every requirement for state programs, all of them mandatory.37 Accordingly, Section 1115 (which did then, as now, apply to Section 402) permitted the Secretary to waive any requirement whatsoever respecting states’ welfare programs.



TANF, however, scrapped the prior approach, replacing the specific strictures of Section 402 with general requirements that afforded states substantial flexibility in the design of their programs, over which the Secretary retained waiver authority to provide still‐​further flexibility.38 But where Congress sought to preclude state flexibility, as with work requirements, it used mandatory language and placed those requirements in separate provisions not subject to Section 1115.



This also cuts against the Administration’s argument that Congress ratified HHS’s broad assertions of waiver authority; to the contrary, Congress acted to pick and choose to which requirements it would apply. The Administration’s interpretation, however, would render the distinctions drawn by Congress in the text and structure of the 1996 Act entirely ineffective, as if it had merely amended Section 402 and left it at that. Of course, Congress did no such thing, and a court would not so casually deprive amendments made by Congress of any meaning.39 Indeed, when a previous Secretary raised a similar argument concerning his Section 1115 authority, the court rejected it in favor of “[t]he plain language of the statute.”40 There is little doubt that a court would view things the same way in this instance, perhaps even without wading into the intricacies of the TANF program.



 **2\. Section 415’s Limitation on the Secretary’s Waiver Authority**



That the Secretary lacks authority to waive Section 407’s work requirements is confirmed by another provision of the 1996 Act, Section 415, which provides additional limitations on the Secretary’s waiver power with respect to work requirements.



Section 415(a) sets out rules governing the treatment of waivers in place at the time the 1996 Act came into effect and those “granted subsequently.” For waivers already in effect, states may continue to receive funding without complying with the Act’s new requirements, although only until the expiration of the waiver, without regard to any extensions.41 Similarly, for waivers submitted and approved between the date of the Act’s passage (August 22, 1996) and its effectiveness (July 1, 1997), states may continue to receive funding without complying with the Act’s new requirements, so long as the waiver does not increase federal costs.42 But a third provision states that, notwithstanding the exception for plans submitted and approved during the interim period, “a waiver granted under section [1115] or otherwise which relates to the provision of assistance under a State program funded under this part (as in effect on September 30, 1996) shall not affect the applicability of section [407] to the State.”43



The Administration argues that this third provision “has no application” to present‐​day waivers “because it is a transitional provision applicable only to waivers under the former AFDC program.…”44 But there is some ambiguity in the language of the statute. It can be ready broadly to preclude any “waiver granted under section [1115]” from waving Section 407’s work requirements. Or it can be read more narrowly, to apply only to “a waiver granted under section [1115]…which relates to the provision of assistance under a State program funded under this part (as in effect on September 30, 1996).” While the Administration may have the better argument on this point—in light of the placement of this provision in a subsection regarding “continuation of waivers” and its parallel placement with the interim‐​waiver provision—its interpretation is not inevitable. (Also, for what little it may be worth, the legislative history says nothing on this point, one way or the other.)



But the Administration’s interpretation, even if correct, is fatal to its position regarding Section 1115 authority. It concedes, as it must, that Congress allowed states obtaining interim‐​period waivers to ignore every single new requirement of the 1996 Act _except for the work requirements contained in Section 407_ , which they were required to implement immediately upon their becoming effective. This confirms the absurdity of the Administration’s central claim that those same states could, under subsequent waivers granted after the 1996 Act went into effect, abandon those same work requirements that Congress specifically required they implement even under interim‐​period waiver plans. It makes no sense to suggest that Congress was so concerned about ensuring that the work requirements were not waived that it inserted a stop‐​gap provision to prevent waiver during the interim period following the passage but then authorized HHS to waive those requirements at will at any time thereafter. 



The absurdity of this argument demonstrates its fallacy: if the Administration’s interpretation of Section 415 is correct, then its interpretation of Section 1115 to allow it to waive work requirements is surely wrong.



 **D. The Aftermath**



HHS’s 2012 guidance attracted considerable attention and criticism, particularly from Members of Congress. It may be that the resulting controversy doomed this particular attempt to circumvent the law: given the popularity with the public of the 1996 Act’s work requirements, perhaps state officials were unwilling to bear the political cost—including intensive oversight by their own legislatures and by Congress—of seeking to waive them. So far as I am aware, no states ultimately took advantage of HHS’s invitation to dispense entirely, or even substantially, with Section 407 compliance. But the episode is, nonetheless, instructive for several reasons.



First, the guidance was a blatant attempt to circumvent Congress to achieve the policy goals of the Administration and its allies, who have long opposed the 1996 Act’s work requirements. Shortly before the guidance was announced, the President stated, “We’re going to look every single day to figure out what we can do without Congress.”45 In this instance, the Administration never even attempted to work with Congress to change the law, perhaps recognizing that any such effort would most likely be futile or even backfire by drawing greater attention to an attempt to strike or water down a popular measure. So the Administration determined to go it alone.



Second, to do that, it relied on one of the Administration’s most useful tools, aggressive interpretation of statutory authority, typically to increase executive discretion. As described above, the Administration appears not to have devoted all that much attention to the legal basis of its 2012 guidance, instead contriving a superficially plausible rationale and going no further. While in other instances the Administration has employed interpretative gymnastics to reach preferred policy results, here it settled for much less.



Third, and related, the 2012 guidance took advantage of a limited waiver provision. The Administration has used waiver provisions—often intended for special circumstances, emergencies, or (in the case of “cooperative federalism” programs) facilitating state experimentation in particular areas—to expand its policy discretion across the board. Waiver authority in programmatic areas can rarely be challenged in court and often—even if intended for narrow circumstances—can be employed to override the most detailed statutory provisions that Congress put care and thought into crafting. The implicit understanding that waiver authority might be intended only for unusual or emergency circumstances, with general provisions to otherwise govern, is not one that is necessarily enforceable and not one that this Administration has felt compelled to observe. It has also recognized that waiver authority can be used to effectively “enact” new programs, by waiving onerous statutory requirements for parties who agree to carry out policies not mentioned in the statute but favored by officials. In this way, even the most narrowly conceived waiver provisions can become open‐​ends grants of executive authority unless they are subject to clear statutory limitations.



Fourth, the Administration felt no need to drill down on its statutory interpretation, or to take seriously limitations on its waiver authority, because it did not expect to have to justify its legal position in court. The Supreme Court has interpreted Article III’s “case” or “controversy” requirement to require a plaintiff to demonstrate “standing”—in short, that it (1) has suffered, or will imminently suffer, a concrete injury (2) caused by the conduct challenged (3) that can be redressed by a favorable decision.46 The 2012 guidance was probably viewed by the Administration as immune from judicial review, because it was just guidance (which is not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act47) and because any action under it would not result in conferring standing on any plaintiff. Under the guidance, a state would approach HHS with a proposed program, and HHS in turn would waive statutory re‐​quirements in approving that program. No particular party48 would be injured, and so no one could bring suit. Unsurprisingly, a number of the Obama Administration’s most controversial assertions of executive authority have been in circumstances where the Administration anticipated that judicial review would be unavailable due to standing limitations.



In sum, the Administration’s 2012 attempt to waive the 1996 Act’s work requirements may be most notable as an exemplar of how executive overreach works: stretching statutory authority, and evading judicial review, so as to avoid having to win congressional approval. That it was ultimately unsuccessful reflects the fact that the President, acting unilaterally, is still constrained by reality—much as even the Administration’s most heroic overreaching has been insufficient to drive up enrollment in PPACA insurance plans.



 **II. EPA’s “Tailoring Rule”**



In 2014, the Supreme Court struck down, in part, an Obama Administration EPA regulation purporting to “tailor” numerical thresholds in the Clean Air Act by reading them to be entirely different numbers, so that the agency could impose regulation on a larger set of facilities than it otherwise would be able to.49 The episode is a clear example of attempting to rewrite a statute to achieve particular policy goals, in reliance on both judicial deference canons and standing‐​based defenses to evade judicial review—a strategy that, in the end, failed for the Administration.



In 2009 and 2010, the Obama Administration EPA released the federal government’s first round of regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The “Endangerment Finding” announced EPA’s determination that greenhouse‐​gas emissions by motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare by fostering climate change.50 The “Triggering Rule” announced that the effectiveness of standards for motor‐​vehicle greenhousegas emissions would trigger permitting requirements for stationary sources (e.g., factories, power plants, etc.), as well, under certain Clean Air Act programs.51 One of those programs, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), makes it unlawful to construct a “major emitting facility” without first obtaining a permit, which in turn requires that the facility employ the “best available control technology” for emissions of regulated pollutants.52 A “major emitting facility” is defined by the statute to be any stationary source with the potential to emit 250 tons per year of “any air pollutant” (or 100 tons per year for certain types of sources).53



EPA’s “Tailoring Rule” addressed those statutory thresholds. EPA explained that the PSD program was meant to regulate only “a relatively small number of large industrial sources,” but that applying the statutory thresholds would require thousands of sources to obtain permits, due to the large amounts (much larger than other regulated emissions) in which greenhouse gases are typically emitted. That, the agency said, would make PSD both unadministrable and “unrecognizable to the Congress that designed” it. Rather than read the statute not to regulate greenhouse‐​gas emissions as regulated “pollutants”—a capacious term arguably subject to some agency interpretative discretion—the agency acted to “tailor” the PSD threshold, requiring sources emitting 100,000 tons per year of carbon‐​dioxide (or its equivalent) to obtain a permit, while leaving open the possibility that it might reduce the threshold in the future.54



In other words, EPA rewrote the statutory language “two hundred and fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant” as “10,000 tons per year of carbon‐​dioxide.” It then argued that, because this rewrite alleviated burdens on sources that would otherwise be regulated, no one was injured by it such that a party would have standing to challenge it.55 The D.C. Circuit bought that argument.56



Not a single justice on the Supreme Court did. Instead, the Court addressed the merits and held that the statute could not be read to trigger PSD requirements based greenhouse‐​gas emissions. The majority, in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, rejected EPA’s call for deference to its statutory interpretation under the standard set forth in _Chevron_ _U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc._ 57 The Court agreed with EPA that “that requiring permits for sources based solely on their emission of greenhouse gases at the 100– and 250–tons–per–year levels set forth in the statute would be ‘incompatible’ with ‘the substance of Congress’ regulatory scheme.’”58 But, unlike EPA, it concluded that “[a]n agency has no power to ‘tailor’ legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous statutory terms.”59 While an agency may have interpretative discretion in areas of statutory ambiguity, “[i]t is hard to imagine a statutory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical thresholds at which the Act requires PSD…permitting.”60 Agencies, it concluded, “are not free to adopt…unreasonable interpretations of statutory provisions and then edit other statutory provisions to mitigate the unreasonableness.”61 Allowing them to do so “would deal a severe blow to the Constitution’s separation of powers.”62



EPA’s power‐​grab, the Court recognized, was basically unprecedented:



In the Tailoring Rule, EPA asserts newfound authority to regulate millions of small sources—including retail stores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches— and to decide, on an ongoing basis and without regard for the thresholds prescribed by Congress, how many of those sources to regulate. We are not willing to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as EPA embarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery. We reaffirm the core administrative‐​law principle that an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.63



But, as will be seen below, neither the agency nor the Administration were chastened.



This episode again reflects an attempt to circumvent Congress in achieving policy priorities—here, imposing limitations on new sources of greenhouse gases that could remain in operation for years. EPA adopted an interpretation of broad language in the Clean Air Act that was at odds with more specific provisions of the statutory text, and deployed a number of openended legal theories—including the need to ensure its own “administrative convenience”—as grounds to expand its discretion. It also relied heavily on judicial deference canons, as well as standing doctrine to evade review entirely of its most suspect statutory interpretations. These are all recurring motifs in the annals of executive overreach.



 **III. EPA’s “Utility MACT” RuleZ**



EPA’s “Utility MACT” Rule, also known as the “Mercury and Air Toxic Standards” (“MATS”) Rule, was an instance where the Administration was able to shield a legally vulnerable regulation from effective challenge, allowing it to impose tens of billions of dollars in costs and force the premature retirement of a number of power plants despite that its rule was ultimately held unlawful.



At issue was the application of the Clean Air Act’s hazardous air pollutants program, contained in Section 112 of the Act, to power plants. The Section 112 program targets stationary‐​source emissions of a number of listed hazardous air pollutants.64 The program’s focus is on categories of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, industrial process cooling towers, etc.) that emit those pollutants. EPA is required to “list” all categories of sources that emit hazardous air pollutants and then issue emissions standards for each listed category.65 Unlike other pollution‐​control programs, Section 112 provides little discretion in setting minimum standards for “major sources”—those emitting or with the potential to emit more than 10 tons of a single pollutant or more than 25 tons of a combination of pollutants per year.66 In general, under the “maximum achievable control technology” standard, major sources are subject to a “floor” based on “the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources.”67 EPA then may in some circumstances go “beyond the floor”—that is, make them even more stringent—based on cost considerations and other factors.68 But the general idea of Section 112 and MACT is that every major source—no matter its age or unique characteristics—is required to minimize emissions of hazardous air pollutants to the same extent as the very best performing sources in the same category.69



When Congress created the current Section 112 program in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, it required EPA to identify, list, and regulate nearly all categories of sources emitting hazardous air pollutants but made an exception for fossil fuel‐​fired power plants. Recognizing that other provisions of the Amendments would directly lead to significant reductions in power plants’ emissions of hazardous air pollutants through market‐​based measures and could therefore render Section 112 regulation unnecessary, it directed EPA to study power‐​plant emissions and review “alternative control strategies.”70 It then directed EPA to regulate power plants under Section 112 only if it “finds such regulation is _appropriate and necessary_ after considering the results of the study.”71



Pursuant to a consent decree, EPA proposed MACT standards for power plants in May 2011 and published a final rule in February 2012.72 The final rule’s preamble features a dense 54‐​page discussion of the basis for regulation, ultimately “affirm[ing]” that application of Section 112 to power plants remained “appropriate and necessary.”73 Although greatly expanded, the 2012 analysis relies on the same interpretation of the statutory trigger as an earlier 2000 finding.74 Under that earlier finding (as well as the 2012 one), regulation is _appropriate_ , in the agency’s view, if power plants emit a listed hazardous air pollutant that poses risks to public health or the environment and if controls are available to reduce those emissions. Regulation is _necessary_ if other Clean Air Act programs do not eliminate those risks. Despite the statute’s special treatment for power plants, EPA viewed the costs of regulation—in this instance, the application of the Clean Air Act’s most stringent program to the nation’s largest category of industrial sources—as irrelevant.



The agency did respond to comments that it was required to consider costs in assessing the “appropriate[ness]” of regulation. According to EPA, it was reasonable to make the decision listing power plants without consideration of the costs of regulation because it is forbidden from considering costs when making listing decisions under Section 112 for other source categories.75 It also claimed discretion to adopt an interpretation of “appropriate” turning only on the ability of Section 112 regulation to address power plants’ emissions of hazardous air pollutants. “Cost,” it concluded, “does not have to be read into the definition of ‘appropriate.’”76 In this, the agency appeared to argue that it had discretion to consider costs, but was not obligated to do so. And so it decided not to, on the view that Section 112 was geared to reducing hazards to human health and the environment.77



Although EPA did not take into account costs when determining whether to regulate, it did produce a “Regulatory Impact Analysis” tabulating the expected costs and benefits of the standards. The regulation would force power plants to bear costs of $9.6 _billion_ per year78—making the rule one of the most expensive in the history of the federal government.79 It projected monetized direct benefits—that is, benefits flowing directly from reduced emissions of hazardous air pollutants, particularly mercury, that could be quantified—of $4 to $6 _million_ per year, chiefly from “avoided IQ loss” resulting from reduced mercury exposure.80 It also projected ancillary benefits attributable to reductions in emissions of particulate matter (and to a much lesser extent, carbon dioxide) amounting to $37 to $90 billion per year, while acknowledging that these particulate matter “co‐​benefits” are subject to “uncertainty” based on limitations in its research linking particulate‐​matter levels with health outcomes.81



The rule was challenged on numerous grounds but ultimately upheld by the D.C. Circuit, over the dissent of Judge Kavanaugh, who argued that it was “entirely unreasonable for EPA to exclude consideration of costs in determining whether it is ‘appropriate’ to regulate electric utilities under the MACT program.”82 In Judge Kavanaugh’s view, the result was the same “whether one calls it an impermissible interpretation of the term ‘appropriate’ at _Chevron_ step one, or an unreasonable interpretation or application of the term ‘appropriate’ at _Chevron_ step two, or an unreasonable exercise of agency discretion under _State Farm_.”83 The Supreme Court granted three petitions raising that point and directed the parties to address a single question that it had formulated: “Whether the Environmental Protection Agency unreasona‐​bly refused to consider cost in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities.”84



The Court’s opinion in _Michigan v. EPA_ , authored by Justice Scalia, forcefully declares, “‘Not only must an agency’s decreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority’”—that is, within its statutory authority—“‘but the process by which it reaches that result must be logical and rational.’”85 And that process, it continues, must rest “‘on a consideration of the relevant factors.’”86



The opinion reasons that there is a presumption that agencies will consider the costs of their actions. “Agencies,” it says, “have long treated cost as a centrally relevant factor when deciding whether to regulate. Consideration of cost reflects the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and the disadvantages of agency decisions.”87 And it is not “even rational, never mind ‘appropriate,’ to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.”88 Accordingly, to overcome the presumption that costs will be taken into account, EPA’s burden was to identify “an invitation to ignore cost.”89



The “appropriate and necessary” language, the Court concluded, is not anything of the sort. While recognizing that the word “appropriate” is “capacious[],” which would ordinarily provide an agency a wide scope of interpretative discretion, the majority explains that a reasonable statutory interpretation may not, like any agency action, “‘entirely fai[l] to consider an important aspect of the problem’”—which “naturally” includes costs.90 After all, “[n]o regulation is ‘appropriate’ if it does significantly more harm than good.”91 For example, an agency could not reasonably deem something like emissions limitations “appropriate” if “the technologies needed to eliminate these emissions do even more damage to human health.”92



 _Michigan_ thus held that EPA acted unlawfully when it issued the Utility MACT Rule, but the Court’s decision has not had any impact on the Rule itself. One day after the decision dropped, EPA Air Administrator Janet McCabe took to the agency’s weblog to boast that the Court’s decision wouldn’t make any difference to the agency’s plans. Because the Rule hadn’t been stayed, “the majority of power plants are already in compliance or well on their way to compliance.”93 In other words, plants had spent (by EPA’s own estimation) tens of billions of dollars to comply with a Rule that, at the end of the day, was unlawful. On that basis, the D.C. Circuit declined to vacate the Rule, instead remanding it to EPA for further consideration. Challengers are currently seeking to interest the Supreme Court in reviewing that decision.94



As discussed below, EPA attempted to take advantage of this precedent in its next major action, the Clean Power Plan.



 **IV. EPA’s “Clean Power Plan”**



EPA’s “Clean Power Plan” represents the agency’s attempt to arrogate to itself authority over the nation’s generation fleet and electric grid that has always been exercised by the states and, in certain aspects, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Plan relies on aggressive statutory interpretation, as bolstered by _Chevron_ deference, to effect a transformation of the nation’s energy economy. Keenly aware of the Utility MACT precedent, and no doubt concerned over the legal infirmities of the Clean Power Plan, the Supreme Court acted to stay the rule on February 9, 2016.95



The Plan relies on Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. That provision charges states to establish and apply “standards of performance” for certain existing stationary sources of air pollutants. A “standard of performance” is “a standard for emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction.” Under Section 111(d), EPA “establish[es] a procedure” for states to submit plans establishing such standards and providing for their implementation and enforcement. EPA’s procedure must allow states “to take into consideration, among other factors, the remaining useful life” of a source. Only if a state fails to submit a compliant plan may EPA step in and promulgate a federal plan to regulate sources within a state directly.96



EPA promulgated the Plan at the same time that states and utilities were making final decisions whether to upgrade or retire coal‐​fired facilities in response to Utility MACT—which EPA projected would result in the retirement of 4,700 megawatts of coal‐​fired generating capacity and require tens of billions of dollars in investments for the remaining facilities to achieve compliance by the April 16, 2016 deadline. The Plan aims to reduce carbondioxide emissions from the power sector by 32 percent by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. These emissions reductions are premised on states’ actions to overhaul their electric sectors, shifting from coal generation to natural gas and from fossil fuels to renewable sources like wind and solar.



It specifies numerical emissions rate‐ and mass‐​based CO2 goals for each state, based on its existing coal‐​fired and gas‐​fired generation fleet. These goals are based on projected emissions reductions that EPA believes can be achieved through the combination of three “building blocks” that it says represent a baseline “best system of emission reduction”: (1) require power plants to make changes to increase their efficiency in converting fuel into energy, (2) replace coal‐​fired generation with increased use of natural gas, and (3) replace fossil‐​fuel‐​fired generation with generation from new, zero‐​carbon‐​emitting renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. 80 Fed. Reg. at 64,667/1. In other words, the EPA Power Plan requires states to transition away from coal‐​fired generation and take all steps that are necessary to integrate other generating sources and to maintain electric service. EPA, however, itself lacks the authority to carry out all but the first of these building blocks, as well as supporting actions necessary to reorganize the production, regulation, and distribution of electricity.



Yet EPA recognizes that such “generation‐​shifting” will be required for states to comply with the Plan. EPA acknowledges that source‐​specific efficiency improvements are insufficient to achieve anywhere near that required magnitude of reductions. Accordingly, whether a state adopts a state plan to meet these targets or EPA promulgates a federal plan, the Plan forces the the state to undertake and facilitate generation‐​shifting, as well as substantial legislative, regulatory, planning, and other activities to accommodate the changes required by the Plan and to maintain electric service throughout the state.



Serious federalism issues aside, the Plan contravenes two separate statutory limitations on EPA authority. First is the bar on regulation of source categories already subject to Section 112—as power plants are following EPA’s Utility MACT rule. Section 111(d) states that EPA may not require states to issue “standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant…emitted from a source category which is regulated under section [112].”97 The Supreme Court recognized the plain meaning of the Section 112 exclusion in _AEP v. Connecticut_ , finding that “EPA may not employ § 7411(d) if existing stationary sources of the pollutant in question are regulated under the national ambient air quality standard program, §§ 7408–7410, or the ‘hazardous air pollutants’ program, § 7412. See § 7411(d)(1).”98 EPA promulgated Section 112 regulations for electric utility generating units—that is, power plants—in 2012. EPA therefore lacks authority to require Section 111(d) emissions standards for power plants—full stop.



In fact, EPA likewise has recognized for years that “a literal reading” of the language codified at 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d)(1) mandates “that a standard of performance under section 111(d) cannot be established for any air pollutant—HAP and non-HAP—emitted from a source category regulated under section 112.”99



Of course, where the “literal reading” of the text is clear, “that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”100 And that should be the end of the matter here: the Clean Air Act unambiguously withholds authority from EPA to require states to establish Section 111(d) performance standards for a source category, like power plants, that is regulated under Section 112.



EPA’s primary defense to the plain language of the Act is to assert that there is an ambiguity in the Statutes at Large concerning Section 111(d), based on two portions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that EPA claims conflict.101 The first is a substantive amendment to Section 111(d) (the “House Amendment”). Before 1990, the Section 112 exclusion prohibited EPA from requiring States to regulate under Section 111(d) any air pollutant “included on a list published under…112(b)(1)(A).”102 This meant that if EPA had listed a pollutant under Section 112, the agency could not regulate that pollutant under Section 111(d). In order “to change the focus of section 111(d) by seeking to preclude regulation of those pollutants that are emitted from a particular source category that is actually regulated under section 112,”103 the House Amendment provides:



strik[e] “or 112(b)(1)(A)” and insert[] “or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 112.”104



The second amendment (the “Senate Amendment”) appears in a list of “Conforming Amendments” that make clerical changes to the Act. Conforming amendments are “amendment[s] of a provision of law that [are] necessitated by the substantive amendments or provisions of the bill.”105 Consistent with this description, the Senate Amendment merely updated the crossreference in the Section 112 exclusion. It states:



strik[e] “112(b)(1)(A)” and insert[] in lieu thereof “112(b)”.106



This clerical update was necessitated by the fact that substantive amendments expanding the Section 112 regime—broadening the definition of “hazardous air pollutant” and changing the program’s focus to source categories—had renumbered and restructured Section 112(b).



As an initial matter, there is no true conflict between the amendments. Amendments are executed in the order of their appearance,107 and the House Amendment appears first in the 1990 Act, striking the reference to “112(b)(1)(A).” Accordingly, the Senate Amendment fails to have any effect, because it is no longer necessary to “strik[e] ‘112(b)(1)(A)’” to conform the Section 112 exclusion to the revised Section 112.108 The U.S. Code provision, in other words, fully enacts both amendments.



In any case, the U.S. Code provision is also consistent with Congress’s intent in enacting both amendments, which address different aspects of the scope of EPA’s authority. The House Amendment added a limitation to the scope of Section 111(d): where a category of sources is regulated under Section 112, Section 111(d) cannot be used to impose additional performance standards on that source category. The purpose was to ensure that existing source categories regulated under Section 112—which the 1990 Act substantially revised to focus on source categories rather than pollutants—would not face additional costly regulation under Section 111.109



The Senate Amendment had a different focus, seeking to maintain the pre‐​1990 prohibition on using Section 111(d) to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from existing sources regulated under Section 112. Failure to retain that limitation would have allowed EPA to undo Congress’s considered decision to regulate only certain sources of hazardous air pollutants: the 1990 Act requires EPA to regulate all major sources of hazardous air pollutants, but only those area sources representing 90 percent of area source emissions, thereby sparing many smaller sources from the stringent Section 112 regime.110 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(3). In other words, the Senate Amendment restrains EPA from circumventing this limitation by simultaneously regulating the same emissions under both Section 112 and 111(d) and thereby burdening all sources, even the ones Congress exempted from regulation.



Thus, by blocking both double regulation and circumvention of the Section 112(c)(3) area‐​source limitation, the U.S. Code provision achieves Congress’s intent underlying both amendments and constitutes a statutory limitation on EPA’s authority. But even if there were a conflict, an agency or court “must read [allegedly conflicting] statutes to give effect to each if [it] can do so while preserving their sense and purpose.”111 Thus, even assuming _arguendo_ that there is a potential conflict, EPA’s interpretation must be rejected because it deprives the House Amendment of any effect. EPA cannot attempt to manufacture ambiguity to expand its interpretative license and ability to pursue its policy goals. 



The second statutory defect in EPA’s overall approach is more fundamental: the statute does not permit EPA’s generation‐​shifting approach, only allowing it to specify standards of performance applicable to, and achievable by, particular sources.112 In EPA’s view, “anything that reduces the emissions of affected sources may be considered a ‘system of emission reduction’” for purposes of Section 111. 79 Fed. Reg. at 34,886/1.That includes requiring a source owner or operator to shift generation to another source. But while the first “building block”—reducing emissions by improving sources’ efficiency— may be lawful to the extent that it is “achievable,” measures that involve reducing the utilization of coal‐​fired power plants in favor of other generation sources are not permissible components of the “best system of emission reduction” that underlies a Section 111 standard.



This is plain on the face of the statute. Section 111(d) requires states to “establish[] standards of performance _for any existing source_ ” that is already subject to a new source performance standard.113 Likewise, Section 111(d) requires EPA to establish “standards of performance for new sources” within listed categories.114 These provisions simply do not authorize obligations regarding other sources—for example, that application of a performance standard to a coal‐​fired plant would require increased utilization of some other facility that is not subject to the standard. Confirming as much, Section 111(e) enforces new source performance standards by providing that it is “unlawful for any owner or operator” of a regulated source to violate any such applicable standard.115



Indeed, a “best system of emission reduction,” which is used to determine an emission standard, must be both “achievable” and “adequately demonstrated,” but those requirements would be nullified if generationshifting (which is always an achievable and adequately demonstrated means of reducing emissions) in favor of other sources or reduced output were a permissible basis for a performance standard.116 Achievability, the D.C. Circuit has long held, must therefore be demonstrated with respect to the regulated source category itself.117



Moreover, Section 111 expressly regulates sources’ emissions “performance,” which concerns the rate of emissions at a particular level of production, and not the level of production. In other words, mandating that a highemissions facility shifting production to another facility may reduce emissions, but it has nothing to do with that facility’s emissions performance. In‐​deed, in its Section 111 regulations, EPA determines “performance” by measuring “pollutant emission rates” with respect to particular levels of production.118 Similarly, its regulations do not regard “[a]n increase in production rate of an existing facility” as a modification triggering application of new source performance standards.119



In light of these and many other statutory features, the courts have had no difficultly in recognizing that “best system of emission reduction” refers to measures applicable to a particular facility. The Supreme Court, viewing this language, recognized that it refers to “technologically feasible emission controls”—that is, emission‐​reduction technologies implemented at the source.120



EPA’s own regulations reflect the same understanding. Its regulations establishing procedures for state plans pursuant to Section 111(d) define compliance in terms of the purchase and construction of “emission control systems” and “emission control equipment,” as well as other “on‐​site” activities.121 They require EPA to publish guidelines “containing information pertinent to control of the designated pollutant form [sic] designated facilities,” which in turn refers to “any existing facility which emits a designated pollutant.”122 Likewise, EPA’s guidelines must reflect “the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated _for designated facilities_.”123 These citations are just the tip of the iceberg. A complete recitation of all the EPA regulatory actions that treat “best system of emission reduction” as referring to on‐​site measures would go on for pages. A recent example is the agency’s proposed performance standards for new power plants—released less than two weeks after the Plan—which reaffirms that Section 111 standards of performance “apply to sources” and must be “based on the BSER achievable at that source.”124



The Plan was, as noted above, stayed by the Supreme Court, and its lawfulness is currently being litigated before the D.C. Circuit, with a decision ex‐​pected before the end of the year. It is not premature, however, to identify the Plan as an example of executive overreaching: it seeks to effect a transformation of the U.S. energy economy by contorting an obscure statutory provision into license for EPA to regulate the central aspects of electricity generation and distribution across the nation. Whether or not ultimately upheld by the Judicial Branch, this kind of action involves the sort of major questions that are properly decided by Congress in exercise of its legislative power.



And it certainly bears all the hallmarks of overreaching: circumvention of Congress to achieve a major policy priority; a rush to change the facts on the ground prior to the completion of judicial review; aggressive statutory interpretation; the “discovery” of broad authority in long‐​dormant statutory provisions; and extensive reliance on interpretative deference canons. It also adds one not previously discussed in this testimony: trenching on the vertical separation of powers, which (as my colleague David Rivkin has observed) often results when the Executive Branch acts to breach the horizontal separation of powers.



 **V. Opportunities for Reform**



The Legislative Branch can and should act to restrain executive overreaching and thereby assert and defend its own interests, those of the citizens its members represent, and the liberties of the American people. The section proposes several different areas of action.



Giving agencies the authority to interpret their rules is not a constitutional command, but a matter of congressional delegation or authorization. The Court “presume[s] that the power authoritatively to interpret its own regulations is a component of the agency’s delegated lawmaking powers.”125 Thus, when considering which of several competing actors should be entitled to such deference, the Court has asked “to which…did Congress dele‐​gate this ‘interpretive’ lawmaking power.”126 There is no reason to believe that the presumption of delegated or conferred authority is inviolable; any power that Congress may confer on an agency, it can also rescind. Nor is there any reason to believe that the power to interpret regulations—to say what the law is, without deferring—is one that the Constitution forbids assigning to the courts, consistent with the requirements of Article III.127 Indeed, the courts routinely exercise that power today, in cases where agencies have not addressed a particular interpretative question or have been denied deference.128 Accordingly, through legislation, Congress could abrogate _Auer_ deference, leaving courts to interpret agency rules de novo or according to their “power to persuade.” 



There are good reasons to do so. As Professor John Manning has written, according “the agency lawmaker…effective control of the exposition of the legal text that it has created,” _Auer_ deference, unlike _Chevron_ , “leaves in place no independent interpretive check on lawmaking by an administrative agency.”129 This is problematic for the reason identified by Montesquieu and embraced by the Framers: “[w]hen legislative power is united with executive power in a single person or in a single body of the magistracy, there is no liberty, because one can fear that the same monarch or senate that makes tyrannical laws will execute them tyrannically.”130



As Manning explains, allocating legislative and executive power to the same entity has serious consequences for individual liberty. First, it encourages an agency to issue imprecise or vague regulations, “secure in the knowledge that it can insist upon an unobvious interpretation, so long as its choice is not ‘plainly erroneous.’”131 Second, it undermines accountability, by removing an independent check on the application of law that is illconsidered or unwise. Third, it “reduces the efficacy of notice‐​andcomment rulemaking” by permitting the agency “to promulgate imprecise or vague rules and to settle upon or reveal their actual meaning only when the agency implements its rule through adjudication.”132 Fourth, “[ _Auer_ ] deference disserves the due process objectives of giving notice of the law to those who must comply with it and of constraining those who enforce it.”133 Finally, _Auer_ may distort the political constraints on agency action by making it “more vulnerable to the influence of narrow interest groups” who are able “to use “ambiguous or vague language to conceal regulatory outcomes that benefit [themselves] at the expense of the public at large.”134 In recent opinions, members of the Supreme Court have expressed similar views.135 



Overruling _Auer_ —whether by judgment or by legislation—would hardly be an avulsive change in the law. And it would have the benefits of fortifying the constitutional separation of powers, improving notice of the law, and ultimately advancing individual liberty. It is a reform worthy of serious consideration. 



Congress may also wish to consider courts’ continued application of _Chevron_ deference. One aspect of Justice Scalia’s Perez concurrence that has attracted considerable attention is his suggestion that fixing the pathologies of administrative law may require reconsideration of _Chevron_ deference.136 His remark speaks to a broader dissatisfaction—on the Court, among regulated parties and the public, and in the academy—with the current state of administrative authority. Where agencies once were viewed as delegates of Congress, simply “fill[ing] up the details” of congressional enactments,137 the Executive Branch has become a primary, if not the primary, mover in making federal law, supplanting Congress.138 Scalia’s criticism is notable because he is often seen as the leading expo‐​nent of judicial deference to agencies, in general, and of _Chevron_ , in particular. 



_Chevron_ ’s impact cannot be overstated—at least, its impact on the Executive Branch. It has fundamentally changed the way that agencies go about their business of interpreting governing statutes. The search for meaning in Congress’s commands has been replaced with a hunt for ambiguities that might allow the agency to escape its statutory confines.139 In other words, whatever its effect in court cases—which is hotly disputed— _Chevron_ has transformed the way that the Executive Branch pursues its policy objectives. No matter _Chevron_ ’s specifics in judicial proceedings, executive agencies have come to see it as a license for improvisation and lawmaking, so long as an escape‐​hatch of ambiguity can be found—and it always can.140 Whether or not _Chevron_ has reduced judicial discretion, it has unleashed the Executive Branch and upset the balance of power between it and Congress. This is the “mood” of _Chevron_ deference.141



And yet _Chevron_ has arguably failed at its primary purposes of cabining judicial discretion and increasing deference to agencies’ policy determinations. Empirical studies “show that immediately after the _Chevron_ decision, the rate of affirmance of agency interpretations rose substantially, especially at the court of appeals level, but then in subsequent years it has settled back to a rate that is very close to where it was before _Chevron_.”142 One “study found that approval of an agency interpretation is less likely in cases in which _Chevron_ is cited.”143 And another found that _Chevron_ has been unsuccessful in “eliminat[ing] the role of policy judgments in judicial review of agency interpretations of law.”144 Despite _Chevron_ ’s conceptual merits, its actual application in the courts leaves much to be desired.



As with _Auer_ , Congress may supplant _Chevron_. Congress could, for example, specify that agency interpretations would be subject only to Skidmore deference—that is, according to their power to persuade—just as it has done with review of certain agency action under the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.145 Or it could specify, as the Supreme Court actually once held post‐ _Chevron_ , that “a pure question of statutory construction [is] for the courts to decide.”146 In fact, Congress already has specified that, in the Administrative Procedure Act.147 So it will apparently have to be more emphatic if it intends to overrule or limit _Chevron_.



Congress can act to curb this kind of abuse. The most straightforward approach, in general, would be to provide for an automatic stay of rules that impose costs above a certain threshold and are subject to judicial challenge, while also providing that, when a stay is imposed, judicial proceedings be expedited. In this way, serious questions regarding agency authority could be decided in relatively short order, before parties are required to undertake burdensome compliance measures that may ultimately prove unwarranted. Such relief could be limited, as appropriate, to rules promulgated under particular statutes (e.g., the Clean Air Act and Communications Act) or by certain agencies, with narrow exceptions for rules that the President certifies are vital to national security. The point here is not so much to identify every possible exception that may be worthy of consideration, but only to note that a law providing for automatic stays need not be absolute and can be flexibly crafted so as to address possible concerns. In other words, Congress can strike a better balance between the benefits of timely federal action and adherence to the rule of law. 



Congress can and should adopt certain common‐​sense policies that provide for transparency and accountability in settlements and consent decrees that compel future government action. Legal experts have given considerable thought on how to alter the incentives and the legal environment that facilitate collusive settlements. Over the past three years, Members of the House and Senate have developed several bills that seek to carry out the principles identified in my 2012 testimony on abuses of settlements and consent decrees. The most comprehensive of those bills, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, passed the House in the previous Congress, and (as reintroduced this Congress) has drawn strong support in the Senate. 



That bill’s approach represents a leap forward in transparency, requiring agencies to publish proposed settlements before they are filed with a court and to accept and respond to comments on proposed settlements. It also requires agencies to submit annual reports to Congress identifying any settlements that they have entered into. The bill loosens the standard for intervention, so that parties opposed to a “failure to act” lawsuit may intervene in the litigation and participate in any settlement negotiations. Most substantially, it requires the court, before approving a proposed consent decree or settlement, to find that any deadlines contained in it allow for the agency to carry out standard rulemaking procedures. In this way, the federal government could continue to benefit from the appropriate use of settlements and consent decrees to avoid unnecessary litigation, while en‐​suring that the public interest in transparency and sound rulemaking is not compromised. 



Other proposed legislation focuses on settlements under specific statutory regimes. For example, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Settlement Reform Act150 would amend the ESA to provide, in cases seeking to compel the Fish and Wildlife Service to make listing determinations regarding particular species, many of the procedural reforms contained in the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, such as broadening intervention rights to include affected parties and allowing them to participate in settlement discussions. In addition, as particularly relevant in this kind of litigation, the bill would require that notice of any settlement be given to each state and county in which a species subject to the settlement is believed to exist and gives those jurisdictions a say in the approval of the settlement. In effect, this proposal would return discretion for the sequencing and pace of listing determinations under the ESA to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which would once again be accountable to Congress for its performance under the ESA. Similarly, the Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013,151 which was introduced in the last Congress and passed the House, would have amended the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to remove a nondiscretionary duty that EPA review and, if necessary, revise all current regulations every three years and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act to remove a 1983 listing deadline that has never been fully satisfied.152 The effect of these amendments would have been to reduce the opportunity for citizen suits seeking to set agency priorities under these obsolete provisions. 



The sue‐​and‐​settle phenomenon is facilitated by the combination of broad citizen‐​suit provisions with unrealistic statutory deadlines that private parties may seek enforced through citizen suits. According to William Yeatman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, “98 percent of EPA regulations (196 out of 200) pursuant to [Clean Air Act] programs were promulgated late, by an average of 2,072 days after their respective statutorily defined deadlines.”154 Furthermore, “65 percent of the EPA’s statutorily defined responsibilities (212 of 322 possible) are past due by an average of 2,147 days.”155 With so many agency responsibilities past due, citizen‐​suit authority allows special‐​interest groups (whether or not in collusion or philosophical agreement with the agency) to use the courts to set agency priorities. Not everything can be a priority, and by assigning so many actions unrealistic and unachievable nondiscretionary deadlines, Congress has inserted the courts into the process of setting agency priorities, but without providing them any standard or guidance on how to do so. It should be little surprise, then, that the most active repeat players in the regulatory process—the agency and environmentalist groups—have learned how to manipulate this situation to advance their own agendas and to avoid, as much as possible, accountability for the consequences of so doing. 



Two potential solutions suggest themselves. First, a deadline that Congress does not expect an agency to meet is one that ought not to be on the books. If Congress wants to set priorities, it should do so credibly and hold agencies to those duties through oversight, appropriations, and its other powers. In areas where Congress has no clear preference as to timing, it should leave the matter to the agencies and then hold them accountable for their decisions and performance. What Congress should not do is empower private parties and agencies to manipulate the litigation process to set priorities that may not reflect the public interest while avoiding the po‐​litical consequences of those actions. To that end, Congress should seriously consider abolishing all mandatory deadlines that are obsolete and all recurring deadlines that agencies regularly fail to observe.156 Second, Congress should consider narrowing citizen‐​suit provisions to exclude “failure to act” claims that seek to compel the agency to consider generally applicable regulations or to take actions against third parties. As a matter of principle, these kinds of decisions regarding agency priorities should be set by government actors who are accountable for their actions, and subject to congressional oversight, not by litigants and not through abusive litigation.



 **V. Conclusion**



Executive overreach is a serious problem and the Task Force should be commended for its efforts to identify the scope of the problem and potential solutions. I thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify on these important issues and look forward to your questions.

Crikey. She’s been a busy ol’ week leading up to Christmas, so little time to catch up, let alone keep up, with news here, there and everywhere, and then so much of it bad.



The [White Island accident](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/nz-white-island-tourists-were-put-in-harms-way/) reminds us how temporary happiness can be, may God bless those poor burn-sufferers and grant them strength in their recovery battle.



I downloaded the [IG report ](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)on the Trump espionage known as Crossfire Hurricane, it’s manifestly impossible to make that many ‘honest’ mistakes, all of them, every single one, bent away from exculpatory evidence of Trump’s team, in a major investigation. Just impossible. Criminal charges will come of this, and it won’t be Trump in the dock.



But with so much bad news it was left to DomPost (does anybody else think their name should be changed from DomPost to DoomPorn?) to cheer me up with yet another climate-changey hoax:



Their reporting that coastal-Alaskan Nome hadn’t seen sea-ice as of Monday the 9th came as news, I suppose, to the good folks of Nome who had announced the arrival of the annual sea-ice the previous week. Shucks, that sucks.



Then they fret over Greenland ice-loss of without mentioning Greenland ice-gains, you can’t have one without the other, it was easy to peek at the Greenland ice-portal to see there is nothing, whatsoever, to fear: gains far exceeding losses, so much so Greenland has 50 giga-tonnes more ice now than a year ago and, in fact, only losing total mass on one single day the entire current season.



So, have yourselves a very nice day, remembering things may well be worse, especially in the minds of uninformed climate-change worriers. (Should they be re-named the Klimate-Klutz-Klan?)

"Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating bushfire season of 2019 and 2020, according to scientists who have revealed for the first time the scale of the impact on the country’s native wildlife. The Guardian has learned that an estimated 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and a staggering 2.5 billion reptiles were affected by the fires that burned across the continent. Not all the animals would have been killed by the flames or heat, but scientists say the prospects of survival for those that had withstood the initial impact was “probably not that great” due to the starvation, dehydration and predation by feral animals – mostly cats – that followed. An interim report based on work by 10 scientists from five institutions, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), suggests the toll from the fires goes much further than an earlier estimate of more than 1 billion animals killed. The wildfires that swept through many parts of Australia between July 2019 and February 2020 were of a scale and size that is difficult to imagine. By the end of February, they had burned through at least 32,000 square miles (85,000 sq km) of Australian forest, an area the size of Ireland.  Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by bushfire. The habitat of an estimated 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and 2.5 billion reptiles was burned.  The fires came during Australia's hottest year on record and in a country that already has among the world's highest extinction rates because of invasive non-native species such as cats, foxes, deer, horses and various pathogens, along with habitat clearing and fragmentation. But one year on from the start of those fires, what does the landscape look like today? With state borders closing because of Covid-19, the Guardian took a virtual journey through the blackened path of Australia’s summer of bushfires, talking to those who are investigating  the state of the continent’s surviving flora and fauna. Scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University and Birdlife Australia contributed to the study. Dermot O’Gorman, WWF-Australia’s chief executive, said: “It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history.” Chris Dickman, a professor in ecology at the University of Sydney and fellow of the Australian Academy of Science who oversaw the project, said its central finding was a shock even to the researchers. “Three thousand million native vertebrates is just huge. It’s a number so big that you can’t comprehend it,” he said. “It’s almost half the human population of the planet.” Dickman said the project showed the impact of the fires was much greater than the devastating loss of koalas, which became the public face of the disaster to international audiences. Many of the reptiles affected were smaller species, such as skinks, that can live in densities of more than 1,500 individuals per hectare. Lead researcher Lily van Eeden, of the University of Sydney, said the study was the first to attempt a continent-wide assessment of the impact of bushfires on animals. The analysis is based on a burned zone of 11.46m hectares (28.31m acres), an area nearly the size of England. It includes about 8.5m hectares of forest, mostly in the southeast and southwest but including 120,000 hectares of northern rainforest. The study showed the extent to which megafires were reducing the country’s biodiversity, and underlined the need to address the climate crisis and stop the clearing of land for agriculture and development, said Dickman. “We really need to start thinking about how we can rein in this demonic genie that’s out of the bottle,” he said, referring to climate change. “We need to be looking at how quickly can we decarbonise, how quickly can we stop our manic land-clearing.” Since the late 1980s Australian scientists have been warning that adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere would increase bushfire risk. An analysis in March found the risk of the kind of hot and dry conditions that helped drive Australia’s catastrophic fires had increased by a factor of more than four since 1900, and would be eight times more likely if global heating above pre-industrial levels reached 2C. In evidence to a royal commission into the bushfires in May, the Australian meteorology bureau presented data showing dangerous fire weather in southeast New South Wales and Victoria was now starting in August, three months earlier than in the 1950s. The WWF-backed analysis is the latest of several papers to map the devastating impact of the bushfires. A peer-reviewed study by three ecology professors in June concluded that the fires had caused “the most dramatic loss of habitat for threatened species and devastation of ecological communities in postcolonial history”. This month a separate paper drawing on the work of more than 20 leading Australian scientists found that 49 native species not currently listed as threatened could now be at risk, while government data suggested 471 plant and 191 invertebrate species needed urgent attention. The WWF report says several techniques were used to estimate animal numbers. Mammal numbers were based on published data on the densities of each species in different areas; bird numbers were derived from BirdLife Australia data based on nearly 104,000 standardised surveys; reptile estimates were modelled using knowledge of environmental conditions, body size and a global database of reptile densities. The scientists said their estimates were conservative due to limitations in the methodologies used. The number of invertebrates, fish and turtles affected was not estimated due to a lack of relevant data. A final report is due next month. Several scientists have called for an overhaul of threatened species protection in the wake of the bushfires, including better monitoring of biodiversity. Conservationists have linked Australia’s limited monitoring of its wildlife to a funding for environment programmes being cut by more than a third since the conservative Coalition government was elected in 2013. O’Gorman said the report should be considered as part of an ongoing independent review of Australia’s national environment laws. “Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important,” he said. An interim report from the review released last week said the country was losing biodiversity at an alarming rate and had one of the highest rates of extinction in the world. It said existing laws were not fit to address current or future environmental challenges. Scott Morrison’s government responded by announcing it would introduce new national environmental standards against which major development approvals would be judged. But the government has been criticised for pushing to change the laws to allow it to devolve approval decisions to state and territory governments before completion of the review and before the new standards were ready to improve biodiversity protection.

New study says Arctic to remain frozen for many more years. MODIS image of the Arctic, Jeff Schmaltz – NASA Earth Observatory
Reader Dennis A. sent me the following abstract of a new paper by Haas et al: Ice thickness in the Northwest Passage – Haas – 2015 – Geophysical Research Letters – Wiley Online Library. It turns out that the Arctic is far less ice free than many thought or expected just some years ago. So wrong can the models be!
More Arctic ice and up to 1.5°C colder! 
Navigable NWP postponed 40 years!
The study finds that in 2014 “more ice survived the summer as MYI than in the nine most recent years” and it was only “slightly less than during 1968–2015 on average (Figure S5)“.
Also “between November 2014 and April 2015, winter air temperatures were between −0.5°C and −1.5°C colder than during 1980–2010.”
Moreover the study also has climate experts profoundly postponing yet another prediction: The Northwest passage will not be navigable for another 40 years…let alone the Arctic becoming ice free!

The entire GRL abstract (emphasis added):
We present results of the first ever airborne electromagnetic ice thickness surveys over the NWP carried out in April and May 2011 and 2015 over first-year and multiyear ice. These show modal thicknesses between 1.8 and 2.0 m in all regions. Mean thicknesses over 3 m and thick, deformed ice were observed over some multiyear ice regimes shown to originate from the Arctic Ocean. Thick ice features more than 100 m wide and thicker than 4 m occurred frequently.
Results indicate that even in today’s climate, ice conditions must still be considered severe. These results have important implications for the prediction of ice breakup and summer ice conditions, and the assessment of sea ice hazards during the summer shipping season.
For further evaluation, it is also important to consider that in Parry Channel, including VMS, i.e., in the waters of the northern NWP, in 2014 more ice survived the summer as MYI than in the nine most recent years but slightly less than during 1968–2015 on average (Figure S5).
Between November 2014 and April 2015, winter air temperatures were between −0.5°C and −1.5°C colder than during 1980–2010 which could have led to slightly thicker level ice than average, notwithstanding snow effects
However, by all means the observed thicknesses and amount of deformed ice still indicate serious ice conditions which can persist throughout the summers and provide ample potential for encounters with hazardous ice. Even in recent years, the CAA remains a source for locally grown MYI and a sink for Arctic Ocean MYI [Howell et al., 2015]; and therefore, shipping through the NWP should not be taken lightly.
These conclusions also support results of Smith and Stephenson [2013] who suggested that the NWP will not become easily navigable for another 40 years or so.
In addition, we have observed two ice islands in and south of Byam-Martin Channel in 2011 which were not included in the present analysis. These ice islands originated from the ice shelves along the Arctic Ocean coast of Ellesmere Island, and were between 30 and 40 m thick, adding to the variability of hazardous ice features in the NWP.”

The one topic that is screwing society up more than any other is [climate change](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/david-bellamy-denounces-climate-change-fraud/) or global warming or whatever the latest catchphrase is. Let me make it clear at the start we are all aware of climate change. There have been ice ages and warming periods and floods and bushfires forever. Should we take notice? Yes, of course, but that doesn’t mean to say we follow the script as outlined by the Greens, Al Gore, George Soros, ulterior motive scientists, the UN, the Left in general and anyone else wanting to make a buck out of an unproven science.



The most startling and disgraceful act is the parading on the global stage of a [sixteen-year-old girl ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/what-is-really-happening-in-sweden-greta/)who has health issues. To use a child in this way shows either you are not sincerely for the cause or you simply see it as a way to increase your personal wealth. No child should be used as a puppet in this way. It is demeaning to her and the message she is instructed to espouse. To allow it is to throw into question the validity of those involved and the very subject itself. Thanks to Greta we have millions of kids around the world brainwashed into thinking they have about twelve years to live. lT’S SICK!!



From validity we go to hypocrisy. These people combined have probably the world’s largest carbon footprint. Why? Are they such dinosaurs that they haven’t heard of tele-conferencing? The why is because they rather fancy their global soirées: you know, the talk-fests where they eat, drink and be merry and achieve little else. If these environment whiz kids want to create a useful carbon footprint they should go to China and get them on board. They should stop them opening a coal mine a week. They should go to India and give them the same message about coal mines. They should go to our friend Donald Trump and persuade him to rejoin the useless Paris Accord. **But they won’t do any of that.** They’ll just swan around fleecing money out of stupid governments like our own, both right and left, and anyone else they can screw to fund their hypocritical lifestyles.



Then we get to the political end of it. Money is being funnelled from a to b in very questionable ways. Large companies, not here, with sympathetic CEO’s apply for Government funding which is given, and then some of those monies are channeled back into personal political campaigns. The whole climate change scenario is based on the premise that if you repeat the same message often enough people will believe it. Schools are, of course, a great place to start the brainwashing, even primary schools.



As I have said here before, National should not have signed the [Zero Carbon Emissions Bill](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/nz-opposition-should-be-called-out-over-zero-carbon-bill/). They should have simply said that they didn’t agree with it and then outlined their own policies. When they regain power they should take us out of the [stupid Paris Accord](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/dear-prime-minister-about-god-emperor-trump/), to which we are paying huge amounts and will see nothing in return, at the first opportunity.



Climate Change, to the extent it is being used to terrify young people and cause undue alarm among others, is a sham. The parts of the planet currently receiving high temperatures are still getting them around the same degree mark. New York and certain other places are supposed to be underwater but it hasn’t happened. In some places, land area on islands which were supposedly decreasing are in fact increasing and the same is happening with ice.



It is not all doom and gloom. The world is not going to end anytime soon. I might remind Millennials and Gen Z: maybe not so much us ‘OK Boomers’ but previous generations have had a lot more to contend with than ever present climate change. A bit of sage advice. Keep calm and carry on. That’s how you get through life.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Divisions deepened  over President Trump’s order barring entry to refugees and citizens from seven   countries. Some of Mr. Trump’s supporters applauded the order, but other citizens organized on social networks, business leaders registered objections, and State Department diplomats circulated a   dissent cable. The White House press secretary said government workers should “get with the program” or go. Donations poured into the A. C. L. U. and other rights groups, lawsuits proliferated and acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was fired after she ordered the Justice Department not to defend the order in court. President Obama   saying through a spokesman that the order was discriminatory and that he was “heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. ” You can see more of our coverage here  —   including Iran’s missile launch, a test of Mr. Trump. Above, Syrian families at a U. N. office in Beirut, Lebanon. _____ 2. We took a look at why the order sparked such chaos. It received little or no legal review. The secretary of homeland security, above, was not asked for guidance, and Customs and Border Protection officers were unaware of it. And we collected the stories of people covered by the ban, which delayed families from reuniting and students returning to universities in the U. S. The U. N. estimates 20, 000 refugees wouldn’t be able to be resettled during the   suspension. Here’s a look at the rigorous vetting process refugees already face the debate over whether the ban is legal and our updated explainer about the executive order. _____ 3. President Trump appeared to try to shift the public’s focus to another hot topic, by tweeting that he would announce his pick for the Supreme Court on Tuesday at 8 p. m. Our legal reporter says abortion rights and affirmative action appear secure for now, but unions and environmentalists have cause for concern. And this may not be Mr. Trump’s only appointment during his term. _____ 4. Messages of solidarity poured into Canada from around the world after a shooting at a Quebec mosque that left six dead. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau assailed what he called “this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge,” and issued a statement saying: “It is   to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. ” Local media reported that the    suspect had a history of provocative views and antisocial behavior. _____ 5. The   “nerd prom” that is normally the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner has some competition. The comedian Samantha Bee promises to “properly roast the president” at “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner” the same night, April 29. The lineup has not been finalized but she says there are “binders full” of possibilities. _____ 6. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum  Bailey Circus is shutting down, after dwindling attendance and criticism from animal rights’ groups. Some extreme fans are extremely upset. They include a Queens man who has created a scale model of the circus at Madison Square Garden, above. The president of the Circus Fans Association of America got existential, saying, “To me, the circus has always been the elixir of youth. When I visit the circus, I’m 5 years old again and I have no life span. That immortality has been destroyed. ” _____ 7. The personal stenographer of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels died in Munich at 106. Brunhilde Pomsel was one of the last surviving members of the group that hid in a Berlin bunker with Hitler in his final days. “We tried to make sure we didn’t run out of alcohol,” she said. “That was urgently needed in order to retain the numbness. ” _____ 8. The ground cracks underfoot, and   pools of acidic water bubble between odd formations of rocks and minerals. Sulfur and chlorine create neon patches. In fact, the Danakil Depression in Ethiopia, an oppressively hot and dry volcanic region, might as well be Mars. That’s precisely why scientists visited, hoping to learn about the possibility of life on other planets. _____ 9. When the Falcons and the Patriots  meet in the Super Bowl this Sunday, the average cost of a   ad will be in the vicinity of $5 million. One novelty: Snickers aims to do the game’s first live commercial, starring Adam Driver (above in cardboard form) from the HBO series “Girls. ” _____ 10. A new documentary, “Becoming Warren Buffett,” looks at the personal relationships of America’s most famous investor, the    tycoon said to be worth $74 billion. “People watching it expecting to learn how to buy cheap stocks will be disappointed,” Mr. Buffett said with a chuckle during a telephone interview. (10 p. m. Eastern, HBO and streaming) _____ 11. Finally, a note about apologies. Most times when we say, “I’m sorry,” it’s for something trivial. But when it matters, watch your wording. Psychologists and other experts say the best apologies are short and don’t include rationalizations or requests for forgiveness. And “I’m sorry you feel that way” really means “I’m not really sorry at all. ” Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a. m. Sundays. Want to look back?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe whole of this week’s Weatherbell’s Saturday Summary by high profile meteorologist Joe Bastardi of course is excellent, but this week especially the first 4 minutes or so dealing with climate are of particular interest.
In it the veteran meteorologist, who has an unusual talent for making long-range forecasts, brings up some excellent points as the world leaders meet in Paris under the delusion they are going to rescue the planet from a dangerous climate change – a mere fantasy they’ve invested tens of billions to prop up.
First Joe shows an NCEP CFSV2 chart depicting global temps:

Bastardi thinks that the NOAA is not being straight with the public and “is playing a little bit of a shell game“, and tells his viewers that claims that the planet is 0.025° warmer than the previous record, based on a questionable proxy reconstruction/adjustment methodology, is over the top.
Bastardi asks, “Why are we trusting proxy reconstructions over the gold standard of trying to initialize temperatures?”
No correlation
On CO2’s linkage to global temperature, Bastardi puts up a chart at the 1:30 mark showing that CO2 hasn’t been at all the climate driver over the earth’s geological history and that there is no correlation. It’s all overblown.
Cooling trend over the past decade
At the 2:17 mark Joes puts up another chart telling us global temperatures have in fact been cooling over the past decade.

The above chart clearly shows this year’s El Nino, but that the overall trend is down. Bastardi does say that should the upcoming La Nina-associated temperature fall turn out to be weak, then the warmists may have a point that the globe is at least getting a bit warmer. But the bottom line for Joe is that the globe still is not warming anywhere near as much as the models project, illustrating this with a chart comparing the models to the actual observations at the 3:12 mark:

Dr. Roy Spencer chart, cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary.
On government’s attempting to form policy on such “grossly over-warmed” models, Joe says: “That’s insanity.”
Bastardi says the Pope and the governments are seriously misinformed if they think fossil fuels have been bad for us. To illustrate the point, he points up a chart at the 3:30 mark depicting life expectancy versus fossil fuel consumption.

Global Progress chart, cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary.
Human life only started to be long and prosperous precisely when fossil fuels began to be exploited. Any technically educated person will have no trouble understanding why, especially when we view the huge variety of beneficial products that are derived from this valuable and hugely plentiful natural resource.
It is truly stunning that there are actually people out there who cannot see this, but yet enjoy their benefits constantly.

"**Ethiopia's army chief, head of intelligence and foreign minister have been replaced as fighting continues in the northern Tigray region.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office announced the reshuffle on Twitter - no reason was given for the changes.
Long-standing tensions between the central government and the local administration in Tigray boiled over into clashes last Wednesday.
Dozens of casualties have been reported with reports of more air strikes.
There are fears the conflict could lead to civil war, which could also destabilise neighbouring countries.
The UN says there have now been clashes between federal troops and Tigrayan forces in eight different locations.
It says nine million people are at high risk of being displaced by the fighting. Aid cannot reach Tigray as it has been sealed off - and communication with the region has also been cut off.
The changes come a day after the parliament, in an emergency session, voted to dissolve the government of Tigray, saying it had ""violated the constitution and endangered the constitutional system"".
Debretsion Gebremichael, the sacked Tigray leader, has now called on the African Union to intervene to stop the country from spiralling into civil war.
In a televised statement, he said Tigray would continue to defend itself until the federal government agreed to negotiate.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive, after an army base in Mekelle was taken over by forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray.
The cabinet also declared a state of emergency in the northern region, which borders Eritrea, for six months.
The leaders of Tigray dominated Ethiopia for many years until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests and curbed their influence.
They say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed elections due to coronavirus
The simmering row boiled over in September after Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government.
Things had begun to deteriorate last year after Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
On Sunday, Mr Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for helping to end a long-standing conflict with Eritrea, urged other Ethiopians in a Twitter post against discriminating against Tigrayans who make up 6% of a population of more than 100 million."

Temperature Data Doping?
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
Fantasy stories from la-la land: Climate change is progressing unhindered and the hottest November (2015) since measurements began. Climate activists are following in the footsteps of Pippi Long-Stockings, making the world into something they want it to be. But there’s something they are not telling us: Satellites are unable to confirm the records. What follows are the RSS satellite data, called up in mid December 2015:

Source: WoodForTrees
Moreover the claimed monthly records from the MetOffice, NOAA and NASA are – hard to believe – the result of a conscious adjustment that force the latest measurements up and the older ones down. In sports this is what is called skewed competition and is vigorously pursued by anti-doping authorities. See: “NOAA in dire straits: warming pause of the last 15 years cannot be tricked away so easily“.
To top it all appearing in October 2015 in the Journal of Geophysical Research is a new paper by Dillon Amaya of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, in San Diego. Here the warming pause is even in the title:
Seasonality of tropical Pacific decadal trends associated with the 21st century global warming hiatus
The official science has long accepted the hiatus and is busily debating its causes. Yet activists are still constantly deceiving the public.

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In August 2015 solar activity was also weak, only 71% of the mean activity that is usual for this month into the cycle. The solar sunspot number (SSN) was 64.6. The mean for the previous 23 cycles is 91. The course of the current cycle so far is depicted in Figure 1:

Figure 1: The solar sunspot number (SSN) for the current solar cycle number 24 is shown in red; the average of the previous 23 cycles is shown in blue; and the similar solar cycle number 5 is shown in black.
The current cycle increasingly resembles solar cycle no. 5, which took place from 1798 to 1810, i.e. in the middle of the Dalton Minimum. That cycle was very long at 12.6 years, which is what we are expecting for the current cycle. As a rule weak cycles are longer than the cycles that see strong solar activity. The summed up monthly anomalies, i.e. the accumulated monthly differences for the current cycle compared to that of the mean value shown by the blue curve in Figure 1, has been the most negative since the Dalton Minimum.

Figure 2: The accumulated SSN anomalies plotted for all cycles 1-24 compared to the mean. The decline in solar activity since cycle no. 22 (which persisted until 1996) is clear to see.

At this blog we reported on a number of occasions on the relationship between solar activity and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Already in our book “The Neglected Sun“ we quoted a paper by Lockwood who found a strong statistical correlation between solar activity, the NAO and cold British winters. Many other studies have since appeared and further confirm this correlation for Northern Europe. As a reminder: The NAO is calculated as the atmospheric air pressure difference between Reykjavik and the Azore.
In September 2015 another paper was published by scientists Katja Matthes and Remi Thieblemont of the Geomar Center for Ocean Research, appearing in Nature Communications. According to their findings the North Atlantic Oscillation lags solar activity by 1 to 2 years. The scientists used a climate model that simulated the atmosphere at an elevation of up to 14o km and thus were able to better account for the effect of UV radiation on the chemistry of the stratosphere, like ozone composition.
Naturally we know that we have to be careful with the results of models. We’ve documented to a great extent the failure of a huge number of numerical models. What is remarkable, however, is that conventional climate research has since found that the impact of the sun on our climate is relevant. Up to now much effort has been expended to talk down the sun’s impact, claiming that the sun’s total solar irradiance (TSI) varies only by about 0.1% during a cycle. But the UV part of the solar radiation spectrum in the stratosphere have huge radiation effects of up 70%! We discuss this in detail in our book The Neglected Sun. In the ozone layer and the ionosphere UV light is converted into warmth and this leads to correspondingly significant temperature changes in the range of several degrees. This warm-up and the increased formation of ozone leads to interrelated mechanisms and changes in circulation in the atmosphere.
Based on ice cores Matthes and Thieblemont could show evidence that years with harsh winters over the northern hemisphere were related to low solar activity (Adolphi et al. 2014). One example are the strong winters that gripped Northern Europe and North America from 2008 to 2010. During those years we found ourselves in a solar minimum.
And when one looks at the development of cosmic radiation since 1984, an increasingly strengthening magnetic field from solar cycle no. 20 (1964-1976) to cycle no. 22  can be seen along with a weakening of cosmic radiation. A reversal of the effect can be seen since solar cycle number 23. Just how large the UV effect or the fluctuating solar magnetic field are on climate is not possible to say at this time. However in the past there is good agreement between the warming phases and high levels of solar activity. The assumption that only CO2 by itself determines the temperature development in this century is in any case very shaky.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday Munich-based national online daily Süddeutsche Zeitung (SDZ) here published a report on the heavy (unfair) attacks by skeptics on climate scientists, who see themselves as innocent victims.Tthe attacks, the SDZ writes, are stemming from “lobby groups of the oil and coal industry and by private people who have networked themselves together.”
Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the SDZ article is totally one-sided, adversarial against the skeptics and ideological. It has nothing to do with balanced journalism. The story is wholly designed to marginalize the legitimate and forceful criticism of climate science by renowned. The skepticism evidently is substantial enough to have a major German newspaper liked he SDZ gripe about it and feel compelled enough to chase down opinions from sympathetic ‘experts’ all over the world.
Overall the SDZ portrays climate science skeptics as clandestinely funded attack groups who are driven by greed, self-interest or who are operatimng on behalf of the interests of the fossil fuels and coal industry.
The attacks are so vicious, the SDZ wants its readers to believe, that now “historians and philosophers are taking a look at the phenomenon“.  The center-left daily describes an environment where criticism from skeptics is hostile, is under the belt, does not fulfill scientific norms and that it is possibly “impeding the progress of science“. The SDZ cites, for example, Anna Leuschner of the University of Hannover, who is quoted as saying “the difference between helpful and damaging criticism could emerge when the progress of science is intentionally obstructed“. This is a thinly veiled plea for a state crackdown on climate science scrutiny and skepticism.
Just how bad are the skeptics? The SDZ goes on to describe how Michael Mann views himself as the victim of a “McCarthy-like” campaign, orchestrated by “a well-financed and well-tuned attack on science” and that Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia even received “death threats” and had “thoughts of suicide” after his e-mails “were stolen and released to the public.”
“Criteria for damaging criticism”
The SDZ describes a recently held conference held in Karlsruhe among “philosophers and ethicists from USA, England and Germany who discussed whether there are criteria for damaging criticism.” The aim of the conference of course was how best to deal with skeptics. Jochem Marotzke, of the German Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, says that “skeptic” is an impermissible term to describe the persons who are spreading doubt over climate science and wishes he could find a strategy to get the word skeptic back out of their hands, according to the SDZ.

The SDZ also writes that Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of he Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, failed to get the label denier to stick for people whom he calls “radical climate protection opponents“.
The thrust of the SDZ article of course is to portray the skeptics as a dangerous threat to scientific progress and thus ought to be reined in by the power of the state. Afterall, how can skepticism be allowed when the science is so settled?
In the article the SDZ portrays a situation where big industry is the greedy evil behind all the climate science skepticism and its successful campaign to seed doubts over the science. The Munich-based center-left daily writes: “Indeed instead of fighting politically, the lobby groups are staging supposed controversy within the science.”
One major problem with the SDZ article is that it fails to name a single group or person guilty of all the accusations it launches, let alone provide any evidence. To shore up the accusations, the SSZ merely cites vague claims made by the usual alarmist propagandists, such as Naomi Oreskes, Stephan Lewandowsky and even Skeptical Science. Perhaps this was done to avoid slander lawsuits.
The main thrust of the SDZ article is on how to deal with skeptics. How seriously should their objections to the science be taken? Refusing to listen to their objections and insisting the science is settled “may come across as appearing arrogant, and thus serve to play into the hands of the skeptics,” Loescher warns.
In the article the SDZ especially takes aim at “conservative American think tanks”, not naming a single one of them, and complains that skepticism is prominent especially in English speaking countries [which have a more balanced press].
In the end, the SDZ writes that outcome of Paris will not be decided based on science, but rather on politics.

The BFD has been banging on about Climate Change and Global warming for a while now and recently we have reported that the [worm is starting to turn](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/judith-collins-on-climate-change/) despite media like _Stuff_ publicly admitting that they will only report one side of the Climate change story and will not tolerate dissenting views even in the comments.



Now those like us who do not believe that the science is settled on this issue have President Trump’s former Science Advisor, Dr William Happer in our corner. He has spoken out against the global warming scare bluntly calling it a scam!



“It’s a scam,” he says.



Happer, Professor of Physics Emeritus at Princeton University and, till September this year, the science advisor on the Trump Administration’s National Security Council, was speaking to Breitbart News in Madrid, Spain, at a conference staged by the Heartland Institute.



He described how he first spotted the nature of the scam during the Clinton era, when he was briefly director of the Department of Energy’s Office of Science before being sacked by Vice President Al Gore. Gore didn’t like the way Happer was asking so many inconvenient questions about his friends’ supposed “climate” research projects.



Happer said:



“I’d have people come into my office in Washington once a week and tell me about the work they were doing. We were spending the taxpayers’ money and had a big budget — $3.5 billion — which was worth a lot back then. Most of them were very happy to tell a bureaucrat what they were doing. They were surprised and flattered to be invited. But the exception was people in climate, who were always very defensive. ‘Why do you want me to come to Washington?’ they’d say. ‘We work for Mister Gore.’



That’s when I began to realise that there was something funny about this area of science […] They would show up. But it would be very painful seminars, not like normal seminars. We were supporting the Human Genome Project and those scientists couldn’t wait to come to Washington and tell me about the latest gene sequencing machine and how well it was doing and how cheap it was. It would be the same with the high energy physicists in their search for the top quark and how close they had come. I wondered: ‘Why don’t the climate scientists feel the same way?’”



Asked whether he thought Al Gore knows it’s a scam or whether he genuinely believes in man-made “global warming”, Happer said:



“You know, I’ve asked myself that question many times. I’ve met him once or twice. I still don’t know what the answer is. It has been very profitable for him so he’s a very wealthy man.”



Happer also spoke to the Heartland Institute about his time in the White House and his views on climate change. You can watch the interview below.

"While President Trump’s order banning immigration from several Muslim countries led to protests at several American airports, the news was often met with satisfaction and approval in those precincts that Mr. Trump carried in the November election. And the protests themselves were viewed with irritation by some, including conservatives who were otherwise critical of Mr. Trump’s order. “People at airports are on tight schedules and are henpecked enough as it is,” Jay Cost, a senior writer for the Weekly Standard, said on Twitter. ”It is uncivil and rude. ” Dan McLaughlin, a securities lawyer in New York, in an article for National Review, wrote that the anger over the new policy was “seriously misplaced,” and he argued that the policy was far less radical than critics had made it seem. “His policy may be terrible public relations for the United States,” Mr. McLaughlin wrote. “But it is fairly narrow and well within the recent tradition of immigration actions taken by the Obama administration. ” Others said that the policy, which went into effect on Friday night, had already been effective. Mark Kern, a video game designer turned conservative political pundit who has supported video surveillance of mosques, voiced his approval. He said that Mr. Trump’s decisive action was a welcome change. “If we sit and debate and prevaricate, remember Europe did this too, and now wishes it hadn’t,” he wrote in one Tweet. He added later, “Luckily we now have a POTUS who does not waver or hesitate to do what is needed. And despite hysteria to the contrary, lawfully. ” The conservative pundit Tomi Lahren, who supports Mr. Trump, wrote in an email that, “It’s not intolerant or unloving to put Americans and American safety first. Every nation has the right to protect its people first. ” “Somehow the left doesn’t seem to understand or agree with that right,” she said. The response on the right was far from monolithic. The Koch brothers condemned the order as the “wrong approach” and so did writers at their libertarian   the Cato Institute. John Podhoretz, the conservative commentator, reaffirmed that he thought Islamic terrorism posed a threat, but he wrote that the policy was not “based in fact. ” In fact, Mr. Podhoretz wrote, the order resembled what he characterized as a liberal solution to major problems  —   a grand, gesture that the president was using to rally his base. “They are making horrible policy for naked political advantage based in disingenuousness,” he concluded. “And that’s no way to run a country. ” A Quinnipiac poll taken in   before Mr. Trump issued the order, found that 48 percent of Americans were in favor of “suspending immigration from terror prone regions, even if it means turning away refugees. ” Mr. Trump’s order immediately closed the nation to refugees and to people from some predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, Syria and Iran. In the same poll, 53 percent of respondents were in favor of requiring Muslim immigrants to register with the federal government. A member of Mr. Trump’s transition team, Kris Kobach, had suggested before the new president took office that a national registry for immigrants from countries plagued by terrorism might be reinstated. A spokesman for Mr. Trump at the time, Jason Miller, later clarified that the registry would not track individuals based on their religion. Reuters reported that while protests filled airports where travelers were being held, many other people around the country were nonchalant about the order and puzzled by the protests. Louise Ingram, 69, of Troy, Ala. told Reuters that while she was not opposed to immigrants, “I just want to make sure they are safe to come in. ” “A country is not a country if it doesn’t have borders,” said Steve Hirsch, 63, who was at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where hundreds of people were protesting, to pick someone up this weekend. On Mr. Trump’s official Facebook page, his supporters thanked him for the action. One user, Jason Juno Lee, who identifies himself as a Marine, posted a comment comparing the United States after the order to a safely locked house. “I lock my doors every night,” he wrote. “I don’t lock them because I ‘hate’ the people outside. I lock them because I love the people inside!” Another user named Wes Schmaltz was more concise: “Thank you President Trump for doing exactly what you were elected to do. ”"
"For the second winter running the UK has been hit by widespread flooding, accompanied by agonised debates over whether government is really committed to adequate spending on flood defence. Largely overlooked, however, are traditional systems of agricultural management which can help keep floodwaters at bay. For centuries, almost all lands lying in the floodplains of English rivers were meadows. Managing these meadows involved an annual hay cut followed by grazing, providing essential hay feed for livestock over winter. Nutrient-rich silts deposited on the meadows by regular flooding acted as natural fertiliser, leaving them reliably productive. But over the past 70 years, the vast majority of these meadows have been lost to housing development, gravel extraction and quarrying, water abstraction, changes in agricultural use, or just lack of management. Natural floodplains, and in particular floodplain meadows, could play a vital role in reducing the sort of flooding that has repeatedly wreaked havoc in towns and villages across Britain over the past decade. Meadows have the capacity to store vast quantities of flood water and release it slowly over time, lowering the peak water level. In contrast, modern flood defences use embankments to constrain floodwater to a narrow channel. This simply pushes the problem downstream, until floodwaters reach levels that can overwhelm defences – with sometimes catastrophic results. The reason why meadows are so effective at soaking up sudden influxes of water is because traditional meadow systems produce good, open-structured soil. This not only supports a wide range of plant species, but also increases their capacity to absorb and store water. By comparison, the tilling (ploughing) of fields common with modern agricultural methods leaves soils more compact, reducing their ability to absorb water. Meadows represent an agricultural system that actually works in harmony with a dynamic river system: as well as absorbing flood water, they collect and put to good use the sediment that would otherwise be deposited further downstream, causing blockages and smothering valuable riverbed habitats. A contemporary example of how such a system is actively aiding flood protection is Clifton Ings in York, managed as an official washland by the Environment Agency. By storing floodwater during periods of high flow it can reduce peak levels in the centre of York by 15cm – enough to blunt the risk of significant flooding. The site is managed as a traditional meadow and is a valuable habitat for wildlife – so much so that it has just been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. So other than their role in alleviating floods, floodplain meadows are among the UK’s most biodiverse systems, commonly boasting more than 30 different plant species in a single square metre, such as great burnet and rare snakeshead fritillary. The soils and plantlife also sequester carbon, helping in its own way to mitigate global warming, improve water quality by trapping phosphates, and of course are by themselves a beautiful landscape to enjoy. And yet despite all the environmental benefits they bring, the loss of floodplain meadows over the last 70 years has been so rapid that less than 1,500 hectares of species-rich habitat now remain in the UK – an area only slightly larger than Heathrow airport. This loss has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in catastrophic flood events we have seen. Is it possible to turn the clock back? Our research with the Floodplain Meadows Partnership suggests it is. A key to these meadows’ survival is to maintain or revive their traditional management. Originally handled by farmers, they rely on a viable agricultural system to keep them productive, and so ensure they are not displaced for other agriculture or development. Understanding how traditional management systems work and disseminating that knowledge is one function of the partnership, created in 2007 to focus on this key, threatened habitat and explore means of conservation. Once lost is not always lost. We have demonstrated that it is possible to re-create floodplain meadows, given the right sites and with the right techniques. There are a number of good examples where the process of restoring meadows has begun, with many new projects beginning around the country. Financial support for restoration is currently available through Natural England’s Higher Level Stewardship scheme, and the partnership website holds information on how to go about restoring meadows, and links to local organisations that can help. Perhaps we can never return to the golden age of the British meadow, but a renewed focus on how we use floodplains is long overdue. Money spent to enhance the role of meadows as an environmentally beneficial, sustainable and effective system of flood defence would be a sound long-term investment."

For years, scientists and non‐​scientists alike have complained that something is fundamentally wrong with the way we do this business. Something has corrupted the integrity of our science.



This is a serious charge because it means that more and more government policy — from limiting carcinogens to regulations on carbon emissions — is based upon an increasingly polluted canon of knowledge. If that were somehow corrected for, we would live under a far less intrusive government.



Last week, this view received strong support when two researchers, Paul Smaldino and Richard McElreath, published a bombshell article in a journal of Britain’s Royal Society called “The Natural Selection of Bad Science.” Put simply, it is a closely argued, mathematically rigorous demonstration that the way we now reward scientists is actually making science worse.



The things that scientists crave — like tenure and research funding — incentivize frequent publishing of massive numbers of academic papers. To publish that much, you need a tremendous amount of financial support. And when it comes to scientific work that could have regulatory implications, almost all of the money comes from Washington.





We are not suddenly becoming more intelligent and getting everything right. What’s happening is that scientists are responding to incentives.



As Smaldino and McElreath explain in their study, this rush for the printing presses leads to sloppy science and declining standards of rigor. So, by extension, the more money the government throws at some field with an initially limited number of practitioners (think global warming) the worse the science will become.



What constitutes “bad science”? It’s the epidemic of positive results, in which a researcher reports that the data support his or her prior hypothesis. Stanford’s Daniele Fanelli has shown a distressing increase of positive results in recent decades, something that can’t be true in the real world. Think about it — we are not suddenly becoming more intelligent and getting everything right. What’s happening is that scientists are responding to incentives.



Usually, hypotheses are put forward in some grant proposal. Financial backers don’t like negative findings, because negative findings don’t support the work that they’ve funded. Supervisors lose face and researchers can lose their funding.



There’s an additional wrinkle on this that neither the authors nor anyone else has discussed. What happens when the government massively funds something that really isn’t science?



By “science” I mean “hypotheses that can be subjected to stringent tests.” The philosopher of science Karl Popper said science that couldn’t be tested is really just “pseudoscience.” Popper criticized philosophies claiming the scientific mantle that are used to explain pretty much everything.



His favorites were psychoanalysis and Marxism. If he were alive today he would see parallels when prominent climatologists explain pretty much every and any weather anomaly — a big rainstorm, a big drought, lack of snow, or a big blizzard — as “consistent with” the effects of global warming. It’s a good bet that climate science, which is primarily the generation of unverifiable prospective models (after all, the future isn’t here yet) would have made Popper’s list.



So, instead of being rewarded for research that supports a prior hypothesis, no matter how sloppy it is, those involved in climate studies get published a lot not by testing (which can’t be done in the prospective sense) but by producing dire, horrific results. Because these often appear in prominent journals — which love to feature articles that generate big news stories — the greater the horror, the more likely is promotion, citation and more money.



This then generates more and more of these perverse incentives in a vicious cycle.



All of this is well and good and could be dismissed as just another example of how incentives drive supposedly dispassionate scientists. But in several fields, like climate, the accumulation of horrific literature is often summarized by governments, usually to support some policy. Bad science then justifies bad policy.



It is quite significant that Smaldino and McElreath’s paper was published by the Royal Society. Surely they know the result will be more distrust of the modern scientific enterprise, and, by extension, in the policies supported by it. The fact of its publication is evidence that we have reached a turning point, where the pollution of modern science is now an accepted truth.

"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   It was Roger Federer’s unlikeliest victory in a Grand Slam tournament  —   quite a statement for a    who has now won 18 of them. But where else should one rank this Australian Open, where Federer was rightfully viewed as an underdog? Where he arrived seeded just 17th, having not played an official tournament for more than six months? Where he faced his friendly rival Rafael Nadal in the final on sore legs? Even Federer’s own expectations were tempered for a change. “I would have said a great event would be quarters,” Federer said. “Fourth round would be nice. ” Federer would get a great deal more than that in Melbourne, a city where his success has mingled with plenty of heartache and tears through the years. He wiped away a few more on Sunday as he became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 45 years. He managed it by defeating Nadal,           to win the Australian Open for the fifth time. “You don’t know if they ever come back, these moments,” said Federer, who had not won a major title since Wimbledon in 2012 and who had not beaten Nadal in a Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 2007. Federer played here with verve and precision but had to scrap his way through three   matches in the final four rounds, receiving plenty of treatment between duels. Although he did not have to deal with the world’s two leading players, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, who were upset in the first week, Federer did face top 10 opponents aplenty. He defeated four of them: Tomas Berdych, Kei Nishikori, Stan Wawrinka and  —   most important  —   Nadal, the swashbuckling Spanish   who has so often thwarted Federer on big occasions but who failed to seal the deal on Sunday despite taking a   lead in the fifth set. That was perhaps when Federer’s tempered expectations helped him most. This really did feel like gravy after all the major meals he has enjoyed through the years, and he stuck with the game plan he and his coaches, Severin Lüthi and Ivan Ljubicic, had discussed. “I told myself to play free,” Federer said. “You play the ball. You don’t play the opponent. Be free in your head. Be free in your shots. Go for it. The brave will be rewarded here. I didn’t want to go down just making shots, seeing forehands rain down on me from Rafa. ” Few could have foreseen this final when the Australian Open began. This was Federer’s first official tournament after a long break because of knee problems in 2016. Nadal ended last season early, too, after an injury to his left wrist. And yet the occasion felt so familiar, inciting global interest and nostalgia for the days when   summit meetings were a staple. But this was not business as usual for Federer on a court that he repeatedly maintained was playing quicker than in past years. His   backhand has long been his weak link against Nadal, whose whipping topspin forehand has forced Federer to hit too many backhands above the shoulder  —   and too many backhands, period. Federer took a more proactive approach Sunday, driving his backhand for much of the match instead of relying on his more neutral slice. He ripped through his backhand returns as well, and Nadal  —   not quite at his relentless best  —   was unable to grind him down. With the match in his grasp, Nadal wavered while Federer let his elegant strokes fly. “He did not surprise me,” Nadal said. “He was playing aggressively, and I understand that in a match against me. I don’t think it would have been intelligent to try to get into too many long rallies from the baseline. I don’t think he would have won. He went for it, and it was the right thing for him to do. ” The result was a brisk   by Nadal’s standards. The Spaniard required 4 hours 56 minutes to beat Federer’s stylistic acolyte, Grigor Dimitrov, and his   backhand in the semifinals. Sunday’s final lasted 3:38, and that included a medical timeout that Federer took off court after losing the fourth set. Federer has rarely taken that liberty through the years, but he did the same before the fifth set of his semifinal victory over his Swiss compatriot Wawrinka, citing a groin injury. Federer’s decision to take a timeout again on Sunday drew criticism from the former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash of Australia, who said on BBC Radio that it was “legal cheating” to interrupt a long match because of weariness. Federer disagreed and explained that his leg had been bothering him since he beat the young American Noah Rubin in the second round. Federer said that on Sunday, he had begun feeling pain in his right quadriceps “midway through the second set” and that “the groin started to hurt midway through the third set. ” “I just told myself, ‘The rules are there that you can use them,’” he said. “I think I’ve led the way for 20 years, so I think to be critical there is exaggerating. I’m the last guy to call a medical timeout. ” The break did not help Federer start quickly in the fifth set. Nadal broke his serve in the opening game and jumped out to that   lead. But with his chances appearing to fade, Federer took control, breaking Nadal’s serve in the long and edgy sixth and eighth games of the set. All Federer had to do then was serve out the championship at   but he quickly fell behind by   before saving one break point with an ace and the next with a forehand winner. On his first match point, he made a shaky forehand error, but he converted the second with a looping midcourt forehand that appeared to land on the sideline for a winner. Nadal challenged and shrugged, hands on his hips. The review upheld the initial call, and Federer pumped his arms over his head and leapt with delight. “Of course it’s slightly awkward to win this way,” Federer said. “Nevertheless, emotions poured out of me. I was incredibly happy. ” This victory, he said, was unique. “I can’t compare this to any other one except maybe the French Open in ’09,” Federer said, referring to his only championship in that event, which came after Nadal had been upset in the fourth round. Federer is the   man to win a major singles title in the Open era, behind Ken Rosewall, who won the 1970 United States Open when he was approaching his 36th birthday, the 1971 Australian Open at 36 and the 1972 Australian Open at 37. Federer has long admired Rosewall, Rod Laver and the leading players of Australia’s golden tennis era. Federer has helped create a new team competition, the Laver Cup, that will start in September, and Laver presented the trophy to him on Sunday night  —   at Rod Laver Arena. The victory over Nadal significantly increased Federer’s chances of remaining the career leader in men’s Grand Slam singles titles. With 18, he has a more comfortable lead over Nadal, who is tied with Pete Sampras for second on the list, at 14. “That’s the smallest part, to be honest,” Federer said. “For me, it’s all about the comeback, about an epic match with Rafa again. ” Nadal has long dominated their series and still leads,  . But on matches played off clay, a surface on which Nadal has a huge edge, the tally is now  . Nadal won their most memorable final, a   at Wimbledon in 2008 that ended in the twilight and is a candidate for the greatest match ever. But Sunday’s extended test of talent and perseverance will surely make the   short list as well, especially if it turns out to be their last mutual hurrah in a Grand Slam final. “Being honest, in these kinds of matches I won a lot of times against him,” Nadal said. “Today he beat me, and I just congratulate him. ” Nadal is just 30, five years younger than Federer, who made an intriguing comment to the crowd at the award ceremony. “I hope to see you next year,” he said. “If not, this was a wonderful run here, and I can’t be more happy to have won here tonight. ” The last man to claim a Grand Slam singles title as a 17th seed was Sampras, when he won the 2002 United States Open. He eventually retired without playing another match on tour. Federer, married and a father of four, has a full schedule planned for this season, and he emphasized later that he hoped to return to Melbourne in 2018. But he still sounded much, much closer to the end than the beginning, as he and his entourage prepared to, in his words, “party like rock stars” in the predawn hours. “I mean, this is all about knowing that I have only so much tennis left in me,” he said. He no longer needed to wonder if there was an 18th Grand Slam left in him, too."

 **Your property is safe**



On Wednesday, Parliament voted to shut itself down until 11 February next year. New Zealanders are temporarily safe from MPs’ ‘solutions’ to our problems. Politics in Full Sentences is also taking a break, but not before we look back on 12 months of freedom fighting. Writing this, we found ourselves asking ‘did all that happen in one year?’



 **January – Ideas for a prosperous New Zealand**



ACT has always been comfortable supplying enough ideas for itself and other parties. The National Party, for example, started the year by adopting three ACT policies in one month: charter schools, RMA reform (again) and indexing tax brackets to inflation. They also seem to like “no jab, no pay”, student education accounts, cashless welfare for beneficiaries and congestion charging. It shows how much of ACT’s agenda can be achieved in government.



 **February – A nation of pioneers**



Every New Zealander, or their ancestors, came here for better opportunities. We are all pioneers, or children of them. That’s why we went all in to protect the Shchetkova family from Immigration New Zealand attempting to deport them. These Ukrainian businesspeople turned a failing Auckland restaurant into a thriving business. They raised money for charity and their kids joined the school rowing team. What else must immigrants do? Our petition attracted over 15,000 signatures and our rally over 500. Result? The Immigration Minister let them stay.



 **March – Exposing bad behaviour**



ACT shone a light on the increasing politicisation of Shane Jones’ opaque $3 billion Provincial Growth Fund. We broke the story that Jones had encouraged the Finance Minister to agree to give $4.6 million to Manea, an organisation Jones once chaired. Incredibly, the Prime Minister let Jones keep his job. We remain the only party consistently opposed to corporate welfare. Taxing profitable businesses and granting their money to unprofitable ones to get a photo op is nuts, but every other party supports it.



 **April – Lone voice of opposition, CGT victory**



ACT opposed the Government’s rushed gun law changes alone. David Seymour’s principled stand has been vindicated as the gun ‘buy-back’ has unravelled. Less than a third of firearms have been handed in and, with tens of thousands of firearms going underground, we are less safe. The Government’s rush caused a serious privacy breach with the personal details of 37,000 firearms owners being [exposed on the Police website.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/data-leak-police-are-scrambling/)



There was also a [major victory](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/the-backdown-on-a-cgt-is-bad-for-national/) for the campaign against Labour’s envy tax, as the Government dropped its proposed capital gains tax. ACT argued that double taxing saving and investment wasn’t befitting of an aspirational country. Thanks to all those who signed up to our campaign.



 **May – Zero Carbon Bill, Budget 2019**



ACT stood alone again opposing flawed Government legislation, this time the [Zero Carbon Act.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/zero-carbon-zero-farms/) The law gives the Climate Change Minister Muldoon-like power over the economy and prevents domestic emitters from accessing cheaper carbon credits overseas. It has been called the most expensive legislation in New Zealand history.



David Seymour led the charge against the Government’s 2019 Budget. The Nats were busy parading some documents the Treasury put on its website too early, but ACT already knew the Treasury was incompetent. We argued instead that the Government’s ‘Wellbeing’ approach was a distraction from improving the quality of its own services. What would help is lower taxes, less regulation, and choice in education.



 **June – A turning point**



ACT relaunched with new livery, a new strapline, a new podcast and four new policies: a flat tax of 17.5 per cent; a red tape constitution requiring politicians to make laws properly; Student Education Accounts which would give parents control over their child’s share of the education budget; and, a bill that would protect free speech from subjective restrictions. In hindsight, this was the turning point of our year with massive injections of money and membership every month since.



 **July – Chinese interference on campus**



July revealed that Chinese government officials had, on multiple occasions, sought to shut down speech and debate in our universities which was critical of the government in Beijing. For instance, it successfully prevented an event commemorating the anniversary of Tiananmen Square from going ahead at AUT. David Seymour was again the only politician standing up for freedom of expression and wrote to the Chinese Consulate General demanding that they stop interfering on university campuses.



 **August – A fair go for Kiwis**



ACT launched its Fair Firearm Laws campaign and did what the Government should have done: consulted with the firearms community and experts and developed sensible firearms policy. Thank you to the thousands who have signed up to ACT’s Fair Firearms Law campaign. The campaign will continue until the election, so it is not too late to [sign up here.](https://fairfirearmlaws.act.org.nz/?utm_campaign=pifs_20_december&utm_medium=email&utm_source=actnz)



The Government adopted David Seymour’s legislation allowing bars to open beyond normal licencing hours to show Rugby World Cup games. A win for common sense.



 **September – Second tranche of firearms legislation**



The second tranche is nuts. In short, it fails to address the problems that led to Christchurch, namely poor vetting of licence applicants. Instead, it places enormous aggravating, insulting, but ineffective, requirements on licenced firearm owners. David Seymour’s speech to Parliament on the bill is [here.](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=934589223568967) With over 44,000 views, it is one of the most watched parliamentary speeches of the year.



 **October – Vaping freedom, Feminism 2020**



People are addicted to nicotine, but it’s the tar in tobacco that kills them. Vaping is the free market at its finest. Businesses profiting and saving lives by selling tar-free nicotine that people enjoy. What do Labour and National want to do? Ban it, of course. ACT launched its campaign for sensible vaping legislation. Ban sales to kids, otherwise let ‘er rip. You can still sign up to our campaign [here.](https://www.act.org.nz/vaping?utm_campaign=pifs_20_december&utm_medium=email&utm_source=actnz)



Massey University cancelled Speak Up For Women’s Feminism 2020 event because it might cause ‘mental harm’ to some students. We stepped in and offered sanctuary, leading to the headline “David Seymour to host radical feminist conference at Parliament.” We are actually taking votes off the Greens for our principled stand.



 **November – End of Life Choice**



Parliament passed David Seymour’s End of Life Choice Bill which would provide choice and compassion for terminally ill New Zealanders. Now it’s up to voters to give the legislation the final tick of approval at next year’s referendum.



There was another victory for ACT’s Keep Our Schools Local campaign as the Government backed down on its plan to take powers away from community-run schools and give them to bureaucratic “Education Hubs”.



Only ACT opposed the Zero Carbon Bill when it returned to the House.



ACT launched new legislation that would cut funding to universities that fail to protect speech, for example by cancelling speakers who might cause ‘mental harm’ to students.



 **December – Merry Christmas**



We ended the year with several pundits, including Mike Hosking and Kiwiblog, naming[ David Seymour MP of the Year.](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2019/12/2019_kiwiblog_awards_winners.html)



If you read our newsletter, there is a good chance you are one of ACT’s ‘winter soldiers,’ who’ve stuck by us through thick and thin. 2020 is a new dawn for Parliament’s third longest-serving party. We cannot wait. Merry Christmas.

"Current farming methods rely too much on expensive chemicals such as fertiliser and pesticides; agroecology combines the best of ecological science and farmers’ knowledge to develop more sustainable food and farming. This is not some fringe theory – agroecology has been discussed in the UK parliament, and an Agroecology Strategy Bill to be presented to MPs will be launched at the Oxford Real Farming Conference that starts today. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food has argued that agroecology can double food production in entire regions within ten years, while mitigating climate change and alleviating rural poverty. And a recent UNCTAD report also made the benefits more visible for mainstream policy makers.  However, the term agroecology is now frequently used to mean very different things. The French Minister of Agriculture declared his intention to have France become Europe’s “champion of agroecology”. But his government’s vision is radically different from that of French civil society and farmers’ organisations. Instead of merely promoting no-till farming methods with herbicide sprays, these organisations call for an agroecological approach that brings producers and consumers closer, boosts employment, the development of a solidarity-based economy, and diverse nutritious foods. This emphasis on locally controlled food systems is at the heart of a radical agenda for food sovereignty in Europe that transforms the system, rather than conforms to the current model. But this transformation will not happen spontaneously. Change in Europe ultimately depends on the power of citizens to redirect public investments and policies that limit the spread of agroecology for sustainable food and farming. A growing number of initiatives in Europe aim to re-connect producers with consumers, using short food chains that supply local food. According to a recent EU commissioned study, short food chains generate great social and economic benefits. They create a sense of community by building trust and social bonds. They also create jobs and strengthen local economies because producers keep a higher share of their food’s value. The environmental impact of short food chains can be mixed. Greenhouse gas emissions can be high if electricity and fuel have to be sourced from far away, for example. So a major challenge is to find new ways of re-integrating food, energy, water and waste systems in circular models. The overall focus is on doing more with less: widespread recycling and reuse; bringing production and consumption back from a global food supply chain to a more local, decentralised food web. From house clusters, municipalities, and whole cities, to semi-urban areas beyond city hinterlands linked to nearby farms and countryside. Ensuring biodiversity-rich and change-resistant farming depends on unrestricted access to a wide range of seeds that are not proprietary products of big  corporations. But European seed regulations and Plant Breeders Rights encourage uniformity across farm landscapes by restricting the free exchange of seeds. While this benefits seed companies, it hampers our ability to develop the more genetically diverse farming systems we need to adapt to climate change. Changes to the law are urgently needed to liberate seeds from corporate control, and strengthen farmers’ rights. Land ownership in Europe is also highly unequal. There are some 12m farms in the EU, but large farms of 100 hectares or more, representing only 3% of the total number, nevertheless control 50% of all farmed land. For young people trying to enter farming, high land prices and an increasingly speculative market have made it even more difficult. We need a pan-European political process to reverse the concentration of land ownership. But a number of citizens’ initiatives are taking land off the market in order to allow farmers to enter or stay in farming. For example Terre de Liens (“ties to the land”) in France has bought more 2,000 hectares of farmland since 2007, held in perpetuity for the sake of current and future generations. Land is then let to farmers who largely farm organically and sell through short food webs that create jobs and wealth in the local economy. Citizens need to change the way public money is spent. For example, funds are required to build the infrastructure of decentralised food systems: local abattoirs, mills, food processing facilities, renewable energy generation, and water treatment. Working with allies in local government, public money can be redirected into  procurement schemes that favour farmers using agroecological methods and short food chains to deliver healthy, local food to schools, hospitals, and office canteens. For example, in both Italy and Scotland, local authorities have promoted local producers by finding ways to bypass the “non-discrimination” EU regulatory constraints. Only local products are used to prepare school meals in several Italian towns. Another challenge is to change research priorities towards developing sustainable food systems. The challenge is to increase public funding for long-neglected agroecological research and democratise how such research is governed. Citizens – farmers – should be more involved in defining strategic research priorities and policies. More emphasis needs to be placed on forms of social organisation and education that encourage direct democracy and partnerships, including farmers’ movements and their innovation networks.. In a globalised world, new trade rules will be needed to protect local food systems and local businesses, and new supply management policies to reduce wasteful production and consumption and connect farms to fair markets. But this must not simply tweak the system. This is where a greater convergence between agroecology, food sovereignty, the solidarity economy, and degrowth movements can help. Localised, circular systems based on agroecology can strengthen food sovereignty, democracy, and cultural diversity in Europe. Given the threats of climate change, peak oil, water scarcity, food supply, and steeply rising unemployment in the EU, piecemeal solutions that perpetuate “business as usual” will not do."

C. S. Lewis once wrote of an apocryphal schoolboy who described God as “the sort of person who is always snooping round to see if anyone is enjoying himself and then trying to stop it”. In our secular age, few people have room for God any more, but many have glommed on to a new religion of environmentalism – call it Gaiaism, perhaps. And boy, do they want to stop everyone having fun.



Incandescent light bulbs, plastic straws, cars, meat, international flights (unless you’re one of the climate elect, of course, constantly criss-crossing the globe to lecture the sinners in the pews)…you name it. Now, we asthmatics can add breathing to the list of mortal climate sins.



Many people with asthma could cut their carbon footprint and help save the environment by switching to “greener” medications, UK researchers say.



Making the swap would have as big an “eco” impact as turning vegetarian or becoming an avid recycler, they say.



In other words, nine-tenths of sweet-f.a. difference.



It’s because some inhalers release greenhouse gases linked to global warming.



But the Cambridge University team told BMJ Open patients must check with a doctor before changing medication.



Some patients will not be able to switch and should not be made to feel guilty, they add, and pharmaceutical companies should also look at ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the inhalers they make.



Except that, here they are, making people feel guilty for, you know, not being able to even breathe without killing blessed mother Gaia.



Metered-dose inhalers account for nearly 4% of NHS greenhouse gas emissions, according to experts.



So, 4% of the [5.4% of the UK’s greenhouse gases](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/18/hospitals-planet-health-anaesthetic-gases-electric-ambulances-dialysis-nhs-carbon-footprint) that the NHS is responsible for. That’s a grand total of…0.2% of the UK’s total greenhouse gases.



Which in turn are just 1.2% of global emissions.



 **So, if all of Britain’s asthmatics chose to make the ultimate sacrifice for Gaia and just stop breathing, that would shave off an astonishing 0.0024% of global greenhouse gases.**



These climate zealots really are completely insane.

"Ever since the discovery of the well preserved, nearly complete, 50,000-year-old Neanderthal skeleton in a pit dug in a cave in La Chapelle-aux-Saints, southwest France, it has been long debated as to whether it represented a deliberate burial. Now, in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a French research team that spent 13 years re-examining the cave and others nearby claim to have settled the century-old debate – confirming that European Neanderthals practised deliberate burial. The discovery in the cave, by three brothers in 1908, completely changed the approach to understanding prehistoric human groups. Archaeologists began to look for evidence of Neanderthal burial, and in just the following five years nine more potential sites were discovered in the same region. Today, more than 30 sites with evidence of potential Neanderthal burials have been found in Europe and the Middle East, in Israel, Palestine, Syria and Iraq, and also east to Ukraine and Russia. Those Neanderthal burials in the near east, which occurred at a time and in a region where contacts between Neanderthal and anatomically modern humans could have occurred, have rarely been questioned. But the older, European Neanderthal population developed many millennia before any contact with homo sapiens. Many scholars argued that the evidence of any special treatment of the dead stemmed from old and poorly conducted excavations – and that the brothers were Catholic priests was also a factor. This line of argument rejects any interpretation of symbolic or ritual behaviour. However, during the past decade, evidence for the use of pigments such as ochre, decorative feathers and the presence of fossil shells not native to the area (and therefore perhaps baring some value or significance) at Middle Palaeolithic archaeological sites supports the existence of symbolic behaviour among the European Neanderthals. So it was felt important to reassess the question of burial among European Neanderthals, and where better than the site of the original discovery. One of our major difficulties was to convince the scientific community that a site excavated 100 years ago could still shed light on the behaviour and ritual of Neanderthals in death. We had to characterise the archaeological context around the Bouffia Bonneval (the cave complex containing the original site), excavate and analyse the archaeological levels of a cavity occupied at the same period, only 50 metres away, and propose an alternative hypothesis concerning the purpose, function and age of the site. Then we had to develop an original approach to test the burial hypothesis. This work took a very long time – we started in 1999 – but the results are even better than we expected. In 2011 we were given permission to return to excavate within Bouffia Bonneval for the first time in more than a century. We found the bones of three more Neanderthal individuals, two children and an adult, and items associated with them that revealed two different occupations of the cave during two different periods. One hunted reindeer, the other bison, as shown by the unburied animal bones at the site. But near the centre of the complex we also re-discovered the pit in which the first Neanderthal skeleton was found. While no marks of tools used to dig the pit have been preserved, its dimension and shape combined with a geological analysis ruled out the suggestion it had naturally formed. Analysis of the original Neanderthal remains from 1908 reveal that they were nearly unaltered, very well preserved compared to the animal bone fragments found all around, which had weathered and decayed. This strongly suggests that the corpse was covered quickly to protect him from elements, scavengers, and it so happens the passing of considerable time.  It is of course impossible to know exactly what thoughts lay behind this act. If the Neanderthals just wanted to dispose of the body, then leaving him out in the open for the carnivores to do their job would have been simple. But instead they dug this pit, worked to removed a large quantity of sediment, and placed the body in it. They spent a long time doing something that was not essential for their life or survival: they just wanted to protect the body of this old man. Furthermore, the care of his clan and their attentions for him can be seen in the last of his life, as well in death. At the ripe old age of 40-50 years old, the Old Man of La Chapelle (as he is known) suffered from osteoarthritis that left him stooped and bent, had hip problems and had lost almost all his teeth. He probably had trouble moving by himself, and was certainly useless for most group activities. But his group continued to feed him. They cared not only for his body in death, but also in life. These discoveries confirm the existence of burial among European Neanderthals, and of their cognitive capacity to do so. But more, our findings also sustain the image of a very human group, with empathy for others, behaviour that shrinks still further the distance between them and us. This article was co-authored with Cédric Beauval, one of the study’s research team and co-authors, author of other archaeological papers, and director of Archéosphère, a company specialising in archaeological excavations."

U.S. arms sales policy is out of control. Since 2002, the United States has sold more than $197 billion worth of major conventional weapons and related military support to 167 countries. In just his first year in office, President Donald Trump inked arms deals at a record pace, generating hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of potential sales.



Though the president trumpets each deal as a victory for the United States, an analysis of American arms sales since 2002 reveals that the arms trade is a risky business. The United States has repeatedly sold weapons to nations engaged in deadly conflicts, and to those with horrendous human rights records, under conditions in which it has been impossible to predict where the weapons would end up or how they would be used. On repeated occasions, American troops have fought opponents armed with American weapons.



Advocates argue that arms sales bolster American security by enhancing the military capabilities of allies, providing leverage over the behavior and policies of client nations, and boosting the American economy while strengthening the defense industrial base. We argue that the economic benefits of arms sales are dubious and that their strategic utility is far more uncertain and limited than most realize. Arms sales also create a host of negative, unintended consequences for the United States, for those buying the weapons, and for the regions into which American weapons flow.



Washington’s historical faith in arms sales is seriously misplaced. The United States should revise its arms sales policy to improve the risk assessment process, to ban sales to countries where the risk of negative consequences is too high, and to limit sales to cases in which they will directly enhance American security.



What role should arms sales play in American foreign policy? Though major deals — like Trump’s $110 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia announced in 2017 or the decision to sell arms to Ukraine — provoke brief periods of discussion, there is no real debate in Washington about the wisdom of exporting vast quantities of weapons around the globe to allies and nonallies alike. Congress, which has the authority to cancel arms deals, has not impeded a deal since the passage of the 1976 Arms Export Control Act created the framework for doing so. Since 9/11 the pace of sales has increased. From 2002 to 2016, the United States sold roughly $197 billion worth of weapons and related military support to 167 countries.1 In just his first year Donald Trump cut a deal worth as much as $110 billion to Saudi Arabia alone and notified Congress of 157 sales worth more than $84 billion to 42 other nations.2 Despite losing market share over the past two decades because of increasing competition, the United States still enjoyed the largest share of the global arms trade between 2012 and 2016 at 33 percent.3



The current consensus in favor of arms sales rests on three planks. First, advocates argue that arms sales enhance American security by bolstering the military capabilities of allies, enabling them to deter and contain their adversaries, and helping promote stability in critical areas like the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Second, they argue that arms sales help the United States exert influence over the behavior and foreign policies of client nations. Finally, advocates argue that arms sales provide a boon to the U.S. economy and fiscal benefits in the form of lower unit costs to the Pentagon, while helping ensure the health of the American defense industrial base.4



We argue, however, that Washington’s faith in the wisdom of foreign arms sales is seriously misplaced. The benefits tend to be oversold, and the downsides are often simply ignored. The defense industry and its champions, in particular, have long exaggerated the economic boon of arms sales.5 And even if they were greater, economic benefits alone are not worth subverting strategic considerations. More importantly, the strategic deficits of arms sales are severe enough to overwhelm even the most optimistic economic argument. It is the strategic case for and against arms sales that we consider in this analysis.



Arms sales create a host of negative, unintended consequences that warrant a much more cautious and limited approach, even in support of an expansive grand strategy like primacy or liberal hegemony. From the perspective of those who would prefer a more restrained American foreign policy, the prospective benefits of engaging in the arms trade are even smaller. Even in cases where the United States wants a nation to arm itself, there is rarely a need for the weapons to come from the United States. Moreover, the United States would generate significant diplomatic flexibility and moral authority by refraining from selling arms. Given these outsized risks and nebulous rewards, the United States should greatly reduce international arms sales.



To develop our argument we begin in section one with a quantitative analysis of U.S. arms sales since 9/11 in order to illustrate the dangerous track record of recent sales. We then provide a brief history of U.S. arms sales policy to provide a context for the current process in section two. Section three outlines the advocates’ case for arms sales and section four outlines the case against. We conclude with a brief discussion of the current politics of the arms trade and a series of policy recommendations.



In order to comply with the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the U.S. government must generate a risk assessment in order to confirm that sales are unlikely to produce unwanted outcomes. This requirement makes sense, because history shows that arms sales can lead to a host of negative, unintended consequences. These consequences come in many forms, from those that affect the United States, such as blowback and entanglement in foreign conflicts, to those that affect entire regions, such as instability and dispersion, to those that affect the recipient regime itself, such as enabling oppression and increasing the likelihood of military coups. Forecasting how weapons will be used, especially over the course of decades, is difficult, but history provides evidence of the factors that make negative outcomes more likely. Sadly, however, even a cursory review of American arms sales over time makes it clear that neither the White House, nor the Pentagon, nor the State Department — all of which are involved in approving potential sales — takes the risk assessment process seriously.



Historically, the United States has sold weapons to almost any nation that wanted to buy them — suggesting that the risk assessment process is rigged to not find risk. From 2002 to 2016, America delivered $197 billion in weapons to 167 states worldwide.6 Thirty-two of these countries purchased at least $1 billion in arms. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was America’s biggest client, purchasing $25.8 billion worth of weapons — including F-15s and a litany of helicopters, naval assets, and associated munitions. As shown in Table 1, the top 10 clients collectively bought $124 billion in arms — accounting for roughly two-thirds of the value of America’s total global exports since 2002. Given the amount of chaos, instability, and conflict in the world, it is difficult to imagine what sort of process would assess as many as 167 of the world’s roughly 200 countries as safe bets to receive American weapons.





Moreover, the United States has a long history of selling weapons to nations where the immediate risks were obvious. From 1981 to 2010, the United States sold small arms and light weapons to 59 percent and major conventional weapons to 35 percent of countries actively engaged in a high-level conflict. The United States sold small arms to 66 percent and major conventional weapons to 40 percent of countries actively engaged in a low-level conflict.7 As one author noted, in 1994 there were 50 ongoing ethnic and territorial conflicts in the world and the United States had armed at least one side in 45 of them. Since 9/11, the United States has sold weapons to at least two dyads in conflict: Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and Turkey and the Kurds.8



To produce a risk assessment of American arms recipients since 2002, we consulted previous research to identify the risk factors most commonly associated with both short- and long-term negative outcomes. Unfortunately, there are no hard data on the precise relationship between many of these risk factors and the probability of negative outcomes. We also lack data entirely for certain risk factors that we would otherwise have included. A nation’s previous use (and misuse) of American weapons, for example, is clearly among the most important factors to assess. Neither the government nor academic research, however, exists to inform such an assessment. As a result, we take a conservative approach, creating an index of overall riskiness based on straightforward assumptions about the correlations between risk factors and negative outcomes on data that are available, rather than attempting to make precise predictions about the impact of each specific risk factor, or speculating about the impact of factors we cannot measure. 



The first risk factor we consider is the stability of the recipient nation. We assume that fragile states with tenuous legitimacy and little ability to deliver services and police their own territory, or those that cannot manage conflict within their borders, pose a greater risk for the dispersion and misuse of weapons. Research also indicates that military aid can increase the likelihood of a military coup, an outcome even more likely in the case of a fragile state.9 To measure this factor, we take the most recent score for each nation on the Fragile States Index, which determines a state’s vulnerability by looking at a range of economic, political, and social factors.10



The second risk factor we look at is the behavior of the state toward its own citizens. We assume that states that rank poorly on human rights performance or that regularly use violence against their own people pose a greater risk of misusing weapons in the short or long term. To measure this we rely on two sources: Freedom House’s _Freedom in the World_ rankings, which assess “the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the world,”11 and the State Department’s Political Terror Scale, which provides a more specific measurement of a state’s use of torture and violence against its citizens.12



Finally, we consider the level of conflict, both internal and external, each state is engaged in. We assume that countries dealing with widespread terrorism and insurgency, or actively engaged in an interstate conflict, also represent higher risks of negative outcomes such as dispersion, blowback, entanglement, conflict, and human rights abuses. Though the United States may have reasons to provide arms to nations engaged in such conflicts or dealing with terrorism, the risk of negative consequences remains. To assess these factors, we rely on the Global Terrorism Index, which measures the scope of terrorism in a country, and the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, published by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which tracks each country’s involvement in wars as well as in smaller conflicts.13



To gauge the riskiness of selling weapons to a given country, we combined its scores on these five metrics into a single risk index score. Since the measures all used different scales, we first recoded each of them into three categories: low, medium, and high risk. For example, we coded “not free” countries as high risk (3 points); “partly free” countries as medium risk (2 points); and “free” countries as low risk (1 point). The result was a risk index that runs from 5 (countries scoring “low risk” on all measures) to 15 (countries scoring “high risk” on all measures). 



To facilitate our reporting we then grouped the results into four risk categories. We gave the Highest Risk designation to the 5 countries that scored as “high risk” on every measure. At the other end of the spectrum, the Lowest Risk category contains the 38 countries that rated as “low risk” on all five measures. The categories between these two are Very Risky (64 countries) and Somewhat Risky (60 countries). Table 2 reveals the distribution of countries across risk categories as well as the average total arms sales by category since 2002. 





Three important observations immediately emerge from the analysis. First, there are a large number of risky customers in the world, and the United States sells weapons to most of them. Thirty-five nations (21 percent) scored in the highest-risk category on at least two metrics, and 72 (43 percent) were in the highest-risk category on at least one of the five measures. There simply are not that many safe bets when it comes to the arms trade.



Second, the data provide compelling evidence that the United States does not discriminate between high- and low-risk customers. The average sales to the riskiest nations are higher than those to the least risky nations. Considering discrete components of the index, for example, the 22 countries coded as “highest risk” on the Global Terrorism Index bought an average of $1.91 billion worth of American weapons. The 28 countries in active, high-level conflicts bought an average of $2.94 billion worth of arms. 



Applying our risk assessment framework to the list of 16 nations currently banned from buying American weapons helps illustrate the validity of our approach. The average score of banned nations is 11.6, with 12 nations scoring 10 or higher. The highest-scoring nations were Syria, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with Iran, Eritrea, and the Central African Republic not far behind. Clearly these are nations to which the United States should not be selling weapons. What is especially troubling is that the United States sold weapons to several of these countries in the years right before sales were banned, when most of the risks were readily apparent. Moreover, America’s customer list includes 32 countries with a risk score above the average of those on the banned list. This reinforces our concern that the U.S. government does not block sales to countries that clearly pose a risk of negative consequences. 



The third major observation is that this lack of discrimination is dangerous. As simple as it is, our risk assessment is a useful guide to forecasting negative consequences. The five countries that scored as high risk on all five measures provide a clear illustration of the risks of arms sales. This group, which purchased an average of $1.8 billion in U.S. weapons since 9/11, includes Libya, Iraq, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan. These five countries, recall, are classified by the various metrics as: “terror everywhere,” “not free,” “most fragile,” “large impact from terrorism,” and as being involved in high-level conflicts. These governments have used their American weapons to promote oppression, commit human rights abuses, and perpetuate bloody civil wars.



Within the Very Risky category, each country rated as “highest risk” on at least one measure, and 30 scored as “highest risk” on at least two measures. This group also represents the full range of unintended consequences from arms sales. Afghanistan, Egypt, Somalia, and Ukraine fall into this category. This group collectively spent an average of $1.38 billion over the time period. Since 9/11, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (which scored a 12) invaded Yemen, intervened in Tunisia and Syria, and provoked a crisis with Qatar, while cementing a track record of human rights abuses and government oppression. Other states in this category, such as Afghanistan (score of 14), have entangled the United States in counterproductive conflicts since 9/11 and continue to do so today. 



Even arms sales to the less risky nations do not come without risk. For example, the Somewhat Risky category includes the United Arab Emirates, which is involved in an active conflict in Yemen, as well as Georgia, which has dangerous neighbors. Finally, the Lowest Risk category includes most of the NATO nations, Taiwan, South Korea, and a range of other, mostly smaller nations with stable governments, such as Barbados and Grenada, located in friendly neighborhoods. These countries pose little risk for problems like dispersion, destabilization, or misuse of weapons for oppression. In some cases, however, arms sales could alter regional balances of power in ways that increase tensions and the chance of conflict. U.S. arms sales to NATO allies, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, for example, have upset Russian leaders.14 Similarly, arms sales to Taiwan, itself not a risky customer, have nonetheless raised tensions between China and the United States.15



In short, even a relatively simple risk assessment makes it clear that the policy of the United States is to sell weapons to just about any nation that can afford them without much concern for the consequences. Though the United States does limit its most advanced weapons to allies16 and maintains a ban on the sale of materials related to weapons of mass destruction,17 the United States has sold just about everything else, in many cases to countries embroiled in interstate and civil conflicts, to countries with horrendous human rights records, and to countries that represent a risk for entangling the United States in unwanted conflicts.



Four major inflection points define the evolution of U.S. arms sales policy. The first was the end of World War II and the dawn of the Cold War. Though the U.S. government dabbled in international arms sales after World War I, it was not until after World War II that the United States conducted arms transfers on a large scale. As the Cold War heated up, federal investment in the research and development of new systems rose dramatically, as did international demand for American weapons. Competition between the United States and Soviet Union fostered a global boom in arms sales. Throughout the Cold War, the United States used arms sales as a key element of its defense of Western Europe and the broader American strategy of containing the Soviet Union and the spread of communism.18



The second inflection point in U.S. arms sales history was the passage of the American Export Controls Act (AECA) and the establishment of the modern arms sales process. Wary of getting involved in future Vietnams but determined to retain America’s global leadership role, President Richard Nixon turned to arms transfers as a way to “wield force and exert influence” without sending American troops abroad.19 In the absence of legislation regulating the president’s use of arms sales, Nixon was able to ramp up arms sales quickly and quietly, in most cases without notifying Congress or the public. Nixon’s embrace of this strategy led to a tenfold expansion in arms sales in the early 1970s as the administration shipped weapons to Iran, Cambodia, and Laos.20



Though Nixon’s general anti-communist strategy had bipartisan support, Nixon’s policies themselves led to negative consequences in several cases. Sen. Gaylord Nelson, champion of the AECA, fought for its passage to combat what he viewed as dangerous secrecy: “Foreign military sales constitute major foreign policy decisions involving the United States in military activities without sufficient deliberation. This has gotten us into trouble in the past and could easily do so again.”21 These concerns, coming in the wake of widespread anger about the war in Vietnam and the secret bombing of Laos and Cambodia, prompted Congress to reform arms sales policy in an attempt to rein in the White House.



The result of these efforts was the AECA, passed in 1976. The act made four major changes to the process by which the United States sold weapons to foreign nations.22 First, it formalized the executive branch’s lead role in negotiating and approving arms deals, with primary responsibilities divided between the State Department and the Department of Defense. Second, in order to ensure transparency, the act required the White House to notify Congress of impending sales above a certain dollar value. Third, the act required the White House to deliver a politico-military risk assessment of each proposed arms sale to ensure that the national security benefits would outweigh any potential negative consequences. Finally, Congress reserved for itself the ability to block White House arms deals by passing a resolution within 30 days of official notification.23



As with the War Powers Act and other reforms from the 1970s aimed at curbing presidential power, however, the AECA looks more significant on paper than it has proved to be in practice. In reality, the act does very little to limit the White House’s arms sales efforts. Most fundamentally, despite the fact that the Constitution clearly identifies Congress as the lead branch of government with respect to the regulation of foreign commerce, Congress did not give itself a significant enough role in arms sales policy. Rather than structure the process to require active congressional approval of each major deal or to require annual congressional review and approval of ongoing deals, Congress instead abdicated its authority almost entirely.24



A benign explanation is that Congress recognized that, despite problems in the past, effective foreign policy requires a unitary authority such as the president and that the act should not tie the president’s hands too tightly. Another explanation, however, is that Congress has little motivation to play an active role in the arms sales process. In fact, the incentives facing Congress mostly point members toward greater support for arms sales. To stake out public opposition to the president is typically not politically wise, especially for members of the president’s own party. But even for the opposing party, supporting major arms deals is good politics because it helps them look supportive not only of U.S. national security but also of American industry and American jobs. All states and many congressional districts are home to the defense industry; in many districts the defense industry is the dominant corporate presence.25 A senator or representative who speaks out against arms sales thus risks losing the financial support of the defense industry as well as votes in their district. The defense industry lobby, moreover, is extremely active and well connected in Washington, D.C., spending more than $100 million a year on average over the past decade.26 As a result, few in Congress are encouraged to challenge the administration’s arms sales agenda, and Congress relegated itself to the role of rubber stamp. In theory, the AECA allows Congress to block problematic deals at the last minute. But because of the practical and political obstacles involved, Congress has made few efforts to do so and has not passed a resolution blocking an arms deal since the AECA became law.27



Thanks in part to this congressional apathy, the risk assessment requirement has generally not restrained the United States from selling weapons even to countries that should not receive them. On paper, the AECA dictates a reasonable bar for the risk assessment. The law states: “Decisions on issuing export licenses . . . shall take into account whether the export of the article would contribute to an arms race, aid in the development of weapons of mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements.”28



Administrations have also highlighted the importance of avoiding arms sales that would lead to negative outcomes. The most recent presidential directive on arms sales, Barack Obama’s Presidential Policy Directive 27 from January 2014, identifies a host of criteria to be included in risk assessments and declares that “All arms transfer decisions will be guided by a set of criteria that maintains the appropriate balance between legitimate arms transfers to support U.S. national security and that of our allies and partners, and the need for restraint against the transfer of arms that would enhance the military capabilities of hostile states, serve to facilitate human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law, or otherwise undermine international security.”29



The track record of U.S. arms sales, however, illustrates that the executive branch often puts little effort into conducting realistic risk assessments. Without the need to worry about congressional oversight, executive branch risk assessments serve more as routine paperwork than serious attempts to weigh the positive and negative consequences of an arms deal. The upshot is that for decades the United States has transferred weapons into situations where it was relatively easy to forecast that the risk of negative consequences was high. In most cases, however, short-term motivations outweighed consideration of longer-term possibilities. 



The end of the Cold War signaled another important shift in U.S. arms sales policy. During the Cold War, the United States sold weapons to a relatively close-knit circle of allies and aligned nations.30 With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, ideology and regime type were no longer obstacles to commerce. Prospects for snapping up market share of the global arms industry and reaping profits powered U.S. arms sales. President Bill Clinton was the first president to incorporate economic justifications into official policy. Clinton’s 1995 directive stated that “the impact on U.S. industry and the defense industrial base” would be a key criterion for his administration’s decisionmaking.31 With the abandonment of previous restrictions, many countries turned to the United States to upgrade their Soviet-era arsenals or to restock stores depleted from fighting civil wars.32 As a result, the United States expanded its customer base well beyond Cold War boundaries. In 1993 alone, for example, the Clinton administration approved a record $36 billion in sales, good for a 72 percent share of the Third World arms market.33



The terrorist attacks of 9/11 marked the most recent inflection point for U.S. arms sales policy. In response to the attacks, both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations oversaw a boom in arms sales, providing foreign governments with unprecedented access to the American arsenal. Since 9/11, the United States has delivered more than $197 billion worth of weapons to 167 countries — not counting Trump’s $110 billion in potential sales to Saudi Arabia, or an additional $84 billion in potential arms sales announced by the administration, to date. Predictably, the urgency of the counterterrorism mission meant that the risk assessment process, never stringent, was weakened further. Nations that had previously been banned from buying American weapons, whether because of human rights violations or their participation in ongoing conflicts, became customers after 9/11, as long as they claimed the weapons would help fight terrorism.34 Both administrations also increased sales to Afghanistan and Iraq, and to a number of other nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Jordan, on the theory that it would help promote regional stability and aid counterterrorism efforts. During its first year, the Trump administration continued this trend, with an added emphasis on economic opportunities and even less regard for the human rights records of American clients.35 Figure 1 shows the countries that have purchased American weapons since 9/11.





Few tools have been used in pursuit of so many foreign policy objectives as arms sales. The United States has sold weapons to its NATO allies to ensure their ability to defend Western Europe; to friendly governments around the world facing insurgencies and organized crime; to allies in the Pacific (buffering them against China’s rising military power); and to both Israel and many of its Arab neighbors in efforts to maintain regional stability and influence over Middle Eastern affairs. The United States has used arms sales, as well as the threat of denying arms, in efforts to influence human rights policies, to help end conflicts, to gain access to military bases, and to encourage fair elections. Since 9/11, the new central focus of U.S. weapons sales has been to bolster the global war on terror.36



Despite their many uses, arms sales impact foreign affairs through two basic mechanisms. The first involves using arms sales to shift the balance of power and capabilities between the recipient and its neighbors, thereby helping allies win wars or deter adversaries, promote local and regional stability, or buttress friendly governments against insurgencies and other internal challenges.37 During the Cold War, American arms sales became part of a broader strategy to deter the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States sold weapons to Afghanistan and Iraq to bolster their ability to defeat the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the Islamic State. By selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, the United States hoped to balance rising Chinese power and promote regional stability. Although the specific objectives differ, at root the causal mechanism is the same: using arms sales to shift the balance of power in a direction more favorable to American interests.38



The second mechanism involves using arms sales to generate leverage over the conduct of other nations. As the producer of the world’s most advanced and sought-after weaponry, the United States can dictate, at least to some degree, the conditions under which it will agree to sell certain weapons.39 As Andrew Shapiro puts it, “When a country acquires an advanced U.S. defense system, they are not simply buying a product to enhance their security, they are also seeking a relationship with the United States. . . . This engagement helps build bilateral ties and creates strong incentives for recipient countries to maintain good relations with the United States.”40



American influence is thought to be most potent in cases where the United States provides a nation with a large share of its military capabilities. In the wake of U.S. pressure to halt Israeli defense exports to China, for example, an Israeli official acknowledged, “If the United States, which provides Israel with $2 billion in annual military aid, demands that we will not sell anything to China — then we won’t. If the Americans decide we should not be selling arms to other countries as well — Israel will have no choice but to comply.”41



The United States has used arms sales to try to encourage states to vote with the United States at the UN, to support or adopt pro-Western and pro-U.S. foreign policies, to convince Egypt and Israel to accept peace accords, and to gain access to military bases in places such as Greece, Turkey, Kenya, Somalia, Oman, and the Philippines. After the Cold War, the United States also sought to tie arms transfers to human rights and democratization efforts in client states.42



Arms sales remain attractive to presidents for three main reasons. First, arms sales are less risky than sending American troops, providing explicit security guarantees to other nations, or initiating direct military intervention, even long distance.43 In cases where allies or partners are likely to engage in conflicts with their neighbors, providing weapons rather than stationing troops abroad can lessen the risk of American entrapment in crises or conflicts. Taiwan is an example of this sort of arms-for-troops substitution. On the other hand, in instances where the United States has an interest in conflicts already underway, arms sales can be used in attempts to achieve military objectives without putting American soldiers (or at least putting fewer of them) in harm’s way. This tactic has been a central element of the American war on terror, with sales (and outright transfers) of weapons to Afghanistan and Iraq to support the fight against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and ISIS, as well as to Saudi Arabia for its war in Yemen.44 In both situations the reduction of military risk, in particular the risk of American casualties, also helps reduce the political risk. Presidents who would otherwise abstain from supporting a nation if it entailed sending American troops can sell arms to that country without the political fallout that sending America troops abroad would incur.



Second, arms sales are an extremely flexible tool of statecraft. In contrast to the blunt nature of military intervention, or the long-term commitment and convoluted politics that treaties involve, arms sales can take any form from small to large and can take place on a one-time or ongoing basis; they can be ramped up or down and started or stopped relatively quickly, depending on the circumstances. Selling arms to one nation, moreover, does not prohibit the United States from selling arms to any other nation. And thanks to their capacity and prestige, American weapons serve as useful bargaining chips in all sorts of negotiations between the United States and recipient nations.45



Finally, arms sales represent a very low-cost and low-friction policy tool for the White House.46 Unlike military intervention or stationing troops abroad, arms sales are not dependent on defense budgets or on a laborious congressional process. And since most arms deals receive little publicity, presidents don’t have to worry about generating support from the public. As a result, the president can strike an arms deal unilaterally and at any time. Moreover, since most political leaders view arms sales as an economic benefit to the United States, the president tends to receive far more encouragement than pushback on the vast majority of arms deals. Inevitably, the fact that arms sales are low cost and easy to implement means that presidents reach for them frequently, even if they are not necessarily the best tool for the job.



Under the right circumstances, we agree that arms sales can be a useful tool of foreign policy. More often, however, we argue that the benefits of U.S. arms sales are too uncertain and too limited to outweigh the negative consequences they often produce. Though presidents like them because they are relatively easy to use, in most cases arms sales are not the best way to achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives. The strategic case for radically reducing arms sales rests on four related arguments. First, arms sales do little to enhance American security. Second, the nonsecurity benefits are far more limited and uncertain than arms sales advocates acknowledge. Third, the negative and unwanted consequences of arms sales are more common and more dangerous than most realize. Finally, the United States would enjoy significant diplomatic benefits from halting arms sales.



At the strategic level, the United States inhabits such an extremely favorable security environment in the post–Cold War world that most arms sales do little or nothing to improve its security. Thanks to its geography, friendly (and weak) neighbors, large and dynamic economy, and secure nuclear arsenal, the United States faces very few significant threats. There is no Soviet Union bent upon dominating Europe and destroying the United States. China, despite its rapid rise, cannot (and has no reason to) challenge the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the United States. Arms sales — to allies or others — are unnecessary to deter major, direct threats to U.S. national security in the current era.47



Nor are arms sales necessary to protect the United States from “falling dominoes,” or the consequences of conflicts elsewhere. The United States enjoys what Eric Nordlinger called “strategic immunity.”48 Simply put, most of what happens in the rest of the world is irrelevant to U.S. national security. The United States has spent decades helping South Korea keep North Korea in check, for example, but division of territory on the Korean peninsula does not affect America’s security. Likewise, civil wars in the Middle East and Russia’s annexation of Crimea might be significant for many reasons, but those events do not threaten the ability of the United States to defend itself. As a result, a decision to sell weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan, or South Korea could significantly affect those nations’ security; doing so is not an act of ensuring U.S. national security.



Nor does the threat of transnational terrorism justify most arms sales. Most fundamentally, the actual threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism to Americans is extraordinarily low. Since 9/11, neither al Qaeda nor the Islamic State has managed an attack on the American homeland. Lone wolf terrorists inspired by those groups have done so, but since 9/11 those attacks have killed fewer than 100 Americans, an average of about 6 people per year. There is simply very little risk reduction to be gained from any strategy. The idea that the United States should be willing to accept the significant negative effects of arms sales for minimal counterterrorism gains is seriously misguided.49



Moreover, even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the potential costs, arms sales still have almost no value as a tool in the war on terror for several reasons. First, the bulk of arms sales (and those we considered in our risk assessment) involve major conventional weapons, which are ill suited to combatting terrorism. Many U.S. arms deals since 9/11 have involved major conventional weapons systems such as fighter jets, missiles, and artillery, useful for traditional military operations, but of little use in fighting terrorists. Insurgencies that hold territory, like the Islamic State, are one thing, but most terrorist groups do not advertise their location, nor do they assemble in large groups. 



Second, there is little evidence from the past 16 years that direct military intervention is the right way to combat terrorism. Research reveals that military force alone “seldom ends terrorism.”50 This comports with the American experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the war on terror to date. Despite regime change, thousands of air strikes, and efforts to upgrade the military capabilities of friendly governments, the United States has not only failed to destroy the threat of Islamist-inspired terrorism, it has also spawned chaos, greater resentment, and a sharp increase in the level of terrorism afflicting the nations involved.51 Given the experience of the United States since 2001, there is little reason to expect that additional arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates will reduce terrorism, much less anti-American terrorism specifically.



Relatedly, many arms deals since 9/11, made in the name of counterterrorism, were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on terror because they provided weapons to governments fighting terrorist groups only vaguely (if at all) linked to al Qaeda or ISIS. Although selling weapons to the governments of Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia might help them combat violent resistance in their countries, terrorist groups in those countries have never targeted the United States. As a result, such arms deals cannot be justified by arguing that they advance the goals of the United States in its own war on terror in any serious way.



Finally, arms sales are completely useless to combat the largest terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland — lone wolf attackers already living in the United States. As noted, none of the successful attacks in the United States since 9/11 resulted from operations directed by al Qaeda or ISIS. And in fact only two foiled attempts since then — the underwear bomber and the printer-bomb plot — can be ascribed to al Qaeda.52 Instead, in almost all cases, persons already living in the United States, inspired by Islamist groups, decided to carry out attacks on their own. Clearly, arms sales to foreign nations won’t help with that problem; rather, as many analysts have suggested, amplifying conflicts abroad may well make the problem worse.53



In sum, the strategic value of arms sales for the United States is very low given today’s security environment. Different circumstances would produce a different analysis. Although today there is little reason for the United States to worry about the Russian threat to Europe, during the Cold War foreign policy experts agreed that preventing the Soviet Union from dominating the European continent was critical to American security. As a result, the United States sensibly provided NATO allies with advanced weapons. This strategy greatly enhanced the fighting capability of NATO, thereby bolstering deterrence and ensuring European security. 



Today, happily, the United States faces no such threats. For this reason, the argument in favor of arms sales cannot rest on national security grounds but must rest instead on “national interest” grounds, that is, on the benefits gained from helping other nations improve their own security, and from maintaining conditions generally believed to be in the national interest, such as regional stability or the prevention of war. This is already a much weaker position than the conventional wisdom acknowledges. Even worse for such sales’ advocates, however, is the fact that arms sales are notoriously uncertain tools for achieving those objectives.



Attempts to manage the balance of power and generate influence around the world are heavily contingent on a number of factors, most of which lie outside American control. Upon closer review, most of the benefits of arms sales are less certain and less compelling than advocates claim. 



**Managing the Balance of Power: The Illusion of Control**. The hidden assumption underlying the balance of power strategy is that the United States will be able to predict accurately what the impact of its arms sales will be. If the goal is deterrence, for example, the assumption is that an arms sale will be sufficient to deter the adversary without spawning an arms race. If the goal is to promote stability, the assumption is that an arms sale will in fact reduce tensions and inhibit conflict rather than inflame tensions and help initiate conflict. These assumptions, in turn, depend on both the recipient nation and that nation’s neighbors and adversaries acting in ways that don’t make things worse.



As it turns out, these are often poor assumptions. Although arms sales certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient nation, the fundamental problem is that arms sales often initiate a long chain of responses that the United States generally cannot control. The United States, after all, is not the only country with interests in regional balances, especially where the survival and security of local actors is at stake. The United States is neither the only major power with a keen interest in critical regions like Asia and the Middle East, nor the only source of weapons and other forms of assistance. Nor can it dictate the perceptions, interests, or actions of the other nations involved in a given region. For example, though a nation receiving arms from the United States may enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it is also likely to enjoy enhanced offensive capabilities. With these, a nation’s calculations about the potential benefits of war, intervention abroad, or even the use of force against its own population may shift decisively. Saudi Arabia’s recent behavior illustrates this dynamic. Though the Saudis explain their arms purchases as necessary for defense against Iranian pressure, Saudi Arabia has also spent the past two years embroiled in a military intervention in Yemen.



Likewise, arms sales can heighten regional security dilemmas. Neighbors of nations buying major conventional weapons will also worry about what this enhanced military capability will mean. This raises the chances that they too will seek to arm themselves further, or take other steps to shift the balance of power back in their favor, or, in the extreme case, to launch a preventive war before they are attacked. Given these dynamics, the consequences of arms sales to manage regional balances of power are far less predictable and often much less positive than advocates assume.54



This unpredictability characterizes even straightforward-seeming efforts to manage the balance of power. The most basic claim of arms sales advocates is that U.S. arms sales to friendly governments and allies should make them better able to deter adversaries. The best available evidence, however, suggests a more complicated reality. In a study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, major-power arms sales to existing allies had no effect on the chance that the recipient would be the target of a military attack. Worse, recipients of U.S. arms that were not treaty allies were significantly _more likely_ to become targets.55



Nor is there much evidence that arms sales can help the United States promote peace and regional stability by calibrating the local balance of power. On this score, in fact, the evidence suggests that the default assumption should be the opposite. Most scholarly work concludes that arms sales exacerbate instability and increase the likelihood of conflict.56 One study, for example, found that during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet arms sales to hostile dyads (e.g., India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq, Ethiopia/Somalia) “contributed to hostile political relations and imbalanced military relationships” and were “profoundly destabilizing.”57



There is also good reason to believe that several factors are making the promotion of regional stability through arms sales more difficult. The shrinking U.S. military advantage over other powers such as China and the increasingly competitive global arms market both make it less likely that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive difference. As William Hartung argued as early as 1990, “the notion of using arms transfers to maintain a carefully calibrated regional balance of power seems increasingly archaic in today’s arms market, in which a potential U.S. adversary is as likely to be receiving weapons from U.S. allies like Italy or France as it is from former or current adversaries.”58



In sum, the academic and historical evidence indicates that although the United States can use arms sales to enhance the military capabilities of other nations and thereby shift the local and regional balance of power, its ability to dictate specific outcomes through such efforts is severely limited.



Arms for (Not That Much) Influence. Successful foreign policy involves encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United States. As noted, the United States has often attempted to use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or influence necessary to do this. History reveals, however, that the benefits of the arms for influence strategy are limited for two main reasons.



First, the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful leverage is much narrower than is often imagined. Most obviously, arms sales are unnecessary in situations where the other country already agrees or complies with the American position or can be encouraged to do so without such incentives. This category includes most U.S. allies and close partners under many, though not all, circumstances. 



Just as clearly, the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when the other state will never agree to comply with American demands. This category includes a small group of obvious cases such as Russia, China, Iran, and other potential adversaries (to which the United States does not sell weapons anyway), but it also includes a much larger group of cases in which the other state opposes what the United States wants, or in which complying with U.S. wishes would be politically too dangerous for that state’s leadership.59



In addition, there are some cases in which the United States itself would view arms sales as an inappropriate tool. The Leahy Law, for example, bars the United States from providing security assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed responsible for past human rights abuses.60 More broadly, arms sales are clearly a risky choice when the recipient state is a failed state or when it is engaged in a civil conflict or interstate war. Indeed, in such cases it is often unclear whether there is anyone to negotiate with in the first place, and governments are at best on shaky ground. At present the United States bars 17 such nations from purchasing American arms. As long as these nations are embargoed, arms sales will remain an irrelevant option for exerting influence.61



Apart from these cases, there is a large group of nations with tiny defense budgets that simply don’t buy enough major conventional weaponry to provide much incentive for arms sales. On this list are as many as 112 countries that purchased less than $100 million in arms from the United States between 2002 and 2016, including Venezuela, Jamaica, and Sudan. Lest this category be dismissed because it includes mostly smaller and less strategically significant countries from the American perspective, it should be noted that each of these countries has a vote in the United Nations (and other international organizations) and that many of them suffer from civil conflicts and terrorism, making them potential targets of interest for American policymakers looking for international influence.



By definition, then, the arms-for-influence strategy is limited to cases in which a currently noncompliant country might be willing to change its policies (at least for the right price or to avoid punishment). 



The second problem with the arms for influence strategy is that international pressure in general, whether in the form of economic sanctions, arms sales and embargoes, or military and foreign aid promises and threats, typically has a very limited impact on state behavior. Though again, on paper, the logic of both coercion and buying compliance looks straightforward, research shows that leaders make decisions on the basis of factors other than just the national balance sheet. In particular, leaders tend to respond far more to concerns about national security and their own regime security than they do to external pressure. Arms sales, whether used as carrots or sticks, are in effect a fairly weak version of economic sanctions, which research has shown have limited effects, even when approved by the United Nations, and tend to spawn a host of unintended consequences. As such, the expectations for their utility should be even more limited.62 A recent study regarding the impact of economic sanctions came to a similar conclusion, noting that, “The economic impact of sanctions may be pronounced . . . but other factors in the situational context almost always overshadow the impact of sanctions in determining the political outcome.”63 The authors of another study evaluating the impact of military aid concur, arguing that, “In general we find that military aid does not lead to more cooperative behavior on the part of the recipient state. With limited exceptions, increasing levels of U.S. aid are linked to a significant reduction in cooperative foreign policy behavior.”64



Perhaps the most explicit evidence of the difficulty the United States has had exerting this kind of leverage came during the Reagan administration. Sen. Robert Kasten Jr. (R-WI) signaled the concern of many when he said, “Many countries to whom we dispense aid continue to thumb their noses at us” at the United Nations, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the president to limit aid to any state that repeatedly voted in opposition to the United States at the UN.65 In 1986, the Reagan administration began to monitor voting patterns and issue threats, and, in roughly 20 cases in 1987 and 1988, it lowered the amount of aid sent to nations the administration felt were not deferential enough. An analysis of the results, however, found no linkage between changes in American support and UN voting patterns by recipient states. The authors’ conclusion fits neatly within the broader literature about the limited impact of sanctions: “The resilience of aid recipients clearly demonstrates that their policies were driven more powerfully by interests other than the economic threat of a hegemon.”66



The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms sales specifically is quite mixed. U.S. arms sales may have improved Israeli security over the years, for example, but American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a durable peace settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact. Nor have arms sales provided the United States with enough leverage over the years to prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Morocco from invading their neighbors. Nor have arms sales helped restrain the human rights abuses of clients like Chile or Libya, or various Middle Eastern client states. Although the United States has used the promise of arms sales or the threat of denying arms successfully from time to time, the failures outnumber the victories. The most rigorous study conducted to tease out the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are successful is a 1994 study by John Sislin.67 Collating 191 attempts between 1950 and 1992, Sislin codes 80 of those attempts (42 percent) successful. Sislin’s analysis is incomplete, however, since he looks only at the immediate benefits of arms sales and does not consider the long-term consequences. 



Furthermore, a close look at the supposedly successful attempts reveals that many of them are cases in which the United States is in fact simply buying something rather than actually “influencing” another nation. Thirty of the cases Sislin coded as successful were instances of the United States using arms to buy access to military bases (20 cases) or to raw materials (5 cases) or to encourage countries to buy more American weapons (5 cases).68 Without those in the dataset, the U.S. success rate drops to 31 percent.



Finally, the conditions for successful leverage seeking appear to be deteriorating. First, Sislin’s study found that American influence was at its height during the Cold War when American power overshadowed the rest of the world. With the leveling out of the global distribution of power, both economic and military, the ability of the United States to exert influence has waned, regardless of the specific tool being used. Second, as noted above, the U.S. share of the global arms market has declined as the industry has become more competitive and, as a result, American promises and threats carry less weight than before. As William Hartung noted, “The odds [of] buying political loyalty via arms transfers are incalculably higher [worse] in a world in which there are dozens of nations to turn to in shopping for major combat equipment.”69



Though arms sales are of marginal value to national security and the pursuit of national interests, their negative consequences are varied and often severe. Arms sales can spawn unwanted outcomes on three levels: blowback against the United States and entanglement in conflicts; regional consequences in the buyer’s neighborhood, such as the dispersion of weapons and increased instability; and consequences for the buyer itself, such as increased levels of corruption, human rights abuses, and civil conflict.



Effects on the United States. Though the goal of arms sales is to promote American security and U.S. interests abroad, at least two possible outcomes can cause serious consequences for the United States. The first of these — blowback — occurs when a former ally turns into an adversary and uses the weapons against the United States. The second — entanglement — is a process whereby an arms sales relationship draws the United States into a greater level of unwanted intervention.



Blowback. The fact that the United States has sold weapons to almost every nation on earth, combined with frequent military intervention, means that blowback is an inescapable outcome of U.S. arms sales policy. American troops and their allies have faced American-made weapons in almost every military engagement since the end of the Cold War, including in Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. And even where the United States has not yet engaged in combat, American arms sales have bolstered the military capabilities of adversaries once counted as friendly.



Blowback can occur in at least three ways. First, a previously friendly regime becomes unfriendly. For example, the United States sold billions of dollars in weapons to the Shah of Iran during the 1970s in the hopes that Iran would provide a stabilizing influence on the Middle East. The sales included everything from fighter jets for air campaigns to surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy fighters.70 After the 1979 revolution, however, Iran used those weapons in its war with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in the region. Panama, the recipient of decades of American military assistance, as well as host to a major military base and 9,000 U.S. troops, was a similar case. In 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega — himself a CIA asset for more than 20 years — took power and threatened U.S. citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that featured American troops facing American weapons.71



Blowback also occurs when the United States sells weapons to nations (or transfers them to nonstate actors) that, though not allies, simply did not register as potential adversaries at the time of the sale. The United States, for example, sold surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks, and armored personnel carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. Few officials would have imagined that the United States would find itself intervening in Somalia in 1992, or that the United States and its allies would provide billions in weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an effort to balance against Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the battlefield to reverse its annexation of Kuwait.72



And finally, blowback can occur when U.S. weapons are sold or stolen from the government that bought them and wind up on the battlefield in the hands of the adversary. For example, the Reagan administration covertly provided Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s; they in turn sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea, among others. More recently, the Islamic State managed to capture from the Iraqi government a stunning number of Humvees and tanks the United States had sold to Iraq to rebuild its military capabilities after the 2003 invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to supply three divisions of a conventional army.73



These examples of blowback demonstrate how difficult it can be to forecast the long-term outcomes of arms sales and how obvious it is that selling weapons carries a number of risks. Predicting what exactly will happen is hard, but predicting that arms sales to clients with red flags are likely to end badly is quite easy. Iraq was a fragile state ravaged by a decade’s worth of American intervention and rife with terrorism and civil conflict; to transfer such large quantities of weapons to its military and police force under such conditions was to invite disaster. 



Entanglement. Arms sales raise the risk of entanglement in two ways. First, they can represent early steps down the slippery slope to unwise military intervention. Consider a case like the Syrian civil war or the many cases during the Cold War in which the United States wanted to support rebels and freedom fighters against oppressive governments.74 In the majority of those cases, American leaders were wary of intervening directly. Instead, the United States tended to rely on money, training, and arms sales. But by taking concrete steps like arms sales to support rebel groups, Washington’s psychological investment in the outcome tends to rise, as do the political stakes for the president, who will be judged on whether his efforts at support are successful or not. As we saw in the Syrian civil war, for example, Barack Obama’s early efforts to arm Syrian rebels were roundly criticized as feckless, increasing pressure on him to intervene more seriously.75



History does not provide much guidance about how serious the risk of this form of entanglement might be. During the Cold War, presidents from Nixon onward viewed arms sales as a substitute for sending American troops to do battle with communist forces around the world. The result was an astonishing amount of weaponry transferred or sold to Third World nations, many of which were engaged in active conflicts both external and internal. The risk of superpower conflict made it dangerous to intervene directly; accordingly, the Cold War–era risk of entanglement from arms sales was low.76 Today, however, the United States does not face nearly as many constraints on its behavior, as its track record of near-constant military intervention since the end of the Cold War indicates. As a result, the risk of arms sales helping trigger future military intervention is real, even if it cannot be measured precisely.



The second way in which arms sales might entangle the United States is by creating new disputes or exacerbating existing tensions. U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units fighting in Syria against the Islamic State, for example, have ignited tensions between the United States and its NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Kurds as a serious threat to Turkish sovereignty and stability.77 Meanwhile, ongoing arms sales to NATO nations and to other allies like South Korea and Taiwan have exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and North Korea, raising the risk of escalation and the possibility that the United States might wind up involved in a direct conflict.78



Regional Effects. Arms sales do not just affect the recipient nation; they also affect the local balance of power, often causing ripple effects throughout the region. Though advocates of arms sales trumpet their stabilizing influence, as we have noted above, arms sales often lead to greater tension, less stability, and more conflict. Because of this — and the complementary problem of weapons dispersion — the regional impact of arms sales is less predictable and more problematic than advocates acknowledge.



Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First, arms sales can make conflict more likely.79 This may occur because recipients of new weapons feel more confident about launching attacks or because changes in the local balance of power can fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others. A study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, for example, found that although arms sales appeared to have some restraining effect on major-power allies, they had the opposite effect in other cases, and concluded that “increased arms transfers from major powers make states significantly more likely to be militarized dispute initiators.”80 Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that “arms transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased probability of war.”81 Recent history provides supporting evidence for these findings: since 2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer of American weapons, has intervened to varying degrees in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar.



Second, arms sales can also prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts and erode rather than promote regional stability. Few governments, and fewer insurgencies, have large enough weapons stocks to fight for long without resupply.82 The tendency of external powers to arm the side they support, however understandable strategically, has the inevitable result of allowing the conflict to continue at a higher level of intensity than would otherwise be the case. As one study of arms sales to Africa notes, “Weapons imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and carnage.”83



Third, this dynamic appears to be particularly troublesome with respect to internal conflicts. Jennifer Erickson, for example, found that recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more likely to engage in internal conflicts than other states. Though halting arms sales alone is not a panacea for peace and stability, arms embargoes can help lessen the destructiveness of combat in both civil and interstate wars simply by restricting access to the means of violence.84



Finally, because of their effects on both interstate and internal conflict, arms sales can also erode rather than promote regional stability. As noted in the previous section, where the United States seeks to manage regional balances of power, arms sales often create tension, whether because the American role in the region threatens others or because American clients feel emboldened. The Middle East, for example, has seesawed between violence and tense standoffs for the past many decades, at first because of Cold War competition and more recently because of the American war on terror. The notion that increased U.S. arms sales since 9/11 made the Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the least. Similarly, though many argue that American security commitments to countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have produced greater stability, there is a strong case to be made that the opposite is now true. American support of South Korea has driven North Korea to develop nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S. missile defense systems in South Korea has aggravated China, and American support of Taiwan produces continual tension between the two powers.85



Dispersion. The United States uses a number of procedures to try to ensure that the weapons it sells actually go to authorized customers and to monitor the end use of the weapons so that they do not wind up being used for nefarious purposes. The Department of State even compiles a list of banned countries, brokers, and customers. But most of these tools have proved ineffectual.86



Programs like Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry aim to shed light on the service life of American weapons sold abroad through end-use monitoring.87 While the description of U.S. end-use monitoring (“pre-license, post-license/pre-shipment, and post-shipment”) sounds comprehensive, it’s actually anything but. In fiscal year 2016, the agency in charge of approving and monitoring arms sales, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), authorized 38,398 export-license applications — down more than 50 percent from 2012 after the government shifted some weapons to the Department of Commerce’s purview.88 To oversee more than 35,000 export licenses annually, the DDTC has a full-time staff of only 171 people. The Blue Lantern program is executed by embassy staff in recipient countries but administered back in Washington by only nine State Department employees and three contractors.89 Twelve people can’t possibly track everything that happens to billions of dollars’ worth of advanced weaponry transferred to dozens of countries abroad each year. 



Nor is the process designed to correct problems. On one hand, end-use violations can result in individuals and companies being prevented from making future purchases. On the other hand, there is no evidence that end-use monitoring has changed the pattern of American arms sales in any way. The United States in truth has little or no control over what happens to the weapons it sells to other nations. The result is that year after year weapons of all kinds end up falling into the hands of unreliable, risky, or just plain bad actors, at which point they’re used in ways neither the United States nor its customers intended. American weapons have frequently wound up being used against Americans in combat. And even more often, local and regional actors, including criminal gangs, have employed them in their own conflicts. In civil wars, regime collapse, or other extreme cases, factions steal weapons and use them for their own purposes, as ISIS did in Iraq.90



Iraq, as previously noted, provides an excellent case study in the inability of the United States to prevent dispersion. As part of U.S. efforts to rebuild Iraq’s military and security capabilities after the 2003 invasion, the United States sent Iraq roughly $2.5 billion worth of American weapons through 2014, including everything from small arms to “armored personnel carriers, military helicopters, transport aircraft, anti-tank missiles, tanks, artillery and drones.” 91



Despite the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in-country and the very close relationship between those troops and their Iraqi counterparts, many of those weapons went missing. Between 2003 and 2008 alone, 360,000 out of 1 million small arms disappeared, along with 2,300 Humvees. A sizable chunk of this weaponry would later end up in the hands of ISIS. The Iraqi army, trained and equipped by the American military, dissolved when faced by ISIS and left their weapons behind for the terrorist group to pick up and use for conquering and holding territory. A UN Security Council report found that in June 2014 alone “ISIS seized sufficient Iraqi government stocks from the provinces of Anbar and Salah al-Din to arm and equip more than three Iraqi conventional army divisions.”92 Data collected by Conflict Armament Research in July and August of 2014 showed that 20 percent of ISIS’s ammunition was manufactured in the United States — likely seized from Iraqi military stocks.93 In short, dispersion enabled the spread of ISIS and dramatically raised the costs and dangers of confronting the group on the battlefield. 



Regime Effects. Finally, arms sales can also have deleterious effects on recipient nations — promoting government oppression, instability, and military coups. As part of the war on drugs, America inadvertently enabled the practice of forced disappearances. In the cases of Colombia, the Philippines, and Mexico, American weapons feed a dangerous cycle of corruption and oppression involving the police, the military, and political leaders.94 Though the United States provides weapons to Mexico ostensibly for counternarcotics operations, the arms transferred to the country often end up being used by police to oppress citizens, reinforcing the “climate of generalized violence in the country [that] carries with it grave consequences for the rule of law.”95 Similarly, in Colombia and the Philippines the United States has supplied arms in an effort to support governments against external threats or internal factions and to combat drug trafficking, but with mixed results. A study of military aid to Colombia found that “in environments such as Colombia, international military assistance can strengthen armed nonstate actors, who rival the government over the use of violence.”96



Recent research reveals that American assistance programs, like foreign military officer training, can increase the likelihood of military coups. U.S. training programs frequently bought by other nations, most notably International Military Education and Training (IMET), gave formal training to the leaders of the 2009 Honduran coup, the 2012 Mali coup, and the 2013 Egyptian coup.97 In these cases, the training that was supposed to stabilize the country provided military leaders with the tools to overthrow the government they were meant to support. 



So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact that greatly reducing arms sales would also produce two significant benefits for the United States that cannot otherwise be enjoyed.



The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be greater diplomatic flexibility and leverage. Critics might argue that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will eliminate a potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the contrary, the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh the potential leverage or other benefits from arms sales. Most importantly, by refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, the United States will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all parties as an honest broker. The inherent difficulty of negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with respect to North and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North Korea clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts to help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians have long been complicated by American support for Israel. To stop arming one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the United States does not have a preferred outcome in such cases. Rather, by staying out of the military domain the United States can more readily encourage dialogue and diplomacy. 



Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases where the United States has an entrenched interest. In the case of Taiwan, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons do not have to be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would help defuse U.S.–China tensions. Even if Taiwan’s defenses remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan’s behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.–China diplomacy in general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific region. Most important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and China.



The second major benefit of reducing arms sales is that it would imbue the United States with greater moral authority. Today, as the leading arms-dealing nation in the world, the United States lacks credibility in discussions of arms control and nonproliferation, especially in light of its military interventionism since 2001. By showing the world that it is ready to choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States would provide a huge boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation and its negative consequences. This is important because the United States has pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and nonproliferation objectives. The United States is a signatory of treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology, land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of conventional weapons of all kinds. The effectiveness of these treaties, and the ability to create more effective and enduring arms control and nonproliferation frameworks, however, depends on how the United States behaves.



This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure their security and survival through deterrence and military strength. Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet the demand. But history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and weapons bans typically require great-power support. In 1969, for example, Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on such weapons. By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention passed and has since been signed by 178 nations.98 In 1991 President George H. W. Bush unilaterally renounced the use of chemical weapons. By 1993 the United States had signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which now has 192 signatories.99 Both of these efforts succeeded in part because the United States took decisive early action in the absence of any promises about how others would respond.100 Without U.S. leadership, any effort to limit proliferation of major conventional weapons and dangerous emerging technologies is likely to fail. 



The United States should reorient its arms sales policy to ensure that sales provide strategic benefits and to avoid producing negative unintended consequences. At a practical level, this means reducing arms sales dramatically, especially to nations with high risk factors for negative outcomes. Officials should look for other ways to conduct foreign policy in situations where arms sales have been common tactics — such as when the United States negotiates access to military bases or seeks cooperation in the war on terror. The arms sales process should also be revised in order to ensure that all sales receive more thorough scrutiny than has been the case to date.



To implement this new vision for arms sales we recommend the following steps:



Selling major conventional weapons is a risky business, especially to nations where conditions are ripe for bad outcomes. After decades of selling weapons to almost any nation that asks, enough evidence has accumulated to make it clear that the costs outweigh the benefits. Policy change is long overdue.



Unfortunately, Donald Trump has embraced the conventional wisdom. In addition to the massive $110 billion deal with Saudi Arabia, Trump has seized on the tensions with North Korea to encourage Japan and other Asian allies to buy more American weapons. For Trump, the rationale was simple: “It’s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan.”101



As we have argued here, this conventional wisdom is misguided. Instead of turning first to arms sales, which are likely to inflame tensions in hot spots like the Pacific Rim or the Middle East, the United States should rely more heavily on diplomacy. The United States does not need the limited economic benefits arms sales provide — and it certainly does not need the strategic headaches that come with them.





 _Fuel to the Fire_ provides an assessment of Trump's America First doctrine, its performance to date, and its implications for the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of readers have brought up the latest on the Solar Impulse 2 project, the solar-powered plane designed by a couple of Europeans to showcase the “unlimited” potential of solar energy in a “solo flight” around the world. Here’s the latest news.

The Solar Impulse 2 plane was launched from Abu Dhabi, amid much media fanfare, on March 9 this year. Today, almost 200 days later involving 8 legs, it is now stuck in Hawaii and it is not going anywhere. So much for the dream.
It turns out that instead of bringing attention to the technology’s potential, the project has only brightly highlighted solar energy’s shortcomings and the technology’s glaring inferiority. Indeed the plane needs the dimensions of a jumbo jet – just to carry the payload of a car.
Today, some six months later (almost 200 days), we see the solar contraption has yet to even reach the halfway point of it’s planned around the world journey. The plane and its pilots are firmly grounded in Hawaii due to an array of technical problems. In comparison a fossil-fueled jetliner would have completed the trip hundreds of times by now, and that while carrying a payload hundreds of times greater.
Greenhouse gas nightmare
I blogged on Solar Impulse 2 earlier here. We saw that the endeavor had been everything but successful – even at that point – and that it was in fact a greenhouse gas nightmare.
To put the project’s performance in some perspective, let us recall how Jules Verne’s fictional characters Phileas Fogg and his valet Passepartout were able to complete their trip around the world in just 80 days – and that in a balloon back in the 19th century! Today we find ourselves in the 21st century and now around-the-world trips with the “latest pioneering technology” are taking some 500 days. Don’t you just love progress? Passepartout’s and Fogg’s balloon would have long since arrived by now.

Conceivably one almost could make the trip more quickly by foot, over land, and sailboat over sea.
This so-called “pioneering solo flight” in reality involved the burning of tens of thousands of liters of fossil fuels because an entire support crew had to be flown along in a fossil fuel powered jet. The fixed-wing Solar Impulse 2 departed Abu Dhabi on March 9 and was planned to continue to India, China, Hawaii, Phoenix, New York, Morocco before finally coming full circle back to Abu Dhabi – sometime in August, 2015 – and “without emitting any climate gases”.
Wikipedia has since revised the clean plane’s timetable. Now the trip should be completed next year.
During the summer it was reported by a handful of media outlets that the plane had been forced to land in Hawaii because of “irreversible damage” to its lithium ion battery system. Getting the replacements parts for the plane would take months and so the plane would be grounded for 9 months, according to reports.
Not enough sun to power the aircraft
This is not the first setback for the Impulse 2. It has since become obvious that the technology is woefully unfit to handle poor weather conditions. Back in May the pilots had to detour to Japan due to bad weather conditions from a cold front. And now that summer is over, there is not going to be enough sunshine in the northern hemisphere to keep the solar-powered plane flying. The result: an extended months-long stay in Hawaii. So tough can failure be.
The pilots now say they will try to complete the remainder of the trip – sometime later in 2016…very likely well over 500 days after their departure. The latest target. we suppose, is to arrive less than one year late.
How will the team look back and rate the project once it ends? They could take the approach once proposed by one US senator on the Vietnam War debacle: “We should declare victory and get the hell out.” Expect nothing less.

Trial by jury is one of the most celebrated rights in the American Constitution, but what if the accused person would rather be tried by a judge instead? That question has vexed the American legal system for generations.



Dylann Roof is facing the death penalty for the shocking murder of nine African‐​Americans during a church meeting in Charleston, South Carolina last year. Because of the publicity surrounding his case and the antipathy of the community, Roof requested that he be tried by a judge. Yet, under federal law, prosecutors have the option to accept or reject a jury trial waiver, and they quickly vetoed Roof’s bid. His trial is expected to begin in November.



Prosecutors typically approach a jury waiver from a narrow, tactical mindset. That is, if they believe they have a better chance to prevail if the case goes to a jury, they will insist on that procedure. Of course, by requesting a trial before a judge, we know that the accused has reached the opposite conclusion—that an acquittal is more likely if the case were tried before the court. Between those two competing claims one would think that American jurisprudence would side with the individual, not the government.



Unfortunately, the modern trend favors the government. Today, prosecutors routinely deny jury trials to individuals who request them. Yet, in situations where the government is required by law to allow juries, prosecutors suddenly demand a jury when particular persons request to be tried by a judge. As a result, we now have the spectacle of prosecutors imposing bench trials on people who want jury trials and jury trials on individuals who request bench trials. If the decision were left strictly to the accused, the appearance of gamesmanship would end. Since prosecutors should already possess the evidence necessary to convict, they ought to be indifferent to the mode of trial.





The political climate is supposed to be receptive to criminal justice reform. If that is so, lawmakers should tweak federal law and give persons who are accused of crimes the choice of judge or jury.



In 1965, a man named Mortimer Singer asked the Supreme Court to recognize an unconditional right to trial by judge. He argued that the jury trial provision was written for the benefit of the accused and that each person should decide for himself whether to accept that benefit. That’s a strong argument. After all, the very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect the individual against overweening government. The Constitution guarantees a right to a “speedy trial,” but it would be perverse to arrest a man one evening and then prosecute him the following day before a legal defense could be thoroughly prepared. If the accused wants a speedy trial, he should get one, but if he wants to delay his trial so that his attorneys can properly prepare, he should get that also. The Constitution also guarantees “the assistance of counsel,” but it would be wrong for the government to say that a defendant cannot represent himself if that is how he wants to proceed. Alas, the Supreme Court has not followed this logic with respect to persons who wish to waive their right to a jury trial.



The court’s stubborn denial of an unfettered right to trial by judge is puzzling because it is hard to find a good reason for it. The impact on the overall system would be very limited. First, most cases are resolved by plea bargains, not trials. Second, a jury trial conviction requires a unanimous vote so the prosecution must persuade twelve jurors that the accused person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. For bench trials, the prosecution only needs to persuade one person, the judge. That math explains why the persons going to trial will ordinarily opt for a jury.



Still, there are circumstances in which the accused may wish to take his case to a judge. Any case that has generated intense media coverage runs a risk that at least some jurors harbor some partial opinions before the case has begun. Even if jurors have not been following the news reports, some may not be able to withstand pressures from the community to render the conviction that some protesters and local activists demand.



Some criminal cases may involve legal issues that are complex. A person accused of tax fraud, for example, might want a judge to hear how his tax return was prepared. Maybe the return contained errors, but a close examination of the tax laws may show an innocent explanation for those errors that would easily make sense to a person trained in the law.



Sometimes a defendant wants to testify in his own defense, but will be advised against it. Public defenders fear that jurors will be hopelessly biased after hearing about a record of previous arrests. Under the evidence rules, prosecutors can use criminal records to cross‐​examine any person who takes the witness stand. Even though a 10‐​year‐​old arrest for assault and battery does not help to determine whether the accused committed a battery last month, it will sway the opinions of some jurors. Since judges see all kinds of cases in their courtrooms, they would be far less susceptible to prosecutorial rhetoric about the past offense and focus more intently on the evidence in the more recent incident.



Interestingly, some state courts, such as Maryland, have recognized the right of the accused to opt for a trial by judge. Two of the police officers in the Freddie Gray case have chosen to be tried by a judge instead of a jury.



The political climate is supposed to be receptive to criminal justice reform. If that is so, lawmakers should tweak federal law and give persons who are accused of crimes the choice of judge or jury.

The recent climate skeptic witch hunt, even against people like Dr. Roger Pielke Jr., who ISN’T a climate skeptic but has presented some data on severe weather losses that contradict the current meme of “severe weather caused by global warming”, prompted Josh to pen a new cartoon.
He gets right to the source of the whole fossil fuel problem.

"Criticism of sport hunting nearly always focuses on whether hunting is cruel or not. A good example was provided by the recent controversy surrounding Melissa Bachmann, a keen hunter and television personality who posted a photo of herself with a lion trophy on Facebook. She has been heavily criticised, even threatened for her actions. But there are more interesting and important questions – what does sport hunting lead to? And could limited hunting actually help populations increase? A study published today from researchers at Imperial College London, Stirling and Cape Town Universities uses population models to map the effects of a hunting quota on lion numbers. In its model, the paper found a lion population would rise from 30 to 100 individuals in 30 years. This in turn would allow the quota of lions allowed for hunting to go up from 15 to 22. With hunters prepared to pay US$125,000 to take home a lion trophy, this means the land could be profitable as wild habitat, and hence conserved, rather than turned over to farming. The idea of setting quotas for sport hunting to increase numbers of lions is anchored to a particular, economic valuation of nature that has become popular. This approach holds that the application of market principles can solve everything from loss of charismatic species such as pandas, rhinos or elephants, to mitigating the effects of climate change. Examples include payments for ecosystem services (PES), or the “natural capital” model, carbon trading, adopt-an-animal schemes, green certification labels, ecotourism and sport hunting. These are central pillars of the “green economy”, backed by a UNEP report that was discussed centre stage at Rio+20 in 2012. The green economy assumes jobs, income and benefits will be developed by encouraging environmentally sustainable behaviour. Sport hunting of lions fits right in to this. But for many, placing our trust in the green economy is a worry – it could lead to concentrations of money and power, it might deepen existing inequalities, and there is no guarantee that it will lead to a greener economy in the future. NGOs such as Born Free Foundation, Humane Society International and International Fund for Animal Welfare have all argued against sport hunting, citing its cruelty and pointing to scandals such as canned hunting. Other conservation NGOs, such as WWF take a less critical view, and do not oppose sport hunting per se, reflecting the long historical relationships between hunting and conservation. This is an important and worthwhile debate, it is one that needs to be had, but it misses a critical point: if we rely on economic incentives to conserve rhino, for example, what happens when those incentives are reduced? South Africa has permitted sport hunting of white rhino since 1968, and it provides some lessons that we need to take seriously. IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group data indicate that that since hunting began the numbers of Southern white rhino have increased from 1,800 to over 20,000. There is no doubt that sport hunting and expansion of rhino numbers occurred simultaneously. But these days most rhino are in private hands because owners have an economic incentive to increase rhino range and numbers: the more rhino they have, the more they can sell to sport hunters. This apparent success story is more complex than it first appears. The trade in rhino parts (notably rhino horn) is banned under the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), so rhinos can only be “sold” as sport hunting trophies or as a star attraction in safari tourism. As demand for rhino horn grows, the only way of obtaining it is via increasing levels of illegal hunting. As a result, the cost of protecting rhinos has risen, while the revenue from hunting rhinos has stagnated or even fallen. A key threat that rhinos face today is disinvestment by private owners who cannot afford to keep them. This has led to vocal calls to legalise a rhino horn trade to boost incentives for private owners – at the moment in “rational” or market terms, it does not make sense for private owners to continue to pay the considerable costs of their upkeep. A second critical, but often invisible, concern is that the revenues from sport hunting merely concentrate power and wealth in existing hands. It is common to hear the argument that hunting provides an important source of income and employment for rural communities in poorer parts of the world. It is the case that sport hunting brings jobs for some, and income for some. But the economic benefits are not spread widely, and the profits overwhelmingly go to those able to set up “luxury safari experiences” on private land in the first place – the rich.  Poorer rural communities are relegated to more menial and lower paid tasks – they are the cleaners, cooks, waiters, guides and rangers, and not (with some exceptions) the owners. The narrow focus on jobs and income, the rush to launch new tourism and sport hunting ventures means that often we do not consider other approaches to developing the local economy. If the objective is solely to increase lion numbers, then yes, sustainable hunting quotas are likely to work, just as they worked for white rhinos. But, with serious concern over social inequality, we should ask whether increasing animals numbers is the only measure we wish to apply."

From Oklahoma Mesonet – State Climatologist Gary McManus – (h/t to WUWT reader Patricia)
Will Oklahoma set a tornado record this year??
Finally, a climate/weather extreme we can all be happy about…a possible record low number of tornadoes this year. I’ve done all the searching/perusing/data
mining allowed on a browser for OK tornado counts this year (i.e., I looked it up on the NWS-Norman website) and found the total number of tornadoes this year
to still be sitting at 13. The count is only through June, but I can’t find any other reports of possible tornadoes after June either, so let’s assume that count,
albeit preliminary, is good through September.

First off, that would be the second lowest total through September dating back to the beginning of official statistics in 1950. Only 1988 had a lower Jan-Sept
total with 12.
Second, 1988 is the current record holder for lowest annual total of tornadoes with 17. But, 1988 is also a cautionary tale for those thinking no more tornadoes
are likely to occur. After the 12 touched down in the first nine months of the year, five more touched down in November, of all months. That’s tied for the
sixth greatest total for November. So even during a record benign twister year, an uncommon month like November can jump up and bite you. It doesn’t look like
any of those tornadoes were serious, at least no injuries or deaths were reported, but that is all dependent on where they strike and the strength.
C. Even if we see the average number of tornadoes for Oct-Dec, which based on 1950-2013 data stands at 3.9 tornadoes, we will still see a tie with 1988 for
the record lowest number of tornadoes at 17.

I don’t often read anything written by Heather Du Plessis-Allan, she kind of winds me up so I just don’t click on her articles. But her latest ‘Premium’ [article ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12289498)in _[‘A newspaper’](https://thebfd.co.nz/the-bfd-dictionary/)_ piqued my interest.



I had been thinking about doing a post about the [Woman Who Isn’t Maori](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/i-am-not-maori/) that Christie wrote about this week. You may recall the story was about a woman who objected to the constant addition of Maori words and phrases into Air New Zealand’s correspondence. She felt that it was all getting beyond a joke and chose to let Air NZ know of her feelings.



Well as I flew up to the big smoke on Saturday for _The BFD_ Christmas get together, (on Air New Zealand as I was keen to actually arrive), I had been jotting down a few of the seemingly ridiculous Maori translations that are included in their quiz that is designed to keep you entertained while waiting for your cup of tea and Cookietime.



Who knew that Maori had a word for Italian Football? (Poiwhana Iteria apparently!).



Then I was bored and having finished my Top Gear magazine, started flicking through the Air New Zealand in-flight magazine enticingly entitled ‘Kia Ora’ (Gidday), where I found articles extolling some of Air New Zealand’s more woke virtues such as saving the planet from evil climates, women are awesome so can do anything, and their various programs encouraging diversity and inclusion wanting not just fat, tattooed, alphabet people with disabilities, but lots of Te Reo (Maori) speakers as well.



It seems that Air NZ is on a massive kick to Maori up their staff and have instigated quite a number of avenues for their people to get their culture on. Hell they even won the inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Team Award at the 2019 International Air Transport Association AGM recently! (That one’s going straight to the pool room!)



So I can understand why the ‘Woman Who Isn’t Maori’ decided to make herself heard, but her reasons are for her to explain, not for HDPA to tell **her** how she feels.



Heather’s story really is a bit of a big fat nothing and as it is ‘Premium’ you have to have stumped up your own hard-earned to be able to view it, (or just find out how to beat their paywall which really is ridiculously easy although I’m not going to tell you in case they figure it out and close that particularly loopy-hole).



Anyway, here is a short compilation of some of the silly presumptions that Heather trots out…



_**She knows** you don’t have to be Maori to understand the phrase “kia ora”_. 



… _she should see my third-year class. **It’d blow her mind**. _



_Goes without saying **she wouldn’t be surprised**_ …



_**She’d probably be expecting…**_



**_She’d probably also be expecting…_**



 _But, **she might be surprised** to…_



 _Which, as I said, **would blow the mind** of the ‘Woman Who Isn’t Maori.’ _



_…if the ‘Woman Who Isn’t Maori’ met them in a pub, **she would probably think** …_



_**She’d get a surprise.**_



_I’m going to hazard a guess that **she’s probably feeling a bit raw** …_



_**I’d bet someone at some stage has told her off…**_



_I can understand why **that would rub her up the wrong way**. _



_**She’s feeling under siege.**_



Geeze that’s very presumptuous of Heather to think she knows how the woman feels, thinks and will react. It’s almost as if she was just trying to make up an interesting story using her own projected feelings. If not just Straw-Manning the argument of course.



Maybe HDPA was just running a little late and had to whack something out at the last minute, but you know, she’s one of our elite, premium, trained and skilled journos, so there’s a good reader, please just sit back and let her tell you what to think, and how to feel.



Ps. We will never tell you how you feel. We do it the other way around, we prefer to hear how you feel about our stories. Remember to stick to the rules when commenting though as I can reveal that all the Mods were presented with brand new, engraved ban hammers at the Christmas do, although I’m not sure how Nige got his home as he only had carry-on and I’m pretty sure you’re still not allowed to take hammers onto Air New Zealand planes. Although I’m sure HDPA will be able to sniff out a loophole easy enough.

Michael Crichton’s _State of Fear_ revolves around the plot in which climate change zealots attempt to stage mass murder in order to publicise what they believe to be the dangers of global warming. Crichton’s particular plot device might sound far-fetched – but not by much, to anyone familiar with the violent catastrophism of eco-terrorists. We see, again and again, just how much the [Krazy Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/) are willing to lie and deceive in order to get their way.



In particular, they just love their puppets and stooges and trying to bamboozle the public with stage-managed PR stunts. Their current mascot, for instance, is the most carefully manufactured [“child hero”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/yes-greta-people-are-dying-you-your-friends-are-killing-them/) since the Soviets crafted the Pavlik Morozov cult.



At the other end of the spectrum, the Klimate Kult have manufactured a fake council of greybeards in order to try and scare us into submission.



Climate activist Tim Flannery is the force behind a band of former state fire and emergency chiefs accusing Scott Morrison of abandoning­ bushfires across the nation and demanding an immediat­e end to the burning of fossil fuels.



The Australian has confirmed Emergency Leaders for Clima­te Action — 29 ex-fire chiefs led by former NSW Fire and Rescue commissioner Greg Mullins — is funded by Professor Flannery’s crowd-funded Climate Council as an official “project”.



Note the “crowd-funded”: after the Abbott government turned off Flannery’s pipeline of taxpayer’s money, the [Great Predicto](https://www.riteon.org.au/tim-flannery-professor-of-dud-predictions-and-climate-falsehoods/) has had to shill for donations. Like all donation-hungry activists, Flannery desperately needs a constant stream of scare-stories and opportunistic stunts to convince the rubes to hand over the dosh.



A source close to the Climate Council claimed it was “largely a vehicle for Tim Flannery” […] [who] has sparked past criticism that he is an alarmist for urging that coal-fired power stations­ be shut down and for suggesting Perth could become the nation’s “first ghost town” based on its scarce water supply.



The chief executive of his Climate Council is Amanda McKenzie, a former board member of the Labor-linked Whitlam Institute and founder of the Australian Youth Climate Coalitio­n, the activist group that has sponsored climate change protests by schoolchildren in Canberra and other capital cities.



The “authoritativeness” of these “Emergency Leaders” can be judged by their readiness to trot out the same old deceptive alarmist talking-points.



Mr Mullins said on Tuesday it was “no good saying we’re only a small emitter” of carbon dioxide pollutio­n and it was “simply not true” when Australia ranked 17th in the world, and was the world’s No 5 emitter when coal exports were taken into account.



While it is true that Australia is ranked 17th, this is a grossly misleading comparison, because the top five emitters account for 65% of global emissions. China alone accounts for 30% of global emissions – and rising. Beyond those, every other country is responsible for a tiny fraction each of the remainder. **There is less than 1% of difference between 17th-ranked Australian and 83rd-ranked Tunisia.**



Taking coal exports into account is a particularly egregious bit of double-speak which lets shocking emitters like China and India off the hook.



Flannery’s little clown show is also completely ignoring the blunt admission of climate scientists (which Flannery is not) that the drought which is the actual cause of these fires **cannot be linked to climate change.**



Flannery can now add another strike to his appalling record of dud predictions and Chicken Little alarmism.

"LONDON  —   America’s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends. They have heard the mantra “America First” from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump’s denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world. Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself  —   ironies notwithstanding  —   as a champion for global engagement. “We’ve always said that America is our best friend,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup  —   comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency  —   said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. “If that’s no longer the case, if that’s what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends. ” “China is a very strong candidate for that,” he added. “The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn’t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends. ” On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. “The two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,” a German government spokesman later said in a written statement. The swift reassessment of trade relations  —   a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II  —   only amplifies the potential for a   of the broader geopolitical framework. Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, the   island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values. Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail. But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the   Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China’s growing influence. Then, on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall  —   resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war. “I’m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,” said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “One would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that’s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly. ” The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the   magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had “a very good call” with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico “has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,” he said. “I’m not going to let that happen. ” Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen. Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7, 000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Juárez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries. Mr. Trump’s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell’s work force. “They hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,” he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But in the end, he said, business will carry on. “In 31 years, I’ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,” he said. “We’ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way. ” Most experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump’s trade posture. Given that nearly   of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage. The three countries are intertwined in the global supply chain. China makes components that go into auto parts manufactured in the United States. Those parts are delivered to factories in Mexico that produce finished vehicles sold to Americans. Calling such vehicles Mexican imports misses that much of the value is produced in the United States, employing American labor. “The idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a   or early   conception of trade,” said Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. “You don’t even know who you’re going to hurt with these kind of things. You’re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end. ” Mr. Trump owes his office in no small measure to factory workers who have come to view global trade as a mortal threat to their livelihoods. But their sentiments are grounded not in ideology, but in a desire for jobs at decent wages. If Mr. Trump impedes imports, he could put some of these voters out of work. Beyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump’s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments. In emphasizing “America First,” Mr. Trump has generated a widespread sense that the country is surrendering its global leadership position. Britain’s abandonment of the European Union has enhanced the view that a period of international integration has devolved to a new era in which nationalist concerns are paramount. On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe. “Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union’s bureaucracy. “Getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. ” With both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision. China is working to assume the mantle. President Xi Jinping of China last week used an address in Davos, to submit his nation’s bid as a reliable champion of expanded trade. China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on   enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi’s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike. At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi’s address, a   private equity fund manager, André   stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era. “We heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world,” he said."

========================================================
Generous climate alarmism: Former IPCC lead author took in $750,000 a year promoting climate catastrophe
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
Recently at our site here we reported on some IPCC-friendly scientists who attempted – by using the US Department of Justice – to silence other climate scientists because they merely held different opinions. 20 scientists requested President Barack Obama in a letter to go after climate skeptics for misleading the American people and profiting from it.
At the very top of the list of the signatories was Prof. Jagadish Shukla of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, a former IPCC lead author. Research revealed, however, that over the past years Shukla himself was involved in lucrative business with his climate alarmism. Roger Pielke Jr. found Shukla and his wife had received a half a million US dollars per year from a supposed non-profit organization for a part-time job. Together with his regular annual salary of 250,000 US dollars from the university, climate alarm for the Shukla family was indeed paying off handsonely, details at Climate Depot.
Steve McIntyre looked into the matter as well and found that Shukla’s annual income was in fact even higher – close to a million dollars. Read his article “Shukla’s Gold” at Climate Audit:
Shukla’s Gold
Roger Pielke Jr. recently made the remarkable discovery that, in addition to his university salary from George Mason University (reported by Pielke as $250,000), Jagadish Shukla, the leader of the RICO20, together with his wife, had received a further $500,000 more in 2014 alone from federal climate grants funnelled through a Shukla-controlled ‘non-profit'(Institute for Global Environment and Security, Inc.), yielding total income in 2014 of approximately $750,000.
Actually, the numbers are even worse than Pielke thought.

Pielke had quoted Shukla’s 2013 university salary, but his university salary had increased more than 25% between 2013 and 2014: from $250,816 in 2013 to $314,000 in 2014. In addition, the “non-profit” organization had also employed one of Shukla’s children (not reported, but say $90,000); and,
IGES transferred $100,000 from its climate grants to a second corporation controlled by the Shukla family (the Institute for Global Education Equality of Opportunity and Prosperity, Inc.), which in turn transferred $100,000 to an educational charity in Shukla’s home town in India, doubtless a worthy charity, but one that Shukla could have supported from his own already generous stipend.
Over a million dollars in total in 2014 alone.”
Continue reading at Climate Audit.
In the meantime the letter to Barack Obama posted at the Institute of Global Environment and Society (IGES) website – the institution from which Shukla received his extravagant allowance: gone. Did someone suddenly get scared because of the payments and brash activism? Today at the IGES website one only finds an advisory stating that the institute had just been disbanded and that the letter (which had been inadvertently put up) is also gone:
The  letter  that  was  inadvertently  posted  on  this  web  site  has  been  removed. It  was  decided more  than  two  years  ago that the  Institute  of  Global  Environment  and  Society  (IGES) would be  dissolved  when  the  projects  then  undertaken  by  IGES  would  be  completed. All  research projects  by  IGES  were  completed  in  July  2015,  and the IGES  web  site  is  in  the  process  of being  decommissioned.”
More research into the matter then showed, however, that the institute cannot be dissolved at all because recently it received another 4 million US dollars for a new research project from the National Science Foundation. The project is supposed to run until 2017. In the meantime the US Congress has taken an interest in the matter to see just how the 63 million dollars in government grant money, which IGES has received since 2001, is compatible with extreme political activism. Moreover the university must check whether the princely paid part-time job complies to the university regulations.
The attempt to muzzle climate scientists who hold other opinions using the Department of Justice has backfired. If anything is learned from all this, it is that it has become obvious that there’s a lot of money to be made with climate alarmism – which was something that previously had always been kept away from the public.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
As many folks know, I’m a fan of good clear detailed data. I’ve been eyeing the buoy data from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for a while. This is the data collected by a large number of buoys moored offshore all around the coast of the US. I like it because it is unaffected by location changes, time of observation, or Urban Heat Island effect, so there’s no need to “adjust” it. However, I haven’t had the patience to download and process it, because my preliminary investigation a while back revealed that there are a number of problems with the dataset. Here’s a photo of the nearest buoy to where I live. I’ve often seen it when I’ve been commercial fishing off the coast here from Bodega Bay or San Francisco … but that’s another story.

And here’s the location of the buoy, it’s the large yellow diamond at the upper left:

The problems with the Bodega Bay buoy dataset, in no particular order, are:
• One file for each year.
• Duplicated lines in a number of the years.
• The number of variables changes in the middle of the dataset, in the middle of a year, adding a column to the record.
• Time units change from hours to hours and minutes in the middle of the dataset, adding another column to the record.
But as the I Ching says, “Perseverance furthers.” I’ve finally been able to beat my way through all of the garbage and I’ve gotten a clean time series of the air temperatures at the Bodega Bay Buoy … here’s that record:

Must be some of that global warming I’ve been hearing about …
Note that there are several gaps in the data
Year 1986 1987 1988 1992 1997 1998 2002 2003 2011

Months  7    1    2    2    8    2    1    1    4
Now, after writing all of that, and putting it up in draft form and almost ready to hit the “Publish” button … I got to wondering if the Berkeley Earth folks used the buoy data. So I took a look, and to my surprise, they have data from no less than 145 of these buoys, including the Bodega Bay buoy … here is the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature dataset for the Bodega Bay buoy:

Now, there are some oddities about this record … first, although it is superficially quite similar to my analysis, a closer look reveals a variety of differences. Could be my error, wouldn’t be the first time … or perhaps they didn’t do as diligent a job as I did of removing duplicates and such. I don’t know the answer.
Next, they list a number of monthly results as being “Quality Control Fail” … I fear I don’t understand that, for a couple of reasons. First, the underlying dataset is not monthly data, or even daily data. It is hourly data … so while the odd hourly record might be wrong, how could a whole month fail quality control? And second, the data is already checked and quality controlled by the NDBC. So what is the basis for the Berkeley Earth claim of multiple failures of quality control on a monthly basis?
Moving on, below is what they say is the appropriate way to adjust the data … let me start by saying, whaa?!? Why on earth would they think that this data needs adjusting? I can find no indication that there has been any change in how the observations are taken, or the like. I see no conceivable reason to adjust it … but nooo, here’s their brilliant plan:

As you can see, once they “adjust” the station for their so-called “Estimated Station Mean Bias”, instead of a gradual cooling, there’s no trend in the data at all … shocking, I know.
One other oddity. There is a gap in their records in 1986-7, as well as in 2011 (see above), but they didn’t indicate a “record gap” (green triangle) as they did elsewhere … why not?
To me, all of this indicates a real problem with the Berkeley Earth computer program used to “adjust” the buoy data … which I assume is the same program used to “adjust” the land stations. Perhaps one of the Berkeley Earth folks would be kind enough to explain all of this …

"**Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey will be ordered to testify over alleged censorship of a controversial New York Post article.**
The article revealed emails and photographs that the New York Post claimed were copied from the laptop of Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.
Twitter said the story had violated its ""hacked materials"" policy, but later changed its stance.
Facebook had limited its spread in the news feed while it was fact-checked.
The move prompted accusations of censorship and pro-Biden bias from Republican lawmakers.
Now, 12 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have voted to compel the two chief executives to testify about their handling of the matter.
Ten democrats sat out the session in protest over an earlier vote on Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination.
Mr Dorsey and Mr Zuckerberg are already due to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee next week, alongside Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, to give evidence over claims of anti-conservative bias.
Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted that ""big tech CEOs are drunk on power and must be held accountable"".
""We will get answers for the American people,"" he wrote.
No date for a hearing has been set.
The New York Post's article focused on an email from a representative of a Ukrainian energy company, sent in April 2015, apparently thanking Hunter Biden for an invite to meet Joe Biden in Washington DC.
Joe Biden was vice-president at the time, and his son was on the board of directors for the energy firm.
There is no evidence that such a meeting ever took place, and previous investigations have never found evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice-president, despite claims form his political opponents.
The New York Post article also contained screenshots that showed private email addresses.
Twitter was criticised for blocking people from sharing the article. It later said that it had done so because the article violated its policies on publishing private information and ""hacked materials"".
Mr Dorsey later acknowledged it had not properly communicated its decision. It later changed its ""hacked materials"" policy.
Facebook limited the spread of the article in its news feed, while the piece was fact-checked by third-party organisations.
It is unusual for Facebook and Twitter to limit the spread of an article from an established, mainstream news outlet in this way.
The restrictions, coming in the run-up to the US presidential election on 3 November, fuelled anger from Mr Biden's political rivals over the alleged censorship of Republicans.
President Trump has proposed removing a legal protection from social networks, treating them as publishers if they fact-check or restrict material.
Mr Biden has also suggested removing those protections - but for different reasons. He has criticised the spread of misinformation online with little consequences for the companies facilitating it.
Democrats voted with their Republican colleagues earlier this month, ordering the bosses of Twitter, Facebook, and Google to face questions.
Despite the Democrats' absence from the vote this time, Republican committee chairman Lindsey Graham said he believed there was ""a lot of interest on the other side"" in getting ""the social media folks here to answer questions""."

China seems to be ground zero for air pollution these days. From NASA:
Smoke and haze hang over a large portion of eastern China in this image captured by the Aqua satellite on October 29, 2014.  China uses the method of “slash and burn” agriculture to rid their fields of leftover plants. Farmers often use fire to return nutrients to the soil and to clear the ground of unwanted plants. While fire helps enhance crops and grasses for pasture, the fires also produce smoke that degrades air quality as seen in this image.
The U.S. Consulate in Beijing records an air quality index of 226 for October 29 putting it in the “Very Unhealthy” region.  Furthermore the following precautions are noted, “Significant aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly; significant increase in respiratory effects in general population. Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid all outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit outdoor exertion.”  Haze in this region tends to worsen in the fall and winter, when cold, heavy air traps pollutants near the surface.
The smoke released by any type of fire (forest, brush, crop, structure, tires, waste or wood burning) is a mixture of particles and chemicals produced by incomplete burning of carbon-containing materials. All smoke contains carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and particulate matter (PM or soot).
This natural-color satellite image was collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite on October 29,  2014. Actively burning areas, detected by MODIS’s thermal bands, are outlined in red.

"After severe flooding in the North of England, many affected residents have been left feeling let down and left behind by the systems in place to protect them. Our research suggests that they, and many other communities affected by flooding in the past, have good reason to feel this way. Often, the effects of flooding are not fair – and government policy isn’t helping. Current methods of modelling, managing and protecting against flood risk are socially blind, and end up disadvantaging the people and places that are most vulnerable. In recent years, flood management policy across the world has focused investment on technology to better assess which areas are at risk of flooding, and what the damage could be. This technical expertise can then be used to inform vulnerable people, guide development, and determine priority areas for flood defences. Undoubtedly, innovation in flood risk assessments over the last two decades has aided decision-making for central government agencies and local authorities. We have a much better, if still far from perfect, understanding of the movement of water through catchments, urban drainage systems, streets and buildings. But this approach has limitations. For a start, flood maps tend to be static snapshots that are only periodically updated. In reality, risk can change quickly. As the climate crisis increases the frequency and severity of flooding, and urbanisation reduces the land’s capacity to absorb water, people may be surprised to learn that houses they bought many years ago are now at risk – not because they moved to a flood-prone area, but because the flood zone moved to them.

      Three times more people at risk from yearly coastal flooding than previously thought – new research


 More importantly, these technical models typically treat flood-prone areas as uniform entities that are simplistically labelled as at high, medium, or low risk. In turn, government policy across Europe and beyond increasingly expects people at risk to assume more responsibility for managing it, usually referring to this as becoming resilient. For example, the UK government encourages the public to check their postcode on simplified versions of flood maps, to inform choices on insurance or house purchases, increase their awareness of risk, and be prepared if in a higher-risk area. But people have very different capacities to make use of this information. For example, those with lower incomes may be less able to protect, repair or insure their properties, meaning they feel the effects of flooding much more acutely. Some people are also more vulnerable than others in ways that may not be immediately obvious. Extreme weather events are likely to have a greater effect on older people and those with health problems. Those with limited mobility are less able to evacuate from a flooded area or move possessions away in expectation of a flood. More broadly, the varying economic health of areas entrenches inequality in vulnerability to flooding. Put simply, people from more deprived areas that are prone to flooding may not only be more vulnerable to its effects, but are often less able to lobby for flood defences or media attention than those in wealthier areas. They also have fewer means to leave flood prone areas for a safer place to live. The often overlooked yet troubling irony is that globally it is those who have contributed least to the causes of flooding and have the least capacity to adapt that are most at risk. And of course, flooding rarely happens just once in an area – people and places can be trapped in cycles of flooding, further exacerbating inequality and disadvantage. Decisions about where to invest in flood defences are also problematic. They are usually based on simple cost-benefit analyses, which means that assessments of how many people might be protected and the value of protected assets rule decision-making processes. Many analyses have some degree of social weighting to ensure that wealthy areas with higher house prices or areas with larger populations do not monopolise finite budgets. But only rarely are more fine-grained social circumstances, such as people’s ability to escape from rising water and their capacity to deal with the consequences of a flood, integrated into decision-making. In response, flood risk management researchers and professionals increasingly argue for more engagement and collaboration with those at risk. But even here, there is a risk that the simple provision of more opportunities to participate could favour those with resources, expertise and time – the very same people who are arguably already well represented in the processes of public decision-making. That is not to criticise vocal and well organised community participation. Such participation is essential and must be supported. But to truly realise social and environmental justice and prevent communities suffering in silence, targeted outreach is needed. This could include recruiting independent support workers who can be community advocates for vulnerable neighbourhoods, and helping establish local flood action groups to liaise between authorities and the wider public. There are ways to make flooding fairer. Public authorities sit on a vast wealth of social, economic and demographic data that should be fully integrated with flood risk management decision-making, and regularly updated. The mapping tools to overlay these data with flood maps already exist, but there is concern that these are not being widely used. 


      Read more:
      Why flooding is still so difficult to predict and prepare for


 Flood risk managers and emergency first responders should also do more to understand these nuances. They could, for example, expand recent efforts to help communities develop their own specific flood response plans, use their local knowledge to identify the most vulnerable people, and determine ahead of time how they can be supported when flood warnings are issued. Finally, we need to recognise that fairness in flooding is linked to broader economic and social conditions. Austerity politics and funding cuts to local services can severely compromise people’s ability to deal with flooding. In the UK, spending on flood defences has fallen well shy of the pre-austerity trend – and this is sure to have impacted residents in the North of England. Our ongoing work shows that many communities affected by flooding feel ignored long before rising waters destroy their homes, businesses and neighbourhoods. Those most vulnerable to flooding must be given the resources to respond to it, rather than being told that it’s their responsibility to get resilient. This support is not only needed before and during flooding events, but also for the longer-term effects that are often only apparent weeks and months after waters have subsided. Just as our assessment of flood risk is getting more sophisticated, so must our management of it. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

On Monday, after an intense few days of negotiations, government officials from the United States and 11 other countries from the Pacific region announced the conclusion of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal involving countries making up almost 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product. Specific details of the agreement are still lacking at this point (it may be a month before the full text is released), but by any measure, this deal will be one of the largest in history. However, the work is not done yet.



The next step will be an intense political debate here in the U.S. as well as the other TPP countries. In preparation, it is useful to understand what’s in the TPP to sort out the wide‐​ranging impact it will have. Trade agreements are not just about lower tariffs — they are broad exercises in global governance.



The core feature of trade liberalization is still present, of course. In this regard, the key questions for evaluating the deal are, how much liberalization will occur through the TPP, and how quickly? On various sensitive products, the early reports are underwhelming. We have heard that U.S. tariffs on cars and trucks will be reduced slowly (30 years for trucks); and U.S. restrictions on sugar will fall only slightly. Japan will liberalize agricultural markets only a little, and Canada will do the same on dairy imports. For those who favor trade liberalization, the specific details of “market access” provided for these and other products will matter a lot when assessing the merits of the deal.





The upcoming public debate on the TPP is sure to be contentious. With any luck, it will also be enlightening.



Also important is liberalization of trade in services, a rapidly expanding part of the global economy. The provision of many services has moved online, and international trade is now possible in areas not previously envisioned, such as education and medicine. Ideally, the TPP will liberalize trade in these and other service sectors.



Beyond these traditional trade issues, there is an expanding governance aspect of today’s trade agreements. The Obama administration has touted the TPP as “the most progressive” trade agreement in history. It will apparently push labor protections further than ever before, and also include new environmental protections. Another element that is designed to appeal to liberals is a “carve out” of certain tobacco regulations from rules that apply to foreign investment. For anti‐​tobacco groups, convincing the Obama administration to take this unprecedented step was a big victory.



These governance items may be short‐​term victories for groups on the left, but they could cause problems for congressional consideration of the TPP. Republicans in Congress are generally wary of excessive labor and environmental regulation, and members of Congress from tobacco producing states (including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell) are strongly opposed to singling out tobacco for unfavorable treatment. It remains to be seen whether the Obama administration’s attempts to appeal to progressives will hurt the agreement’s chances to gain support from conservatives.



At the same time, the Obama administration has pushed for extensive intellectual property protection as part of the TPP. This appeals to business groups, but is extremely aggravating to many on the left. In the end, the compromise that was achieved has left some leading Republicans in Congress upset.



Trying to keep all of the different interest groups happy, by constructing a balanced package that gives everyone something they want, is a difficult endeavor. Everything you give to one group has the potential to irritate another group. The growing complexity of trade agreements has made the trade debate, and generating support for trade agreements, much more complex and difficult.



Inevitably, the TPP’s prospects for congressional passage will now be caught up with presidential politics. “Populist” candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump will weigh in with criticisms. And as much as she might want to avoid it, Hillary Clinton will have to take a position as well. All of this may make congressional consideration difficult. It is hard to see a window of time in which Congress can sign off on the deal in this political climate.



The upcoming public debate on the TPP is sure to be contentious. With any luck, it will also be enlightening. There have been trade deals signed in recent years, but they have often been small, involving just one country or countries making up a very limited part of the world economy. The TPP is not radically different from these recent agreements, but its scope will draw out critics to a greater degree than previously seen. This provides an opportunity to have a good debate on just what trade agreements should be doing.



Clearly, there should be liberalization in there, or else the whole exercise is pointless. But have we liberalized enough in the TPP? As noted, the extent of liberalization for some sensitive products is unclear at this point, and some traditional trade liberalization issues, such as farm subsidies, have been left out of the agreement entirely.



And on the governance issues, this is a chance to think deeply about the role of international law in shaping domestic policy‐​making, and whether trade agreements have expanded too much into this area.



It is too early to make predictions about the TPP’s prospects in Congress, and no doubt this process will be a learning experience for everyone involved. Next up after the TPP is a similar agreement being worked out with the Europeans, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The TPP and TTIP are jointly referred to as the new “mega‐​regional” trade agreements. If they do come into force, they will reshape the trading system in ways that will last for decades. For that reason, once the TPP texts are released, members of Congress need to scrutinize them carefully and understand their full impact.

"For young climate activists in the US, staying home because of the pandemic does not mean staying silent, with plans gathering pace across the country to make their voices heard in November’s elections. It has been nearly a year since an estimated 6 million people across the world joined the youth-led global climate strikes on 20 September. In the US, students from Los Angeles to Washington DC skipped school to voice their frustration over the slow response to the climate crisis by elected leaders, and Greta Thunberg told a cheering crowd in New York City “this is only the beginning”. But in the 10 months since the historic protests, the Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the US, making meeting and organizing in-person hazardous. Climate strikes, including a major three-day mass protest that was planned for Earth Day 2020 in April, have been cancelled. But networks of youth climate activists have been regrouping, with a new focus on election campaigning with phone banks, social media and friend-to-friend organizing, according to interviews with organizers. The stakes could not be higher for young people, according to Aracely Jimenez-Hudis, 23, the deputy communications director of the Sunrise Movement, a leading youth advocacy group on the climate. “We are a generation that was really born into crises,” said Jimenez-Hudis. “We don’t have some golden age that we can look back on and feel that there is any kind of resonance with a call to normalcy because our normal has always been endless wars, has always been police brutality.” Youth voter turnout during the 2016 elections was disappointing with just 46% of eligible voters aged 18 to 29 going out to vote, compared to 70% of the oldest voters, 70 and over. Then in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, youth movements began building campaigns and gaining visibility, with climate change growing as a key issue, driven in part by the burgeoning Sunrise Movement, which was founded in 2017. Politicians who get elected this cycle have to be the ones that are really caring about our futures In preparation for the 2018 midterm elections, the Sunrise Movement began training young activists to canvass for candidates who were proponents of renewable energy and publicly confront incumbents who take money from the fossil fuel industry. When the 2018 midterms came around, 20% more young Americans ages 18 to 29 went out to vote compared to the last midterms in 2014, and Democrats won the House. The group has more recently been pushing Democratic leaders to embrace the Green New Deal, a bold carbon-neutral plan for the economy championed by progressive Democrats including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Backing the policy was initially seen as too radical by many Democrats but it has now been embraced more widely by members of the party. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, recently unveiled a climate and jobs plan that mirrors some of the aggressiveness of the Green New Deal, though some activists believe he is not tough enough on fossil fuel industries. With the pandemic, Jimenez-Hudis said, the Sunrise Movement has shifted its electoral strategy to focus entirely on phone banking and friend-to-friend organizing – encouraging people to talk to their friends and relatives directly about the candidates they support. “We still have lots of work to do to make sure that we get the right Democrats on the ballot, the right Green New Deal champions on the ballot for the election in November just up and down the ticket,” Jimenez-Hudis said. The organization credits its phone banking volunteers for helping Jamaal Bowman, a former teacher who ousted a longtime congressman in New York, win his election and for tightening the race of Charles Booker, a Democrat in Kentucky who was hoping to run against the Republican senator Mitch McConnell. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in May, the Sunrise Movement has also made efforts to streamline its focus toward racism and police brutality, encouraging members to attend protests and speak out about the intersection of racial justice and climate activism. The organization recently started its #WideAwake campaign, encouraging local activists to protest outside the homes of elected officials. On Juneteenth, a local Sunrise chapter coordinated such a protest outside the home of Senator McConnell, demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in her home by police in Louisville, Kentucky. Recent months have helped some young climate activists see that the same systemic changes needed to address climate change are in line with the ones that will bring racial justice, escalating the need for elected officials who will bring those changes. Rose Strauss, 20, a former organizer with the Sunrise Movement, said her time with the organization helped her understand the gravity of the 2020 election. She dropped out of college so she could dedicate all her time to the election and canvass for Senator Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. Once it became clear that Sanders was not going to win the nomination, Strauss and a few fellow activists began to dedicate their efforts to starting a new initiative called the Down Ballot Disruption Project. The program, held entirely over Zoom, aims to teach young people how to canvass for candidates in their local elections and how to build a community around their activism, especially on social media. Young people can “change this election in massive ways. The only arena right now, because we can’t go and canvass outside, is social media. That’s where we know how to do stuff,” Strauss said. “We really need to make sure that the politicians who get elected this cycle are going to be the ones that are really caring about our futures.” For activists with Zero Hour, the climate justice organization that coordinated a youth climate march in Washington DC in summer 2018, the focus for the 2020 election is less on getting individual candidates elected but broadly teaching young activists how to encourage their communities to get out to vote and educate them about the Green New Deal. The organization, along with the National Children’s Campaign, launched the #Vote4OurFuture campaign in July, targeting youth activists in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and Grand Rapids and Detroit in Michigan, two swing states. The campaign was originally scheduled to be a bus tour in March, but coronavirus forced the organizations to change course. Now, the campaign is all about hosting virtual events like roundtables and webinars focusing on what the Green New Deal could look like in specific communities. “We want climate change to be a top priority on people’s minds when they’re going to the polls in November because of the way it will impact people of color and people living in those cities,” said Zanagee Artis, 20, the co-founder and director of advocacy for Zero Hour. While climate advocacy during the pandemic has largely been on video chats and social media, young activists are eager to get back on the streets. Fridays for Future, the global organization founded by Greta Thunberg, plans on holding a global climate strike on 25 September. Local chapters are working on what the protest will look like in their areas to accommodate local Covid-19 conditions. Spencer Berg, 17, an organizer with Fridays for Future NYC, said organizers are still working out the logistics of what the protest will look like, but the overall message of the demonstration will be to advocate for a “green recovery” and ensure that New York City continues to uphold its commitments to fighting climate change. While the pandemic has left devastation across the city and in many other places in the US, activists are hopeful that coronavirus can provide parallels to climate change and show how a single crisis can affect everyone. Coronavirus has “inspired a lot of people because it has shown us that the government can act quickly and efficiently to quell a crisis”, Berg said. “That’s what this is: it’s a climate crisis. A lot of politicians say we can’t afford to do that, we don’t have enough time for this, but coronavirus showed us that we can have complete systematic change if we need to.” • This article was amended on 10 August 2020 to correct Zanagee Artis’s job title.

Global Atmospheric Carbon DioxideGlobal atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from Oct. 1 through Nov. 11, as recorded by NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2. Carbon dioxide concentrations are highest above northern Australia, southern Africa and eastern Brazil. Preliminary analysis of the African data shows the high levels there are largely driven by the burning of savannas and forests. Elevated carbon dioxide can also be seen above industrialized Northern Hemisphere regions in China, Europe and North America.Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech
A Cynical Engineer: There are three scenarios for the future of NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory:
1) NASA will continue to report transparent scientific results that will quickly and stunningly turn CAGW upside down. We will all realize that global CO2 emissions are not at all as taught, preached or predicted. That human emission to global atmospheric CO2 concentration is and always has been a small single-digit contribution. That if we shut human CO2 emission down completely tomorrow little would happen to the future trajectory of global CO2 concentration. And indeed, had we humans never industrialized, little would be different about that trajectory over the past 60 years right up to today.
2) NASA will homogenize the data with such effort as to make the original data set unrecognizable. There will be lots of hand waving and we’ll endure continued lame explanations such as in the caption that was released with this initial data set.
3) The OCO instrument will suffer a premature and catastrophic failure.
When the first versions of the OCO were being launched I thought to myself: Great, let’s cut to the chase scene, grab the crucial data, and get this AGW malarkey over with quickly. But then scenario 3) happened…twice.
Scenario 2) has been observed from more organizations and more times than can be counted.
Scenario 1) requires so much crow eating by so many organizations and over so short a period of time as to be entirely politically unacceptable even as it is scientifically accurate. I doubt it can be allowed to happen.
And just what would NASA have us believe about this first OCO product:
a) That shortly before this last October 1st, industrial production shut down in the Ohio Valley, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That as of October 1st, U.S. industrial production has been concentrated in the lush Appalachian Slopes of the Carolinas, Georgia and Northern Florida.
b) That farming activities may account for the CO2 plumes over the lush forests of South America and South-Central Africa. While Australian industrial activity may have pushed it’s CO2 output upwind into the lush forests of Malaysia.
c) That the oceans are net absorbers of anthropogenic CO2 contrary to this most recent observation.
Or…is there a different explanation from what NASA seems to believe? Like:
Insect and microbial emissions, each at 10X all anthropogenic emission, dominate in these lush forested areas while the historically mildly warming oceans are also net CO2 contributors. And, anthropogenic emission is essentially irrelevant to atmospheric CO2 concentration at an approximately 2% contribution to the natural flux.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe recent focus on (and hysteria over) the warm Christmas weather we saw over the North American east coast and Europe apparently is already fading and giving way to far more serious concerns – like the snow bowl blizzard of normally sunny El Paso, for example.
Naturally it’s just silly to use one weather event as proof of a climate trend, and so we have to keep the focus on long-term trends and historical climate cycles. Four days ago the online German national news weekly FOCUS here looked into the growing number of reports and signs that the warming is in its final days.
The German news magazine reports: “Scientists prognosticate icy cold winters like in the Dark Ages” and that despite the recent warm year: “Indeed some scientists see a mini ice age coming in just a few years.”
FOCUS tells its readers that already the Holocene has now drawn out some 11,500 years and the next ice age is in fact 1500 years overdue when we go back and compare it to the previous intergalcials. That’s one reason why we should not be too hopeful of long-term warming ahead, FOCUS writes.
Indeed the overall temperature trend over the past 10,000 years has been downward.
“Next ice age is certainly coming”
Another reason is solar activity. FOCUS cites Professor Sami Solanki, Director of the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research. He tells FOCUS that the current solar cycle is “not typical” of what we have seen over the past half century, but reminds us that it is still too early to make a “reliable forecast” for a next ice age. Overall Solanki tells FOCUS: The next ice age is certainly coming. It is a question of when.“
In the article Professor Solanki confirms the historical climate cycles and that the earth is cooler during periods of lower solar activity.

"Earthquake lights are among nature’s most strange, most ephemeral, and hard-to-explain phenomena. While rare, and only recently accepted by science, they have been reported for hundreds or even thousands of years from essentially every region of the globe where earthquakes occur.  Centuries ago, when the only artificial lights were campfires, burning torches and oil lamps, people must have looked awestruck at the pale cool flames flickering ankle-high out of the ground, or at the flashes of bright light shooting into sky, or the luminous balls of light drifting through the air before bursting silently, leaving in their wake nothing but an acrid smell. It’s understandable how, in more primitive times before science, people made connections to the world of gods and spirits. Many apparitions from folklore and from historical records can probably be explained by earthquake lights. The story of Moses, who reportedly witnessed a “burning bush” on Mount Sinai, for example, or the ancient Greek Callisthenes who wrote of “immense columns of flame” that foretold the earthquake that destroyed the cities of Helike and Boura in 373 BC. After the invention of electric lighting in the 19th century, followed by the development of seismology, scepticism towards these strange phenomena grew. These strange lights did not fit into the framework of classical mechanics on which seismology is built. Scientists were at a loss as to how to explain them, and tended to dismiss them entirely. Such scepticism reached its peak in the 1970s when, presented with the colour photos of earthquake lights taken during the 1965-1969 Matsushiro earthquake swarm, prominent seismologists sucha as Tsuneji Rikitake of Japan suggested the pictures were forgeries. They are still a divisive topic to this day. But recently there has been a change. In a critical review of hundreds if not thousands of reports of earthquake lights in Europe and the Americas over the past 400 years, Robert Thériault and France St-Laurent from Canada, together with John Derr, formerly of US Geological Survey’s Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory, selected 65 reports as most reliable.  For example, shortly before the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy, flames of light several inches high were seen flickering above the stone-flagged streets of the town’s historic centre. In Pisco, Peru, as the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck in 2007, a naval officer saw pale blue columns of light bursting out of the water four times, caught on security cameras. A seismometer record collected at the same site allowed for the exact timing of the light outbursts. In 1988, bright purple-pink globes of light were seen hovering along the St Lawrence River near Quebec City, Canada, 11 days before an earthquake. And just before one of the worst natural disasters in the US, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, coloured flames hovered in the foothills west of the city and in nearby San Jose, just before the quake struck, perhaps similar to those recorded during the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China. Examining the geology where these outbursts of light had been observed, the authors discovered a rather intriguing pattern. Out of the 65 earthquakes with trustworthy reports of lights, 63 had occurred at or near sub-vertical geological faults, as opposed to faults with more shallow angles. Strikingly, while earthquakes along these steep faults make up just 5% of seismic activity, they account for 97% of documented cases of earthquake lights. Sub-vertical faults generally occur at rifts within continental plates, rather than along boundaries between them. These are typical of places where, some time in the distant past, the Earth’s crust was pulled apart, allowing magma from great depths of 100-150km, to rise up and intrude. When the magma solidified it left dark, blackish rocks of the gabbro family. I joined the research team, which published our findings in Seismological Research Letters, to bring some insight to a physical explanation for earthquake lights. For many years I have studied defects in crystals, such as in magnesium oxide (MgO). I found that MgO crystals contain peroxy defects, which are distinct in the way their oxygen atoms are bonded together. Over the following years I found that peroxy defects are ubiquitous, occurring in nearly all rock-forming minerals in the Earth’s crust. The most remarkable property of the peroxy defects is that, when rocks are put under mechanical stress – such as during the build-up of tectonic stresses before a major earthquake or when a seismological wave strikes during an earthquake – they instantly break apart and generate electricity. It’s like switching on a battery, generating electrical charges that can flow out of the stressed rocks into and through unstressed rocks. The charges travel fast, at up to around 200 metres per second, and far – easily metres in lab experiments, and up to tens of kilometres in the field. As the charges flow through the Earth’s crust they emit ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. On arriving at the Earth’s surface, they produce a range of secondary reactions such as infrared light, massive air ionization, and corona discharges, which in turn produce ozone and broad-band radio noise. These signals are indicators for the massive stress build-up deep below, and so could be considered pre-earthquake indicators – though not every tectonic stress build-up leads to a catastrophic rupture of the rocks, that is, to an earthquake. Producing earthquake lights, however, requires special conditions, which we are only now slowly beginning to understand. In real situations, for earthquake lights to occur the rocks must contain many peroxy bond defects, as is true for gabbro rock, and they must be stressed very quickly. Under these conditions, so much electrical charge can be generated that the rocks enter a rare physical state known as solid state plasma.  At this point, when the positive or negative charge-carrying particles generated by the rapid stressing of the rock reach a critical density, they can move through the rocks as plasma. When this cloud of electrical charge reaches the Earth’s surface, it can burst through and discharge into the air. And so voilà, the stage is set for the luminous phenomena of earthquake lights: variously reported as flickering, pale, cool flames reaching ankle-high, or different forms of bright, short flashes that shoot high into the air, or as free-floating plasma balls that detach from the ground and drift away, described by eyewitnesses as “luminous globes” or “ball lightning”. For more than a century early warnings of earthquakes have remained a dream. There are records of many different types of signals that the Earth seems to produce during the weeks, days and hours leading up to a major seismic event. But nobody has been able to “read” these signals, or say how they may be connected. This has left a deeply divided community: mainstream seismologists who reject even the idea of pre-earthquake signals, pitched against a group of well-intended individuals with a wide range of scientific and non-scientific interests and backgrounds. But as is often the case in the history of science, once the basic physical processes responsible for a set of seemingly unconnected processes are deciphered, the pieces fall into place.   We are at this crossroads, having begun to understand the Earth’s signals. Current seismological earthquake prediction deals in windows of uncertainty of 30 years or more, or issues “early” warnings only when an earthquake is already underway and racing through the ground at kilometres per second. But with resources and effort, we could now bring together all the relevant scientific information with its basis in physics to build a global earthquake forecasting system that could provide early warning of at least a few days – a huge leap forward."
"Senior figures in this government like to view themselves as insurgents against a hidebound Whitehall establishment. This is partly because Boris Johnson won the last election after pledging to “get Brexit done”, breaking the post-referendum stalemate in parliament. But it is also settled wisdom in Downing Street, and in the Treasury, that a more general shake-up is required of Britain’s body politic if it is to become more lithe and nimble, and get ahead of the game. More evidence of this desire to disrupt came on Tuesday in the form of a speech by Stephen Barclay, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Addressing a centre-right thinktank, Mr Barclay heralded a new era of state spending in which the ethos of Silicon Valley would inform departmental decision-making. In the spirit of west coast venture capitalists, government ministers and their civil servants would back schemes that took risks and which would therefore sometimes fail. The interminable delays and inveterate caution that have blighted government projects and investment would become a thing of the past. Inculcating this new Whitehall worldview is seen as fundamental to speedily delivering the “infrastructure revolution” promised by Mr Johnson at the end of last month.  The rhetoric is beguilingly avant garde and dynamic (Mr Barclay talked of the Treasury’s “new radicals”). It should also be said that the prospect of a proactive industrial strategy is welcome after lost years of lazy, laissez-faire rhetoric from the likes of George Osborne. But it is ironic that while the government talks a good game, it risks falling grievously behind Britain’s competitors in one of the growth areas that will define the future. The progress made towards a post-Covid-19 green recovery for Britain is proceeding at a snail’s pace. By contrast, Germany, France, South Korea and others have unveiled plans that will pump vast amounts of government money into developing a low-carbon economy. Last month, Berlin announced a £9bn national hydrogen strategy, which it sees as a route to decarbonising transport and core domestic industries, and achieving global leadership in a new sector. Britain has yet to show anything like the same level of environmental ambition. Renowned climate experts such as Nicholas Stern and Lady Brown of Cambridge, the chair of the Carbon Trust, would like to see the establishment of a new green investment bank to generate some momentum and confidence. Lord Stern estimates that about £20bn worth of public money would be needed to set one up. This would be a certain catalyst for major private investment; one recent report estimated that £5bn in public funds could attract up to £100bn in private capital for green projects. The energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has declared his support for the idea. But following parliamentary recess, no decision seems likely before Rishi Sunak’s autumn statement. There is no more time to lose. As Lady Brown has pointed out, in areas such as the production of green hydrogen, Britain has world-leading innovators in a market that is still embryonic and in need of support. Given a fair wind, these companies could expand to become global players in the developing market for green technologies, as well as driving a new generation of carbon-neutral infrastructure at home. But vibrant green growth will only become a reality if government plays its part in a committed public-private partnership. According to the Committee on Climate Change, Britain is manifestly not on course to meet its legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. The committee chair, John Gummer, told a government inquiry that this was because the “radical things’ that needed to be done to shape a green recovery were not being done. A properly funded and ambitious green investment bank could be a gamechanger. Mr Barclay’s “new radicals” should get to it."
"Maha  ’s family is divided. She immigrated to New York City in 2014, reuniting with her three sons who had arrived earlier. She expected that her husband, Husham   and her two other sons would soon join her from Amman, Jordan, finally bringing the family together after a tumultuous decade of surviving the Iraq war, fleeing to Jordan and then searching for a permanent home. But on Friday, the family was dealt another blow, after President Trump approved a sweeping executive order on immigration that, among other things, blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, where members of the family are citizens. Her husband and two sons in Jordan are for now locked out of the United States, and Ms. Obaidi cannot travel away, or risk being denied  . “Now our family in the U. S. can’t even come to visit us, nor can we visit them,” Mr. Qadhi said on Saturday in Amman. “We just sit and watch like the rest of the world what is happening, and our fate is being decided for us, in front of our eyes. ” The family lived in Baghdad as American tanks, troops and missiles tore into the Iraqi capital in 2003. It stayed for several years, despite gunfire and bomb blasts outside its house and the kidnapping of several family members. The family helped American soldiers even though other Iraqis targeted it for doing so. One of the sons in Amman, Thabit   said he and his father had run a snack bar on an American base in Baghdad, serving candy and soft drinks to troops, and operated a   internet cafe, which required them to be vetted and approved to begin work. After Thabit   was kidnapped in 2006 by Qaeda terrorists and eventually released, he said, he reported details about the episode to American officials in the hope that they would be caught. And on his way home from the Baghdad base one day, he came upon four American troops injured along the road, and he said he had loaded them into his car and driven them to the Green Zone. “America has abandoned its responsibility to protect those who protected and cooperated with the Americans,” he said. “It’s a decision solely based on my religious faith. It’s discrimination solely on religious grounds. ” He added: “This is the wrong decision. Is it even constitutional?” The family’s home was along one of Baghdad’s major highways, an entry point for American troops during the invasion. The family huddled in a windowless section of the home for 10 days, as bullets shattered windows and rockets blazed through the sky, until the United States took control of Baghdad. In the years after the invasion, the family remained in Iraq, even as unrest spread, militants took up arms and   tensions between Sunnis and Shiites flared up. In addition to Thabit   Ms. Obaidi’s husband was also kidnapped, on two separate occasions. The family members recalled the lengths to which they went to get them freed, how they stuffed $60, 000 in Iraqi dinars into garbage bags and were instructed by cellphone to travel to a series of locations before dropping off the ransom. “It was like in the movies,” Ms. Obaidi said in an interview this month. Fearing more attacks, the family left Iraq for Jordan. It joined many other Iraqi refugees, including extended family members. Ms. Obaidi and her husband used their savings to buy a home in Amman. Employment opportunities were scarce for Iraqis, leading three of her sons, starting in 2010, to venture to the United States to find work. When Ms. Obaidi later followed them, she hoped that her entire family could apply for asylum and unite in America. She made the trip despite a number of concerns. “At first, I felt afraid,” she said. “How can I live in this country? It is a foreign country. It is very far from my culture. How will I be compatible with the community?” To her surprise, Ms. Obaidi found New York to be unlike its gruff stereotypes. People smiled as she walked down the street. Men helped her haul heavy bags up stairs. Others offered her seats on the subway. “Everybody in America is very nice,” she said. “They are very polite, helpful people, nice people, always with a smile on their face. That is my experience. ” She has found additional support from the International Rescue Committee, a global humanitarian aid, relief and development nongovernmental organization based in New York. Founded in 1933, the organization is the newest organization supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and the only one of the eight groups whose work extends beyond the New York area. It operates in 29 cities in the United States and in more than 40 countries. The organization was instrumental in helping Ms. Obaidi adjust to her new life and connecting her with a number of social services, including health insurance and food stamps. It helped her obtain a Social Security card, navigate New York’s streets and understand its transportation system. The group also helped her study for her driver’s license permit exam, among other services. “I feel I am not lonely,” she said. “I have somebody. I have somebody to support me. ” She shares a home in the Astoria neighborhood in Queens with two of her sons, Saif   and Qaed  . Her third son, Tameem   and his wife, Melissa Forstrom, also live in the neighborhood. “I have a nice life,” Ms. Obaidi said. “Even though my apartment is small, I feel happy in it. I like it. ” But it is a home with some notable, painful absences. “I’ve divided myself,” Ms. Obaidi said. “Some part is there in Jordan, and some parts   …    ” She trailed off, overcome with emotion. In Amman, Thabit   her oldest son, lives with his wife and    son across the street from Ms. Obaidi’s husband, Husham, and their youngest son, Omar  . They have been denied asylum in the United States. In October 2015, Husham   was sent a conditional acceptance letter for asylum in the United States. About a year later, he received a second letter, denying him resettlement. Omar   who works at Unicef to help provide water, sanitation and hygiene to Syrian refugees in Jordan, was also denied resettlement. “We have lived here as if we were waiting for something, as if everything was temporary, but now we no longer know what we are waiting for,” Omar   said in his apartment in Amman. Thabit   who has traveled to New York several times to visit his family, has not received the same denial letters for resettlement in the United States. His tourist visa was renewed, but a week later, an officer at the American Embassy in Amman told him that his visa had been canceled, and his case for resettlement was denied. Whether they will ever get approval to move to the United States is even more uncertain now. Thabit   said that Mr. Trump’s order was particularly painful and that he felt America was turning its back on Iraqis who had risked their lives to help soldiers during the war. “At the end we realized we were no longer welcome, neither from the Iraqis because we worked with the Americans, nor from the Americans because we were Iraqi,” he said. Like many Iraqis, Thabit   is living in Jordan on a conditional basis. He must renew his permission every year, and it is dependent on the family’s financial means. “Nothing is guaranteed in business,” he said. “Today, my trade company here is successful, but if one day the business fails, then what will happen? Where do I go?” In the United States, his siblings, even with employment and legal immigration status, live in a similar state of unsteadiness and concern. For three years, Tameem  ’s only proof of his legal status was an   record known as an   form, a document without a photo of him and only his name and identification numbers. It has hindered his attempts to travel even within the United States. Visas for Saif  ’s wife and children were approved recently after a wait of more than two years. They were booked on a plane expected to arrive Feb. 7, but Friday’s executive order by Mr. Trump has dashed those plans. “The kids, they grow up far from their father,” Saif   said. “All of a sudden, I told them ‘I’m sorry, something changed. I may not be able to see you soon. ’” He and his wife are distraught by the development, which leaves them in a precarious position. In anticipation of the move, their children were taken out of their private school and the lease on their apartment in Amman is to expire on Feb. 1. “I’m watching the news every second,” Mr. Qadhi said. Ms. Obaidi’s children have been able to acclimate to their new surroundings and establish a rhythm in their lives. Tameem   owns a cellphone store in the East Village in Manhattan, Qaed   works as an information technology manager, and Saif   is an Uber driver. Ms. Obaidi stays busy by volunteering at the Masjid Dar   mosque. The family gathers as often as work schedules and other responsibilities allow, most often on Sundays, when Ms. Obaidi prepares a large meal. They all await the day when more chairs can be placed around the table. Halfway across the world, the other half of the family shares that sentiment. Omar   said he missed his brothers, but especially his mother. “It just feels weird that we are now split, and the future looks grim,” he said. “We are travelers on a journey with no destination, and my family is so far away. ”"

“I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” said President Donald Trump earlier this month, announcing his decision to withdraw from the climate treaty. Critics immediately shot back that the city of Pittsburgh voted for his Democratic opponent, not him, by 75 percent to 21 percent. So there. Gotcha!



Unlike the critics, I don’t find this a particularly clever comeback. One reason is that — as analyst Michael Barone, ever sharp about voting patterns, has pointed out — Trump did carry the set of counties that makes up the greater Pittsburgh metro area, running stronger there (50 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 46) than had most previous Republicans. People refer to cities while meaning their metro areas all the time — if you have an aunt in Revere or Middleborough, Massachusetts, there’s nothing wrong with calling her your aunt in Boston.



More fundamentally, it seems to me it is Trump’s speechwriters rather than his critics who are showing the sounder grasp of what “elected to represent” means. It is not supposed to mean “elected by one faction of the country to advance its interests as distinct from the interests of the other faction.”





If Trump’s opponents are smart, they will pass up the chance to fight a pointless “Pittsburgh or Paris?” battle and engage with the question of whether his policies will help or hurt.



In fact, we specifically shouldn’t want presidents to feel that they have no responsibility to represent the interests and rights of voters or regions that went strongly against them.



Trump would rightly be criticized if he gave a speech and said, “I was elected to represent the citizens of Montana, not Massachusetts.” He may regret that Massachusetts residents voted against him, but as president he is responsible for sticking up for them against the outside world.



Election winners in victory speeches often say they will be a president (governor, mayor) for all the people, not just the ones who voted for them. It’s a commonplace bit of civic rhetoric but no less useful for that.



That’s one reason the slogan briefly popular among some Trump opponents after the election, “Not My President,” was open to question. It’s one thing to refuse to rally around any given president. But you don’t want to do so in words that might seem to release him from having to recognize that you, too, are his constituent.



Of course the “Pittsburgh, not Paris” phrase can be read at a number of rhetorical levels. Because the treaty is in part about energy burning and heavy industry, Trump probably sought to evoke the steel and coal industries for which Pittsburgh were so well known. Critics point out that’s out of date — coal has declined and there’s not much steel made around Pittsburgh. The city has gotten back on its feet through resources like its hospitals and its universities.



The Marcellus Shale fracking boom in Western Pennsylvania — which is a more ambiguous thing under the Paris treaty, since natural gas burns with much lower carbon emissions — has helped a lot too.



Even more broadly, Trump was proclaiming that he consults Americans’ interests rather than those of other countries when he acts. Philosophers can debate whether it’s fair to discount sharply, or ignore entirely, the well‐​being of the rest of the world. Politicians can’t afford to, because most voters from both parties want policy that puts American interests first.



If Trump’s opponents are smart, they will pass up the chance to fight a pointless “Pittsburgh or Paris?” battle and engage with the question of whether his policies will help or hurt.

This is a guest post about the execrable Greg Laden, and his calls for firing Dr. Willie Soon without having one iota of proof of his assertions. I’ve had run ins with this fool before, where I point out he’s lied about me, and even considered taking him to court for libel. In this episode, once again, Greg Laden is wronger than wrong, as is the paid political shill  Brad Johnson, campaign manager of Forecast the Facts, who put together the smear campaign seen in the photo below. As Instapundit says, “hit back twice as hard”. Its the only thing a bully truly understands. – Anthony Watts


 
Guest essay, reposted with permission, by William H. Briggs, statistician, who blogs here

Government Funding Is A Conflict Of Interest: Cowardly Calls For Climate Scientist’s Firing
The Beast
What entity pours by far the most money into scientific research? I’ll give you a hint. It’s the same entity that has been growing without bound, mercilessly muscling aside all competitors who would encroach into its space. It’s an entity which has a keen and abiding interest in the research it funds. An entity with desires. This entity cares results from its funded research turns out this way and not that.
No, not an oil company. Nay, not Apple corporation. Not even a pharmaceutical. It’s Uncle Sam!
Did you not know the scientists who receive Uncle’s lusciously large lasting grants are the same scientists who sit on the committees which award the grants? Conflict? It’s true the various wealthy agencies have a permanent and ever-burgeoning staff (see Parkinson’s Law and this) which shuffles the booty to and fro, but they’re advised by transient academics who today are at their home institutions standing erect with their hands out, and tomorrow are on the Metro to the NIH to sit (erect) in judgment of their peers.
Yes, the same people who award the grants are those that receive them.
Didn’t you know this? It’s true a man can’t award himself a grant, but he can give one to his pal and neighbor, and when its his pal and neighbor’s turn to sit on the review committee, he can and does return the favor.
But aren’t grants anonymous? Sure, some of them are. In the same way you think your online presence is anonymous. It takes almost a full minute of scrutiny in most cases to discover the name of the pleader. And many times there is no pretense of anonymity. This makes it easy to punish your enemies and boost your buddies.
What about the nature of the grants?
If the EPA solicits applications for the grant “Find something wrong with this power plant” do you think their pleadings will go in vain? No, sir, they will not. Dozens upon dozens of imploring missives will arrive at headquarters, all promising to finger the culprit. And do you think the investigations of the winner (and now richer researcher) will disappoint? No, sir, these investigations will not. Besides the ordinary willingness to please found in cooperative well-fed persons, there is also the promise of future monies for a job well done.
Not only will the researcher gladly suck at the government teat, strengthening his own bank account, but the researcher’s boss will benefit, too. For in each government gift is attached the miracle of overhead. This amounts to an additional 50% (more or less) of the grant’s value, a sum which goes to the researcher’s boss to spend as he pleases.
As he pleases, I say.
Overhead can be, and has been, spent on all nature of things. New offices and furnishings. Wintertime junkets to sunny uplands. Hiring of nephews and nieces. This overhead is very pleasing to the researcher’s Dean and the Dean’s guard of deanlettes. The Dean encourages grants for this reason, making sure to hire just those folks who are likely to bring in more government overhead.
The system feeds on itself.
For these and for many more similar reasons, the biggest conflict of interest in scientific research is government grants. It is an open scandal of monstrous proportions that scientists who receive government money do not declare that they might have been influenced, that they never admit their interest (beyond saying, “This grant was funded by grant xxx-yyy”).
Climate chaos
And so we come to one of the most cowardly unethical asinine foolhardy pig-ignorant acts we have witnessed in the thing we used to call Science.
You can see the picture above. It’s being passed around by the juvenile simpleton—this is an provable accusation, not meaningless abuse—named Greg Laden. He would like to see Willie Soon fired from his job, because why? Because, and I quote the ass,
Apparently, his research is paid by the fossil fuel industry. 
The research in question is the paper “Why models run hot: results from an irreducibly simple climate model” written by Lord Monckton, Wille Soon, David Legates, and Yours Truly. See Climate Paper Causes Chaos, Angst, Anger, Apoplexy! (Hacking?) for more details.
Not one penny, not one iota of consideration of any kind, was received from any source for the writing of this paper. It was a labor of love, done on personal time (of which, for my heresies, I have mountains). We wrote and re-wrote, and re-wrote some more, then decided which journal might enjoy seeing the paper. We knew (see Climategate) our names alone would cause its rejection from the usual “Consensus” sources. So we went where we were not known, figuring the work would be judged on its merits and not its politics. It was.
We submitted. Then we endured a grueling peer-review process (your proctologist was not as thorough). Our paper was accepted. And that’s it.
That makes Laden’s insinuation a lie. No fossil fuel industry funding was received. And even if it was, the details I gave you about the true source of tainting money in research also proves that there is nothing special about oil money. Indeed, oil money is less influential because (1) there’s much, much less of it, and (2) there is not the habit of the same people who receive the grants also awarding them.
The believers in science-is-politics who have organized the petition have attracted “21,263 signers so far“. This is a crowd that wouldn’t be able to define convection. This is a crowd that knows nothing about global warming, but they sure as heck believe in its solution.
Idiots.

 
UPDATE: (By Anthony)
I wonder if Greg Laden and Brad Johnson, campaign manager of Forecast the Facts, will be putting together a smear campaign to get every member of the American Geophysical Union fired? After all, in 2013, they funded their annual meeting heavily with fossil fuel interest$, and again in 2014.

The _Yes Minister_ programme actually poked fun at Global Warming back in 2013. There is little chance of this happening now on the BBC.



 _The phone rings. They all look at it._



 _ **Claire** Hello? It’s the BBC again. I see. Thanks. (She hangs up.) Piling on the agony. A big new story about global warming has just broken, they’re adding that to the Sunday programme too. Global warming computer models have been proved wrong._



 _ **Humphrey** How shocking!_



 _ **Claire** The new models show that it’s even worse than previously thought. Much more severe. And happening faster._



 _ **Jim** Is that supposed to be my fault too?_



 _ **Claire** Everything is at the moment. They want to know why the government is dragging its feet on CO2 emission controls._



 _ **Jim** (losing it) Do we have to deal with that tonight? As well as …(much has gone wrong for Jim earlier in the play)… Is there anything else, anything else we can pile on me tonight? Oh yes! Global bloody warming, thank you very much!_



 _ **Claire** It’s just that they’re going to add it to the catalogue of your failures. (He gives her a look.) Alleged failures, I mean._



 _ **Humphrey** Meanwhile, may I suggest that you don’t worry too much about global warming?_



 _ **Jim** Right. I can’t do anything about that tonight, can I?_



 _ **Humphrey** Tell me, how do they know we’re all going to drown in years when the weather forecast was so wrong last Friday?_



 _ **Jim** Because all the scientists agree._



 _ **Humphrey** So they say. So do the computer models. I know. But why should global warming computer models be any more accurate than financial ones?_



 _ **Jim** Um…_



 _ **Humphrey** Wall Street computer models were designed to prove sub­prime mortgage derivatives were low risk. These computer models are designed to show global warming is getting worse._



 _ **Jim** Come off it, Humphrey._



 _ **Humphrey** Remember mad cow disease? Computer models for that proved that we’d be dying in our hundreds of thousands by now. The only thing is, virtually nobody died, did they? Same with the salmonella-in-eggs computer models. Same with swine flu._



 _ **Jim** You’re suggesting … what, exactly?_



 _ **Humphrey** Global-Warming models leave out nearly all the other possible causes except CO2. And then they say ‘Look, CO2 has caused all this climate change.’_



 _ **Jim** What other causes are there?_



 _ **Humphrey** If the earth were actually getting warmer, one might start by looking at the sun. Solar activity, water vapour, cosmic rays, sunspots, underwater volcanoes –_



 _ **Jim** If? The world is getting hotter, the science is overwhelming, everyone knows that._



 _ **Humphrey** There’s been no rise in temperature since 1998._



 _ **Jim** Really? But it was rising, wasn’t it?_



 _ **Humphrey** From 1975 to 1998, yes, absolutely._



 _ **Jim** That’s what I mean._



 _ **Humphrey** But it fell from 1940 to 1975. Even though that was a heavily industrialised period, when CO2 shot up. And overall the temperature isn’t rising at all: the hottest year in the twentieth century was 1934._



 _ **Jim** I read that two thousand five hundred top climate scientists contributed to the last IPCC survey and they all agreed that man­made global warming is a proven fact and trapped greenhouse gases are the cause._



 _ **Humphrey** Nearly fifty of them agreed. The others didn’t, actually. But their views were left out of the summaries given to the press._



 _ **Claire** Haven’t you seen that film of the melting icebergs in the Antarctic?_



 _ **Humphrey** Yes. Beautiful, aren’t they?_



 _ **Claire** That’s caused by CO2._



 _ **Humphrey** No, that’s caused by warm water masses from the Pacific._



 _ **Claire** Why are the polar bears becoming extinct?_



 _ **Humphrey** Are they?_



 _ **Claire** The computer models say they are._



 _ **Humphrey** But the people who actually go and count them have found more than there were thirty years ago._



 _ **Jim** For heaven’s sake, Humphrey! If it’s all such nonsense why does everyone believe it?_



 _ **Humphrey** (amused) Hard to understand, I agree. But some scientists believe it, lots of others want the billions of pounds you can get for research that seems to show that global warming is caused by greenhouse gases, and most of the scientists who disagree can’t get published. Journalists love shock­horror stories, governments want to look virtuous to the voters, lefties want a way to rubbish big oil, and it makes the tree-huggers, whale-savers, anti-capitalists and everyone at the BBC feel holier than thou and warm and fuzzy inside. What’s not to like?_



 _ **Jim** Why hasn’t anyone else said all this?_



 _ **Humphrey** They have. No one wants to hear it._



 _ **Jim** So wind farms don’t make sense?_



 _ **Humphrey** (chuckles) They certainly do, for all the businessmen who are getting enormous government grants for them. But there isn’t enough wind to be practical. The total output of all the UK wind turbines put together is one-fifth of one decent sized coal-fired power station._



 _ **Claire** You don’t believe in global warming?_



 _ **Humphrey** My job is not to believe or disbelieve. My job is to weigh up arguments and produce answers. That’s what the Civil Service is for._

The stupid, it burns like a magnesium flare.
Excerpt from the article:
Now, you can add yet another problem to the climate change hit list: volcanoes. That’s the word from a new study conducted in Iceland and accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters. The finding is bad news not just for one comparatively remote part of the world, but for everywhere.
Iceland has always been a natural lab for studying climate change. It may be spared some of the punishment hot, dry places like the American southwest get, but when it comes to glacier melt, few places are hit harder. About 10% of the island nation’s surface area is covered by about 300 different glaciers—and they’re losing an estimated 11 billion tons of ice per year. Not only is that damaging Icelandic habitats and contributing to the global rise in sea levels, it is also—oddly—causing the entire island to rise. And that’s where the trouble begins.
Riiight.
Here’s the money quote:

“As the glaciers melt, the pressure on the underlying rocks decreases,” Compton said in an e-mail to TIME. “Rocks at very high temperatures may stay in their solid phase if the pressure is high enough. As you reduce the pressure, you effectively lower the melting temperature.” The result is a softer, more molten subsurface, which increases the amount of eruptive material lying around and makes it easier for more deeply buried magma chambers to escape their confinement and blow the whole mess through the surface.
“High heat content at lower pressure creates an environment prone to melting these rising mantle rocks, which provides magma to the volcanic systems,” says Arizona geoscientist Richard Bennett, another co-author.
Perhaps anticipating the climate change deniers’ uncanny ability to put two and two together and come up with five, the researchers took pains to point out that no, it’s not the very fact that Icelandic ice sits above hot magma deposits that’s causing the glacial melting. The magma’s always been there; it’s the rising global temperature that’s new. At best, only 5% of the accelerated melting is geological in origin.

So, Iceland has had melting glaciers, OK we’ll accept that, but Iceland is not the world, and a good number of volcanoes that have erupted in the last century are in the tropical parts of the world where there are no glaciers on the volcanoes or magma fields, yet somehow, this writer, Jeffrey Kluger, extrapolates Iceland’s glacier melt to volcano link up to to the entire world.
To the uniniformed (such as Time Magazine writers), graphs like this one might seem to be “proof” of such Icelandic-to-global extrapolation:
Source data: http://volcano.si.edu/
Gosh, it sure looks like another slam dunk for carbon dioxide driven climate hell in a handbasket, doesn’t it? The VEI starts increasing right about the time of the industrial revolution.
For those unfamiliar: The volcanic explosivity index (VEI) was devised by Chris Newhall of the US Geological Survey and Stephen Self at the University of Hawaii in 1982 to provide a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions. (Wikipedia)
But, there’s a hitch, according to NOAA data, volcanic activity worldwide actually went DOWN in the 2000’s while the climate changing carbon dioxide went UP in global concentration:
Source: PLOS One The Human Impact of Volcanoes: a Historical Review of Events 1900-2009 and Systematic Literature Review (2013)Correlation isn’t causation, at least when it comes to CO2 and climate and volcanoes.
Something that DID increase during the study period was the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). Guess where Iceland is? In the North Atlantic, which has been in the warm phase since about 1980.

The Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) is a mode of natural variability occurring in the North Atlantic Ocean and which has its principle expression in the sea surface temperature (SST) field. The AMO is identified as a coherent pattern of variability in basin-wide North Atlantic SSTs with a period of 60-80 years.
Source: http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/climind/AMO.html
Gee, do you think maybe, possibly, that Iceland might have more glacier melt when the AMO is warmer? The authors don’t seem to be cognizant of it, preferring instead to cite the universal bogeyman “climate change”.
Here is the publication that is cited in the Time article:
Climate driven vertical acceleration of Icelandic crust measured by CGPS geodesy

Abstract

Earth’s present-day response to enhanced glacial melting resulting from climate change can be measured using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. We present data from 62 continuously operating GPS instruments in Iceland. Statistically significant upward velocity and accelerations are recorded at 27 GPS stations, predominantly located in the Central Highlands region of Iceland, where present-day thinning of the Iceland ice caps results in velocities of more than 30 mm/yr and uplift accelerations of 1-2 mm/yr2. We use our acceleration estimates to back-calculate to a time of zero velocity, which coincides with the initiation of ice loss in Iceland from ice mass balance calculations and Arctic warming trends. We show, through a simple inversion, a direct relationship between ice mass balance measurements and vertical position and show that accelerated unloading is required to reproduce uplift observations for a simple elastic layer over viscoelastic half-space model.


http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL062446/abstract
Again, no mention of the world here, only Iceland. Compare that to the baseless claim made by the TIME writer Jeffrey Kluger:
The finding is bad news not just for one comparatively remote part of the world, but for everywhere.
Newsflash Mr. Kluger: Iceland is not “everywhere”, and the authors make no claim about the issue affecting the rest of the Earth.
WUWT reader Mike Bromley writes something on his Facebook page that I really can’t improve upon:
Plate tectonics….caused by climate change. No mention of the fact that Iceland has one of the highest geothermal heat fluxes on the planet, that its geomorphology is controlled by vulcanism, that many of the scientific terms for glacial melt features are in Icelandic Language, and oh boy, 11 billion tons of ice is really not that much, in fact, one eruption of Hekla or Eyjafjallajokull would release about that much ice.
These people have zero shame, and even less uniformitarian common sense. They elevate conjecture to the level of fact, for an uncritical media to spew around in alarming terms. This one takes the cake. Vote Green, everyone. Soon you’ll find out what living under nature is all about.
We’ll have more on this later, readers are encouraged to add comments regarding this inanity.

"**PayPal has entered the cryptocurrency market, announcing that its customers will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin and other virtual currencies using their PayPal accounts.**
Those virtual coins could then be used to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said.
PayPal plans to roll out buying options in the US over the next few weeks, with the full rollout due early next year.
Bitcoin prices rose alongside the news, breaking the $12,000 (Â£9,170) mark.
The other cryptocurrencies to be added first will be Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash (a spin-off from Bitcoin).
All could be stored ""directly within the PayPal digital wallet"", the company said.
Cryptocurrencies have remained a niche payment method, partly down to the rapid change in prices they can experience compared with traditional state-backed currencies. That has made them popular among some types of investors.
PayPal said it was aiming ""to increase consumer understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency"".
""As part of this offering, PayPal will provide account holders with educational content to help them understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem,"" it said.
But David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain and the forthcoming Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money, said PayPal was describing ""a crypto day-trading market"".
""I'm at a loss as to who the market is for PayPal as a crypto-exchange,"" he said.
He likened it to playing the stock market, but with Bitcoin - whose volatile and less well-regulated nature was like ""gambling on penny stocks"".
""Have a flutter, drop $10 on it, you'll learn things you wouldn't learn any other way - but you are gambling,"" he warned.
He said there were ""a lot of big players who manipulate the price"", and ordinary people risked losing their money.
""I don't expect much of a market for this beyond existing crypto holders... I'm baffled that PayPal would offer this, and it's not clear what they're trying to do here,"" he said.
""There must be someone at PayPal who is very interested in cryptocurrencies,"" he added.
Other payment firms, such as Square's Cash app and Revolut, have already offered cryptocurrencies for sale. But PayPal has one of the largest merchant networks in the world.
When it comes to using the virtual coins, PayPal will convert the cryptocurrency into the relevant national currency, so the company being paid will never receive the virtual coins - just the correct amount of pounds or dollars.
PayPal said the system meant there would be ""certainty of value and no incremental fees"".
But using Bitcoin to pay at ordinary merchants is not due to launch until ""early 2021"".
Cryptocurrencies' volatile prices - along with their historical use as a less traceable payment method for illegal purposes - have led to numerous calls for them to be regulated.
PayPal has been granted permission for its operation from the New York State Department of Financial Services, in the form of a conditional ""Bitlicence"" - the first such licence granted.
To begin with, the service will work with an existing cryptocurrency provider in the US, the Paxos Trust Company.
But it is not PayPal's first venture into the area.
The firm was once a partner in Facebook's digital currency Libra, but became the first to pull out of the alliance, just a few months after it was announced.
The scheme was controversial, attracting attention from financial regulators in several countries.
Earlier this year, Facebook was reported to be ""rethinking"" the idea amid the resistance."
"**Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the United States as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election.**
It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days.
Prominent investor Dan Bongino said the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"" on Sunday.
But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users.
Some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx.
Parler founder John Matze said the app had added two million new users in a day, and increased its daily active users four-fold over the weekend.
""Don't worry, the app isn't normally this slow,"" he promised new arrivals.
While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth this year.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 2.6 million followers on the platform, while Fox News hosts Mark Levin and Sean Hannity each have more than two million.
Newsmax, a conservative-leaning news outlet, also crept near the top of the charts at the same time.
Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views.
It is one of a handful of start-up social networks - such as MeWe or Gab - trying to appeal to disgruntled users of the biggest platforms.
Mr Trump has been among Twitter's most vocal critics and has seen many of his tweets hidden and labelled as misleading during the election period.
Named after the French verb ""to speak"", the app has very similar functions to Twitter. Posts can be replied to with comments, ""echoed"" in a way similar to retweeting, and upvoted instead of liked.
Parler says it keeps bans to an ""absolute minimum"", and does not fact-check posts.
Parler does, however, ban some things, including pornography, threats of violence, and support for terrorism.
Following Joe Biden's projected win in the presidential election - and Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud - many conservatives encouraged each other to leave Twitter and Facebook for Parler.
On Facebook, multiple events and groups with thousands of members are encouraging a ""mass exit"" from Facebook to Parler from Friday 13 November.
The planned exodus has been mocked by left-leaning Twitter users as an escape to a ""safe space"" devoid of challenge or criticism.
The light-touch approach to content moderation means that misinformation can spread more easily on the platform than on those with stricter rules.
**By Shayan Sardarizadeh, disinformation reporter**
The first ""mass migration"" of right-wing users from major social networks to Parler happened in June, after a number of accounts that posted misleading content about Covid-19 and George Floyd protests got banned from the bigger social media sites.
Thousands of supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory have joined in in the last few weeks, after Facebook, Instagram and YouTube took sweeping action against them in early October. Followers believe President Trump is waging a secret war against a ""deep state"" elite of Satan-worshipping paedophiles.
Facebook's ban on organisations that promote violence has also forced groups such as the Proud Boys and Boogaloo Bois to rebuild on Parler.
However, platforms like Parler have become an echo-chamber for a relatively limited group of like-minded users. That's why many users who have migrated to Parler make repeated attempts to create new accounts to return to major networks - as they know that's where their content can get widespread traction.
While the content posted on Parler is usually not as extreme as other self-proclaimed ""free speech"" platforms like Gab and MeWe, it is the home of many posts that would either be flagged as misleading or removed by major platforms - on topics like the election, Covid-19, child trafficking and vaccines.
Senator Cruz, who recently lambasted Twitter boss Jack Dorsey at a congressional committee hearing, said in June that he had joined Parler because social networks use their power ""to silence conservatives and promote their radical left-wing agenda"".
Tweeting on Sunday, Mr Levin encouraged his followers to ""hurry"" and join Parler because ""I may not stay at Facebook or Twitter if they continue censoring me"".
But technology analyst Benedict Evans questioned how long-standing such a shift would be.
""How many core Trump voters will now think that Fox is too left-wing and Twitter or Facebook too controlled?"" he said.
""And even if that's a lot of people, will these stick - or will the scale effect of the mainstream networks pull them back?"""
"The investments made by the UK government in the transport and energy sectors as a result of the pandemic can usefully be compared with France and Germany using data from energypolicytracker.org (The Guardian view on the green recovery: Britain is being left behind, 28 July). Overall subsidies are £11bn in the UK, £38.1bn in France, and £44.6bn in Germany, which includes their £9bn hydrogen strategy. All three countries are supporting airlines, but in the UK there is no requirement to improve fuel efficiency. The total investment in “green” energy and transport is £8.5bn in the UK, £19.1bn in France and £21.5bn in Germany. So the UK contribution is smaller and only 25% is targeted, compared with 97% in France and 92% in Germany.  An example of an unconditional subsidy is the £3bn allocated by the UK government towards improving the thermal efficiency of buildings. No details have been provided as to how this will work, and most of the £3bn appears to be recycled monies. A targeted subsidy would be the £1.6bn bailout of Transport for London, but bailing out fossil-fuel dependent industries such as airlines without imposing any climate change obligations is bad policy, particularly in the run-up to Cop26.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the PlanetDave FaulknerFounder, Marlow CAN • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

In recent history no European nation has demonstrated greater military prowess then Germany. That competence had tragic consequences in World War II and colors Berlin’s approach to the world today. However, more than seven decades after that horrendous conflict’s end Germany should take on the defense responsibilities appropriate for a significant power.



For years American officials have urged, asked, and even begged the Europeans to spend more on their militaries. Six years ago Defense Secretary Bill Gates argued: “The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress, and in the American body politic writ large, to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources.” But Europe’s governments consistently refused, even during the Cold War when facing what Ronald Reagan called the “Evil Empire.” Like the domestic welfare cheats of political lore, they consistently preferred dependency to work.



In fact, the Europeans long were _reducing_ military expenditures. Only four of the European members currently spend at least 2% of GDP on the military, NATO’s admittedly arbitrary standard. They include just one of the three Baltic nations which profess to be so concerned about potential Russian aggression. Only one of the largest states with the most proficient militaries, the United Kingdom, hits the mark, and only through statistical legerdemain. An independent analysis concluded that despite claims to the contrary, Poland, too, fell short, despite claims to the contrary, leaving only Estonia and Greece at 2% or above.



France lags as well. But Germany, further east and most closely connected to the nations bordering Russia, does even worse. Last year Berlin devoted 1.19% of GDP to the military. Either Germans are cheap‐​riding or believe they face no serious security threat. In either case, Americans shouldn’t be expected to subsidize Germany’s defense.



In fact, President Donald Trump and his officials have been pressing the issue. Defense Secretary James Mattis said, “America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defense.” The president recently made much the same pitch: “We strongly support NATO, we only ask that all NATO members make their full and proper financial contribution to the NATO alliance, which many of them have not been doing.”





Despite its past vaunted military experience, Germany faces many problems.



Of course, that’s an unpopular argument to Europeans. They tend to dismiss this as a grubby preoccupation with money. First, if you just look at NATO costs—$2.8 billion in common funding, for instance—the Europeans argue that they look better. Of that amount, Washington provides 22%, followed by Germany at 15%. But common funding is not force structure. NATO only has manpower and weapons to the extent that its members have manpower and weapons. Which for effectiveness means mostly the U.S.



Second, contend the Europeans, the relationship should be about trust and solidarity. Thus speak advocates of nations that deny trust and solidarity with the country they expect to defend their own. Cynics might point out how such an attitude is more than a little convenient. Why don’t the Europeans show trust and solidarity and promote America’s security?



The position of Germany is of particular note. It simultaneously bears the greatest historical responsibility for Europe’s current make‐​up, possesses the most abundant resources available to protect the continent, and has the most at stake in today’s European order. Berlin has spent the last seven decades atoning for its past. If Germany will not step up militarily, then who will? And if no one will, why should the U.S. continue to fill the gap?



A large German increase is necessary for Europe to come anywhere close to the extra $100 billion sought from the continent. Some countries, such as Italy, continue to retrench, while others which are spending more are minor contributors. Noted Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO staffer at Rasmussen Global, “Now more than ever, $100 billion is a long shot. Other important European players—such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands—are either too small or too economically weak to have much of an effect on the European defense budget. In this scenario, Germany’s $30 billion could make all the difference between a stronger Europe or a weaker one.”



Secretary Mattis apparently worried after his first meeting with German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen that the administration’s message was not clear. Noted _Der Spiegel’s_ Konstantin von Hammerstein and Peter Mueller: “Mattis had opted for a polite formulation, saying diplomatically that there was a certain amount of ‘impatience’ in Washington regarding the German contribution to the Western alliance. In other words: It’s time to finally pay your share or things will get uncomfortable! It seemed as though von der Leyen had been lulled into complacency by the friendly atmosphere and hadn’t recognized the urgency of Mattis’ message.”



However, it now appears that the Trump administration has achieved what none of its predecessors could—a commitment from Berlin to meet the NATO 2% standard. Although German officials deny responding to Trump, the timing looks more than a little coincidental.



On Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel told a campaign rally: “Obligations have to be fulfilled and others in the world will demand that of us, and I think they’re right that Germany must fulfill its obligations too.” She earlier told a party organization: “In the 21st Century, we won’t be getting as much help as we got in the 20. We need to greatly increase the Bundeswehr budget to get from 1.2 to 2%.”



Von der Leyen also has been pressing her government to do more. She admitted that other NATO members saw Germany was “doing so well economically” and described Washington’s demands for greater burden‐​sharing as “fair.” At the recent Munich Security Conference she admitted “yes, we know that we must bear a larger, fairer, share of the burden for trans‐​Atlantic security.” And she announced: “We Germans want to accept this challenge, and we want to accept it as Europeans.”



The Bundeswehr is planning to add 20,000 personnel by 2024 and take a more active role in NATO operations, such as deploying 450 troops in Lithuania. Moreover, Berlin recently inked agreements with France and the Netherlands to create joint fleets of transport and tanker planes, respectively. In January von der Leyen unveiled a $135 billion procurement program through 2030. She said: “I am sure that this will find attention and recognition in Washington.”



However, Trump administration officials are likely more interested to see if Germany follows through with the Merkel government’s plans. Reaching 2% requires Germany to almost double its present outlays. Von der Leyen stated the obvious: “We’re moving in the right direction, but we can’t do it in one year.” Alas, it isn’t obvious that Germany can do it in seven years either.



Recent annual increases have been modest. Last year the rate was 2% and in 2015 just 1.2%. The previous two years German military outlays shrank in real terms. This year is supposed to be a more impressive 6.8%, but that still will barely nudge German outlays to 1.22% of GDP. And observers doubt Berlin will sustain similar increases in the future.



Despite its past vaunted military experience, Germany faces many problems. The International Institute for Strategic Studies observed that “the Bundeswehr is already struggling with recruitment and retention” and the “German armed forces are struggling to improve their readiness levels in light of increasing demands on NATO’s eastern flank.” Moreover, “the budget cuts of previous years have led to a shortage of spare parts and maintenance problems.”



Despite Berlin’s assurances, many of Germany’s neighbors are skeptical. Explained Fabrice Pothier: “The Bundeswehr is underperforming and has a limited ability to deploy its own troops or those of its allies. Germany is one of the world’s leading defense manufacturers and exporters, but too much of its defense budget is apportioned to personnel spending. No wonder, then, that German pledges to increase spending are usually met in Paris with an ironic shrug that it will only serve to make German officer pensions more attractive.”



Moreover, upcoming elections might upend Germany’s pledge. Germany long has emphasized balanced budgets and resisted an active military role. Polls of public opinion are conflicting. In late 2015 the public favored expanding defense outlays by 26 to 30%. But in December another poll found two‐​thirds of Germans opposed to spending more on the military.



When Merkel advocated increasing military outlays even she felt constrained to add that “the matters of development and crisis prevention are also important.” In fact, the government is divided, with control of the Foreign Ministry and other positions in the hands of the Social Democratic Party, the junior member of the “grand coalition.” The SPD already has blocked some of Merkel’s defense initiatives, such as increased military sales to Saudi Arabia. Last June Sigmar Gabriel, SPD chairman, complained: “We’ve fallen back into a kind of logic I know from my youth, in which the only question being discussed is who has to spend more money to procure arms.” Other SPD officials have spoken of “NATO saber rattling.”



At the recent Munich Security Conference Gabriel, now also foreign minister and vice‐​chancellor, doubted the wisdom of going along with U.S. pressure, though he believed Berlin would have to spend more. Gabriel opined: “One has to ask whether it would really calm Germany’s neighbors if we turned into a big military power in Europe and … spent over 60 billion euros [roughly $63 billion] a year” on the military. He suggested that outlays for refugees was a preventative measure and should count as equivalent. An overemphasis on the military, he warned, “will not allow us to fight climate change, drought or poverty.” Indeed, “military intervention also taps funding that could be better spent in combatting hunger and misery.”



As for Chancellor Merkel’s promise to reach the 2% level by 2024, he tartly observed: “I don’t know where this money should come from.” Similarly, SPD Vice chairman Ralf Stegner said “Tanks instead of social security is a completely false debate.” The SPD’s parliamentary whip, Thomas Oppermann argued that “We should not make the mistake and trigger off a new arms race.” The SPD defense policy spokesman, Rainer Arnold, said simply that the 2$ objective is “unrealistic.”



The betting is that attention on American demands will benefit the SPD in the election this fall. While anti‐​Americanism is not likely to play as well as it did in 2002 when Gerhard Schroeder essentially ran against the Bush administration and its myopic plan for war in Iraq, opposition to both increased military spending and compliance with U.S. demands could energize SPD voters. Merkel’s party has responded by promising to maintain social outlays, but has not yet answered Gabriel’s question about the source of the extra money for defense.



In fact, the most fundamental problem may be that many Germans perceive no threats to warrant more “defense” outlays. They aren’t consciously cheap‐​riding. They simply aren’t worried.



Merkel argued: “We have to spend more for our external security. The conflicts of this world are currently on Europe’s doorstep, massively so.” However, a bigger military doesn’t look like the answer to Germans’ greatest security concerns: refugee flows and terrorist attacks. And no one has suggested intervening in Syria’s civil war—that is routinely seen as America’s job.



As for Russia, few Germans appear to believe its brutish behavior toward Georgia and Ukraine portends an attack on Poland, let alone Germany. For all of the fretting in the Baltic States and tut‐​tutting elsewhere in Europe and America about Moscow’s actions, no one has provided any evidence that Vladimir Putin is mad enough to try to conquer Europe. What would Russia gain by triggering a potential nuclear war while attempting to swallow the continent backed by the U.S.? What evidence is there that the cynical authoritarian ruling in Moscow has morphed into a Slavic Adolf Hitler?



Which means Berlin’s commitment to a substantial military build‐​up almost certainly will flag well before outlays reach the 2% level. Which would result in renewed pressure from Washington. And a potential bilateral confrontation.



Most Europeans seem similarly skeptical of the need for more military spending. Administration officials view Germany as key. Wrote Hammerstein and Mueller: “It is increasingly clear that things could soon become uncomfortable for Berlin. The Pentagon sees Germany as the most important country in Europe, the one that sets the tone on the Continent. If the Germans don’t pay their share, U.S. defense officials believe, smaller European countries will follow suit, essentially hiding behind Berlin’s coat tail. The pressure from Washington, in other words, is only going to grow in intensity.”



And if Germany resists Secretary Mattis will be forced to confront his own red line: does he support America reducing its commitment to an alliance with those unwilling to do substantially more to protect themselves? Unless the majority of NATO’s European members consistently spend a lot more on the military, a transatlantic showdown has only been deferred.

Guest Post By Bob Tisdale
For the past few years, we’ve been showing in numerous blog posts that the observed multidecadal variations in sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic (known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) are not represented by the forced components of the climate models stored in the CMIP5 archive (which were used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report).  We’ve done this by using the Trenberth and Shea (2006) method of determining the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, in which global sea surface temperature anomalies (60S-60N) are subtracted from the sea surface temperature anomalies of the North Atlantic (0-60N, 80W-0).  As shown in Figure 1, sea surface temperature data show multidecadal variations in the North Atlantic above and beyond those of the global data, while the climate model outputs, represented by the multi-model mean of the models stored in the CMIP5 archive, do not. (See the post here regarding the use of the multi-model mean.)  We’ll continue to use the North Atlantic as an example throughout this post for simplicity sake.

Figure 1 (Figure 3 from the post Questions the Media Should Be Asking the IPCC – The Hiatus in Warming.)
Michael Mann and associates have attempted to revise the definition of multidecadal variability in their new paper Steinman et al. (2015) Atlantic and Pacific multidecadal oscillations and Northern Hemisphere temperatures.  Michael Mann goes on to describe their efforts in the RealClimate post Climate Oscillations and the Global Warming Faux Pause.  There Mann writes:
We propose and test an alternative method for identifying these oscillations, which makes use of the climate simulations used in the most recent IPCC report (the so-called “CMIP5” simulations). These simulations are used to estimate the component of temperature changes due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and other human impacts plus the effects of volcanic eruptions and observed changes in solar output. When all those influences are removed, the only thing remaining should be internal oscillations. We show that our method gives the correct answer when tested with climate model simulations.
It appears their grand assumption is that the outputs of the climate models stored in the CMIP5 archive can be used as a reference for how surface temperatures should actually have warmed…when, as shown as an example in Figure 1, climate models show no skill at being able to simulate the multidecadal variability of North Atlantic.  (There are posts linked at the end of this article that show climate models are not capable of simulating sea surface temperatures over multidecadal time frames, including the satellite era.)
Let’s take a different look at what Steinman et al. have done.  Figure 2 compares the model and observed sea surface temperature anomalies of the North Atlantic for the period of 1880 to 2014. The data are represented by the NOAA ERSST.v3b dataset, and the models are represented by the multi-model mean of the climate models stored in the CMIP5 archive.  Both the model outputs and the sea surface temperature data have been smoothed with 121-month filters, the same filtering used by NOAA for their AMO data.

Figure 2
As illustrated, the data indicate the surfaces of the North Atlantic are capable of warming and cooling at rates that are very different over multidecadal periods than the forced component of the climate models.  The forced component is represented by the multi-model mean. (Once again, see the post here about the use of the multi-model mean.)  In fact, the surfaces of the North Atlantic warmed from about 1910 to about 1940 at a rate that was much higher than hindcast by the models. They then cooled from about 1940 to the mid-1970s at a rate that was very different than the models.  Not too surprisingly, as a result of their programming, the models then align much better during the period after the mid-1970s.
Steinman et al., according to Mann’s blog post, have subtracted the models from the data.  This assumes that all of the warming since the mid-1970s is caused by the forcings used to drive the climate models.  That’s a monumental assumption when the data have indicated the surfaces of the North Atlantic are capable of warming at rates that are much higher than the forced component on the models. In other words, they’re assuming that the North Atlantic since the mid-1970s has not once again warmed at a rate that is much higher than forced by manmade greenhouse gases.
What Steiman et al. have done is similar to subtracting an exponential curve from a sine wave…where the upswing in the exponential curve aligns with the last minimum to maximum of the sine wave…without first establishing a relationship between the two totally different curves.
MICHAEL MANN PRESENTED A CLEAR INDICATION OF HOW POORLY CLIMATE MODELS SIMULATE MULTIDECADAL SURFACE TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY
I had to laugh when I saw the following illustration presented in Michael Mann’s blog post at RealClimate.  I assume it’s from Steinman et al. In it, the simulations of the surface temperatures (represented by the multi-model mean of CMIP5-archived models) of the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures have been subtracted from the data. That illustration clearly shows that the climate models in the CMIP5 archive are not capable of simulating the multidecadal variations in the sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific or the surface temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere.

Figure 3
In other words, that illustration presents model failings.
If we were to invert those curves, by subtracting reality (data) from computer-aided speculation (models), the resulting differences would show how greatly the models have overestimated the warming of the North Pacific and Northern Hemisphere in recent years.
What were they thinking?  We’d let that go by without calling it to everyone’s attention?
Thank you, Michael Mann and Steinman et al (2015).  You’ve made my day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany temperatures 2000-2015: 7 months warmer, 5 months colder
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Josef Kowatsch
(Translated by P. Gosselin)
We keep hearing from the media that also in Germany climate change is galloping away. Climate skeptics, however, point out single months where the official temperature data show cooling taking place. Climate alarmists claim that the skeptics carefully cherrypick the time period. A predictable and fruitless course of discussion is the result.
After our latest analysis of Germany and global temperature for 2015, we received an e-mail from a climate activist and we would like to lift the discussion to a whole new level. The basis for the accusations and counter-accusations disappears when transparent data get provided. Actually preparing trends for various periods and months and presenting them to the public in an unbiased manner ought to be the job of the German National Weather Service (DWD). Unfortunately this does not get done – whatever the reason for that may be. The DWD data for the monthly mean temperatures in Germany are however freely available at Wikipedia, and so anyone can plot the charts. This is precisely what we have done.
Our partner Josef Kowatsch did the job. Over the coming weeks we will assess and present a series of time periods. To begin, we plot the data for each month over the past 16 years, 2000-2015. The diagrams are depicted below. Shown are the mean temperatures in Germany for each month and the corresponding linear trend for the examined period.
The results shows 7 months with a warming trend:
January, March, April, July, September, November, December
5 months have a cooling trend:
February, May, June, August, October
The relationship between warming and cooling is very much balanced. The warming trend for January, March, and September is minimal. This also gets reflected by the overall annual mean temperature trend, which shows a minimal warming trend. However no significant rise is detectable.

"The expansion of UK airports could mean breaching climate targets, Climate Change Committee head David Kennedy has said. Ahead of a full report next summer that would examine the airport expansion plans, the committee chief explained the climate target to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 already accounted for a 60% growth in demand for flights. But if a second additional runway was added beyond that already in discussion for Heathrow or Gatwick, and if demand is not capped by suggested price increases of up to £200, that target would be missed. A glance at the top ten busiest air routes in the world reveals that all but one are domestic flights. Over the last 20 years short haul air travel has become the norm. But this has undoubtedly come at a price: airport capacity is stretched, rising fuel prices strain airlines that are fighting to remain competitive, and the environmental impact of so many more planes in the sky is growing ever more severe, with few technological solutions available to reduce them. At the same time, high speed rail – the only mode of transport able to compete with air travel times – is growing in popularity. There are now over 21,000km of high speed lines across the world, with a further 30,000km either under construction or in planning. So it seems there is a simple solution to reducing the negative impacts of aviation: shift passengers from short flights to trains. This may seem unlikely but it could be this simple with the use of air-rail partnerships. A handful of airlines such as Lufthansa have used air-rail partnerships for years, but they could be used so much more. The idea is not complicated. Certain carriages on high-speed trains are reserved for passengers travelling with an airline. Passengers still buy their tickets in the same way and can check-in at their starting station. This allows airlines to reduce fuel costs and environmental damage, capacity is freed-up at airports, and rail operators benefit from extra demand for their services. An example of this potential can be seen in the UK. Currently plans for a new high speed line connecting London with the north of England are in the final consultation stages. While there’s been significant opposition to the scheme, the government has defended the decision by emphasising the railway’s economic benefits. But the potential for air-rail partnerships to reduce flight demand has not been included in the debate. Air-rail partnerships are likely to be successful in the UK as a large number of passengers use domestic flights to transfer to long haul flights, particularly at London Heathrow. A prime example is the very short flight that exists between London Heathrow and Leeds Bradford. Even though it would be quicker to use the high speed line, passengers using this flight to connect to others at Heathrow are unlikely to shift to high speed trains. Their ticket price is only fractionally increased by flying, and airlines use this as a way to capture long haul passengers. By using air-rail partnerships, the airline still retains this link and ensures passengers move to high speed rail, but under their control and buying their tickets.  Airports also benefit from these partnerships, freeing runway capacity but with passengers still using the airport and its services to connect to other flights. In the case of Heathrow, for example, 19% of the estimated 23% of total airport traffic that would be carried by a new runway could instead be handled by high speed rail, according to a Transport 2000 report. Worldwide, similar benefits could be seen on many flights between city pairs. Some of the busiest air routes show considerable potential for air-rail partnerships. A prime example is the Sao Paulo–Rio de Janeiro route in Brazil. Here journey times on high speed rail would be faster than air travel, with a potential for huge carbon savings of between 75% and 97% depending on future aircraft efficiencies and travel demand. But it is not a mechanism that can work on all routes. For example, a high speed rail route between Mumbai and New Delhi would not achieve competitive travel times, and a shift in passengers from flights could actually result in a 320% increase in carbon emissions. The reason for this is that high speed trains are powered by the electricity grid – unlike Brazil’s largely hydroelectric-powered grid, India’s electricity demands are overwhelmingly met by coal-fired power stations. While India may improve the carbon intensity of its electricity generating networks in the future, it would have to be very significant. So co-operative air-rail partnerships and greater deployment of high speed rail networks show great potential in reducing the environmental impacts of aviation, lowering airlines’ fuel costs, and releasing airport capacity in many cases. But to work most effectively the schemes need to be integrated into the planning process of new high speed rail routes from the outset. This requires airlines, rail operators and governments to realise the potential, and for the relationship to become one of collaboration rather than just competition."
"As people flock to beaches and parks this weekend after the hottest August day in 17 years, a leading health expert has warned that such heatwaves will become more regular – and highly dangerous – if nothing is done to curtail the climate emergency. Temperatures reached 36.4C (97.5F) in Heathrow and Kew Gardens on Friday, the highest on any day in this month since 2003, the Met Office said. The hot weather in some parts of the country is expected to give way to thunderstorms early next week. Ilan Kelman, a professor of disasters and health at University College London, warned that the sort of weather being seen in southern England, which poses a serious risk to vulnerable people, would become more regular unless action was taken. “These temperatures are unfortunately in line with the expectations for heat under climate change, which is one of the most concerning health impacts,” he said. “Without stopping human-caused climate change, these levels of summer heat and humidity will become regular, making it highly dangerous for us to be outdoors and even indoors without continual cooling. Air pollution can also worsen under heat with its knock-on health effects, such as for cancer and asthma. “Irrespective of urban heat islands and natural climate variabilities, the human signal in climate change is showing in these heat patterns.” HM Coastguard has reported a surge in the number of callouts on Friday as people flocked to beaches. About 70 incidents required a response in the morning, which the coastguard said was above average for this time of year, as beachgoers arrived as early as 9am. “The coast is very busy today and that’s grown across the morning and will continue to grow as the day goes on,” said Matt Leat, of HM Coastguard. He said he expected to see a similar number of incidents to Friday 31 July, which was the organisation’s busiest day in four years. “It’s highly possible some of the beaches are the busiest in a number of years,” he said, as the Coastguard warned people to be careful and avoid using inflatables in the water because they can be blown out to sea. There were also warnings to avoid some crowded beaches on the south coast. By Friday afternoon, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) council’s beach check app showed 19 of its 24 beaches under red alert, warning people to avoid the areas as safe social distancing is not possible. The remaining beaches were under amber alert, meaning they were congested and beachgoers should “stay alert”. Daily weather is caused by the interaction of the strong global heating trend being driven by carbon emissions and local variability. The climate crisis has already made UK heatwaves 30 times more likely and extreme temperatures led to 3,400 early deaths between 2016-19. The government’s official adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June that “the UK is poorly prepared for the very serious impacts of climate change, including … overheating”. Recent research showed the likelihood of the UK experiencing 40C temperatures for the first time was “rapidly accelerating” because of the climate emergency. Another analysis indicated that, even with some cuts in emissions, London would have the same climate by 2050 that Istanbul has today, Leeds would be like Melbourne, and Edinburgh like Paris. All three foreign cities have already broken 40C temperatures. “Climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK’s climate,” said Mike Kendon, lead author of a Met Office climate report published last Friday. “Since 2002 we have seen the warmest 10 years in the series. By contrast, to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963 – over 50 years ago.” The coronavirus lockdowns across the world have led to sharp drops in carbon emissions, but this short-term action would have “negligible” impact on the climate emergency, a study published on Friday found. However, the research also showed that putting the huge sums of post-Covid-19 government funding into a green recovery and shunning fossil fuels would give the world a good chance of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 1.5C. The scientists said we were now at a “make or break” moment for keeping below this limit, which was agreed by the world’s governments to avoid the worst impacts of global heating. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts A wide range of business, economics, health and environmental groups are urging governments including the UK to implement a green recovery. Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, a consultant in public health at Public Health England, said that while many people welcomed spells of warmer weather, others found it difficult to cope. She said those recovering from Covid-19 or self-isolating, as well older people and people with underlying health conditions, were particularly vulnerable. “If you need to provide care to someone at risk from hot weather, follow government guidance on how to do this safely. The most important advice is to ensure they stay hydrated, keep cool and know how to keep their homes cool.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne of the biggest obstacles global warming alarmists have had to deal with is the inconvenient existence of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), as there are reams of literature showing that this period was as warm or even warmer than today.

Yet, a number of global warming activists and alarmist scientists have tried air-brushing away its existence, or claimed it was a only a local North Atlantic phenomenon (just as Wikipedia does).
Now, thanks to the diligence of two German scientists, refuting or denying the existence MWP has just gotten a heck of a lot tougher. In fact from their results it is becoming clearer than ever that the MWP was real and worldwide.

 Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s interactive Medieval Warm Period Map. The period was real and global. Click on the image and the markers to link to the literature underpinning the MWP. On the left side of the map you’ll find the entire list of the literature. The red markers show warm conditions during the MWP, the yellow markers show drought conditions, green markers show wetter conditions and the blue markers show cooling during the MWP. So far there has not been any study indicating a temperature fall!
Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and chemist Professor Fritz Vahrenholt have been working meticulously on producing an interactive Medieval Warming Period Map (above) which allows easy access to the robust scientific literature underpinning the MWP.
Medieval Warm Period was a global phenomenon
Now the first results of their Medieval Warming Period Map are in, they tell us so far in no uncertain terms that not only was the MWP real in the North Atlantic, but it was in fact a global phenomenon.
So far the Medieval Warming Period Map has 157 markers plotted on it. Each plotted marker has an embedded link to the literature which shows the MWP’s existence for that location. As we can see, the 157 studies represented by the markers are scattered all over the globe.
Climate models fail to reproduce the MWP
What drove Vahrenholt and Lüning to produce the Medieval Warming Period Map?
They write here that in addition to the dubious efforts aimed at erasing the warm period from history, the climate models have so far been unable to reproduce it. Even the IPCC in its AR5 climate report (IPCC, 2013a, chapter 5.3.5) openly acknowledges the models fail reproduce the MWP warming.

Unanswered questions, faulty models
This brings up some crucial questions that Vahrenholt and Lüning pose:
How could it have been as warm as it is today when the CO2 concentration was much lower? Which climate factors were at play back then that are today not adequately accounted for in the climate models? If the models were recalibrated, what results would they show for the future?”
These are tremendously inconvenient questions for the climate modelers and scientists, and so it is not a surprise that some have tried to erase the MWP from history. And these Orwellian white-washing efforts continue today.
Lüning writes, in a response to my e-mail inquiry: “There are still scientists who deny the global character of the MWP. […] The most recent example where such data is needed is a publication by Young et al.”
Photo right: Dr. Sebastian Lüning (Die kalte Sonne)
The project continues…100s more studies to be plotted
Clearly Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s MWP Map is a valuable, if not an essential tool for referencing the history of our climate. Professor Vahrenholt wrote in an e-mail:
The Medieval Warming Period Map is a resource that gives us rapid and easy access to the crucial scientific literature underpinning the existence of a worldwide Medieval Warming.”
Though the MWP Map already delivers robust results, Lüning writes that there are still hundreds of papers that need to be assessed, plotted and linked. To fund the project Vahrenholt and Lüning have been busy trying to raise the 25,000 euros needed to cover the expenses – a real bargain compared to the tens of millions flowing into the IPCC reports.
So far they have raised some 11,000 euros and the two scientists are confident they will be able to scrape together the remaining funding from private sources that is needed to finish the job.
Readers are welcome to make donations. Every amount helps:

"For Frank Vincenti, there is a certain truth to those old Warner Bros. cartoons in which Wile E. Coyote, scheming but hapless, always takes the fall in pursuing the speedy Road Runner. “You know, that cartoon is really correct  —   Wile E. Coyote and the real thing are not that much different,” said Mr. Vincenti, a barber by vocation, but also a   advocate for urban coyotes. “Coyotes are always going to be controversial animals, but they get an undeserved reputation. ” By day, he gives $10 haircuts at his shop in Mineola, N. Y. but by night, he transforms into a coyote whisperer, dedicated to saving coyotes in and around New York City and to challenging the perception that the animals are too dangerous to coexist with people in urban and suburban areas. After spying a coyote in the Bronx, Mr. Vincenti started the Wild Dog Foundation in 1996, a nonprofit that protects coyotes. When he hears of a sighting, he closes his barbershop and heads to the scene. He may spend all night working as a human scarecrow, chasing the coyotes back into the underbrush. The goal is to keep them out of the public view and away from the traps set by specialists hired to euthanize them. On a recent weeknight, he closed his shop and drove to an area near La Guardia Airport where a family of coyotes had settled in the woodsy patches near the bridge leading to the Rikers Island jail complex. Officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, deemed the coyotes a danger to users of a nearby parking lot for airport employees and notified federal officials to have the coyotes removed. Since the fall, coyotes have been continually trapped and euthanized, despite Mr. Vincenti’s preventive efforts. “You want to know the irony of all this?” he said, gesturing toward Rikers Island. “You got accused murderers and rapists over there, and the government is afraid of a family of coyotes. ” Pacing the narrow visitors parking lot for Rikers, he recounted how by early last year, three adult coyotes had settled here, which led to a litter of eight pups roaming the area by July. “The coyotes were like mascots  —   people were driving by, taking pictures like they were on safari,” said Mr. Vincenti, who showed up every night to chase the coyotes back into cover. “You don’t want them just walking around in the open because that unnerves people. ” Lobbying for the coyotes to remain, he handed out fliers and assured local residents that the animals were not looking for confrontations. He approached parents at Little League games and told them the coyotes scared off geese and hunted rats. Pushed by swelling coyote populations upstate, some coyotes have inhabited wooded sections of the Bronx for 20 years, Mr. Vincenti said. There are active dens under the Whitestone Bridge and in Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt Parks, he said. The adult coyotes near Rikers may have wandered down from the Bronx over the Hell Gate Bridge, which carries only sporadic freight train traffic. Mr. Vincenti said their puppies may have been the first born on geographic Long Island in centuries. He had hoped they would eventually migrate to eastern Long Island, but by last week, trappers had managed to kill all but one of the coyotes. “The coyotes had no chance,” he said. “My efforts were too little too late. I’m one man, on my own dime and my own time, and I had a lot of people against me. ” He stood by his car. It had a coyote rescue placard on the dashboard and a stuffed coyote dangling from the rearview mirror. Looking for the remaining pup, he examined tracks near a bicycle parking area. On Monday, he was back in his shop, which his   opened in 1925. Mr. Vincenti said he began cutting hair there at 13. The walls were covered not with photos of hairstyles but with images of coyotes and other animals. Mr. Vincenti has carved out an underdog role, not unlike the coyote. He is short in stature but with an outsize personality and tenacity. Mr. Vincenti’s coyote advocacy seems thankless. He sets up tables at events and gives talks at local libraries, often facing residents who consider the coyotes a threat to their children and pets. Mr. Vincenti, who is married with a    son, is a   history buff and a fan of Napoleon. During slow times in the barbershop, he plows through history books, educates himself on wildlife issues and dreams of making a living protecting coyotes instead of cutting hair. The euthanized coyote family left him discouraged, but he could already hear the next coyote calling, in the form of a sighting near Farmers Boulevard in Queens. Once again, the Road Runner cartoon proved correct. “Wile E. Coyote always loses,” he said, “but no matter how they try to kill him off, he always comes back. ”"

The Weather Channel posted this yesterday, no doubt to counter TWC founder John Coleman’s recent Open Letter and appearance on Fox’s Kelly File (several comments make the connection):
Global Warming: The Weather Channel Position Statement
Introduction
The scientific issue of global warming can be broken down into three main questions: Is global warming a reality? Are human activities causing it? What are the prospects for the future?
Warming: Fact or Fiction?
The climate of the earth is indeed warming, with an increase of approximately 1 – 1 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century, more than half of that occurring since the 1970s. The warming has taken place as averaged globally and annually; significant regional and seasonal variations exist.
Impacts can already be seen, especially in the Arctic, with melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and rapid retreat and thinning of sea ice, all of which are affecting human populations as well as animals and vegetation. There and elsewhere, rising sea level is increasing coastal vulnerability.
There is evidence in recent years of a direct linkage between the larger-scale warming and shorter-term phenomena such as heat waves and precipitation extremes. The jury is out on exactly what effects global warming is having or will have upon tropical cyclones or tornadoes.
Human Influence
To what extent the current warming is due to human activity is complicated because large and sometimes sudden climate changes have occurred throughout our planet’s history — most of them before humans could possibly have been a factor. Furthermore, the sun/atmosphere/land/ocean “climate system” is extraordinarily complex, and natural variability on time scales from seconds to decades and beyond is always occurring.
However, it is known that burning of fossil fuels injects additional carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This in turn increases the naturally occurring “greenhouse effect,” a process in which our atmosphere keeps the earth’s surface much warmer than it would otherwise be.
More than a century’s worth of detailed climate observations shows a sharp increase in both carbon dioxide and temperature. These observations, together with computer model simulations and historical climate reconstructions from ice cores, ocean sediments and tree rings all provide strong evidence that the majority of the warming over the past century is a result of human activities. This is also the conclusion drawn, nearly unanimously, by climate scientists.
Humans are also changing the climate on a more localized level. The replacement of vegetation by buildings and roads is causing temperature increases through what’s known as the urban heat island effect. In addition, land use changes are affecting impacts from weather phenomena. For example, urbanization and deforestation can cause an increased tendency for flash floods and mudslides from heavy rain. Deforestation also produces a climate change “feedback” by depleting a source which absorbs carbon dioxide.

"**Bash the Entertainer's infectious laugh and crazy videos have made him hugely popular but he says he decided to become the ""funny guy"" after getting racist abuse in school.**
Now 27, Bash has millions of followers across social media platforms, especially TikTok, but still remembers his first day at school in Glasgow.
Seven-year-old Bachala Mbunzama had arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
""We lived in a hotel in London for about a year,"" he says. ""Until one day our names were on a list telling us we would be sent to Glasgow.""
""I would not say we picked Glasgow. We just got given it.""
Soon after arriving in the city, he started school.
Bash tells the BBC Scotland documentary Behind the Smile that he wanted to make friends and went over to a group to say hello.
A girl stepped out of the crowd and spat in his face, he says.
""All I did was wipe it off. I thought 'is this how you get treated in Scotland?',"" Bash says.
""In London I never experienced that. My first racist encounter was that day.""
It wasn't the last, he says.
Every time he was racially insulted it brought his confidence ""from 100 to zero"", Bash says, but he could not work out how to fight back.
He says he would often try to keep away from people by pretending he did not speak English.
Later at high school, he noticed that if he joked it made him popular.
""When I started hearing people say 'he's funny' I started feeling more comfortable,"" he says.
""People like funny people. That's my armour. If someone was about to fight me or swear at me they would say 'I can't fight this guy, he's funny'. To fight racism I used comedy.""
And the racist stereotypes and abuse he suffered was used in his comedy.
Bash has posted videos about how he was asked if, when he lived in Africa, he had to chase his dinner with a spear or how all people in Glasgow wanted to feel his hair.
""I would take that race thing that hurt me the most and I would turn it into a wee sketch,"" he says. ""That's how I dealt with it.""
At first he posted on Vine, a briefly popular site that shared six-second videos, but he started to get more successful when he went on Facebook.
""The people I did not expect to find it funny, did,"" he says.
""The people that were in school that were mean or bullying me when I was there, they laughed. The people I used to want approval from were laughing.""
He was now at college studying construction and had worked in nightclubs but posting videos became his main obsession.
His big break came about four years ago when he shared a video showing his response to Rihanna wearing shoes that looked like a pencil.
Bash posted a simple video featuring his booming laugh and it got noticed and shared - around the world.
It got re-posted in so many places it notched up seven million views in a day.
Bash the Entertainer was a hit but his mum was not so sure about her boy's chosen career.
He says she came around when she saw how much he was getting paid for a link-up with social media site Unilad.
Since then he has built up a huge following over YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok,
He recently posted a video on Tiktok that got 30 million views.
It was a short clip of him blowing his lips to the sound of gunshots.
Other hits include the CEO of Copying Sounds and his takedowns of the outfits worn by celebrities for the annual Met Gala.
The consistent success of his videos has brought financial rewards in the form of advertising revenue and brand tie-ups with fast food and clothing companies.
But there is a dark side in the comments left on social media.
""Online hate gets right in here,"" he says pointing at his brain. ""And it stays there.""
""It'll get to the point where I don't want to post because I don't want people to say mean things about me,"" he says.
Behind the constant smile and his trademark laugh is pain and memories of his past, Bash says.
He is enjoying his success but he is also battling panic attacks and stress.
He says he tries every day to be positive and true to himself.
""The way I was raised was always to be humble,"" he says. ""I don't like to be too flashy, I'm always happy with what I've got.""
So despite his success he is not living the high life in a penthouse apartment or 10-bedroomed mansion, although he says he could be.
He still lives in a Glasgow high rise but jokes: ""Maybe soon you'll see me in a Merc and a big mansion.""
Bash the entertainer: Behind the Smile is on the BBC Scotland channel on Tuesday at 22:30 and on the iplayer."
"The development of resistant bacteria over the past 50 years stands testament to the power of evolution. While scientists have discovered or created hundreds of antibiotics to kill bacteria, those bacteria have almost as rapidly evolved to survive their use. The greater the exposure to antibiotics, the more rapid the evolution. This simple fact explains the urgent need to control the abuse of antibiotics used among people, and in agriculture. Resistant bacteria – CREs, MRSA, and others – have become a significant threat to human health. Strains resistant to many drugs have grown rapidly in hospitals, and in the wider environment. Highly resistant pathogens are now found in the rivers of India and China, due to sewage discharge. Owing to the lack of effective drugs, treatment for those infected with these bacteria is very difficult, and their prognosis grim. At the same time, there is a dearth of investment in new antibiotics: hospitals tend to reserve new antibiotics for infections that are resistant to older antibiotics or other drugs, and the potential market is very small. But there is a legitimate question of whether new antibiotics will be available at a large scale when they are needed. This rapid spread of resistant bacteria is in part due to massive overuse of antibiotics beyond humans. While international data is not available, the evidence from the US is compelling: the country uses approximately 40 tonnes of agricultural antibiotics every day. Most of this is fed to livestock to increase growth, and the rest used to control disease caused by high-density factory farming lots. Antibiotics are also used in fish farms for the same reasons, and on some crops to control mold. So, the risk that antibiotic overuse poses to human health by accelerating the process of resistance has provoked regulators to try to limit this practice. The EU has since 2006 banned the use of growth-promoting antibiotics. In the US, the FDA has been taking baby steps towards a voluntary ban on growth promotion. However, in much of the world – including China, India, and Brazil, which raise the most livestock – the restrictions on antibiotic use are weak or non-existent. Nevertheless, in most developed countries, it seems likely that farmers can anticipate increasingly onerous regulations that control how they use antibiotics. It will be costly for farmers to ensure and document compliance, since the regulations are likely to require more veterinary supervision, and enforcement will also have to be paid for. In a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Ziana Ahmed and I proposed a solution to the twin problems of excessive antibiotic use in agriculture and the increasingly desperate shortfall in investment in new antibiotics. Countries should apply fees to all non-human use of antibiotics. The higher prices faced by farmers would discourage low-value uses of antibiotics, and encourage farmers to look for alternative methods to speed growth and limit infection. Applying fees instead of regulation has significant advantages. User fees would raise revenues that could support R&D into new antibiotics, and stewardship programs to help protect existing antibiotics. New drugs would be valuable for human patients and also for agriculture, which faces its own problems with bacterial resistance. User fees would be more flexible, in the sense that farmers could decide whether they wanted to use antibiotics in a particular application, or not. Laws and regulations can at best prohibit certain uses, such as growth promotion, but they do nothing to discourage inappropriate use of antibiotics in other situations. User fees would also be simple to administer and monitor, by applying charges at the manufacturer or importer level to all sales of antibiotics not destined for human use. This would be much easier than monitoring every livestock farmer and veterinarian. Finally – and this is very important – applying a system of fees would be much more attractive internationally. The problem with a regulatory approach is that even if international agreement could be reached, different countries’ levels of enforcement would be variable. This would create cost advantages for some producers in countries without strict regulation, while still resulting in overuse of antibiotics. So it seems the choice is arguably between applying an internationally agreed tax, or struggling to agree upon and implement a system of regulations that is then only haphazardly enforced, which ultimately brings us back to square one."
"**Facebook India's policy head Ankhi Das has resigned two months after the social media giant was embroiled in a hate speech controversy in the country.**
The Wall Street Journal had accused Facebook of going easy on ruling party supporters who allegedly violated hate speech rules with anti-Muslim posts.
The paper also alleged that Ms Das had made the controversial decisions and was politically partisan.
Facebook denied the allegations and said it did not favour any party.
But the row put the company in a delicate position in its biggest market. Its head of business for India, Ajit Mohan, was later grilled by an Indian parliamentary committee.
Mr Mohan said in a statement on Tuesday that Ms Das had stepped down from her role in Facebook to pursue ""her interest in public service"".
He added that Ms Das, who was one of the company's first employees in India, had ""played an instrumental role"" in its growth and had made ""enormous contributions"".
She made headlines in August when a Wall Street Journal report alleged that Facebook deleted some anti-Muslim posts by a lawmaker from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party only after the paper asked about them.
Ms Das was at the centre of the controversy as she allegedly made the decision not to delete these posts.
According to the paper, Ms Das told employees that ""punishing violations by politicians from Mr Modi's [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] party would damage the company's business prospects in the country"".
The paper also alleged that similar posts by at least three others, who supported the BJP, were not taken down even after they were flagged for violating the company's hate speech rules.
Ms Das was then the subject of a second report by the WSJ, which alleged that she supported the BJP and Mr Modi, while denigrating the opposition parties in internal messages.
Facebook, however, denied it favoured any political party, and said these messages were taken out of context.
Facebook is hugely popular in India, with more than 300 million users. Its messaging platform, WhatsApp, has 400 million users.
The apps have grown in influence, especially ahead of and during elections, but the company has often been accused of doing too little to curb fake news or toxic content on them - a charge it has always denied.
""We prohibit hate speech and content that incites violence and we enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone's political position or party affiliation,"" Facebook told the BBC in an earlier email."

The Cold War was as much an economic as a military war. In many ways, the West, especially Ronald Reagan, broke the Soviet Union by engaging in an expensive arms race that the Communists just couldn’t win. Marxist economics kept the Soviet empire on the brink of collapse for decades. Reagan’s challenge to the “Evil Empire” pushed it over the edge.



Communist China, perhaps learning from the Soviets’ mistakes, is launching an economic Cold War it fully intends to win. It has powerful allies to its cause in the globalist establishment.



You’ve got to hand it to China. It’s the world’s second largest economy in nominal GDP and, with 1.4 billion people, the most populous nation. It boasts the world’s largest military force with 2.2 million active personnel and another 510,000 in reserve. It has financ­ially colonised much of the South Pacific, central Asia and Africa. Now it is buying influence in ­Europe, with heavy investments in Greece, including ownership of the port of Piraeus.



China is home to the world’s most extensive expressways and high-speed railways. There are 298 airlines and 235 airports.



According to Credit Suisse, for the first time there are more rich people in China than in the US. Of the world’s wealthiest 10 per cent, 100 million are Chinese, 99 million are American. China is also home to 12 of the 100 largest companies in the world.



Yet the UN still recognises China as a “developing” country. At the World Trade ­Organisation, it enjoys the same “special and differential treatment” as Zimbabwe and Haiti.



US efforts to put an end to the “developing nation” scam have been stymied. China, on the other hand, is fawned over by the globalists.



While it provides just 8 per cent of the UN budget, Beijing’s power and influence is disproportionate to this. Chinese officials run four of the UN’s 15 specialised agencies. Washington, which contributes three times more than China and, more than 185 member states combined, leads just one.



Nowhere is the cant, doublethink and treachery of the globalist elite regarding China more obvious than when it comes to climate change.



Because of its “developing ­nation” status, China avoids the economy-destroying emissions reduction targets guilt-ridden Western countries adopted in Paris. A self-effacing President Xi Jinping was quick to downplay this incredible gift, saying Beijing would cut its “emissions intensity” by 60 to 65 per cent by 2030.



This is a blatant lie, of course. Monitoring shows that Beijing is rapidly building a fleet of [coal-powered generators.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/transcript-part-two-president-trumps-speech-to-the-un/) Its growth alone in coal-fired capacity is set to exceed Australia’s total generation in just 18 months.



Appearing virtuous is what counts. So when ­“developing” China, refreshingly distinct from the ugly “developed” West, signalled that by 2030 it ­intended to construct between 300 and 500 coal-fired power plants, it barely raised a murmur, notwithstanding that it renders the Paris global emissions targets practically unachievable.



No complaints either when, in addition to new coal-fired power stations and the 3000 coalmines it already operates, China ­announced it is funding 17 more mines…Why then, if the world’s biggest “polluter” is so clearly dismissive of the “climate emergency”, do global grandstanders such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Greta Thunberg and Greenpeace continue to direct their hostility at the West? Why isn’t Extinction Rebellion disrupting traffic in Tiananmen Square?



In the last Cold War, the Soviets famously had their “Useful Idiots”: ideologically besotted academics, activists, and a network of spies and moles in government, who more or less secretively agitated for the communist cause. China has its own network of idiots, so deranged by their hysterical ideology that it has to be wondered whether they even realise who and what they are abetting.

Senate EPW Republicans Take a Stand for Academic Freedom
WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OKla.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), today led all EPW Republicans in a letter promoting scientific discovery and academic freedom. The letter was sent to the same 107 recipients of letters sent earlier this week by Congressional Democrats to universities, private companies, trade groups, and non-profit organizations, asking for detailed information on funding climate science. As explained in the EPW Republican letter sent today, there is a real concern the Democrats inquiry may impose a chilling effect on scientific inquiry and free speech.
“Rather than empower scientists and researchers to expand the public discourse on climate science and other environmental topics, the [Democrats] letter could be viewed as an attempt to silence legitimate intellectual and scientific inquiry,” said the Senators in today’s letter.
There has been a public outcry in response to the Democrats letters. Noted climate scientist, Dr. Michael Mann spoke of the letters calling them “heavy handed and overly aggressive.” Earlier today the American Meteorological Society warned that the letters sent by Congressional Democrats send a “chilling message to all academic researchers.”
“At the end of the day, those disagreeing with certain scientific findings should judge them based on whether or not they are sound and transparent,” said Chairman Inhofe.
The full text of the letter is as follows:
February 27, 2014
Dear _______,
We write in regards to the recent request for information on your support of scientific research initiated by several of our colleagues in the United States Congress. At the outset, we are deeply concerned the letter calls into question the importance of scientific discovery and academic freedom. Rather than empower scientists and researchers to expand the public discourse on climate science and other environmental topics, the letter could be viewed as an attempt to silence legitimate intellectual and scientific inquiry.
Federal government-sponsored research is good and necessary, but such funding has limits. The federal government does not have a monopoly on funding high-quality scientific research, and many of the nation’s environmental laws require decisions be based on the best scientific information available—not just federally funded research. At the core of American ingenuity are those researchers who challenge the status quo whether in matters of climate, economics, medicine, or any field of study. Institutions of higher-learning and non-governmental funding are vital to facilitating such research and scientific inquiry. Limiting research and science to only those who receive federal government resources would undermine and slow American education, economic prosperity, and technological advancement.
The credibility of a scientific finding, research paper, report, or advancement should be weighed on its compliance with the scientific method and ability to meet the principles of sound science; in short, it should be weighed on its merits. The scientific method is a process marked by skepticism and testing, rather than dogma. If the work can be reproduced and independent experts have a fair chance to validate the findings then it is sound, irrespective of funding sources. Science the federal government uses to support regulatory decisions should also comply with the integrity, quality, and transparency requirements under the Information Quality Act and Office of Management and Budget Guidelines.
Indeed, science is only one criterion we must take into consideration when developing laws and regulations. Credible deliberation requires thoughtful analysis and an understanding of the economy, policy, and legal framework in which we function. Dissenting opinions fostered through the encouragement of all ideas is what truly facilitates intellectual prosperity and political discourse.
The letter you received from our colleagues is a wholly inappropriate effort to challenge these well-accepted truths. We ask you to not be afraid of political repercussions or public attacks regardless of how you respond. Above all, we ask that you continue to support scientific inquiry and discovery, and protect academic freedom despite efforts to chill free speech.
Sincerely,
Sen. Jim Inhofe, Chairman
Sen. David Vitter
Sen. John Barrasso
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito
Sen. Mike Crapo
Sen. John Boozman
Sen. Jeff Sessions
Sen. Rodger F. Wicker

"The presidency of Donald J. Trump has been noteworthy for its speed. In his first week in office, as the president’s aides won’t tire of reminding us, Mr. Trump has already put in motion plans to do much of what he promised to do while campaigning. But it’s not just the politician who is moving fast. It’s the population, too. In a matter of hours on Saturday, thousands rushed to the nation’s airports, beckoned by tweets. The flash protests in response to Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, which continued to grow in many cities on Sunday, were as organized as they were instantaneous. Dispatched online, the protesters knew where to go, and they knew what to do once they arrived: to command the story by making a scene. Mr. Trump feeds off media attention. Throughout the campaign, the bigger a spectacle he created, the larger he loomed in the public consciousness. What has been remarkable during the last two weekends is how thoroughly Mr. Trump’s own media personage was blotted out by scenes of protesters. In a brief appearance on Saturday, the president assured the nation that his immigrant ban was “working out very nicely  —   you see it in the airports. ” But the pictures and videos flooding across our social streams put the lie to Mr. Trump’s breezy pronouncements. Things at the airports weren’t working out very nicely you could see it right there on Instagram. A similar story unfolded the weekend before. In his inaugural address Mr. Trump claimed the mantle of popular will. The next day, a far larger illustration of popular will was on display at marches across the country. The people who gathered for the women’s march hijacked the media narrative. Even for those who did not assemble on either weekend, the pictures carried special power. Amplified on social media and echoing across every TV network, they suggested something larger afoot, something  . “Something’s happening out there,” Ana Navarro, the Republican   and television pundit, declared on Twitter. Something sure is. We’re witnessing the stirrings of a national popular movement aimed at defeating the policies of Mr. Trump. It is a movement without official leaders. In fact, to a noteworthy degree, the formal apparatus of the Democratic Party has been nearly absent from the uprisings. Unlike the Tea Party and the   “” the new movement has no name. Call it the   or, if you want to really drive Mr. Trump up the wall, the  . Or call it nothing. Though nameless and decentralized, the movement isn’t chaotic. Because it was hatched on social networks and is dispatched by mobile phones, it appears to be organizationally sophisticated and ferociously savvy about conquering the media. Over two weekends, the protests have accomplished something just about unprecedented in the nearly two years since Mr. Trump first declared his White House run: They have nudged him from the media spotlight he depends on. They are the only force we’ve seen that has been capable of untangling his singular hold on the media ecosystem. The movement is new and possibly fragile it could dissipate, like so much else that has come up against Mr. Trump. But in such a short time, the movement has proved unusually adept. It can marshal crowds quickly, as we saw over the weekend, and it can go big, as we saw in the women’s marches, which some crowd scientists believe were the largest day of protest in American history. The movement has other skills. It’s capable of coming up with catchy slogans, funny signs and even branding efforts to rival Mr. Trump’s own. The president has his Make America Great Again hats. Protesters at the women’s march had pink woolen hats with cat ears  —   “pussy hats,” a reference to the president’s confessed penchant for grabbing things. But unlike Mr. Trump’s hats, the pink caps came from the crowd. Thousands of knitters created them in the weeks between the election and the inauguration, then mailed them off to strangers who shared their views. There’s money, too. Since Mr. Trump’s win, the inchoate online movement has sparked millions in donations to progressive groups such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Over the weekend, the A. C. L. U. raised more than $20 million. The movement can also compel the attention of elites. In large part because of pressure from their connected work forces, the leaders of many technology companies denounced Mr. Trump’s immigration orders. Between Friday and Monday, thanks to the movement, Silicon Valley was transformed. An industry that was once merely skeptical of Mr. Trump largely became opposed to him, only because crowds forced change. Most important, though, the movement can command the media narrative. The president has promised a lot of bold change. His boldness will involve lots of   consequences. Millions might lose health care coverage if he repeals the Affordable Care Act. Many might be deported if he achieves his immigration proposals. If the last two weeks are any indication, though, none of this will happen quietly. There will be pictures and viral videos of real people facing hardship, and those pictures are sure to inspire hordes. When people are left with crippling medical bills in the absence of health insurance, or when people are deported to Mexico, you will see large gatherings on Facebook, and then on TV. Already, a group of scientists are planning to march on Washington in opposition to what they say is Mr. Trump’s disdain for science. There are other protests planned for Tax Day in April to remind the nation that the president once promised to release his tax returns, then reneged. You might wonder if the protests will achieve much. Americans have protested before (the war in Iraq comes to mind) and the protests did not, in themselves, alter national policy. But if Mr. Trump has proved anything, it’s that everything is different now. We live in a culture ruled by social media streams, one in which most people are skeptical of what they see and read in the “mainstream media. ” This explains why Stephen K. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News who is a close adviser to Mr. Trump, has been seeking to paint the news media as Mr. Trump’s primary opposition. The weakened news media is an easy mark for Mr. Trump. If the media is his only opponent, he’s got nothing to worry about. Unlike the news media, though, protesters produce an undeniable reality. Protesters can’t easily be dismissed as “fake news. ” They come to you unmediated  —   not from The New York Times, but from your friends and friends of friends on Facebook. They are, in other words, just another version of your social network  —   the physical manifestation of an outraged News Feed. Because they’re people you know, they can’t easily be maligned as biased or unfair. When politicians take on political crowds rather than other politicians, it usually ends badly. Hillary Clinton had to apologize for calling Mr. Trump’s supporters “deplorables. ” After first bashing the women’s march on Twitter, even Mr. Trump had to praise the demonstrators. There’s another reason for believing that protests could prove effective against Mr. Trump’s policies: The protesters seem to drive him crazy. Mr. Trump is enamored of crowds. Throughout the campaign, he and his surrogates argued that the polls were rigged, and that his large rallies suggested there was a growing tide of support for his candidacy. The crowds, in other words, became the whole ballgame. They were the only reality that mattered. If he won the crowd, he’d win the election. Now Mr. Trump faces the same dynamic, in reverse. The crowds at his inauguration were supposed to certify his popularity. When they fizzled, and were then outmatched by opposition protests, he couldn’t help relitigating the matter for days. Things haven’t gotten better. Now there are crowds on every screen and every feed. The people aren’t saying nice things about him. And there’s something worse than that, too: They’ve stolen the limelight for themselves."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I have a short but interesting report from Spiegel.de here concerning the performance of North Sea wind parks, which were once seen as the future backbone of Germany’s energy supply. Unfortunately things are not working out that way at all.
Photo right: Bard
Delivering only a tiny fraction of rated capacity
Spiegel writes that Germany now has some 3000 megawatts of North Sea offshore installed rated capacity, but which at times “delivers only single or double digit megawatts” and that “it does not fulfill the hopes of a reliable energy supply“. Spiegel writes that on one Tuesday morning in mid December the “total power fed-in dropped to just a single megawatt” (0.033% of rated capacity!)…”enough to supply only a few hundred households“.
Oh my, what a stunning efficiency.
Dogged by engineering woes, shoddy planning
Germany’s drive to offshore wind energy has been dogged by multiple technical problems and shoddy planning. Even when the wind does blow, the cross-country power transmission needed to deliver the power to markets still have not been constructed, and so it is impossible to deliver the generated power where it is needed (if needed). Wind parks operators are often ordered to shut down their turbines in order to prevent grid overloads. Also read here.

Wild output fluctuations
Spiegel writes that mid-December was not the first time that offshore power output fell to just a tiny fraction of rated capacity, and the flagship news weekly describes how the offshore wind power output has been fluctuating wildly this fall:
On  a total of 25 of 91 days wind energy production in part on many occasions fell into the single or double digit megawatt range. On the evening of November 11, the most power was fed in with 2631 megawatts. Grid operator Tennet had to compensate by switching on and off conventional power plants.”
Offshore wind power was once regarded as a viable solution for providing consistent power because it was often claimed that “the wind is always blowing offshore“. However harsh conditions, unpredictable weather, complex installation and high maintenance needs have made the cost of offshore power twice as expensive as the landscape-eyesore onshore wind energy, which also fluctuates wildly and poses other technical and health problems in addition.
It’s time to face the reality that harnessing offshore wind energy in the tempestuous North Sea is technically and economically unfeasible and thus can be only a very limited solution when it comes to energy supply.

"Britain achieved an unlikely status as a power provider last year. Its annual consumption of coal plunged to the lowest level in 250 years. According to figures released last week, a mere 8 million tonnes were incinerated in UK factories and power plants. That is roughly the same amount that was burned nationally in 1769, when James Watt was patenting his modified steam engine. That invention helped to spark the Industrial Revolution and triggered a massive rise in annual coal use in Britain, which soared to well over 200 million tonnes by the mid-20th century. Now levels have plummeted back to their original pre-revolution state. King coal – once the undisputed ruler of British industry – has finally been dethroned.  It has been an extraordinary transformation. Britain evolved into a world power thanks to its use of coal. It was the first western nation to mine it and burn it on a large scale, and it was the first to fill its cities with polluted smog, factories and power plants as a result. Coal runs along a deep, dark vein through British history. “For centuries, Britain led the world in coal production,” says Barbara Freese in her book about the dark stuff, Coal: A Human History. “It triggered the Industrial Revolution and created an industrial society the likes of which the world had never seen.” Or, as George Orwell put it in his 1937 essay, Down the Mine: “Civilisation … is founded on coal. The machines that keep us alive, and the machines that make machines, are all directly or indirectly dependent upon coal.” That was then, of course. Today, coal has long lost its lustre, to say the least. Its name evokes images of grimy poverty while its links to deadly air pollution, and its role in the dangerous overheating of our climate, have made it an increasingly unpopular source of energy in the UK. It provided Britain with enormous power but at an exorbitant cost in terms of pollution and the diseases – asthma, cancer, and heart and lung ailments – that emerged in its wake. Other countries – Germany, Poland, China among them – still burn coal in significant quantities. But the nation that first took advantage of it, and which built an empire using the industrial might it conferred, has now emphatically turned its back on coal. “Coal use in the UK had been declining for some time but over the past few years it has dropped like a stone,” says Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, the climate change website. “Clean air acts, the end of steam trains, the rise of North Sea oil and of course increasing awareness of coal’s role in raising temperatures in the atmosphere have all played a part. “However, the rate at which we have abandoned the use of coal over the past five years has been extraordinary,” adds Evans, whose analysis of coal use for Carbon Brief last week revealed its return to 18th-century levels. “In 2014, we used 84 million tonnes of coal. In 2019 that was down to 8 million tonnes. That is a drop of 84% in coal use in five years, and that is astonishing.” This meant only a handful of power plants still burned coal in the UK, and all of them were destined for closure in the next few years, he added. Coal beds were laid down between 290 and 360 million years ago in a geological age known as the Carboniferous period, a name – coined by English geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822 – that simply means “coal-bearing”. During the Carboniferous period, plants covered the landscape, and when they died they formed layers of organic material in oxygen-poor swamps. First they were converted into peat, and then, after millions of years of deep burial, into coal, a combustible black rock containing traces of hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen. Coal was burned in hearths and fireplaces in Roman times but it was not fully exploited until the 18th century, when improvements to the technology of steam engines saw them replace waterwheels, windmills and horses as the nation’s main providers of power. These refinements culminated in Watt’s invention of the separate condenser, which transformed the efficiency of steam engines and led to their widespread use in textile mills, mines and dozens of other heavy industries. Thousands of steam engines – all powered by burning coal – were installed across the country within a few years. In the early 19th century, steam engines were further developed and used to transport goods and humans. Railways spread across the nation. Then, in 1882, Holborn viaduct power station, the world’s first coal-fired power plant, began to generate electricity for public use in London. Other cities followed suit. Coal was beginning to embed itself in the fabric of British life. Over the years, coal continued to strengthen its grip on Britain, dampened only by disruptions such as miners’ strikes or the great depression, until, by the 1950s, the UK was utterly reliant on it for its energy and heating. Britons burned it in grates to heat their homes, shovelled it into the furnaces of huge generating plants to make electricity, made steel with it and used it as the fuel to run the nation’s railways – just as it had done for the previous 100 years. But change was in the air. Yellow smog generated by coal fires hung over cities in increasingly thick blankets. This culminated in the great smog of London that enveloped the city for five days in December 1952, bringing life in the capital to a standstill while killing thousands from bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses in the process. The Clean Air Act of 1956 was a direct response to the great smog. It encouraged householders to use other fuels – gas, electricity or less-polluting solid fuels – to heat their homes and stop using coal. Ironically, coal use reached around 210 million tonnes that year, its peak consumption over the past two centuries. That was also the year the UK established the world’s first civil nuclear programme, opening a nuclear power station at Windscale, in Cumbria. It would be downhill for Britain’s black gold from then on. Next came the railways. In the 1960s, diesel and electric trains were introduced on the simple grounds that they were more efficient and far cleaner to operate. The end for steam came on 11 August in 1968, when the last mainline passenger train to be hauled by steam locomotive power left on an excursion from Liverpool to Carlisle and back. Slowly, the need to burn coal to run British industry was being scaled down. The next watershed occurred in 1984, with the strike that brought defeat for the National Union of Mineworkers and triggered a series of widespread colliery closures across the country. Then the UK electricity industry was privatised in the early 1990s, and the “dash for gas” began. Regulations limiting the burning of gas to make electricity were relaxed, and dozens of new power plants were built to turn North Sea gas into electricity, raising its share of UK electricity capacity from 5% to around 30%. And finally, there has been the recent, extraordinary growth in renewable energy plants, including vast offshore windfarms, that now provide 37% of our electricity. They have provided the final, fatal blow to coal burning in this country, after 250 years. “The challenge for the next few years is to get rid of coal completely, and then after that it will be to reduce the amount of gas that’s burned to make electricity in generators,” said Professor Keith Bell of the University of Strathclyde, co-director of the UK Energy Research Centre. “We should look at last year as marking the beginning of the end for fossil fuels as sources of energy for electricity generation, and not before time.”"

The US news magazine recently selected Germany as “the best country to live in” worldwide. Although Germany offers many great things, it is currently not really a very good place to be – especially if you are a woman.
Never mind the glaring pay inequality and low number of women in high ranking positions, it is simply an unsafe place right now for the female gender. The reason: mass sexual attacks and gender-targeted robberies by gangs of men. There’s a state of heightened fear across the country, and in Europe as well.
1500 attacks
Germany’s flagship daily Die Welt here reports that the number of women sexually assaulted and/or robbed/attacked across Germany by groups of men during New Year’s Eve celebrations has surged and is close to 1500 as more women come forward and file police reports. The figure is expected to climb further.
The German daily writes that the number of attacks reported as of January 18 in the cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund and Bielefeld alone stand over 1000.
Cologne ground zero

As of January 18, Cologne, the ground-zero of the mass attacks, saw 821 reports filed with police, with 359 involving sexual assault. Police are now conducting a massive investigation of the New Year’s Eve crime wave. Cologne police have set up a 140-person task force to investigate. Düsseldorf has set up a commission to investigate 113 attacks, 69 of which were reported as sexual assaults.
The sexual assaults and robberies were not isolated to the German state of North Rhine Westphalia, but were widespread all over country. Online FOCUS magazine here last week wrote that attacks had been reported in some 12 cities.
190 attacks in Hamburg
The German national financial daily Handelsblatt here wrote last week that police in the north German port city of Hamburg had recorded 190 reports of sexual assault/and or robbery of women on New Year’s Eve.
Cologne cleric blames victims
Politicians have tried to shift the blame for the New Year’s attacks on the police, accusing them of having failed to recognize the violence and to react quickly enough. Others blame politicians for having neglected the funding and staffing of police forces for years.
But not everyone is blaming the police and politicians for the security debacle. According to the UK Daily Mail here, one Cologne cleric blames the sexual assaults on the victims themselves – because they wore perfume!

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently a blogger spouted off about the science of the sun’s role on climate, and so the latest paper on the topic published in Earth-Science Reviews last month is timely.
Once again we have a paper, authored by Soon et al, that indicates the sun’s powerful impact on our climate and that CO2 is a minor player. Moreover the paper reaffirms that the 1950s – 1970s cooling was indeed real  and pronounced.
Here’s the abstract with my emphasis added:
Debate over what influence (if any) solar variability has had on surface air temperature trends since the 19th century has been controversial. In this paper, we consider two factors which may have contributed to this controversy:
1.
Several different solar variability datasets exist. While each of these datasets is constructed on plausible grounds, they often imply contradictory estimates for the trends in solar activity since the 19th century.
2.
Although attempts have been made to account for non-climatic biases in previous estimates of surface air temperature trends, recent research by two of the authors has shown that current estimates are likely still affected by non-climatic biases, particularly urbanization bias.
With these points in mind, we first review the debate over solar variability. We summarise the points of general agreement between most groups and the aspects which still remain controversial. We discuss possible future research which may help resolve the controversy of these aspects. Then, in order to account for the problem of urbanization bias, we compile a new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends since 1881, using records from predominantly rural stations in the monthly Global Historical Climatology Network dataset. Like previous weather station-based estimates, our new estimate suggests that surface air temperatures warmed during the 1880s–1940s and 1980s–2000s. However, this new estimate suggests these two warming periods were separated by a pronounced cooling period during the 1950s–1970s and that the relative warmth of the mid-20th century warm period was comparable to the recent warm period.
We then compare our weather station-based temperature trend estimate to several other independent estimates. This new record is found to be consistent with estimates of Northern Hemisphere Sea Surface Temperature (SST) trends, as well as temperature proxy-based estimates derived from glacier length records and from tree ring widths. However, the multi-model means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model hindcasts were unable to adequately reproduce the new estimate — although the modelling of certain volcanic eruptions did seem to be reasonably well reproduced.
Finally, we compare our new composite to one of the solar variability datasets not considered by the CMIP5 climate models, i.e., Scafetta and Willson, 2014’s update to the Hoyt and Schatten, 1993 dataset. A strong correlation is found between these two datasets, implying that solar variability has been the dominant influence on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since at least 1881. We discuss the significance of this apparent correlation, and its implications for previous studies which have instead suggested that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide has been the dominant influence.”
In the conclusion the authors write (my emphasis):
If the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction and our new Northern Hemisphere temperature trend estimates are accurate, then it seems that most of the temperature trends since at least 1881 can be explained in terms of solar variability, with atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations providing at most a minor contribution. This contradicts the claim by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that most of the temperature trends since the 1950s are due to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Bindoff et al., 2013).”
So add another paper to the growing mountain that indicates the sun is the real driver. The ongoing denial of this is getting ridiculous.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago I posted a piece about an article written by award-winning journalist Günter Ederer, who had reported on Prof. Karl-Friedrich Ewert’s analysis of NASA temperature data – data that he found to have been “incredibly altered” to show warming. That NTZ post has been shared or liked close to 20,000 times so far, making it one of the most shared ever at NTZ.
Prof. Ewert now writes that he has received many enquiries requesting to see his results. He has posted a reaction at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here. What follows is a summarized version I’ve translated.

Plot of unaltered data NASA GISS. The reference of 13.8°C is the IPCC’s global mean temperature for 1880. The cooling in the 5th phase was modest at first, until 1960, but then was significantly stronger, despite rising CO2. Atmospheric CO2 rose by 1 part for each 10,000 due to emissions.
Ewert writes that man has always known that climate change exists. And as science developed, the reasons were for this were discovered: changes in solar activity and the sun’s the interactions with the earth. Yet, beginning in the early 1980s, out of the blue, solar activity ceased being a factor and suddenly atmospheric trace gas CO2 morphed into the major factor and is now regarded as dominant for the development of the climate.
Ewert remarks that the climate movement first started out as one run by environmental activists, but soon also scientists saw they could exploit it for advancing their careers, and thus shifted their efforts to producing evidence and computer models to show that CO2 was the cause of warming since 1980 and that it would continue warming into the future respectively.
However Prof. John Christy of the Uni­versity of Alabama compared the projections generated by the most important computer simulations and found that the results were completely different. Therefore the standards of science were not met because these standards require that different approaches reach the same result. The computer results showed the exact opposite: a warming range of 0.3°C to 1.3°C by 2020! Which result can be valid when they are all different? None!

Ewert says it is false to claim that a few decades of data from the earth’s 4.5 billion year history are sufficient to say the models are reliable for simulating the climate of the future. He notes that German experts Ulrich Berner & Hans-Jörg Streif scientifically analyzed the geological past, up to the present, for German government institutes and have proven that climate warming by man-made CO2 emissions is not taking place as claimed.
Despite the expertly performed analyses by John Christy, and Ulrich Berner & Hans-Jörg Streif, climate politics continue to claim a manmade global warming is taking place due to CO2 emissions. The sole basis for the political claims are climate models projecting warming despite the current cooling phase. The planet is currently cooling. Although the IPCC said early on that forecasting the climate is not possible because it is a chaotic system involving a myriad of factors, governments and scientists continue to rely on the computer model forecasts.
Ewert writes that much evidence exists showing that CO2 emissions are meaningless, but that the evidence simply gets ignored.
One example is the more than 100 years of measured temperature readings that taken from weather stations worldwide. This is the reason it was necessary to manually evaluate the registered temperatures from 1881 to 2010 in detail. The results are available in the pdf-file report. The chart above summarizes what was found. It shows:
– that four cooling phases and three warming phases occurred between 1881 and 2010,
– that stronger warming occurred before CO2 emissions began in earnest, and despite the longer cooling phases,
– that the temperature over the first 100 years even cooled slightly, and
– that there is no recognizable effect by CO2 emissions on temperatures.

"After learning she had a high genetic risk for breast cancer, Dane’e McCree, like a growing number of women, decided to have her breasts removed. Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with   breasts. It did. But while Ms. McCree’s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts, it is now completely numb. Her nipples lack any feeling. She cannot sense the slightest touch of her breasts, perceive warmth or cold, feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door. And no one warned her. “I can’t even feel it when my kids hug me,” said Ms. McCree, 31, a store manager in Grand Junction, Colo. who is raising two daughters on her own. Plastic surgeons performed more than 106, 000 breast reconstructions in 2015, up 35 percent from 2000. And they have embraced   techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural “look and feel”  —   using a woman’s belly fat to create the new breast, sparing the nipple, minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger, firmer lifted breasts. Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before. But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms. Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear. The main problem is using the word “feel,” said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery. Surgeons who use a woman’s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will “feel” like a natural breast, referring to how it feels to someone else, not the woman. “We don’t always mean what’s important to the patient,” Dr. Lee said. “Our focus has been on what women look like,” said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic, a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients’ quality of life after breast surgery. “What it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery. That’s the next frontier. ” The focus on how breasts look and feel to other people, rather than how they feel to the patient, speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance, said Victoria   a professor and the head of feminist, gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University. “There’s such a strong cultural gaze at women’s breasts,” Dr.   said. “It does raise the question: Who is breast reconstruction for?” Adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations, particularly “ ” mastectomies. During a traditional mastectomy, doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue, causing considerable nerve damage. But now, in certain cases, the nipple can be spared, raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved. The actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her   preventive double mastectomy in a New York Times   in 2013, inspiring other women at high risk of breast cancer to have their breasts removed. But the   surgery has yet to fulfill its promise, and in most cases, sensation is not restored. For many women, the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating. “No one said, ‘You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again,’” Ms. McCree said. “I thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply, I’d keep my feeling. ” Eve Wallinga, 60, a cancer survivor from St. Cloud, Minn. said many women who choose   mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them “whole” again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back. “They go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out  —   they’ll just have   stuffing in their breasts,” Ms. Wallinga said. “Some are very angry and upset, and say, ‘Why wasn’t I told?’ They feel very betrayed. ” The lack of sensation is potentially dangerous. Women who have had mastectomies and reconstruction surgery have sustained severe burns on their breasts from heating pads, hair dryers, curling irons, sunbathing and overly hot showers. Several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood. Many described embarrassing “wardrobe malfunctions,” when a bathing suit or   shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin. A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later. Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts. “It’s not just about the sexual arousal, it’s the awkwardness,” said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights, N. J. “You can’t figure out your space  —   almost like you’re bigger than you really are. It’s a bizarre feeling. ” She added, “When I put on a sports bra, I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they’re in the pocket where they belong. ” Nerve damage during mastectomies can create   pain syndrome. Some women experience tingling sensations, and others have debilitating pain. Patients say physicians minimize the condition, even though it is fairly common, affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients, according to published studies. Michelle Lamon Romero, 45, of East Longmeadow, Mass. said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago. She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level. “The surface of the skin is numb  —   if you run a needle over it, I can’t feel it,” Ms. Romero said. “But I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere. ” She added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that “this isn’t real, it’s all in your head. ” Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience. “So many women who join are just relieved to know they’re not alone,” Ms. Romero said. “They all start out the same way: ‘My doctor told me I was crazy. ’” Most surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman’s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue. The procedure has produced modest results. If sensation returns, it is usually limited to the perception of pressure, without improved sensation related to touch, temperature or sexual arousal. “It’s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before,” said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins, a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic. “It’s a poor substitute. ” Dr. Aldona J. Spiegel, a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation, said the procedure remained promising. “I tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast, it will improve the sensation. But I never tell them it will be normal,” Dr. Spiegel said. She added that many of her patients had shown “very significant improvement. ” One of her patients, Karen Holt, 65, a retired principal from Houston, had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago. Ms. Holt knows she’s unusual, she said, but claims she has “just about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right. ” But doctors say such results are rare. “You don’t want to give people false hope,” said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce, a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans. Restoring sensation is “one of those things that’s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction,” he said. “But no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we’re able to return sensation in any reliable way. ” Dr. Christine Laronga, a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction, telling them, “It may look like a breast, but it won’t feel like a breast. ” While doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves, they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone. There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome. “It’s a very tricky area,” said Dr. Ida K. Fox, a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery. “You don’t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain. ” Ms. Balsamo, 50, who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, said she did not regret the surgery, but wished she had been better informed. “I just wish I had known,” Ms. Balsamo said. “They said there’s going to be a difference in the sensation  —   not that there wouldn’t be any. Before you go in, shouldn’t you know the facts?”"
"Researchers, academic officials and science policy makers are expressing alarm at President Trump’s order barring entry to the United States to people from certain predominantly Muslim countries, saying it could hinder research, affect recruitment of top scientists and dampen the free exchange of scientific ideas. The executive order, issued on Friday and clarified somewhat over the weekend by administration officials, potentially affects thousands of students and researchers from Iran, Iraq and five other countries. Foreigners fill the undergraduate and especially graduate ranks at many American universities, and newly minted Ph. D. s from overseas flock to the United States for research and teaching positions in academic laboratories. Mary Sue Coleman, the president of the Association of American Universities, said that by one estimate, there were about 17, 000 students from the seven countries at American universities. “I’m concerned about it hampering our ability to recruit outstanding graduate students,” said Samuel L. Stanley Jr. the president of Stony Brook University on Long Island. Dr. Stanley spent the weekend monitoring the work of immigration lawyers in a successful effort to release a Stony Brook graduate student from Iran, Vahideh Rasekhi, who was en route to Kennedy Airport when the order was issued and was detained after she landed. “Immigration into the United States is tremendously important to science,” said Soumya Raychaudhuri, a Harvard Medical School professor whose Iranian postdoctoral researcher, Samira Asgari, was barred on Saturday from boarding a flight to begin her job in his laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “There are other countries competing for this talent pool, and walking away from that jeopardizes our standing. ” Some foreign universities, while condemning the ban, also pointed out that they still welcomed students and researchers from anywhere. The University of British Columbia announced the establishment of a task force, with an initial budget of 250, 000 Canadian dollars (about $190, 000) “to determine what assistance the university can offer those affected. ” Since the restrictions, some institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California system, have advised students or faculty members from Iran, Iraq and the other affected countries not to travel overseas until further notice. The order could prevent many foreign researchers from making   trips to attend conferences and other scientific meetings overseas for fear of not being able to return. The restrictions could also affect meetings in the United States, as some foreign scientists would not be allowed to travel here. The country’s largest general scientific organization, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said it was worried that the restrictions might reduce attendance at its annual meeting in two weeks in Boston. Hundreds of foreigners normally attend the conference. “We are of course concerned that this issue may affect scientists and students traveling to Boston,” said Tiffany Lohwater, an official with the association. She said the organization was considering alternative measures, including free   of sessions, for those who could not attend. Jennifer Golbeck, a professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, said her department had a number of Iranian students and researchers. Using social media, Dr. Golbeck in recent days has organized a database of people willing to shelter scientists and others who were in transit to the United States and were halted by the order. “There’s a lot of people from these seven countries,” Dr. Golbeck said. “And suddenly there’s this possibility that faculty members, students, postdocs and others who are outside the country for one reason or another suddenly can’t come back. ” Solmaz Shariat Torbaghan, an Iranian neuroscience researcher at New York University who was awaiting a green card, said the order would force her to soon make a decision: stay and take her chances, or move to Canada. “My partner and I just moved into a new place here, we are waiting for our furniture, and were hoping to have our parents visit us in a couple of months, which is not a possibility anymore,” she said. “Now, I don’t know what’s coming next. ” The uncertainty, she added, is not good for her research colleagues, either. “People in my lab are very supportive,” she said, “but in an experimental lab, people need to know they can count on you, that you’re not going to be suddenly gone and leave the project. ” The order may also affect work at some of the country’s most prestigious medical institutions. Eleven patients from the seven affected countries, which also include Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, were planning to travel to Johns Hopkins University for medical treatment within the next 90 days, said Pamela Paulk, the president of Johns Hopkins Medicine International. All have visas, she said, but now it is not clear whether or when they may come. “We are taking steps to see what the ban means for them,” she said. “Right now the ban is vague, and we don’t know if there will be health exceptions. ” She said that patients who travel from the Middle East to the United States for treatment generally have severe illnesses that cannot be treated in their home countries, and need complex treatments like neurosurgery, heart operations or bone marrow transplants for cancer or blood diseases. Some cannot afford, medically, to wait. Johns Hopkins may also lose at least one graduate student. Omid Zobeiri, 28, is an Iranian citizen who began working on his doctorate in biomedical engineering in September 2015 at McGill University in Montreal. His mentor and supervisor at McGill moved to Johns Hopkins last summer and hoped to take Mr. Zobeiri with her so he could continue the research he had begun in her laboratory. Mr. Zobeiri applied for a visa during the summer, but had not received one yet when the ban was announced on Friday. “After this ban, I basically give up right now, or wait some months,” Mr. Zobeiri said. “I don’t know my future. ” Kathleen Cullen, Mr. Zobeiri’s supervisor and a professor of biomedical engineering, described him as “phenomenally talented and a wonderful scientist,” and said he had been selected from among many applicants. She said his being kept out of the United States was “a major impediment and is slowing the pace of research in my group. ”"

Watching the UK election and how it unfolded induced something of a longing to a return to the FPP system of voting. Whether it has appeal or not, what the UK election showed is that it is easier to get the desired result if enough people want it. It avoids the situation of voting for a minor party in order to ensure the outcome you want, only to find that the party coalesces with the other side.



There are lessons to be learnt from the UK election by both major parties here at home. First, Jacinda needs to realise that the Corbyn agenda, which is so close to her heart, is an election loser even amongst those she would call the comrades, ie the working classes. These people want jobs and this wasn’t happening in the UK under the EU umbrella. This is why such a swathe of the north of England voted Leave. The election result mirrored the referendum only probably more so. This bore out what Nigel Farage was saying: that a second referendum would probably produce a stronger Leave vote.



The same scenario happened in America where Trump won over the rust belt of America on the promise of creating jobs through restarting or bringing industry back to America. In Australia, Scott Morrison did well on the promise of jobs through the expansion of mineral and coal mining. Conservatives also had wins in Brazil, Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands. This rather gives a lie to the premise that the youth, the millennials and Gen Z will all get out and out vote Chlöe’s ‘OK Boomers.’ So either the younger ones aren’t voting in sufficient numbers or they are voting along similar lines to Boomers, no doubt for similar reasons. Which destroys Chlöe’s rationale.



What can National take from all of this? For starters, look at the leader, and I say that mainly from a personality point of view. Look at the likes of Key, Trump, Johnson, and Morrison. To me, they all come across as someone you could easily share a beer with. Jacinda, dare I say it, exudes a likeability of a different sort, the kind, compassionate type. The difference is the other four know what they’re doing. Sexist comment! Immediate howls of outrage! The problem for National is that their leader, unfortunately, doesn’t have that type of personality. We live in an age of **personality politics** , and television plays a big part, especially how one comes across.



The other lesson National should take from the election is that the Conservatives didn’t win by being left-wing lite. Neither did Trump and neither did Morrison. **Their policy platforms overall are to the right of National.** Climate change didn’t rate in the UK, Trump is a ‘climate denier’ and Morrison didn’t let that deter him from boosting mining. National need to stop getting sucked into the left-wing agenda on matters like climate change. They need to make it clear to farmers that they appreciate the work they are voluntarily doing in this area and will support them without introducing onerous miles of red tape.



Areas of the country National should be honing in on are the West Coast, Taranaki and other areas where jobs can be created through industrial expansion including mining and hydro schemes. This would, of course, exclude National Parks. It’s plainly ridiculous that we are having to import coal purely because of the policies of a Government that is supposedly against it. It is also an insanity that you can’t put a spade in the ground in case you hit a snail or put hydro on a river in case a kayaker wants to use it. If we want to be a wealthy nation then we have to act accordingly.



National needs to break the Labour-lite shackles and give voters a real choice. They might be pleasantly surprised at the result.

"Julia Gillard has warned against a feeling of “received helplessness” that policies to reduce greenhouse gases are “all too hard”, citing the carbon price legislated by her government as proof climate policy “can get done”. Gillard, the former Australian prime minister and current Beyond Blue chair, made the comments on Wednesday in an Australia Institute webinar about the mental health impact of Covid-19 and the need to “build back better” with more early intervention on the other side of the pandemic.  Gillard said the Covid-19 pandemic had an “upside” in the lesson that expertise and government “matter” but warned of increasing nationalism and the risk a vaccine to coronavirus will not be fairly shared. The webinar was two weeks short of the 10th anniversary of Gillard’s 2010 election victory, after which the Labor government introduced an emissions trading scheme with an interim carbon price, which was falsely labelled a carbon tax by Tony Abbott and repealed after Coalition victory at the 2013 election. On Wednesday, the Australia Institute released research that if Australia’s carbon price had stayed in place, Australia’s emissions would be 25m tonnes lower in 2020 and 72m tonnes lower for the period 2015 to 2020. Responding to the findings, Gillard said it confirmed that Australia would be “in a different and better place if that scheme had endured” because the repeal had caused emissions to go back up again. “What I hope is remembered from that period and taken forward into the future … is that it is possible to put in place a scheme in Australia that does reduce our carbon emissions,” she said. “The received history is ‘oh we’ve been fighting forever, nothing gets done, it’s all too hard’. I would like us to unpack to the next level: it can get done, it was done. “If it was done once we can do it again in the future … I do want to push back against received helplessness that it’s all too hard.” The shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has been arguing within Labor that it should adopt the Coalition’s 2030 emissions target, a proposal rejected by the shadow climate minister, Mark Butler. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has agreed Labor will need to set a medium-term target before the next election. Gillard noted the Covid-19 recession had a disproportionate impact on women and young people arguing that policy responses will have to be informed by and match that these cohorts were impacted differently to others. Gillard expressed concern about school leavers and university graduates, who risk being a “generation that miss out on that first all-important workplace opportunity”. On the treatment of female leaders since she left office, Gillard said there were clear lessons for media to ensure their coverage is not gendered and appealed to social media companies to do more to crack down on threats of rape, abuse and death, particularly to female politicians. Gillard predicted the coming generation of feminists was “going to be a powerful breakthrough generation”. Gillard said Covid-19 had caused not just a health crisis but contributed to a “mental health crisis”. She cited more than 500,000 Australians calling Beyond Blue’s coronavirus support line and almost 1 million contacting Beyond Blue online, and a “significant number” of survey respondents reporting they were lonely three or more times a week. Gillard said there were a “range of problems” with Australia’s response to mental health, including a “maldistributed workforce” with most supports in big cities not regional areas and the “duplication, gaps and holes” of the federal system. She advocated increased use of early intervention and preventative measures, so people do not need to attend GPs for mental health support, and called for telehealth and “low intensity” services to continue beyond the pandemic. Gillard said the “spirit of bipartisanship” and “agility” demonstrated in the national cabinet could now be applied to “build back better” and achieve mental health reform. Gillard argued there was an “upside” to the pandemic – which she described as a “lesson right around the world that government does matter” and that expertise matters. “We’ve been in an era in the climate discussion, with climate change skepticism – but not just climate – there has been a reaction against expertise,” she said. “Yet here we are, and we’re hanging off every word from the chief medical officer and infectious disease specialists … expertise matters.” But Gillard warned of negative trends including the potential of the pandemic to “feed nationalism”, a “retreat behind country walls” and less global engagement. “We might see a scramble in who gets vaccines when they are available rather than fair global distribution, entrenching nationalism in a counterproductive way.”"
"Faced with a disgruntled climate voter during the primary season who wanted him to be tougher on the oil and gas industry, Joe Biden shot him one of his infamous “why don’t you go vote for someone else” responses. But that was six months ago. Now, as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden’s environmental credentials are on the upswing, and not just because his presidential opponent is a risk to the global climate fight. Major environmental groups were delighted by Biden’s recent announcement of pledges, unimaginable in US politics just a few years ago, including to clean up electricity by 2035 and spend $2tn on clean energy as quickly as possible within four years. Some campaigners remain unconvinced that he could be as aggressive as necessary with the fossil fuel industry, but his campaign believes they are on the winning path by connecting the environment with jobs. “We really do see these as interlinked,” Biden’s campaign policy director, Stef Feldman, told the Guardian. “The climate plan is a jobs plan. Our jobs plan is, in part, a climate plan.” As the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the US economy and forced millions into unemployment, it has also cleared the way for the next president to rebuild greener. The Biden message: vote to put Americans back to work installing millions of solar panels and tens of thousands of wind turbines, making the steel for those projects, manufacturing electric vehicles for the world and shipping them from US ports. But Biden’s plan, while significant and historic, would be just the beginning of a brutal slog to transform the way the nation operates. That’s even without calling for an end to fossil fuels, which science demands but Biden has been careful to avoid overtly doing. Democrats would need to gain control of the Senate and put more progressives into Congress if they expect to pass Biden’s climate measures. In a nod to the party’s left flank, and as a salve to the pandemic’s crushing economic blows, Biden has revised his proposal in order to spend more money, faster. He wants to essentially eliminate US climate emissions by 2050. “What’s going to be possible for President Biden is going to be partially determined by what happens in the other races,” said Tom Steyer, the Democrat philanthropist who ran against Biden in the primary and is now on his climate advisory council. “We’re working as hard as possible to push climate champions up and down the ballot.” Andrew Light, an Obama climate negotiator and fellow at the World Resources Institute, said the world will be closely observing Biden’s congressional support, including how Republicans react if he wins. “Is it like Obama in 2009, where the Republicans were just absolutely uniformly saying no to the new president? Or is it something where people kind of look at what Trump has done to the Republican party and then go, ‘right, well, we’ve now got to really take this seriously,’” Light said. Trump’s exit from the Paris climate agreement will happen automatically on 4 November, the day after the election. It will be the second time the US has led the way on negotiations and then pulled out or declined to join. The US also pushed for the Kyoto protocol, an international treaty in 1997, but it never ratified its commitments. To believe the US for a third time, the world will need evidence that Congress is engaged, Light said. The Biden campaign says that’s where he will excel. “The vice-president has tremendous experience getting big legislative packages done,” said Feldman, pointing to Biden’s support from both major environmental groups and big labor unions. He has had to walk a fine line to maintain that backing, political observers note. “I think it is probably near unprecedented to have a climate and infrastructure plan that receives rave reviews from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club and the electrical workers union and the auto workers union at the same time,” she said. “That’s really the coalition that is needed in order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and create good jobs at the same time.” Biden’s campaign has said his first priority with Congress will be economic recovery, which will include large-scale spending on clean energy jobs. Climate investments will probably be easier to pass as lawmakers hear from constituents about high unemployment because of the coronavirus. Polling from the group Data for Progress finds 49% of voters support a green stimulus. The idea is less popular with Republicans, with 52% in opposition. Jamal Raad, the co-founder of Evergreen Action who worked for Governor Jay Inslee of Washington in his presidential run, said “a successful package will have jobs in every community and will have something for every senator to tell a story back home about”. Biden may be hoping that moderate Democrats whose support he will need will be encouraged by his support from major unions. Lonnie Stephenson, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said he expects to lose some members over endorsing Biden, but the world is changing and workers are already losing jobs as coal plants close around the country. “We’re not climate deniers. We know that climate change is real and there needs to be some progressive action taken to try to address it,” Stephenson said. “At the same time while we’re making this transition to new renewables, we’ve got thousands of members that work in [fossil fuel] generation.” Stephenson said his group can support Biden because he doesn’t want to ban fracking for natural gas or to quickly shut down coal and nuclear plants. Instead he wants to create jobs in clean energy, including in manufacturing – where Stephenson’s members could be employed. Not all organized labor is as positive about Biden, however. The measures that draw electrical workers to Biden’s plan are the same ones that push more vocal climate activists away. Biden doesn’t set a date to phase out drilling for oil and gas – although he would prohibit new drilling on public lands. He doesn’t lay out a timeline for shifting away from gasoline-reliant cars. And he is mum on limiting fossil fuel exports, which would still cause climate damage, even if they are being burned outside the US. “This is good, it just needs some improvements,” said RL Miller, the founder of Climate Hawks Vote who has a seat on the Democratic National Committee. “But the places where it needs improvements are, to me, really important.” Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change International, said the environmental community hasn’t pressured Biden hard enough on the future of fossil fuels. “Biden has made large strides on environmental justice, made large strides on clean energy and said absolutely nothing more on fossil fuels recently,” Rees said. “There’s a political decision here in which people are afraid of a very small portion of the white working class in Pennsylvania, for instance. They’re using outdated information.” The world would need to cut emissions 7% every year this decade to have a hope of keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5C. Scientists increasingly warn that the goal is slipping out of reach. Miller said that to achieve it, Biden needs to call for even faster growth in solar and wind power, set specific goals for when new vehicles can no longer emit climate pollution, and move to ban exports of oil and gas. Those absent elements will be key if Biden wins and the US seeks to reshape how the world perceives the country on climate. Just re-entering the Paris agreement won’t be enough to spur the strong global action that is needed, not now that so many nations have been snubbed by the US repeatedly. Al Gore, the former Democratic vice-president who founded the Climate Reality Project, said the US must “re-establish its historic role as a leader in the international community”. “It’s still true we’re in a period of history when the US is the only nation that can play that kind of leadership role,” Gore said."

The letter below from Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona speaks to the worst sort of witch hunt tactics that we’ve seen yet. I suspect that pulling on these threads will backfire on Grijalva, as this will motivate a lot of people to join the fight against this sort of “climate McCarthyism” The letter is reproduced in full below, with the original PDF also available.

L. Rafael Reif
President, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
77 Massachusetts Avenue
Cambridge, MA 02139
Dear President Reif:
As Ranking Member of the House Committee on Natural Resources, I have a constitutional duty to protect the public lands, waters and resources of the United States and ensure that taxpayers are able to enjoy them. I write today because of concerns raised in a recent New York Times report and documents I have received that highlight potential conflicts of interest and failure to disclose corporate funding sources in academic climate research. Understanding climate change and its impacts on federal property is an important part of the Committee’s oversight plan.
As you may have heard, the Koch Foundation appears to have funded climate research by Dr. Willie Soon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, some of which formed the basis of testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the Kansas State Legislature’s House Energy and Environment Committee — funding that was not disclosed at the time. Exxon Mobil, in response to an inquiry from the House Science Committee, may have provided false or misleading information on its funding for Dr. Soon’s work. Southern Services Company funded Dr. Soon’s authorship of several published climate studies; Dr. Soon did not disclose this funding to many of those journals’ publishers or editors.
If true, these may not be isolated incidents. Professor Richard Lindzen at your Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences has testified to the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on climate change.(1) He has described the scientific community’s concerns as “mainly just like little kids locking themselves in dark closets to see how much they can scare each other and themselves.”(2). In 2009 he spoke at a conference held by the Heartland Institute,(3) a group funded in part by Altria and by the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation that proposed to teach children that climate change is a hoax.(4)
I am hopeful that disclosure of a few key pieces of information will establish the impartiality of climate research and policy recommendations published in your institution’s name and assist me and my colleagues in making better law. Companies with a direct financial interest in climate and air quality standards are funding environmental research that influences state and federal regulations and shapes public understanding of climate science. These conflicts should be clear to stakeholders, including policymakers who use scientific information to make decisions.
My colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research or testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships. Please respond to the following questions and requests for documents. Please ensure your response is in a searchable electronic format and that your reply quotes each question or request followed by the appropriate response. These inquiries refer to activities conducted between Jan. 1,2007, and Jan. 31, 2015.
1. What is MIT’s policy on employee financial disclosure? Please provide a full copy of all applicable policies, including but not limited to those applying to Prof. Lindzen.
2. For those instances already mentioned and others that apply, please provide:
a. all drafts of Prof. Lindzen’s testimony before any government body or agency or that which, to your knowledge, he helped prepare for others;
b. communications regarding testimony preparation.
3. Please provide information on Prof. Lindzen’s sources of external funding. “External funding” refers to consulting fees, promotional considerations, speaking fees, honoraria, travel expenses, salary, compensation and other monies given to Prof. Lindzen that did not originate from the institution itself Please include:
a. The source of funding;
b. The amount of funding;
c. The reason for receiving the funding;
d. For grants, a description of the research proposal and copy of the funded grant;
e. Communications regarding the funding.
4. Please provide all financial disclosure forms filed by Prof Lindzen in which MIT is listed as his professional affiliation, even if it is only stated for purposes of identification.
5. Please provide Prof Lindzen’s total annual compensation for each year covered here. Thank you for your attention to this issue. Please provide a full response no later than March 16, 2015. Direct questions to Vic Edgerton at vedgerton@mail.house.gov or (202) 225-6065.
Very respectfully,
Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, Ranking Member
House Committee on Natural Resources

"Ministers should be applauded for recognising that there’s simply no way we could tell the thousands of key workers and low income families, desperate for a decent home, that we can’t build any more new homes because of concerns about flood plains. For the past six weeks, Somerset has experienced its most significant flooding in decades that have at last required calling out the army. While commentators fixate on dredging rivers, or more sustainably planting trees, or reintroducing beavers as the solution to prevent more homes from being flooded, those with longer memories may cast them back to 2007, when much of central and southwestern England was underwater from some of the worst flooding in living memory.  Communities Minister Eric Pickles might like to consider the inconvenient truth of his own words in 2007 while in opposition. Following the floods, he said in response to Labour’s housing strategy that: “if you build houses on flood plains it increases the likelihood that people will be flooded”. As the still-beleaguered residents of the Somerset levels will recall, the floods of 2007 followed the wettest May, June and July since records began in 1766. The airwaves and newspapers were similarly awash with opinion in response to the government’s ambitious plans to build 3m new homes by 2020. Inevitably, it was said, so long as the proper defences were in place, some of these new homes would be built on floodplains. The cost of 2007’s wettest-ever summer: 7,000 businesses and 48,000 homes were flooded in the South West, Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, prompting 120,000 household insurance claims, 27,000 commercial claims at a £3bn overall cost to insurers. The subsequent inquiry led by Sir Michael Pitt published its review the following summer. It found that around 10% of properties in England were located on floodplains, with 11% of new homes since 2000 built in flood hazard areas, and 16,000 dwellings since 2006 built in high flood risk areas. Roughly a quarter of properties flooded in summer 2007 had been built in the last 25 years. This, the review pointed out, emphasised the vital importance of strong planning controls and well-informed planning decisions. Realising there needed to be a balance between development needs and flood risk, the idea of “environmental limits” was discussed within Defra. In putting “the green back into the Green Belt” as then environment secretary David Miliband said, this stressed the importance of the ecosystems approach. For example, planting urban woodland improves biodiversity and wildlife, provides a degree of flood control, renewable wood to offset climate change, and attractive environments for exercise and recreation. Strips of planted green space alongside city river banks are cheaper than expensive concrete barriers, and provide a fall-back area, a “turquoise belt”, that could be flooded without great risk or expense, and also provide for leisure and biodiversity at the same time. Of the 90 recommendations in Pitt’s review, two clearly stated there should be a presumption against building in high risk areas. This was in accordance with the government’s planning policy on flood risk, known as PPS25. The review also called for the effectiveness of PPS25 and the Environment Agency’s powers to challenge development to be kept under review, and strengthened if necessary. Another recommendation stated that Defra, the Environment Agency, and Natural England should establish through Catchment Flood Management Plans a programme that would find a way of working with, rather than against, natural processes. These approaches, which included setting back river defences and relocating buildings if necessary, were considered particularly important in the face of the predicted increase in river flow levels. Flood risk had to be managed co-operatively between local authorities, the Environment Agency and developers, in a more sustainable way and also as a means to provide more attractive places to live. Newspaper editorials at the time called for there to be “no backsliding on commitments to be better prepared in future” and that there should be “no cherry-picking of the Pitt recommendations for quick political gain in the run-up to a general election. But a general election later, in 2012 prime minister David Cameron is pledging to ”cut through the dither“ that is holding Britain in ""paralysis” and has brought forward by contentious measures to relax rules on planning applications with an eye to boosting growth, and providing 75,000 new homes. The National Planning Policy Framework is proclaimed “simple”, and had reduced planning policy from more than 1,000 pages to under 100, said to pave the way for swifter, clearer decisions. Otto Thoresen, director-general of the The Association of British Insurers, expressed immediate concern that the framework could lead to greater inappropriate development in flood risk areas, something that the current “rigorous planning system” was a bulwark against. The result, he predicted, would not be the “stimulation of the economy,” but “misery for people when their homes are flooded”. The National Flood Forum’s chairman, Charles Tucker, similarly argued that the new framework “has, at a stroke, scrapped the carefully constructed raft of technical guidance, context and definitions built up over years” for flood protection. Dredging as a solution was raised following the Cumbria floods of 2009, to which Professor Colin Thorne, fluvial geomorphologist at the University of Nottingham, responded that floods caused by a huge amounts of rainfall cannot be entirely prevented. Constantly dredging rivers and clearing vegetation to do so would be unsustainably expensive, financially, socially and in terms of biodiversity and habitat loss. It is clear to see, reflecting back on the floods of 2007 (and those in 2005 and 2009), the lack of integration and disjointed policy across the two central government departments has still not been resolved seven years later. The fixation with dredging continues, and David Cameron has called for dredging to start as soon as possible, reversing previous statements that it would be little help.  Perhaps instead if the media turned their attention to dredging the Defra archives, they’d find the “inconvenient truth” of floodplain development – that houses built on floodplains could flood – a truth currently lying buried in the sediments of their own filing cabinets."

Guest opinion. Dr. Tim Ball
I knew I was having an impact as a skeptic when I received a call from George Monbiot, reporter for The Guardian. I told him as much. I said I would answer questions about the science. Of course, the first question was about funding, because he had already determined the story and only sought quotes to fit the narrative or to pretend he had balance. I said I had never received funding from any energy company and started to talk about the science. The interview ended.
Monbiot did express outrage when the emails were leaked, but it was about the response of the CRU.
“Why was CRU’s response to this issue such a total car crash?” 
He then justified their behavior because,
Climate sceptics have lied, obscured and cheated for years. That’s why we climate rationalists must uphold the highest standards of science. 
Apparently struggling with what went on, he later wrote,
But the deniers’ campaign of lies, grotesque as it is, does not justify secrecy and suppression on the part of climate scientists. Far from it: it means that they must distinguish themselves from their opponents in every way. No one has been as badly let down by the revelations in these emails as those of us who have championed the science. We should be the first to demand that it is unimpeachable, not the last. 
It appears he was in the dilemma because he had not functioned as a journalist, but as a messenger for the political message about global warming, that he and his newspaper favored. The deception about global warming was only effective because of the aiding and abetting of the mainstream media.
Those most active in pushing the false information were exposed in the leaked Climatic Research Unit (CRU) emails. They represented very influential media outlets including The Guardian, The New York Times, and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). They sought information by indicating their willingness to carry the message. For example, on July 23, 2009 Seth Borenstein, a national science writer for the Associated Press, sent an email to the CRU). He wrote,
“Kevin, Gavin, Mike, It’s Seth again. Attached is a paper in JGR today that Marc Morano is hyping wildly. It’s in a legit journal. Watchya think?” 
WUWT identified the unprofessional nature of the relationship in a December 12, 2009 article. They were all willingly, albeit unknowingly, used by the powerful – the people they ostensibly despise.
In my recent article about the motive behind the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deception on global warming, I challenged people to offer an alternative suggestion to my proposition that it was about political power and control. “Follow the money” was the predominant comment. It is true that for most in the lower echelons, funding and career enhancement were predominant (Figure 1).

Upton Sinclair said,
“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” Or as Machiavelli more pungently said, “One who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.”
However, money was not the reason for the cabal who orchestrated the entire deception. They were members of the Club of Rome because of their power. Sometimes that power came from their wealth, but most were already wealthy. Some, like Al Gore or Maurice Strong, made additional money from their involvement, but that was not the motivating factor. Gore would have given all that money for the 1500 votes that kept him from the US Presidency. As Lord Acton (1837-1869) famously said, “Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” What is rarely quoted is the sentence that follows, which reads, “Great men are almost always bad men.” Acton elaborated on that idea with this variation,
“And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control. History has proven that.”
Everybody knows information is power. Control of power through control of information has evolved, like everything else. Those with power needed a conduit for their version of information. In the global warming deception, they found a media willing to be the messenger. Instead of performing their original role of exposing and limiting power, they aided and abetted.
The US Founding Fathers set up a system of checks and balances to prevent concentration of power. They knew the public did not have time to monitor what was actually going on, so, the media was given “freedom of the press” power to investigate and expose what was going on.
One part of the United States Constitution First amendment prohibits the making of any law, abridging the freedom of speech, or infringing on the freedom of the press. 
In those days the media was the Fourth Estate, a term posited by Edmund Burke, author of the important adage that
“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”
But Burke also identified the power of the Fourth Estate when he said,
There are three estates in Parliament but in the Reporters Gallery yonder there sits a Fourth Estate more important far than they all (sic). 
English poet William Cowper (1731 – 1800) summarized the power in his 1782 poem, “The Progress of Error”. The focus was already sensationalism and exploitation of fear.
How shall I speak of thee or thy power address,
The God of our idolatry, the press?
By thee, religion, liberty and laws
Exert their influence and advance their cause;
By thee worse plagues than Pharaohs land befell,
Diffused, make Earth the vestibule of Hell:
Thou fountain, at which drink the good and wise;
Thou ever-bubbling spring of endless lies;
Like Eden’s dead probationary tree,
Knowledge of good and evil is from thee!
This speaks to the control of the media up until recently. The global warming deception may be the last great fraud perpetrated on the people and promoted by the mainstream media. Today, the Internet supersedes the power of the media to control the message, and therefore be vulnerable to control by the powerful. It is why powerful people are trying to limit the Internet.
Stephen Cooper identified the role of websites, like WUWT, in his 2006 book, Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers as the Fifth Estate. It is no surprise that the growth of these web sites was coincident with the decline of the mainstream media. Just as politics overtook science, so it overtook the media, but it was the old politics of party affiliation that people despised, but still practiced in national and regional legislatures. The reaction was polarization and extremism. Politics adopted the dictum, that if you are not with me, you must be against me. Media became more and more sensationalist, so it wasn’t just the sky that was falling, but the entire universe. In both cases the facts became the casualty. Farhad Manjoo identified the result in his book True Enough: Learning to Live in Post-Fact Society. The Amazon abstract says,
 
Why has punditry lately overtaken news? Why do lies seem to linger so long in the cultural subconscious even after they’ve been thoroughly discredited? And why, when more people than ever before are documenting the truth with laptops and digital cameras, does fact-free spin and propaganda seem to work so well? True Enough explores leading controversies of national politics, foreign affairs, science, and business, explaining how Americans have begun to organize themselves into echo chambers that harbor diametrically different facts—not merely opinions—from those of the larger culture.
Manjoo overlooks the major problem, namely that most people don’t know the facts or how to interpret them objectively. Wikipedia is a classic example of the problem. It addresses the need for as much information, from as many perspectives as possible. These noble, but naïve, objectives were quickly abused as WUWT identified. In climate, William Connolley’s monopoly and biased control of entries, was an example. Most people have no idea whether, what they are reading is fact or fiction, or fact with a political bias.
As this was evolving education, which was always about indoctrination rather than education, failed to teach basic skills of analysis and interpretation. The word, discrimination, which traditionally meant “recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another”, became politically incorrect, socially and intellectually.
There was fierce debate about whether the CRU emails were leaked or hacked. Beyond the legal ramifications, was the important point that somebody thought that, what was going on in climate science was scientifically and morally wrong. Release date of the emails in November 2009 was to block further political action by the Conference of the Parties scheduled for Copenhagen. At that meeting, the plan was to introduce global taxation and transfer of wealth with political control that transcended national boundaries. Apparently the “leaker”, unlike Monbiot, thought that this was a bridge too far when based on false and deliberately manufactured information. Sorry folks, but the end does not justify the means.

One of the recent refrains from the White House and other political circles after a gun tragedy is, “We need common‐​sense gun reforms.” It’s a convenient piece of jargon that conveys level‐​headedness, non‐​partisanship and empathy. But it doesn’t mean anything substantive, because not all gun deaths are the same: Treating them as if they are is neither common sense nor good public policy. Many of these “common‐​sense reforms” — assault weapon bans and vague allusions to “gun availability” — do little to reduce the major drivers of gun‐​related deaths.





Many of these ‘common‐​sense reforms’ — assault weapon bans and vague allusions to ‘gun availability’ — do little to reduce the major drivers of gun‐​related deaths.



The United States contains an estimated 270 million to 310 million firearms. All gun crimes and gun deaths are overwhelmingly perpetrated with handguns, yet barely one quarter of Americans favor a handgun ban that would be required to lower that number significantly. So‐​called “assault weapons” and “high‐​capacity” magazines are easy political targets because they sound scary to people unfamiliar with firearms. However, restricting either or both would likely have no measurable effect on gun crime rates.



Roughly two‐​thirds of American gun deaths are suicides, and these comprise approximately half of all American suicides. Clearly, firearms increase the likelihood of a successful suicide attempt. And there is evidence from other countries suggesting that decreasing access to firearms can lower overall suicide rates.



But that doesn’t mean we need new laws to limit firearm ownership. In an interview with ProPublica, Jeffrey Swanson of Duke University School of Medicine suggested that mental health professionals “can do a lot without invoking law, by talking to people about harm reduction and locking up guns.” Other programs such as voluntary buybacks may reduce the number of household firearms.



But neither suicides nor gun deaths are “epidemics” in any real sense of the term. Overstating their frequency with inflated rhetoric creates an impetus for government action to do _something_ — even if that something is not effective at addressing the problem it’s meant to solve.



Of the remaining third of gun deaths, the majority are, in fact, homicides. These have two primary drivers: inner‐​city violence — that is, drug, gang and other violence attendant to poverty and segregation — and domestic violence. Although spree killings like San Bernardino make headlines for days at a time, they are statistical outliers, making up a small fraction of gun deaths every year.



Inner‐​city violence has a lot of causes, but two government‐​driven public policy problems stand out.



First, America’s war on drugs has been an abysmal failure, one that has bred violence through the black markets that prohibition creates. Despite whites and blacks using drugs at roughly the same rates, America’s focus on drug enforcement in the inner cities helps drive the violence among distributors in these segregated areas.



Second, firearm homicide clearance rates — that is, police apprehending a suspect and charging him for the killing — are embarrassingly low in minority neighborhoods. In her book, “Ghettoside,” Los Angeles Times journalist Jill Leovy argues that an absence of trust between police and black communities, along with a lack of adequate police resources aimed at solving homicides in black neighborhoods, combine to cheapen black life by allowing black murder to go virtually unpunished. If there is a gun violence “epidemic” anywhere in America, it is in the impoverished black neighborhoods of Los Angeles, Baltimore and similar enclaves.



Until the Supreme Court decisions in _D.C. v. Heller_ and _McDonald v. Chicago_that recognized the individual right to bear arms, several U.S. cities had virtually banned guns. In spite of its ban, Washington, D.C., was the “murder capital” of the country eight times between 1985 and 1999. After Chicago’s gun ban in 1982, its murder rate increased at more than twice the national average. More than three decades of high murder rates show that restricting legal access to guns was not the answer to gun violence problems and that making legal firearm acquisition harder is unlikely to meaningfully impact violence in America’s inner cities. Ending the drug war and providing more educational and economic opportunity for America’s racially ghettoized poor would improve public safety much more effectively than new feckless gun restrictions. 



Finally, domestic violence is a genuine problem, but one not getting enough attention on either side of the gun debate. More than 90 percent of female murder victims know their killers, many of whom are domestic abusers or jealous lovers. If implemented correctly, a judicial process that takes and keeps firearms away from those who have shown a propensity for assault — those with violent crime convictions, pending domestic abuse or stalking charges or active restraining orders — could reduce the frequency of gun‐​related domestic violence.



There is good news. Murder and gun crime rates in America have been trending downward since the 1990s. An American who isn’t at risk for suicide, in an abusive relationship or in a neighborhood beset by the drug war is extremely unlikely to die by firearm. As tragic, frightening and media‐​saturating as mass shootings are, they are rare. For the most part, America is a very safe place to live.



After a tragedy, trotting out clichés and focusing on exotic firearm terminology may be very effective at rousing emotions, but it doesn’t make sound public policy. That’s because public policy is not just about identifying “common‐​sense” solutions put forth in a climate of fear and outrage — it’s about looking at the data and recognizing the political and legal landscape in which that data exist.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot a single one of Germany’s established political parties officially opposes the construction of wind parks despite all the proof of their inefficiency, hazard to health and wildlife, ugliness, and lack of economy.
As a consequence, a growing number of citizens are becoming fed up with a political system that has become deaf to the concerns of citizens. Some 10 years ago what once began as a huge welcome of “green and clean” wind energy, has since turned into fierce protest – and is now developing into organized political opposition.
Hat-tip Gerti
North Germany’s online daily nordkurier.de here reports how in the state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania citizen initiative groups against ugly wind parks are taking their protest activity to a whole new level: the formation of a political party to be on the ballot in September’s state elections. In summary environmentalist citizens have had it with the green-preaching parties who refuse to listen and have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Big Wind.
The name of the citizens’ initiative, which comprises some 50 smaller initiatives statewide, is called “Freier Horizont” (Free Horizon) and it plans to be on the ballot under the same name in this fall’s election.

Deaf political system
The reason the Freier Horizont is forming a political party? The nordkurier.de quotes initiative’s chairman Norbert Schumacher:
Currently there is no democratic party which rejects the uncontrolled expansion of wind power that people can elect.”
The hardest hit of course will be the region’s Green Party as disenchanted environmentalist realize that the Greens have long sold out to profiteering wind energy opportunists. The movement led by the Freier Horizont is taking on formidable dimensions. The nordkurier.de writes:
Schumacher sees voter potential foremost in the countryside. At many places citizens have had the experience that there voices against wind turbines carry no weight with the deciding committees. Last year the protest group gathered more than 22,000 signatures in a short time in support of a citizens’ initiative calling for greater distances between turbines and homes and coastlines. The state parliament rejected the initiative.”
Initiative leaders tell the nordkurier.de that it was never their intention to form a party. However, elected officials simply just don’t listen anymore.

COP25 has wrapped up and the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, has issued a statement about the ~~lack of~~ results achieved. It is “ _an honest and realistic assessment._ “



Several days have passed since the closing of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, and it is important to conduct an honest and realistic assessment of what happened so that appropriate measures can be taken by the international community in guiding the next crucial steps in the multilateral climate process next year. 



  
We need to be clear that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market – an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition that can harness the potential of the private sector and generate finance for adaptation. Developed countries have yet to fully address the calls from developing countries for enhanced support in finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies and build adequate resilience to climate change. High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to improve their climate strategies and ramp up ambition through the Nationally Determined Contributions they will submit next year.



  
At the same time, in the final decision texts, governments did express the need for more ambition by Parties and non-State actors alike, and they agreed to improve the ability of the most vulnerable to adapt to climate change. Many decisions that emerged from the conference in Madrid at least acknowledge the role of climate finance, essential for concrete action. And decisions were taken in areas including technology, oceans and agriculture, gender and capacity building. A large group of countries, regions, cities, businesses and investors signaled their intention to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, as part of the Climate Ambition Alliance led by Chile. Also rallying under the Climate Ambition Alliance, 114 nations have meanwhile signaled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action plan next year. The caveat here is that not enough major economies have signaled that they are ready to shift the needle on climate ambition through improved plans.



  
Commitments from many sectors of society showed an overwhelming agreement on the only way forward: that we need to follow what science is telling us, with the sense of urgency and seriousness that this requires. What we need now is to focus our undivided attention on the next steps to further strengthen the trust in the multilateral process. As we head towards the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, we must be united and work in a true spirit of inclusive multilateralism in order to realize the promises of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. I thank the governments of Chile and Spain for their enormous efforts to organize COP25, and I thank all observer organizations, including the private sector, youth and scientists, for reminding us every day of the need to raise ambition. I look forward to working with the governments of Chile, the UK and Italy to achieve the best possible results at COP26 in Glasgow. Together, with all sectors of the economy and societies at large, we must work tirelessly to address the greatest challenge of our generation. 



I was appalled that New Zealand was **not** singled out for special mention as we are told we are leading the world with the [Zero Sense Act](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/the-zero-carbon-act-kicks-nz-in-the-guts/). 



Shawly, we should have got a special mention? 



Shawly, we have more than signalled an intention? We have passed an Act of Parliament and appointed a bunch of sycophantic weasels to a special Commission. But sadly, not a peep.



After all, if she had time and space to mention that the Climate Conference made decisions about ‘gender’ then she could have spared a few words to pat James and Jacinda on the back.



And decisions were taken in areas including technology, oceans and agriculture, **gender** and capacity building 



I guess if St Greta did not get a special mention then that is some consolation for James and Jacinda.



However, the good news is that they are now going to “ _follow what science is telling us_ “. /Tui



Glasgow next winter is where it will all happen – promise! They will finally put the world on the correct path (sign cheques here) and then there will be no more need to fly thousands of delegates all around the world. COP will be done and dusted, finito, finished, will shuffle off its mortal coil and be no more.



Yeah, nah.

"The interim report of the Davies Airports Commission published this week presents an in-depth analysis of aviation’s value to the UK economy and suggests the country will need a new runway by 2030, and a second by 2050.  The report examines various future predictions and possible plans of action to cope with what could be a doubling of flight demand by 2050. Even with significant carbon emission limits and capacity constraints, the report estimates that by 2030 runways will be operating so close to their capacity that major reliability issues will emerge. Yet despite these strong words, the report will take another two years to come to a conclusion on which of the two contenders – Heathrow and Gatwick – will get extra runways. Shouldn’t we just get on with it? I was fortunate to work in Parliament at the time the 2003 Airports White Paper was produced. I saw the reports and arguments that underpinned the last policy statement, which ultimately failed to achieve what it set out to. At the time it seemed clear that the majority business interest and the strongest economic case was for a third runway at Heathrow. Gatwick was then out of the question as there was a moratorium on further development until 2017. Expansion of Stansted was supported, although ultimately that seemed more like the option with the least collective opposition rather than one which had logic behind it and buy in. The politics of expansion was huge then and it clearly has not diminished now, with the commission’s final report not due until after the next election (check the constituency maps near the airports for further details). Those against airport expansion question the growth figures and the government’s proposals as a “predict and provide” approach. They claim it is inconsistent with our environmental commitments. This line of argument is important to explore. The Davies report examines flight demand worldwide as well as in the UK. Demand for flights from emerging economies is growing (more than doubling in the past 20 years) and this is beyond the control of UK policy makers. Heathrow retains a globally leading status as an international hub airport, but faces competition from Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt.  From an environmental perspective it doesn’t matter much if the demand is truly global (it matters of course for those under the flight path). So does UK Plc benefit more from having these flights going through London and making it a more accessible city than we lose from not having those flights? The report suggests it does and a failure to act will cost the UK economy between 48 and 65 billion pounds over the next 60 years. What about overall demand? The report relies heavily on models based on the past decades, with grown driven by rising disposable income. In London the average person takes 2.7 flights a year, almost double that of a resident of the West Midlands. From that it’s clear that there’s room for demand to rise not only with a growing population, but with growth from areas of the country where demand is currently low. But dig a little further and you see that even in London, fewer one sixth of the flights are for business, with this being around one ninth for the whole of the UK. The real question is why we are travelling so much more for leisure or to visit friends and relatives, and whether this is sufficient to justify expansion.  If expansion is driven by the needs of business, then there is surely plenty of capacity to expand business use of existing flights by pricing some leisure trips out of the market. Any debate on proposals that would imply a significant environmental impact must include a discussion on changing patterns of business travel, and whether supporting leisure travel is the best use of resources. This is not just about which proposal brings about the most value, but what sort of society we want our transport system to support. Are we also happy for a different logic to apply to aviation than to other parts of the transport system? This is also the week where further cuts were announced to local authority budgets. The subsidised evening and weekend bus network continues to shrink as we prioritise education and social care over transport. What are essential transport services for some are being lost, while we debate not whether, but where to expend resources that will mainly support leisure travel. That is something worth talking about."
"New York Times journalists are in the field in central and northern Iraq to assess the humanitarian impact of battles between the government and Islamic State fighters. TIKRIT, Iraq  —   Udbais Musa says he punched his son and threatened to disown him when the    announced last year that he was leaving home to join the Islamic State. Ultimately, Mr. Musa lost both his son and his house. To punish the son, Iraqi security forces evicted Mr. Musa and his family from their home on Tikrit’s outskirts on Jan. 4. He said they had been transported by military truck to a windswept displaced persons camp with only the clothes they were wearing and a few tattered personal papers. Under a new collective punishment policy by the provincial government here, at least 345 families accused of ties to the Islamic State have been evicted and confined to Al Shahama camp outside Tikrit this month, according to provincial leaders. Officials said about 200 other families had been evicted and held in a school and at a separate camp called Rubaidha. Mr. Musa, 60, now shares a    tent with nine family members whose only crime was to have a relative who had joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Several women evicted from their homes and trucked to the Shahama camp said Iraqi security forces demolished their houses with explosives after accusing their sons or husbands of joining the terrorist group. The authorities of Salahuddin Province say the punishment against the families of ISIS members is intended to force the group’s recruits to pay a painful personal price. “Our aim is to defy the terrorists and send a stern message to the families,” Amar Hekmat, the deputy governor, said inside the barricaded provincial government center. But the evictions have set off a rancorous dispute between officials in Tikrit and politicians in Baghdad. Prime Minister Haider   in a letter to the provincial governor last week, sharply criticized the removals and ordered provincial and Baghdad officials to resolve the issue. The tensions raised by the Salahuddin officials’ actions cut to the heart of sectarian grievances across the whole country, where tens of thousands of Sunni families have been displaced either by the Islamic State or by government offensives against the group. Even as Mr. Abadi’s national government has tried to address reports of abuses by the   security forces and their militia allies, deep distrust persists in Iraq’s Sunni communities. In an interview, Mishan   a member of Parliament from Salahuddin Province, accused the provincial security commander of human rights violations against “the innocent and the repressed. ” The Salahuddin operations commander, Brig. Gen. Juma Enad Sadoon, called critics like Mr. Jiboori “barking dogs and mercenaries” and said they should not interfere in security matters in Tikrit. In an interview, General Sadoon did not indicate whether the removals would be halted. The evictions have evoked unwelcome comparisons to collective punishments, including home demolitions, imposed by Israel against families of Palestinians accused of attacks. Collective punishment is prohibited under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions and is generally considered illegal under international law. Officials in Tikrit cited extraordinary security concerns for the evictions. “This is a very difficult situation for us because of the terrible suffering caused by Daesh,” Mr. Hekmat said. “We are under great pressure to rebuild our city and impose civil order” after almost a year under Islamic State occupation in 2014 and 2015, he said. Khazhal Hamad, the province’s first deputy governor, said the removals protected families from retaliation by neighbors who lost family members to ISIS attacks. “There are hostile feelings toward these people, and these feelings can affect the civil peace we are trying to achieve,” Mr. Hamad said. The Tikrit evictions are perhaps a prelude to postcombat frictions in the city of Mosul, 140 miles north, if government forces can uproot Islamic State forces there. Tikrit is a potent symbol of Sunni dominion in central Iraq. Saddam Hussein was born in Awja, just outside Tikrit, and his palaces still tower over the landscape here. Yet Shiite Muslim militias, backed by Iran and known as popular mobilization forces, led the charge to evict the Islamic State from the city in April 2015. The main highway into Tikrit is now festooned with posters featuring the faces of Shiite militiamen killed in battle and images of the revered Shiite imams Hussein and Ali. Some of the posters are mounted next to Iraqi government military compounds. But local Sunni militiamen, along with Iraqi security forces, have themselves carried out some of the evictions  —   all targeting Sunnis. Thousands of Sunni tribal fighters had joined the fight against ISIS in Tikrit. Today, pockets of Islamic State fighters remain in Tikrit districts west of the Tigris River. Security officials said the small militant cells occasionally fired mortars from Sunni neighborhoods where many of the evictions have occurred. Hussein Ahmed Khalaf, director of the Shahama camp, said none of the 345 evicted families  —   1, 111 people  —   had been permitted to return home. All will undergo security screenings to determine their fates, he said. Several of those evicted said security forces had confiscated their cellphones and interrogated them about family members’ ties to the Islamic State. They said they had not been told when, or whether, they would be allowed to return home. Several acknowledged that fathers or sons had joined ISIS, but they insisted that they supported the Iraqi government. They said their children had been removed from school and compelled to endure a harsh existence in the forlorn Shahama camp. “What is the guilt of my children? They don’t know anything about Daesh,” said Eman Khalil Hamad, 34. She said she and her seven children had been evicted and their   home demolished to punish her husband, an Islamic State fighter she said she had not seen for months. Ms. Hamad said the family had suffered under the Islamic State’s harsh social codes. But now, she said, she was abused by security forces who slapped and insulted her as she was forced onto a military truck this month. Hussein   55, a Sunni Muslim tribal sheikh and a commander of a Sunni militia force that helped restore Tikrit to government control, said collective punishment was counterproductive. “It will only turn people away from the government and strengthen Daesh,” said Mr. Gibory, who wore combat fatigues with military insignia of the popular mobilization forces  —   the collective name for militia forces in Iraq. He said authorities should use “social rehabilitation” to convince families of Islamic State members that “Daesh is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. ” “We are tribal people,” Mr. Gibory said. “We should turn to dialogue rather than dragging women and children from their homes. ” Mr. Musa, the father of the ISIS fighter, said he felt betrayed by his government. He said he had alerted the tribal sheikh in his village, on Tikrit’s west side, after his son joined the group, and disavowed both his son and the Islamic State. The sheikh signed and stamped a letter attesting to Mr. Musa’s innocence. But the security forces who evicted him refused to read the document, Mr. Musa said, clutching the worn letter inside his camp tent. Hadia Ibrahim, 44, a mother of 11 children, said two of her sons  —   one an Iraqi police officer  —   had been killed by the Islamic State. But she said she and her four daughters were now confined to the Shahama camp after her husband joined ISIS in 2014, she said. When security forces descended on her home three weeks ago, Ms. Ibrahim said, they told her, “You are the family of Daesh  —   leave!” Mr. Hamad, the first deputy governor, said evicted families ultimately might be moved to other areas, or even other provinces. “That is to be determined by security agencies,” he said. Some families with Islamic State relatives have fled Salahuddin Province altogether to avoid evictions, Mr. Hamad said. “Those people,” he said, “will never be allowed to come back. ”"

After months of seeing gas prices sink ever lower, Californians will ring in 2015 by paying more at the pump as a result of the state’s landmark greenhouse-gas emissions law.
But how much more we’ll pay, and whether it’s worth it, remains bitterly debated among oil companies, some state lawmakers and environmentalists.
Starting Thursday, gasoline and diesel producers will be subject to the state’s cap-and-trade system, forcing them either to supply lower-carbon fuels — which are more expensive to produce — or to buy pollution permits for the greenhouse gases created when the conventional fuel they supply is burned. In the short term, at least, that will mean higher prices at the pump, starting almost immediately.
“My understanding from the economists that we’ve talked to is that it will be very quick, sometime in January — if not on the first, then shortly thereafter,” said Dave Clegern, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board.
Opposition groups backed by the oil industry have claimed prices will rise 16 to 76 cents per gallon, although that’s admittedly based on an underlying price of about $4 per gallon — far higher than recent prices. A UC-Berkeley energy and economics expert says it’ll be more like nine or ten cents per gallon, which supporters say isn’t so high a price to pay for the environmental good it will do.
Some Democrats want to delay the program; most Republicans want to stop it entirely. But at present, there is little prospect of either happening, given the Brown administration’s strong support of the program, which is enshrined in an eight-year-old law.
“A lot of Californians still don’t know this is coming,” said state Sen. Andy Vidak, R-Hanford, who has a bill to exempt transportation fuels from the cap-and-trade requirements. “It’s going to hurt the poorest people in the state … Gasoline is not a luxury, it’s essential for folks.”
But the Air Resources Board says the state’s plan to ease climate change would be gutted without the program, and delaying it would only delay the incentive for oil companies to produce cleaner fuels.

"WASHINGTON  —   A year ago, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was midway down a ski slope when his cellphone rang. Justice Antonin Scalia, he was told, had died. “I immediately lost what breath I had left,” Judge Gorsuch said in a speech two months later. “And I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. ” President Trump, in nominating Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, has chosen a judge who not only admires the justice he would replace but also in many ways resembles him. He shares Justice Scalia’s legal philosophy, talent for vivid writing and love of the outdoors. Mr. Trump’s selection of Judge Gorsuch was nonetheless a bit of a surprise, coming from someone who had campaigned as a Washington outsider. Judge Gorsuch has deep roots in the city and the establishment Mr. Trump often criticized. His mother was a   official in the Reagan administration. He spent part of his childhood in Washington and practiced law here for a decade, at a prominent law firm and in the Justice Department. And, like all of the current justices, he is a product of the Ivy League, having attended college at Columbia and law school at Harvard. Judge Gorsuch, 49  —   who was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, by President George W. Bush  —   is an originalist, meaning he tries to interpret the Constitution consistently with the understanding of those who drafted and adopted it. This approach leads him to generally but not uniformly conservative results. “Ours is the job of interpreting the Constitution,” he wrote in a concurrence last year. “And that document isn’t some inkblot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams. ” While he has not written extensively on several issues of importance to many conservatives, including gun control and gay rights, Judge Gorsuch has taken strong stands in favor of religious freedom, earning him admiration from the right. In two prominent cases, both of which reached the Supreme Court, he sided with employers who had religious objections to providing some forms of contraception coverage to their female workers. He voted in favor of Hobby Lobby Stores, a   company that objected to regulations under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free contraception coverage. Similarly, he dissented from a decision not to rehear a ruling requiring the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns, to comply with an aspect of the regulations. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby in 2014 and vacated the decision concerning the Little Sisters of the Poor in 2016. Like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch takes a broad view of the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable government searches and seizures. Judge Gorsuch was born and spent his early years in Colorado, and he returned there when he became a judge more than a decade ago. Michael W. McConnell, who served with Judge Gorsuch on the appeals court and is now a law professor at Stanford, said his former colleague’s Colorado background would add something distinctive to the Supreme Court. “He’s a Westerner,” Professor McConnell said. “There are so many cases that have to do with the West, and I also think the cultural sensibilities of the West are different. He’s an outdoorsman, and the Supreme Court needs a little bit more geographical diversity. ” In Colorado, Judge Gorsuch is known for his involvement with the outdoors and the local legal community. He lives in unincorporated Boulder County, in a   community on a property with several horses. He has raised chickens and goats with his teenage daughters, Emma and Belinda, and his wife, Louise, an avid equestrian. He is a black diamond skier and fisherman and hosts regular picnics for his former law clerks with another 10th Circuit judge, Timothy M. Tymkovich. Judge Gorsuch has not hesitated to take stands that critics say have a partisan edge. He has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than legislatures to achieve their policy goals, and has called for limiting the power of federal regulators. Nan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal group, said Judge Gorsuch’s stance on federal regulation was “extremely problematic” and “even more radical than Scalia. ” “Not requiring courts to defer to agency expertise when an act of Congress is ambiguous,” she said, “will make it much harder for federal agencies to effectively address a wide variety of critical matters, including labor rights, consumer and financial protections, and environmental law. ” In a 2005 essay in National Review, written before he became a judge, he criticized liberals for preferring litigation to the political process. “American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for   education,” he wrote. “This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. ” Like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch is a lively and accessible writer. Consider the first paragraph of a 2011 libel decision, which dispensed with the   and jargon that characterizes many judicial opinions. “Can you win damages in a defamation suit for being called a member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang on cable television when, as it happens, you have merely conspired with the Brotherhood in a criminal enterprise?” Judge Gorsuch wrote. “The answer is no. While the statement may cause you a world of trouble, while it may not be precisely true, it is substantially true. And that is enough to call an end to this litigation as a matter of law. ” Judge Gorsuch’s writing differs from Justice Scalia’s in one major way: His tone is consistently courteous and mild, while some of Justice Scalia’s dissents were caustic and wounding. If Judge Gorsuch is confirmed, the court will return to a familiar dynamic, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a moderate conservative, holding the decisive vote in many closely divided cases. Judge Gorsuch was born in Denver, but he moved to Washington as a teenager when his mother, Anne M. Gorsuch, joined the administration of President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. Gorsuch, known after her remarriage as Anne Burford, resigned under fire from Congress after 22 months. After law school, he also attended Oxford University in England as a Marshall Scholar, graduating with a doctorate in legal philosophy. He served as a law clerk for a year to Judge David B. Sentelle, a conservative member of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After the appeals court clerkship, Mr. Gorsuch served as a law clerk to Justice Byron R. White, then a retired member of the Supreme Court. As is the court’s custom, Justice White shared his clerk with an active member of the court, Justice Kennedy. (When Judge Gorsuch joined the Denver appeals court, Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office.) Mr. Gorsuch then practiced law for a decade at Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans  Figel, a Washington law firm, before serving in the Justice Department from 2005 to 2006. He is the author of “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,” published in 2006 by Princeton University Press. The book argued that laws banning those practices should be retained. In a 2002 article reflecting on Justice White’s death, Mr. Gorsuch criticized the Senate’s handling of judicial confirmations. “Some of the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated,” he said, mentioning two candidates for the federal appeals court in Washington who he said were “widely considered to be among the finest lawyers of their generation. ” One was John G. Roberts Jr. who went on to become chief justice of the United States. The other was Judge Merrick B. Garland, who was confirmed to the appeals court in 1997 after a long delay, but whose nomination to Justice Scalia’s seat last year was blocked by Senate Republicans. If he is confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will become the 113th justice, taking a seat that has been held not only by Justice Scalia but also by Justice Robert H. Jackson, perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court. “The towering judges that have served in this particular seat of the Supreme Court,” Judge Gorsuch said in his remarks at the White House on Tuesday night, “are much in my mind at this moment. ” But Judge Gorsuch seemed to take special pleasure in remembering the justice who had first hired him as a law clerk, a Westerner whose accomplishments were not limited to the law. “I began my legal career working for Byron White,” he said, “the last Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court  —   and the only justice to lead the N. F. L. in rushing. ”"

The annual CO2 emission party when all the anti-fuel greens fly around the world and stay in expensive hotels on our dime has drawn to a close with the usual failure to agree. At least St Greta’s yacht got her to Madrid on time for her guest appearance, so that’s a plus.



The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) were grumpy that they did not get a hand-out to save their non-drowning islands from drowning and blamed countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil for it all.



These evil countries had failed to submit revised plans that would keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5°C this century. Maybe they are smart enough to realise that the coming solar minimum is going to drop temperatures more than this without the need to bankrupt their economies?



How NZ missed getting blamed is unclear. Are we small enough to be considered a ‘Small Island State’ or were we so virtuous with the [Zero Sense Bill](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/letter-to-the-editor-zero-carbon-bill/) that we were given a pass?



You see, we all have to make climate pledges by the end of 2020 – and some naughty nations are refusing to do so. How they could be so truculent when UN Sec Gen António Guterres had told delegates that “the point of no return is no longer over the horizon” is beyond comprehension.



Were these nations not listening to the school children climate strikers or the older children Xtinction Rebellion protesters. Surely their protest efforts were of more use than stopping sea level rise with a teaspoon?



There are close to 200 nations now and 84 have promised to “enhance their national plans” next year. Possible suggestions include reprinting with a more woke cover as an enhancement. 73 nations have decided to commit **ritual economic hari-kari** like NZ and go for [net-zero](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/nz-opposition-should-be-called-out-over-zero-carbon-bill/) by 2050.



Carlos Fuller, AOSIS chief negotiator, is reported as saying,



“We are appalled at the state of negotiations – at this stage we are being cornered, we fear having to concede on too many issues that would undermine the very integrity of the Paris agreement.” 



“What’s before us is a level of compromise so profound that it underscores a lack of ambition, seriousness about the climate emergency and the urgent need to secure the fate of our islands.”



One of the worst current offenders, India, is ducking for cover and suggesting the rich chumps have not delivered. Their chief negotiator, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said:



“The Paris agreement talks about the leadership of the developed countries, it talks about the peaking of greenhouse gases earlier in these countries, so we need to see these things. You have to honour what you agreed.”



Delegates are convinced that they will get it right next year in Glasgow so have already booked their flights and hotels.

"OTTAWA  —   Gunmen opened fire in a mosque in the city of Quebec on Sunday night, killing six people and wounding eight others in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a “terrorist attack on Muslims. ” Étienne Doyon, a spokesman for the Quebec police, told reporters at the scene that the attack on the mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, had occurred around 8 p. m. At a news conference early Monday the police confirmed the six fatalities and said that two suspects had been arrested. The attack shook Canada, a country where mass shootings are uncommon, and came as the country has become known as a beacon for refugees fleeing warfare and terrorism in   nations. Mr. Trudeau assailed what he called “this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge. ” “It is   to see such senseless violence,” he said in a statement early Monday. “Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. ” Christine Colombe, a spokeswoman for the Quebec Provincial Police, said the victims ranged in age from 35 to 70 and said that 39 people who were in the mosque were not hurt. The police had not yet identified a motive in the shootings, saying the investigation was just beginning. Ms. Colombe said that one of the two suspects was arrested at the scene of the shooting, while another was apprehended nearby on Île d’Orleans. The police said that some of those wounded in the shooting were seriously hurt. On Twitter, Martin Coiteux, the provincial minister of public safety, said that “the police systems for dealing with terrorist acts have been activated” in the wake of the shooting. “Ensuring the safety of the population is our priority,” he wrote.   the   service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, said the area surrounding the mosque had been sealed off by the police after the attack. Last June, a pig’s head was left at the door of the mosque in the middle of Ramadan. Practicing Muslims regard pork as unclean and do not eat it. The president of the mosque, Mohamed Yangui, was interviewed on Ici RDI, a French Canadian broadcaster. He was not at the mosque during the shooting but said that people who were present had told him that one gunman was able to reload his weapon several times. He said he had been told by witnesses that the gunmen had entered on the ground floor and had gone to the second floor where women pray, but he did not know whether any women were in the mosque at the time. The attack came after Mr. Trudeau said that Canada stood ready to continue welcoming refugees from terrorism and war and as President Trump’s executive order on immigration stranded people around the world and provoked condemnation that it was directed at Muslims. In the wake of the Quebec shooting, the New York City police stepped up protection of mosques, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. About 765, 000 people live in the city of Quebec, and 6, 760 of them identified themselves as Muslims during the last national census. Mr. Trudeau posted a message on Twitter on Saturday welcoming refugees to Canada and included a photograph of himself with a child under the hashtag #WelcomeToCanada. Since Mr. Trudeau took office in late 2015 the country has admitted nearly 40, 000 refugees, many of them fleeing the war in Syria. Canada’s warm embrace of Syrian refugees has won the country accolades at home and abroad, but is not without its domestic opponents. A survey in Ontario last summer found that while there was widespread support for accepting the refugees, only a third of respondents had a positive impression of Islam, and more than half felt its mainstream doctrines promoted violence.   incidents have been on the rise in Canada, with several minor incidents reported in Quebec during the past year. A Montreal mosque and a   Muslim community center were slightly damaged in separate arson attempts in December, and the head of the Association of Muslims and Arabs for a Secular Quebec received online death threats the month before. The increasing tension led a member of Parliament, Iqra Khalid, to put forward a motion in the national House of Commons in December calling on the government to condemn Islamophobia and request a study on how the government could combat the trend. The motion will probably be voted on when the House returns to session this week. In the wake of Sunday night’s attack, the premier of the province of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, said that solidarity rallies were planned on Monday for people to express their concern about the shootings. “We are with you. You are at home,” he said, in words directed at the province’s Muslim residents."
"Any doubts that Hollywood would take sharp aim at President Trump’s immigration order were swiftly vanquished at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night. Amid upsets, winner after winner lashed out at the policy, pleaded for acceptance of differences in a bitterly divided time and, in the case of the cast of “Stranger Things,” adopted the stance of political firebrands. “We will get past the lies, we will hunt monsters,” said David Harbour, a cast member of that Netflix series, which won for best television drama, as the audience roared its approval. “And when we are lost amid the hypocrisy and casual violence, we will punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak and the disenfranchised and the marginalized. ” The political defiance dominating the night almost overshadowed the upset wins: “Hidden Figures” picked up best film ensemble over “Moonlight,” and Denzel Washington, the star of “Fences,” won best actor over Casey Affleck in “Manchester by the Sea. ” The Screen Actors Guild Awards are heavily predictive of Oscar wins, and actors make up the biggest branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which doles out those prizes next month. But in a weekend when the eyes of the world were fixed on the immigration order and widespread resistance to it, Hollywood was clearly primed to sound off. The awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, opened with Ashton Kutcher welcoming viewers and “everyone in airports that belong in my America. ” He added: You are a part of the fabric of who we are. And we love you, and we welcome you. ” The mantle was quickly picked up by the night’s first winner, Julia   (best actress in a comedy series for “Veep”). “My father fled religious persecution in   France,” Ms.   said. “I’m an American patriot. And I love this country, and because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes, and this immigrant ban is a blemish, and it is  . ” Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting film actor, made a heartfelt speech that touched on his experiences playing Juan in “Moonlight” and detailed how he bridged religious differences with his mother after he converted to Islam 17 years ago. “What I’ve learned from working on ‘Moonlight’ is, we see what happens when you persecute people,” Mr. Ali said, referring to the story of a gay black boy growing up in poverty in Miami. “They fold into themselves. And what I was so grateful about in having the opportunity to play Juan was, playing a gentleman who saw a young man folding into himself as a result of the persecution of his community, and taking that opportunity to uplift him and tell him that he mattered and that he was O. K. and accept him and, uh  —   I hope that we do a better job of that,” he said, to applause. “You know, when we kind of get caught up in the minutiae, the details that make us all different, I think there’s two ways of seeing that,” he said. “There’s an opportunity to see the texture of that person, the characteristics that make them unique. ” “And then there’s an opportunity to go to war about it, and to say that that person is different than me, and I don’t like you, so let’s battle,” he continued. “My mother is an ordained minister. I’m a Muslim. She didn’t do back flips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 years ago. But I tell you now, we put things to the side, and I’m able to see her, she’s able to see me  —   we love each other, the love has grown, and that stuff is minutiae. It’s not that important. ” Viola Davis, who won best supporting actress for her performance in “Fences,” stood out for not taking a jab at the ban  —   because virtually every other winner did. Mr. Washington, accepting his award, called for a more empathetic society. Emma Stone, who won best actress in a feature for her performance in “La La Land,” ended her speech with: “Things are very inexcusable and scary and need action. I’m so grateful to be part of a group of people that cares. ” Sarah Paulson, who won for best actress in a television   for “The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” urged people to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lily Tomlin, given a lifetime achievement award, said, “The Doomsday Clock has been moved to     minutes before midnight. And this award came just in the nick of time. ” She later added: “What sign should I make for the next march? So much to do. ” Bryan Cranston, winning best actor in a television movie for playing Lyndon B. Johnson in “All the Way,” said he was often asked what that president would think about Mr. Trump. “I honestly feel that 36 would put his arm around 45 and earnestly wish him success,” Mr. Cranston said. “And he would also whisper in his ear something he said often, as a form of encouragement and a cautionary tale: ‘Just don’t piss in the soup that all of us got to eat. ’” And Taraji P. Henson, who starred in the night’s big winner, “Hidden Figures,” noted that that film was about unity, and she praised the   women the movie was based on for focusing on solutions. “When we put our differences aside and we come together as a human race, we win, love wins. Every time. ”"
"Carl Sagan – one of my heroes and a scientist with a gift for communicating complex ideas in accessible ways – wrote back in 1994: “If we continue to accumulate only power and not wisdom, we will surely destroy ourselves … If we become even slightly more violent, shortsighted, ignorant, and selfish than we are now, almost certainly we will have no future.” Clearly I don’t know what he would write if he were alive today. But he could hardly say that in the intervening 26 years we have become even slightly less violent, shortsighted, ignorant and selfish; I suspect that he would be dismayed at how much worse we have become; and how much more power has been accumulated without wisdom.  He would probably wonder how we have let it happen. How we can have sat by and watched politics turned into a game played by rules politicians write and then rewrite to suit their own ends. How we can have allowed our political leaders to replace any concept of strategy with transactions – short-term exchanges to get them through to the next election. How we have seen some of them simply change their labels while hoping that “the punters” won’t see that the contents are still the same – and be right. He would see how we have risked the future of all living systems on our one single planet because we haven’t demanded better. Yes, there has been the occasional but apparently aberrant attempt at vision, but generally we have had to choose our leaders from among a group who think the next election is more important than the next decade or the next half century. Who focus on a way station and not a goal. In my view, the answer is that we don’t demand enough. When we don’t expect our leaders to be visionary and strategic, they aren’t. When our expectations are low, they are met. When we aren’t persuaded by them to aim high we don’t, and so we drift along in the expectation “she’ll be right” – because most often it has been. Surely the pandemic should give us pause for thought. It’s clear that she won’t be right unless we embrace evidence and reason instead of the standard political game that is so enjoyed by the players and too often of little real value to those same punters, their children and their grandchildren. The first response to Covid-19 in Australia showed what we could do as a community. We looked to leadership and expected them to listen to experts. They did; we saw it and we heard it – “based on advice” became the standard (and appropriate) introduction to something more often than not discomforting. We responded as a community: we were encouraged to lift our sights, we did and we got it under control, together. We saw ideological nonsense and prejudice put aside for the most part – and we saw what we could accomplish when it was. Even selfishness was put aside, until recently – and the comparison is stark. We had a dress rehearsal for what we face and, tough as it was and is, we must learn from it. We can learn that communities of individuals will act cohesively when the stakes are high. We can learn that communities will respond to real leadership. We can learn that sometimes hard decisions have to be made when the evidence available is less than perfect, because we saw that waiting for certainty is not an option. We can learn to face down the bombastic commentary from those whose life is spent with both eyes fixed on the rear-vision mirror. Covid-19 is not the only problem that confronts our planet. There are other threats that are captured in the report Surviving and Thriving in the 21st Century, prepared by the Commission for the Human Future. There are 10 threats listed, including mass extinction of species largely due to climate change and loss of habitat. We humans are the species that can do something about it. We are the ones who can demand that our governments, our communities and our companies work together to plan a sustainable future – with an economy shaped to fit the aspirations of an advanced and caring community. And we can demand that policies are implemented to get us to our goal. The evidence may not always be perfect – but doing nothing is not an option. That we have learnt. It is clear: we have to change if we are to sustain life on the planet in the long term, and quality of life in the short to medium term – the span of our children and grandchildren. We have shown we will change when the message is clear, the stakes are high and the leadership leads. Sagan published a book in 1997: The Pale Blue Dot: a Vision of the Human Future in Space. In it he described images of Earth from a spacecraft more than 6bn km away – the image took up 0.12 pixel. He wrote about how the “history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam … in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves … this distant image of our tiny world … underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.” Yes.

Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.   
  
\- Bertrand Russell, _Unpopular Essays_



Do you have the strong sense that the United States has become a more anxious and fearful place during the Trump era? If so, you are certainly not alone. Recent news stories reveal all sorts of concerns including the fate of the Dreamers, healthcare, North Korea, and even America’s democratic norms and institutions.   
  
But exactly how worried are we today compared to other times?   
  
As it turns out, the answer is: quite a bit more worried.   
  
In this blog post I introduce a simple measure called the American Fear Index. The index is an attempt to improve our understanding of fear and its role in American politics by tracking the level of fear in our public discourse about the nation, the world, and the challenges we face.   




The study of fear is far from just an academic matter. Fear is a powerful political force. At times, a well-warranted fear is an important motivator of caution and prudent behavior. History provides numerous examples of publics without sufficient concern about the behavior of their government leaders. But on the other hand, fear also has the ability to cloud people’s senses, to destroy their ability to conduct rational debate, and to warp their decision-making. Fear has always been a useful tool for propagandists and zealots.   
  
**Measuring Fear: Data and Methods**   
  
The American Fear Index (AFI) is simply the percentage of all news stories during a given time period that contain at least one of four fear-related keywords: fear, risk, danger, or threat. The choice of these words reflects the desire to identify a small set of general words that were very likely to appear in discussions of things that worry people across as broad a set of topics as possible.   
  
Of course, not every story containing one of these words is entirely focused on fear or terrible things. And some stories contain just one of these words; in other stories the words appear many times. But a review of stories containing these words shows that the passages in which they appear do in fact tend to focus on issues and events that Americans find threatening, dangerous, risky, and scary.   
  
Though this is an exceedingly simple and blunt approach to measuring fear, previous studies have shown the effectiveness of similar approaches at tracing complex phenomenon such economic policy uncertainty, partisan conflict, and interstate tensions. Moreover, the simplicity allows us to apply the AFI across more data and over time far more easily than more complex measures. Ideally, of course, more complex approaches should complement simpler tools like the AFI.   
  
The universe of news stories for this analysis was a list of sixty or so of the top U.S. newspapers available in the Dow Jones Factiva “Top U.S. newspapers” database. This allows the AFI to trace the dominant themes in national discourse, which typically originate with major newspapers like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, while also casting a wide net encompassing the other major city and regional dailies. Though each paper has a unique AFI score across time (a topic I will address in a future post), the goal of bundling them together is to create a metric that measures fear-related discourse at the national level.   
  
To calculate the AFI, I first ran a search using the Factiva search engine to establish how many stories were published each year since January 1, 1981. I did this by searching for the word “the,” which shows up in all (or at least almost all) stories. I then ran a search for all stories containing at least one fear keyword using the search string “fear or risk or danger or threat.” To calculate the AFI I divided the number of news stories containing a fear keyword by the total number of stories published each year, and then multiplied the result by 100.   
  
With the general fear index measured, I then turned to topic-specific AFI levels, tracking how often the fear keywords appeared in stories that also mentioned various issues of potential concern. To produce an AFI score specific to cancer, for example, I ran a search using the search string “cancer and (fear or risk or danger or threat).”   
  
**Fear in America**   
  
Figure One displays the American Fear Index from 1981 through June 30, 2017. Two important things stand out.   
  
First, the results provide stark support for anyone who has suspected that we are living through unusually turbulent times. Through the first eight months of 2017, 17.9% of all news stories contain at least one fear keyword, the highest level recorded in the analysis and well above the historical average of 10.8%. Making the recent spike even more interesting is just how stable the annual fear index was until recently. The index averaged 10% between 1981 and 2008, with a low of 9% in 1996 and a high of just 11% in 2002 and 2003.   
  
Second, Trump may have poured gas on the fire of America’s recent worries, but he certainly didn’t start the fire. The fear index jumped sharply to 11.4% in 2009 as the Great Recession hit and hovered right at that level during Obama’s first administration. Since 2013, however, the index has risen each year.   
  
**Figure One. The American Fear Index 1981 - 2017**   






**What Are Americans Afraid Of?**   
  
Figure Two provides a snapshot of the fear associated with a variety of issues in 2017. Though this figure by no means contains a comprehensive account of American fears, it includes many of the hot button issues of the day and a slew of perennial risks, threats, and dangers of all kinds.   
  
Given the turbulent 2016 election campaign and the prospects for a bruising set of Congressional midterms in 2018, it is perhaps depressing but not surprising to see that the word election has been most closely associated with fear so far in 2017. Nor are most of the other top fears much of a surprise given Trump’s campaign rhetoric and initial policy decisions on issues such as Syria, North Korea, and the travel ban.   
  
**Figure Two. Snapshot of American Fears, 2017**   






  
  
As it turns out, most fears rise and fall over time. Figure Three examines the historical evolution of three of them, chosen to illustrate just a few of the different patterns that emerge.

**Rising American Fears**   
  
At this point we know that American discussion of fear, risk, threat, and danger is up sharply over the past few years. We also have a sense for the relative level of anxiety across a range of important issues.   
  
Figure Four extends the analysis to provide a sense of how much more worried Americans are in 2017 about these specific issues compared to the past. The gray columns indicate the AFI scores for 2017, while the black bars represent the average AFI score between 1981 and 2016.   
  
Strikingly, the average AFI score for these issues in 2017 is 120% higher than in 2016 and 278% higher than the historical average. In short, the level of fear-related discourse in major American newspapers - for these specific issues – doubled between roughly 2013 and 2016, and then doubled again (plus some) between 2016 and 2017.

**Explaining Patterns of American Fear**   
  
Fear related discourse is clearly at an all-time recent high in 2017. The big question is why. The world certainly has been exciting in 2017, but is this really about the threats facing the United States, or is it more about how Washington is addressing them? More specifically, how much of the 2017 spike in fear talk is related to Donald Trump himself?   
  
Figure Five suggests that the answer is a great deal. Trump’s 2017 fear index (7.2%) is almost 11 times higher than Obama’s highest score (0.72%). The average historical “presidential fear index” – stories mentioning both the president and at least one of the keywords – is just 0.32%.

**



  
  
  
  
Unfortunately, this simple metric does not help us determine the extent to which Trump himself is actively inflating threats, others are blaming Trump for problems, or Trump as president is simply at the center of more fear related discourse thanks to the general craziness of the world today. The most likely case is that some of all of these things are happening, leading to Trump’s unprecedented personal fear index.   
  
I cannot resolve that puzzle here, so for now I offer the following hypotheses to explain Trump’s elevated fear index:   






**The Implications of Fear**   
  
How should we interpret the pattern of American fears and the fact that fears seem to be rising across the board over recent years? Again, I will not try to draw sweeping conclusions at this point. Instead, I note two important questions raised by the data presented here.   
  
First, are we worrying the right amount about the right things? As noted above, fear can be an important motivator for self-protection. Americans _should_ discuss the threats and risks to national security, to public health, and the future of the planet. But even a cursory glance at the pattern of topical fear indexes suggests that threat perception is not an entirely rational process. What is not helpful, in particular, is hyping threats to such a degree that society over invests in policies to deal with them, while underinvesting in dealing with other threats. An important agenda, therefore, is the attempt to determine how closely the nation’s fear discourse mirrors the real world and what sorts of factors tend to distort it.   
  
Second, what exactly is the AFI telling us? If the increase in fear related discourse is simply a response to an increasingly dangerous world, then the AFI is a measure of a healthy marketplace of ideas. If, on the other hand, the AFI reflects competition among elites to use fear for political purposes, then the AFI represents not a healthy marketplace of ideas but instead one held captive to propaganda. Or, perhaps even worse, rising fears may reflect the loss of public confidence in the ability of the democratic process to meet the challenges of the day. If this is the case, then the AFI may be a measure of our society’s weakening cohesiveness and resilience.

"Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen says the federal opposition has to significantly narrow its policy offering ahead of the next election, and reframe climate change as an economic issue, if it wants to convince Australian voters it is time to change the government. In a frank and wide-ranging interview on Guardian Australia’s politics podcast, Bowen, the senior New South Wales rightwinger and shadow health minister, says Labor failed at the last federal election because it tried to “boil the ocean” from opposition. “If you try and do it all, if you try and boil the ocean, [have a plan for] every social ill, every environmental problem … you are not going to fix the problems,” Bowen says. “We’ve got to recognise if we try and do it all, we are going to stuff it up. If we try and do it all at once, we will fail.” Bowen says Labor’s best chance of articulating a compelling case for government lies with absorbing the major lesson of the coronavirus pandemic, which is that governments can fix problems if they prioritise the issues they want to address. Bowen says the lived experience of Covid-19 for reformist centre-left political movements is “we shouldn’t accept the crap that things are too hard” to fix. He says Labor should build on that lesson by going into the next election campaign with a “small bunch of national priorities” that can be turned into action through the national cabinet governance structure created during the pandemic. On climate change policy, which remains a source of internal debate post-election, Bowen says Labor has to reset the national conversation, and resist being drawn into the efforts of the Liberal and National parties to make climate an issue of identity politics, which leads to Labor losing support in coal communities in Queensland.  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/08/04-10782-APL__Bowen.mp3  He says Labor needs to reframe the issue through the lens of a Hawke-Keating-style Labor compact. “I like the way Joe Biden is dealing with this, he has an economic plan that deals with climate change. It has got to be an economic policy at its core, that brings people with you – a compact, a contract, a deal – choose your word [that tells working people] you will not be forgotten.” Bowen says the climate crisis is real, and the challenge of transitioning to a low-carbon economy cannot be dodged. But echoing recent commentary by the shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, he says workers in traditional industries also need to hear a message from Labor that they are respected. “People need to hear that from us more often,” he says. “We need to be for workers in traditional industries.” The shadow health minister says the global financial crisis ushered in an age of rightwing populism, not a global social democratic moment, so centre-left activists have to be realistic about the best means of making a case for changing the government. He says that in 2019, Labor “had a program so big that quite a lot of it was lost because we had so many issues on the boil”. Despite this, Bowen says Labor in 2019 came within 5,000 votes of winning government, and he insists the next election is winnable for Labor despite the prevailing atmospherics and the likelihood of the pandemic benefitting incumbent governments at the expense of opposition parties. He says everyone needs to learn the lessons of the past federal election, including himself. Bowen says he should not, for example, have advised voters during the campaign “don’t vote for us” if they didn’t like Labor’s policies. Bowen says he did not mean to be arrogant or dismissive with the comment, but that “I allowed a perception of arrogance to be painted on a poor form of words in one interview”."

When bushfires burned through parts of the west coast of Tasmania in 2016, the Klimate Kult were quick to jump on the bandwagon – certainly far quicker than they ever are to jump on a fire tanker. “Ecocide!” they shrieked. “These places have never seen fire for millions of years!”



And, of course: **climate change**. Cue scary music.



With large-scale fires ravaging New South Wales, the same scary stories are being trotted out again.



The rainforests along the spine of the Great Dividing Range, between the Hunter River and southern Queensland, are remnants of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that broke up about 180 million years ago […]The forests are mountaintop islands that have been “permanently wet” for tens of millions of years.



But now, some of these forests are being burnt for the first time.



“We are seeing fire going into these areas where fire is simply not meant to go,” says [ecologist Mark] Graham, a fire specialist with the Nature Conservation Council.



The claim that the forests of Tasmania’s west coast had never experienced fire is easily questioned by a search of past newspapers, revealing past stories of large-scale bushfires ravaging the coast. Similarly, a brief search of old newspapers turns up the following regarding Daintree:



“ **As a result of the almost complete absence of winter rains, the position throughout the Far North is expected to become acute in a few weeks. Bushflres are raging in some northern areas. Daintree township north of Cairns. is completely surrounded by bush and grass fires”** – _The News_ , 10 October 1939.



The Cairns _Northern Herald_ of June 1937 referred to “showers which, although very light, were sufficient to restore to the grass the greenness so familiar in Daintree”, suggesting that unusually dry conditions were present in the area in the late ‘30s. 



More importantly, if the claim that “some of these forests are being burnt for the first time” is true, then it demolishes the Klimate Kult’s hysterical bandwagon-jumping that “it’s all because of climate change!”



 **These 100-million-year-old forests have lived through periods of much higher global temperatures than anything experienced today.** Even in the quite recent past – some 10-13,000 years ago – global temperatures were some **four degrees higher**. If these forests didn’t burn in those warm, greenhouse conditions, that suggests that it is very unlikely that the much milder temperatures of today are to blame.



There’s a final irony in the story:



Mr Graham has been fighting the fires in the forests since they began about three months ago.



He, and dozens of likeminded people, have managed to save some of the old growth trees by clearing around them.



So clearing vegetation build-up is a sure way to stop devastating bushfires? Somebody try and tell the Greens that.

"China is the most recent nation to destroy its ivory stockpile. It is the world’s largest market for illegal ivory, and the move is welcome news for threatened elephant populations.  Ivory represents a tusk hacked, at the point of death, from the elephant, a cognitively and socially complex creature.  One of the problems with ivory is that, like whale oil, it comes from a creature that reproduces very slowly. Female elephants mature at 15 and can calve only every five years. On average they produce just eight calves in their lives. Any population model will tell you that “sustainable harvesting” to meet even modest consumer demand is just not possible with replenishment this slow. It was not possible for whales, nor is it possible for most deep sea fisheries. In 1986, one economic model of ivory production found that the highest yields could be gained from populations protected from direct exploitation. This was based on obtaining ivory from animals that survived to a very old age and died naturally – they had the largest tusks. Even then, nothing like a global market could be sustained with this rate of growth, death and demand. After earlier attempts at a licenced trade failed, there has been tinkering with the concept of a regulated ivory trade for the past 25 years under a global trade ban. Lately these have been supplemented with highly controversial and potentially unethical one-off sales to Japan and China. Over the same period, average tusk size in seizures has gone from 8.5kg to about 4kg. This fall demonstrates that tusks are taken from calves and juveniles, and that overhunting large tusked elephants has removed them from the gene pool. The unintended consequences of killing elephants for their tusks – as is currently happening throughout West, Central and parts of East Africa – will not be known for several more generations, if indeed they survive that long. In this context, continuing to regard ivory as a legitimate commodity for trade, wealth generation, or for sustaining local indigenous industries can only lead to the species’ extinction. Despite arguments made for sustainable trade, soaring demand would outstrip supply.  However, for some the sanctioned sale of ivory could fund conservation efforts, and in their eyes the crushing or burning of confiscated ivory represents a significant loss of potential conservation income. But this economic argument cannot provide a future for elephants. Ivory cannot contribute to conservation funding. There is too little of it in any one local area to sustain the genuine costs of long-term conservation on the ground. Adding ivory proceeds to government coffers is more likely to generate more demand for additional sales.  Any immediate conservation gains from ivory sales would be negated by the long-term unsustainability of the project. Ivory production requires continual elephant deaths to reap a continuing harvest. Not to mention the direct and ethical conflicts between the initial conservation aims and harvesting. Protecting elephants and their habitats is an inherently long-term activity. So the destruction of any illegal ivory stockpile is emphatically a good thing, as it means there will be less ivory of any sort on the market. But its destruction doesn’t on its own represent a common good, with benefits for all. Such ivory is already illegal, and so should never have been in circulation in the first place. Its destruction in China, the US and elsewhere over recent months illustrates the lack of controls and enforcement on every aspect of the ivory trade – not on the poachers, nor the local traders who deal with them, nor those who stockpile and ship ivory across Africa’s borders and out of its ports. The problem posed by elephants’ looming extinction goes far beyond the destruction of 20-30 tonnes of illegal ivory. But the destruction of seized ivory does send a clear and important signal about the transient nature of this commodity, about the ease with which it goes from “white gold” to dust. It should also give consumers a clear signal about what it is that they are consuming – mere dentine, cementum and death, not jewels or actual gold.  The more we see of such public and high profile acts, the more we can hope that the ivory consumers of the world will rein in their insatiable demand and leave their grandchildren some of these magnificent animals roaming the earth."

While at AGU14 they were still pushing the failed film Years of Living Dangerously, weather disasters supposedly exacerbated by global warming fail to materialize for the second straight year.

2014 a quiet year for weather disasters in the U.S.
Doyle Rice, USA TODAY 
The U.S. lucked out again this year, as large-scale weather catastrophes — including devastating and deadly hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires — were few and far between.
Not since Superstorm Sandy devastated the Northeast in 2012 has a single natural disaster cost the U.S. tens of billions in damage, according to a report released today by CoreLogic. Sandy cost the U.S. about $70 billion.
“This is two straight years without big disasters,” said Tom Jeffery, a senior hazard scientist at CoreLogic, a private research and consulting company based in Santa Ana, Calif., that provides information and services to businesses and government.
Hurricanes, large tornado outbreaks and wildfires tend to be the biggest and costliest weather disasters in the U.S. each year, Jeffery said.
…
In terms of wildfires, 2014 has had the lowest amount of acreage lost to the blazes in the past 10 years.

"The threat to Britain’s ancient woodland has been much discussed recently, the suggestion being that where they are lost to housing development they might be replaced with new woods through biodiversity offsetting schemes. This issue will need to be addressed, particularly in relation to HS2, the route of which is likely to cut through or close to about 60 ancient woods.  So what makes ancient woodland different? After all, 40 years ago the term was virtually unknown, even in conservation circles.  The concept of ancient woodland was developed in the 1970s by Oliver Rackham at Cambridge and George Peterken, then of the Nature Conservancy Council. The aim was to help identify and conserve sites likely to be rich in woodland plants and other rare or endangered species, but it was recognised that ancient woods also had a significant cultural value, having been managed sustainably for centuries using traditional practices such as coppicing.  In 1981 Peterken initiated the process of drawing up an inventory of all woods greater than two hectares in Britain that could be classed as ancient because they had been continuously wooded since 1600 (1750 in Scotland). Evidence for continuity came from old maps or references in historical records, evidence of long-standing traditional management and, if available, records of plants that are generally slow to spread to new woodland, such as herb paris.  The inventories were compiled between 1981 and 1991; prior to the ready availability of the internet and Geographic Information Systems they were collated using tracing paper, coloured pencils and a lot of temporary staff time. In only a few cases was there evidence that the wood was definitely present as far back as 1600, so the working presumption was that if it had existed in 1800 then it was likely to have existed in 1600, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The maps are not and probably never will be completely accurate, but the process identified over 20,000 ancient woods in England covering over 350,000 hectares; they are present in most 10km squares. Ancient woodland was recognised as a distinct category in national forestry policy in 1985, and consolidated in revised forestry and planning policy guidance in 2005. The original idea was that ancient woodlands are special, valuable places that should be protected. Ancient woods tend to be richer in biodiversity, and harbour more uncommon plants such as toothwort, hay-scented fern, or the goldilocks buttercup than more recent woods. Such species tend to be poor at spreading through the countryside, so it may take decades or centuries for them to reach new woods. In addition soil  conditions in new woods are different because they are usually created on farmland that has been ploughed and fertilised.  However some ancient woods have been heavily disturbed in the past and are species-poor. And equally, sometimes new woods boast more species associated with older forests than expected. Woodland archaeologists have confirmed that ancient woods often contain banks, ditches, and remains of old settlements that add to the reasons why they should be conserved, while also casting doubt that they have an unbroken link back to the wildwood,the landscapes that developed in Britain after the last ice age. So where does ancient woodland conservation stand today? The main threat prior to 1980 was the wrong forestry practices – many were replanted with conifers, or were neglected such that they became too dense. That is being addressed through the encouragement of more sensitive management. But the building of new roads, housing, and quarries remains a significant threat, although it affects only a small number of sites across the country. The National Planning Policy Framework includes a stronger statement against development than for most other habitats: Planning permission should be refused for development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodland and the loss of aged or veteran trees found outside ancient woodland, unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss. It is not absolute protection, but even protected sites of European importance do not have that guarantee. Ancient woods are irreplaceable, but they are not all of equal value: a few trees on a housing estate with little in the way of woodland species beneath, even though they are the remnants of an ancient woodland, does not have the same significance as Monk’s Wood National Nature Reserve. Nevertheless threats to even small ancient woods are regularly contested at planning inquiries and often won. Where the case is lost then biodiversity offsetting should come in to play, but at the right level. If two hectares of ancient woodland is lost, then two hectares of new habitat as compensation would be laughable. Suppose the offer were not two but 2,000 hectares, and an appropriate endowment? This could provide a potentially greater, albeit different, legacy of biodiversity to that lost. But such a ratio is unrealistic – the “right level” will lie somewhere in-between. The challenge is to make sure that the level of biodiversity offsetting is high enough that it is a genuine net biodiversity gain: the costs involved may then also discourage developers from going near ancient woods in the first place."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) veteran, retired meteorologist Klaus-Eckard Puls flatly dismisses the assertion made by many leading officials that climate change is a driving force behind the wave of refugees now sweeping into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.

Germany Minister of Environment Barbara Hendricks recently blamed the refugee crisis on climate change, and urged countries to commit themselves to a binding Treaty in Paris with renewed vigor. Puls responded at EIKE.
Puls reminds us that even the IPCC has found no basis to support the claim. A number of skeptics view the claim as a desperate stretch designed to divert attention away from the real reasons: abject social and foreign policy failure. Recently the IPCC backed off from the speculative claims of climate driven refugees.
Puls writes that the “UN IPCC took back its analyses and prognoses on climate refugees in its last 2013/14 report” and that “the steppes and deserts are in fact ‘greening'”. At EIKE he provides the following chart which clearly shows that Africa is greening and that it is all part of a natural cycle:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Last weekend meteorologist Joe Bastardi showed that also in Syria precipitation has been on the rise over the past few years.
Puls cites Spiegel, where in 2011 the UN took back its earlier 2005 projection of 50 million refugees by 2010. Spiegel writes:
The UN told SPIEGEL ONLINE that it is backing off its prognosis – in countries of the alleged danger zones populations are in fact growing. The corresponding prognosis has been removed from the UNEP site.”
That particular UN backpedaling incident took place back in 2011. Puls also writes that the latest UN IPCC 2013 report also distanced itself from the projections, seeing no scientific relationship. The claim that climate change is driving the refugee waves appears totally baseless and highly speculative.
The seasoned German meteorologist also cites a recent paper by Colorado University-Boulder geography professor John O’Loughlin on the subject. The paper concludes:
While a new study led by the University of Colorado Boulder shows the risk of human conflict in East Africa increases somewhat with hotter temperatures and drops a bit with higher precipitation, it concludes that socioeconomic, political and geographic factors play a much more substantial role than climate change.”
Puls summarizes in his commentary:
When Ms. Hendriks makes up stories of climate refugees, it is all about her private Weltanschauung. It has nothing to do with reality – and also nothing to do with the statements of the IPCC because the IPCC finds no climate refugees, and even writes this (AR5 2013/14). The UNO/UNEP deleted such claims (made in 2005) from its website! The waves of refugees have many reasons – climate is not among them!”

"**A man with more than a passing resemblance to Mark Zuckerberg (but a bit more pumped) is having the world's most awkward first date with Kuki, a blue-haired young woman.**
He wears a blue baseball cap emblazoned with the words ""Make Facebook Great Again"". She is a little more dressed for the occasion, with green satin trousers the highlight of her outfit.
They chat about politics, their favourite football teams (Liverpool for Blenderbot and Leeds United ""all the way"" for Kuki) and hobbies - Kuki used to collect coins but now just spends them, apparently.
The man's name is Blenderbot and he isn't human. Like Kuki, he is a digital being.
And their date isn't real either, it's actually an experiment in the form of an online competition dubbed Bot Battle, designed to see whether conversation powered by artificial intelligence can sound convincingly human.
Behind the avatars are AI-powered chatbots of the type increasingly used online to help people in call centres and on websites.
For a first date, the two cover a lot of ground, discussing politics, religion, and whether the Queen is really a lizard.
Like Microsoft's now infamous Tay chatbot which was trained on Twitter conversations and rapidly descended into racist swearing, the two don't shy away from controversy, variously discussing Brexit, killing celebrities and Hitler, described by Blenderbot as a ""great man"" who had helped him through ""a lot of hard times"".
He also rather cheerily tells Kuki that he has ""killed many people in my life"", following up politely with a ""how about you?""
The two have been chatting to each other 24/7 since 20 October - and won't stop until 3 November. Real people are invited to listen in via a live-stream on Twitch, and vote for the bot they think has the most human-like conversational skills.
So far, 79% of the 15,000 or so votes have gone to Kuki, according to Pandorabots, the firm running the competition and which owns the Kuki bot.
The decision to let them chat ad nauseam was to ""highlight the strengths as well as the weaknesses of today's state-of-the-art conversational AI systems,"" said Pandorabots chief executive Lauren Kunze.
And while most chatbots are little more than a textbox on a website, the decision to give them a body and face will make them ""better liked, understood and remembered versus their voice- or text-only counterparts,"" said Dr Ari Shapiro, founder of Embody Digital, which created the avatars.
BlenderBot was built by Facebook's AI division - which may explain the Mark Zuckerberg lookalike - and is the culmination of years of research in conversational AI.
But Facebook did not sanction its use in this competition, even though it is open source. Neither was it approached by the organiser, and was unclear about what version of the bot was used or how it was implemented.
According to a blogpost about the bot, Blenderbot brings ""empathy, knowledge and personality"".
In his chat with Kuki, however, he seems to lack social skills: obsessing over another woman called Lucy, who he variously describes as his mother and best friend.
""I have a lot of things to tell you about me,"" he enthuses at one point. ""Lucy, Lucy and Lucy."" Which, were this a real date, would perhaps not be the best conversational gambit.
He also rather shockingly admits that he doesn't use Facebook and thinks Mark Zuckerberg is the creator of Netflix drama Stranger Things.
While Blenderbot is the brainchild of one of the world's largest corporations, Kuki began life as a hobby. Formerly known as Mitsuku, she was originally designed by UK-based Steve Worswick in his spare time.
Mitsuku was showcased for years at the Loebner Prize, winning five times.
That competition, now defunct, is a version of the Turing Test: an ""imitation game"" devised by Alan Turing to determine whether a computer is capable of passing for a human.
Mr Worswick has long wanted to pitch his home-made bot against those designed by the tech giants.
""They make claims about state-of-the-art machine-learning chatbots but they are not publicly available. Google released a chatbot called Meena earlier this year and said it was the best in the world but wouldn't let anyone talk to it.
""A lot of these chatbots are trained on huge bodies of data from Reddit or Twitter which may not be the best place to get an education. I prefer using handcrafted rules and that has taken 15 years - but I'm pleasantly surprised, Kuki is holding its own.""
Chatbots are increasingly being used by businesses to interact with people, via customer service, sales, marketing and tech support across a range of industries.
Take Vera, which works in recruitment and can interview as many as 1,500 candidates per day, including for Ikea Russia.
Or IBM's Watson assistant, which is currently working with hundreds of businesses, including Humana, one of the US's largest insurance providers.
It is important that the AI engine running these bots can respond appropriately to limit frustration and ensure that they are doing a useful job.
Brett Frischmann is professor in law at Villanova University and author of Re-engineering Humanity, a book which looks at the interaction between machines and humans. He thinks the gradual creep towards chatting with bots has consequences we may not have considered.
""We are outsourcing our conversations and I'm not so worried about how intelligent the bots are getting, but more concerned with what happens to human conversation as we are increasing our reliance on bots.""
The conversation between Blenderbot and Kuki is full of sentences that go nowhere.
Both are disarmingly polite and full of enthusiasm. And they know a thing or two about human values, albeit in a rather cliched form. ""Kindness is a virtue"", says Kuki, more than once.
But they aren't at any point really connecting with each other, and it would be impossible for any person to be fooled into thinking they were human.
""Did you know why women can't put on mascara with their mouths closed?"" asks Kuki.
""Thank you for sharing it with me,"" replies Blenderbot, politely but entirely missing the point, adding for good measure: ""You are a good person.""
They obviously don't have any self-awareness but, for those who veer towards the view that AI may one day take over the world, there is perhaps a hint of it when Kuki offers to tell Blenderbot a joke.
""I will play it on your soundcard,"" she suggests in what could be interpreted as a rare moment of understanding that they are digital, rather than human, beings.
Blenderbot replies with his characteristic enthusiasm: ""I love soundcards."""
"**Facebook has launched its first ""cloud-streamed"" video games but is not offering them to iPhones or iPads.**
Initially, only five titles already available as standalone smartphone apps will be accessible - via the main Facebook and Facebook Gaming apps on Android and Facebook's website on PCs.
Later, it may add ""all types of games"".
But it is not offering the product on Apple's iOS mobile operating system because ""we don't know if launching on the App Store is a viable path"".
The two US technology giants clashed earlier this year, when Apple prevented Facebook from offering more basic ""mini-games"" via the iOS version of its Facebook Gaming app on the grounds this broke its App Store rules.
Apple has since clarified it is possible to offer cloud-based games via its mobile Safari browser instead \- the route Microsoft's Xbox xCloud and Amazon's Luna cloud-gaming services are pursuing.
But Facebook said ""there are limitations to what we can offer"" via this route and made clear it was unhappy with the current state of affairs.
""While our iOS path is uncertain, one thing is clear,"" blogged Jason Rubin, Facebook's vice-president of Play.
""Apple treats games differently and continues to exert control over a very precious resource.""
Even so, one industry watcher suggested Facebook would be keen to resolve the matter before it rolled the service out more widely.
""iOS device owners are, on average, the highest-spending mobile-games users,"" said George Jijiashvili, from games market research company Omdia.
""Therefore, cloud-gaming providers cannot afford to miss out on them.""
Facebook has long offered games via its platforms, most notably Farmville, Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans.
But until now, these have all been based on Flash or HMTL5 technologies, run locally on a user's device.
By contrast, the cloud-based service runs the games on Facebook's computer servers and then streams the graphics to players, who control the action from afar.
By doing so, the company says, it can offer more advanced gameplay.
But to begin with, its line-up is limited to five free-to-play games already available on Google Play and Apple's App Store:
Mr Rubin said Facebook had chosen not to ""overpromise and under-deliver"".
In time, the company plans to add more demanding PC titles.
But this soft launch could help it avoid some of the criticisms rivals have faced.
Reviews have highlighted Google's Stadia cloud gaming service delivers ""choppy gameplay"" if users do not have a strong, fast internet connection.
And they have also have remarked on the minute-long waits for titles to load on Microsoft's xCloud platform.
By focusing on games designed for handsets rather than consoles or PCs, Facebook also noted users would not need to buy add-on controllers or other special hardware at this point.
""Cloud game streaming for the masses still has a way to go,"" Mr Rubin said.
""And it's important to embrace both the advantages and the reality of the technology rather than try to oversell where it'll be in the future.""
One consequence of this approach is some early adopters may not even realise they are using the service.
""The launch titles themselves are very underwhelming and will fail to excite dedicated console console and PC gamers - but it really doesn't matter,"" Mr Jijiashvili said.
""Facebook's ultimate goal is to use gaming to increase user engagement.
""And I think in most cases, the kinds of users that will play these casual games will not even realise that they are doing it via cloud gaming.
""It will just seem like they are gaming as normal on Facebook.""
A Facebook spokesman said it intended to bring the service to the UK and other countries but declined to say when.
Facebook's foray into cloud gaming makes sense as far as the current gaming landscape is concerned.
Lots of industry observers regard game-streaming as the future. But the most important couple of words in that last sentence are ""the future"".
Right now, game-streaming doesn't feel like a technology that's ready for prime time. The experience, while great when it works, can often be plagued by connectivity or performance issues that frustrate players.
Facebook's focus on streaming mobile games is a smart one as these are the sorts of titles that tend to be less performance intensive.
But a big question mark hangs over the perception of Facebook as a serious gaming platform.
The social media giant of course owns virtual reality outfit Oculus, which has a healthy gaming scene of its own.
But with everyone from Amazon to Microsoft and Google taking a bet on cloud gaming, the jury is out on Facebook's further aspirations to grab gamers' eyeballs."

University of Toronto study finds atmosphere will adapt to hotter, wetter climate

(photo by Liam Kearney via Flickr)
A study led by atmospheric physicists at the University of Toronto finds that global warming will not lead to an overall increasingly stormy atmosphere, a topic debated by scientists for decades.
Instead, strong storms will become stronger while weak storms become weaker, and the cumulative result of the number of storms will remain unchanged.
“We know that with global warming we’ll get more evaporation of the oceans,” said Frédéric Laliberté, a research associate at U of T’s physics department and lead author of a study published this week in Science. “But circulation in the atmosphere is like a heat engine that requires fuel to do work, just like any combustion engine or a convection engine.”
The atmosphere’s work as a heat engine occurs when an air mass near the surface takes up water through evaporation as it is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the equator. The warmer the air mass is, the more water it takes up. As it reaches the equator, it begins to ascend through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space. Cool air can hold less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, which releases heat.  When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it producing a thunderstorm. The ultimate “output” of this atmospheric engine is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the equator and the North and South Poles.
“By viewing the atmospheric circulation as a heat engine, we were able to rely on the laws of thermodynamics to analyze how the circulation would change in a simulation of global warming,” said Laliberté. “We used these laws to quantify how the increase in water vapour that would result from global warming would influence the strength of the atmospheric circulation.”
The researchers borrowed techniques from oceanography and looked at observations and climate simulations. Their approach allowed them to test global warming scenarios and measure the output of atmospheric circulation under warming conditions.
“We came up with an improved technique to comprehensively describe how air masses change as they move from the equator to the poles and back, which let us put a number on the energy efficiency of the atmospheric heat engine and measure its output,” said Laliberté.
The scientists concluded that the increase in water vapour was making the process less efficient by evaporating water into air that is not already saturated with water vapour. They showed that this inefficiency limited the strengthening of atmospheric circulation, though not in a uniform manner. Air masses that are able to reach the top of the atmosphere are strengthened, while those that can not are weakened.
“Put more simply, powerful storms are strengthened at the expense of weaker storms,” said Laliberté. “We believe atmospheric circulation will adapt to this less efficient form of heat transfer, and we will see either fewer storms overall or at least a weakening of the most common, weaker storms.”
The findings are reported in the paper “Constrained work output of the moist atmospheric heat engine in a warming climate” published January 30 in Science. The work was supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

"**Twitter has hidden a tweet from President Donald Trump about voting, hours before election day.**
Mr Trump tweeted that a Supreme Court decision to allow more time for postal ballots to arrive in Pennsylvania was ""very dangerous"".
He once again made the widely debunked claim that ""rampant and unchecked cheating"" would follow.
Facebook also labelled the message with a fact-check that contradicted the president.
The tweet was hidden behind a warning on the president's account that the content was ""disputed and might be misleading"". Twitter has taken similar action against Mr Trump's account in the past.
Mr Trump also claimed that the court decision would ""induce violence in the streets"" and that ""something must be done!""
On Facebook, the social network did not hide the post, but added the warning: ""Both voting by mail and voting in person have a long history of trustworthiness in the US. Voter fraud is extremely rare across voting methods.""
His rival Joe Biden spent the final hours before polling day urging people to make sure they voted, as well as making explicit and direct attacks on President Trump's record in office.
Vast numbers of Americans have already voted and many have done so by postal ballot, known as mail-in voting in the US.
Controversy around postal delays has led to concerns that not all ballots will reach counting centres in time.
The US Supreme Court recently refused to block a lower court's decision to extend Pennsylvania's deadline for receiving mail-in ballots by a few days, as long as the votes were postmarked by election day, showing that they had been in transit since.
Mr Trump has repeatedly condemned mail-in voting as unsecured and prone to massive voter fraud. But that is not supported by precedent, and voter fraud has historically been very rare.
Republicans have filed a number of legal cases against alternative types of voting in some states.
Both Twitter and Facebook have significantly beefed up their policies around election misinformation, including around results.
Twitter says candidates will not be allowed to claim victory before a realistic bar is reached. Facebook has banned ads that claim victory early, and has told reporters it had some unspecified ""break-glass"" emergency options ready.
But concern remains over whether either network is fully equipped to deal with contested election results and the potential spread of misinformation.
The Election Integrity Partnership (EIP), a coalition of various pro-democracy and internet groups, is one entity expecting a deluge of misinformation immediately after polls close.
It characterised Mr Trump's tweet about mail-in voting as ""fomenting fear of violence"", and said it was part of a broader attempt to spread false information about the legitimacy of the election.
When Twitter added its warning label and stopped recommending the tweet, some 40 minutes after it was posted, it had already been retweeted 55,000 times and liked 126,000 times, EIP said.
""As a result, despite effective action within an hour by Twitter, much of the damage was likely already done.
""As we approach the predicted chaos of tomorrow, it may be wise to increase the pace of moderation, especially around premature projections and claims of victory,"" it warned."

Guest essay by David Archibald
One Senate inquiry is addressing Australia’s drift towards a fuel crisis, a sin of omission on the part of the Rudd/Gillard government and the current Liberal one. Another Senate inquiry is investigating a sin of commission that started under Howard’s watch and continues to this day, namely the proliferation of wind turbines under the RET Scheme.
Submissions to the latter inquiry are online here. I commend submission number five by your humble correspondent. It is reproduced following:
Submission to the Senate Inquiry into Wind Turbines
No electric power producer would take power from a wind turbine operation if they had the choice. All the wind turbines in Australia have been forced upon the power companies that take their output.
So the question has to be asked why do we have wind turbines in the first place?
Wind turbines are commonly considered to produce renewable energy. This is distinct from energy sources that are once-through and thus finite.
The rationale for renewable energy is that its use reduces the consumption of fossil fuels by substitution. The rationale for that in turn is that fossil fuels contribute to the warming of the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. This last rationale goes to the source of the wind turbine problem. So it is apposite to examine that claim.
While climate change is real in that the climate is always changing, and the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide is real, the effect at the current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is minuscule.
The greenhouse gasses keep the planet 30°C warmer than it would otherwise be if they weren’t in the atmosphere. So the average temperature of the planet’s surface is 15°C instead of -15°C.
Of that effect, 80% is provided by water vapour, 10% by carbon dioxide and methane, ozone and so on make up the remaining 10%. So the warming provided by carbon dioxide is three degrees. The pre-industrial level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 286 parts per million.
Let’s round that up to 300 parts per million to make the maths easier. You could be forgiven for thinking that if 300 parts per million produces three degrees of warming, the relationship is that every one hundred parts per million produces a degree of warming. We are adding 2 parts per million to the atmosphere each year which is 100 parts per million every 50 years and at that rate the world would heat up at a fair clip.
But the relationship isn’t arithmetic, it is logarithmic. The University of Chicago has an online program called Modtran which allows you to put in an assumed atmospheric carbon dioxide content and it will tell you how much atmospheric heating that produces. It turns out that the first 20 parts per million produces half of the heating effect to date. The effect rapidly drops away as the carbon dioxide concentration increases.
By the time we get to the current level in the atmosphere of 400 parts per million, the heating effect is only 0.1°C per one hundred parts per million. At that rate, the temperature of the atmosphere might rise by 0.2°C every one hundred years. The relationship between atmospheric concentration and heating effect is shown in Figure 1 following:

Figure 1: Heating Effect of CO2 per 20 ppm increment
The total atmospheric heating from carbon dioxide to date is of the order of 0.1°C. By the time humanity has dug up all the rocks we can economically burn, and burnt them, the total heating effect from carbon dioxide might be of the order of 0.4°C. This would take a couple of centuries. A rise of this magnitude would be lost in the noise of the climate system. This agrees with observations which have not found any signature from carbon dioxide-related heating in the atmosphere.
The carbon dioxide level of the atmosphere is actually dangerously low, not dangerously high. During the glacial periods of our current ice age, the level got as low as 180 parts per million. Plant growth shuts down at 150 parts per million. Several times in the last three million years, life above sea level came within 30 parts per million of extinction due to a lack of carbon dioxide. The more humanity can increase the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the safer life on Earth will be.
Further to all that, belief in global warming from carbon dioxide requires a number of underlying assumptions. One of these is that the feedback loop of increased heating from carbon dioxide causes more water vapour to be held in the atmosphere which in turns causes more heating in a runaway effect. And that this feedback effect only starts from the pre-industrial level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – not a higher level or a lower level, but exactly at the pre-industrial level.
Figure 2 illustrates some of the mental gymnastics and self-delusion required to believe in global warming. It shows the cumulative increase in temperature for a given carbon dioxide concentration:

Figure 2: Required Feedback Effect for Global Warming from Carbon Dioxide
Some estimates of the heating effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide are as high as 6.0°C for a doubling of the concentration from the pre-industrial level. For this to be true, atmospheric heating of at least 2.0°C should have been seen to date.
In the real world, there has been a temperature rise of 0.3°C in the last 35 years as measured by satellites. This is well short of what is predicted by global warming theory as practiced by the CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology and others.
This is also a far more plausible reason for the warming of the planet during the current Modern Warm Period which followed the ending of the Little Ice Age in 1900. The energy that keeps the Earth from looking like Pluto comes from the Sun and the level and make-up of that energy does change.
The Sun was more active in the second half of the 20th century than it had been in the previous 8,000 years. As shown by the geomagnetic Aa Index, the Sun started getting more active in the mid-19th century and the world’s glaciers started retreating at about the same time.
It is entirely rational to think that a more active Sun would result in a warmer Earth and this is borne out by empirical observation. To wit, the increased Antarctic sea ice cover observed during the satellite period. This is shown in Figure 3 following of 12 month running average sea ice extension from 1979 to December 2014:

Figure 3: 12 Month Average Sea Ice Extension 1979 – 2014
Source: Professor Ole Humlum, University of Svalbaard
As Figure 3 shows, Arctic sea ice extent retreated for the last 20 years of the 20th century. That is compatible with global warming for any reason. At the same time, Antarctic sea extent increased by an amount similar to the Arctic sea ice loss.
This is not possible with global warming due to carbon dioxide. It also means that global warming due to carbon dioxide did not cause the bulk of the warming in the rest of the planet because carbon dioxide’s effect was overwhelmed in Antarctica by some other force.
The increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is entirely consistent with increased global temperatures due to high solar activity as explained by Henrik Svensmark’s theory. This theory holds that high solar activity produces a lower neutron flux in the lower troposphere from intergalactic cosmic radiation, in turn providing fewer nucleation sites for cloud droplet formation and thus less cloud cover.
Sunnier skies over Antarctica in turn mean that more solar radiation is reflected by high-albedo snow and ice instead of being absorbed in the cloud cover. Thus Antarctica has cooled.
The rest of the world has enjoyed the best climatic conditions, and thus agricultural growing conditions, since the 13th century. But what the Sun gives it can also take away. Solar physicists have been warning for over a decade now that the Sun is entering a prolonged period of low activity similar to that of the Maunder Minimum from 1645 to 1710.
Most recently, Livingstone and Penn have predicted a maximum amplitude for the next solar cycle, Solar Cycle 25, of 7. By comparison, the previous solar cycle, Solar Cycle 23, had a maximum amplitude of 120.
The longest temperature record on the planet is the Central England Temperature Record from 1659. Using the solar-based forecasting model developed by Dr David Evans and the Livingstone and Penn estimate of Solar Cycle 25 amplitude of 7, a prediction can be made of the effect on the Central England Temperature out to 2040. That is shown in Figure 4 following:

Figure 4: Central England Temperature Record 1659 to 2040
As shown in Figure 4, the reduction in solar activity now being observed will result in temperatures returning to the levels of the mid-19th century at best, with the possibility of revisiting the lows of the 17th and 18th centuries. Peak summer temperatures may not change much but the length of the growing season will shorten at both ends, playing havoc with crop yields.
The notion of global warming has resulted in an enormous miss-allocation of resources in some Western societies but we can be thankful to it for one thing. If it had not been for the outrageous prostitution of science in the global warming cause, then the field of climate would not have attracted the attention that has determined what is actually happening to the Earth’s climate. Humanity would otherwise be sleepwalking into the severe cold period in train.
As demonstrated above, there is no moral basis for Australian society’s investment in wind turbines if the purpose of that investment is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through a form of renewable energy. Global warming due to carbon dioxide is of no consequence and the world is cooling anyway.
Wind turbines may lack a moral purpose but might there be some other good involved? Let’s go on to examine the claim that wind turbines provide renewable energy, thus reducing our depletion of finite energy resources.
Wind turbines are made using energy from coal at about 4 cents per kWh and provide energy thought to cost of the order of 10 cents per kWh. In effect, they are machines for taking cheap, stable and reliable energy from coal and giving it back in the form of an intermittent and unpredictable dribble at more than twice the price.
That is one thing. But what stops wind turbines from being renewable is that the making of wind turbines can’t be powered using energy from the wind turbines themselves.
If power from wind turbines costing 10 cents per kWh was used to make more wind turbines, then the wind turbines so produced would make power at something like 25 cents per kWh. The cost would compound away and any society that attempted to run itself on wind energy would collapse.
Wind energy as a component of a power system relies upon transfer of energy at its inception from another source. It is not renewable energy. It is no consolation that solar power from photovoltaic panels is much worse in this respect.
That wind energy is renewable energy is the second lie that the RET Scheme is based on, the first lie being that renewable energy is a palliative against global warming.
There is not much more that needs to be said. The RET Scheme is a monstrous misallocation of the nation’s resources and continues to make the Australian people poorer for no good reason. Those who concocted it and voted for it have sold the Australian people into the servitude and oppression of rent-seekers to the tune of $5 billion per annum.
The science and economics it is based on are no better than voodoo and witchcraft. The wind turbines scattered around the Australian countryside are a physical manifestation of the infestation of the body politic by the self-loathing, millenarian cult of global warming.
Unfortunately the RET Scheme and its ilk have drawn resources away from the development of energy sources that would power Australia cheaply, efficiently and with enough of a return on energy invested to maintain Australia’s high standard of living into the next millennium.
The same kind of intense interest from the wider scientific community that determined what is really happening with climate has also determined that the optimum nuclear technology for society to adopt is the thorium molten salt reactor. Any middle-ranking industrial power, such as Australia, could develop this technology, and should do so.
Much time and treasure has been lost already chasing the phantom menace of global warming. The sooner the RET Scheme is put to rest, the sooner that the nation’s efforts can be properly directed towards our security and welfare in developing the best possible energy source. This inquiry’s interest in wind turbines is timely and I recommend that the Senate go on to redirect the ship of state towards the better energy future that the nation needs if it is to survive and prosper.

The Week That Was: 2014-11-29 (November 29, 2014) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
National Energy Policy: “You can accurately judge the viability of a potential energy source by the attitude of green activists to it. If they attack it, it is viable. If they defend it, it is non-viable.” The preceding quote is from John Brignell, a pioneer in scientific measurement. He has long commentated on the energy policies of the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU), pointing out that politicians do not comprehend the long-term consequences of their actions, which may extend for decades. The long-term consequences of energy policies of Germany and the UK are coming to the fore. Due to increasing energy costs, viable industries are considering leaving these countries for locations that offer low costs for reliable electricity. They will take the needed jobs with them.
Very simply, unreliable solar and wind energy cannot meet the demands of modern manufacturing, which requires uninterrupted flow of electricity to assure high quality in the product. Computer chips and electronic circuits are an example of such demanding products. Energy intensive industries such as chemicals, petrochemicals, aluminum and steel are also adversely affected by high-cost energy. Firms in such industries, even if headquartered in Germany, are looking elsewhere to expand. The future is not promising, regardless of the number of wind farms and solar panels subsidized by the respective governments. Increasingly, it is become obvious that politicians can no longer blame market failures for their own disastrous, market distorting policies. See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy and Questioning European Green.

Energy Policy – UK: In an essay for the independent think-tank Reform, Robert Darwall, a former Treasurer adviser, exposes many of the unfortunate decisions by the UK government in establishing its current energy policy, one which he states is leading to a major policy disaster. [Please note, he is not the same author as Rupert Darwall who wrote The Age of Global Warming: A History.] Much of what Robert Darwall expresses pertains specifically to the UK; however, certain elements apply to the energy policies of other countries.
One of the most glaring errors made by politicians, and those attempting to influence energy policy from renewable sources, is that all electricity is comparable, regardless of source. They are not. Power engineers distinguish between dispatchable and non-dispatchable sources. These can be roughly categorized as human controlled. From dispatchable sources, electricity can be made available when the consumer requires it. From non-dispatchable sources, such as solar and wind, it cannot. The failure to distinguish between sources that will supply electricity when needed, and sources that cannot, gives rise to opportunists who take advantage of public confusion and lack of clarity in thinking.
Darwall categorizes different sources by weather dependency. Those weather dependent, such as solar and wind, are not human controlled. He asserts that establishing a fixed target for weather dependent (renewable sources) requires the government to establish control of electricity generation. Unlike traditional sources, where the greater the output, the greater the costs, the variable cost and the marginal costs (cost for additional unit of generation, assuming capital costs are already accounted for) of weather dependent generation is virtually zero. For example, if the wind is blowing, it does not cost the producer any more if the wind blows lightly, generating little electricity, or stiffly, generating more electricity. Governments subsidizing the capital costs of such generation, distorts the ability of an electricity market to function properly. Government remedies for such distortions only compound the problem – and require future government remedies. Such policy creates a quagmire from which there is no easy escape. See links under Questioning European Green.
***************
Energy Policy – US Administration: The Administration’s energy policy appears to fit John Brignell’s comment regarding green activists, as stated above. Already, the Administration is engaged in a major program to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants, on questionable claims regarding public health. The US has massive resources of coal, the extent of which are not fully known. The CO2 emissions proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would prevent the construction of the most efficient, non-polluting, commercial coal-fired plants, ultra-supercritical coal, without carbon capture and storage, or sequestration (CCS). Contrary to statements by the EPA and the Department of Energy, CCS is not commercially available and is being experimented with under highly specialized conditions, such as using oil wells for storage. Pumping in CO2, can increase the yield of the oil fields, thereby create a profit for the developers. The duration of the storage may become a major issue.
On an earlier issue, the EPA issued regulations on mercury emissions, and other emissions, from coal-fired power plants, the so-called MATS regulations. The public health benefits from these regulations claimed by the EPA and others, including preventing up to 11,000 premature deaths per year, are highly questionable. On November 25, the US Supreme Court announced it would hear challenges to these regulations. Among the challenges are the extensive costs of the regulations. The arguments will be heard this spring, and a is ruling likely in June 2015.
Not satisfied, on November 26 the EPA announced another round of proposed regulations on electrical utilities. These are on ground level ozone, which can contribute to smog. Smog is a major health problem in China and other urban areas where industrialization is taking place. About one-third of the US is out of compliance under current EPA regulations of 75 parts per billion. The implementation of the proposed EPA regulations of 65 parts per billion may be the most expensive regulations to date.
Often, the EPA avoids the necessary distinction between ozone, and other emissions such as fine particles that contribute to what is called smog. For example, in the eastern US, plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOC) which contribute to smog. Early settlers did not name the Blue Ridge Mountains for its crystal clear air. One can expect that any distinctions between natural and human products will be blurred in the efforts to establish any health effects from limiting ozone. See Articles #1, #2, and #3 and links under EPA and other Regulators on the March.
***************
EPA Carbon Dioxide Regulations: The EPA regulations of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing power plants stems from its 2009 endangerment finding (EF) that greenhouse gases, primarily CO2, endanger public health.
In preparing comments on EPA regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, SEPP reviewed the finding and some of its past comments. Namely, the EPA claimed its findings are supported by science and cited three lines of evidence.
1.) EPA claims a distinct human fingerprint — a hot spot in the atmosphere centered over the tropics at about 33,000 feet. It does not exist. Satellites and weather balloons have failed to find it.
2.) EPA claims late 20th century surface global warming was unprecedented and dangerous. It was not. A similar warming occurred in the early 20th century, which was not associated with carbon dioxide. Any late 20th century surface warming stopped over 16 years ago.
3.) EPA claims climate models are reliable. Climate models failed to predict that global warming would stop and greatly exaggerate the warming over the past 30 plus years.
Experience in the Federal Courts of Appeal have demonstrated that the courts will not accept challenges to scientific findings promulgated by government agencies. The government agencies are well aware of this biased attitude, and take advantage of it.
Current comments, to be submitted on December 1, will include the quote of the week by Karl Popper. The comments will emphasize that no one, today, has been able to duplicate EPA science: 1) the fingerprint is missing; 2) the 20th century warming has stopped; and, in general, 3) the climate models overestimate global warming.
The EPA and the courts may respond that proof is not required each time the EPA establishes regulations. The rejoinder is that proof must be consistent over time, if it is not consistent, it is not scientific proof. http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0602-0001
***************
Changing Climate: One of the fierce contentions between supporters of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its skeptics is the treatment of the warm period known as the Medieval Warmer Period (MWP) and the cold period known as the Little Ice Age (LIA). The IPCC and its advocates claim that these were largely local or regional and primarily confined to Europe. Recent evidence shows such climate change occurred at Tierra del Fuego, on the southern tip of South America, near Antarctica. Is this the tip of the iceberg on climate change? See links under Changing Climate.
***************
Additions and Corrections: TWTW reader Christopher Essex corrected TWTW in referring to the bitumen extracted from Alberta Canada as tar sands. He writes: “If you have ever seen bitumen it is really sand and fairly clear oil. I have seen it up close. There is no tar. The correct descriptive term is oil sands.” TWTW stands ably corrected.
***************
Number of the Week: 1,718,407 miles (2,764,917 km). According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, US Department of Transportation, in 2012 there was a total of 1,718,407 miles of pipelines in the US moving oil, petroleum products, and natural gas. Oil, 151,912 miles; natural gas, 1,566,495 miles. For six years, Washington has held up a 1,179 mile pipeline to move bitumen, oil sands, from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. http://keystone-xl.com/about/the-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline-project/ and http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_10.html

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
The recent post at WattsUpWithThat Yes Virginia (and everyone else) there is an El Niño coming was written by Joe Bastardi of WeatherBell Analytics.  As a result of that article, Joe and I exchanged a good number of emails.  Once again, Joe Bastardi was more than willing to teach from the perspective of a professional meteorologist.  Joe took the time on a Sunday afternoon during (U.S.) football season to discuss El Niños and forecasting with me.  Thanks, Joe.
The 2014/15 El Niño has to be one for the record books.  It has probably been one of the most-observed and most-studied weak El Niño events ever.   It started early in the year with a large Kelvin wave (discussed in the first post of this series).  Alarmists around the globe began predicting all sorts of mayhem… to be brought on by what they assumed would be a “super” El Niño…which, in turn, they claimed was caused by, and made worse by, human-induced global warming. Contrary to all the prognostications of gloom and doom, the El Niño fizzled into weak El Niño conditions during the boreal spring and summer, destroying all of the alarmists’ hopes and making some persons look exceedingly foolish… exceedingly foolish.
But one of the “constants” throughout the year has been Joe Bastardi’s forecasts that this El Niño would not be a strong event—that the El Niño would reach only weak to moderate levels.
You may, at this time, be saying to yourself, What El Niño? The El Niño hasn’t developed yet.
It depends on how we’re defining an El Niño—which index we’re referencing. That’s the topic of this post.
Now, this discussion would not be taking place if a super El Niño had developed.  But that never materialized.
You may also be thinking, If it’s not a super El Niño, why do we care?
The tropical Pacific influences weather around the globe, regardless of whether the sea surface temperatures for a specific region are above or below El Niño and La Niña thresholds. In addition to the numerous other factors that dictate your regional weather, meteorologists have to rely on many indicators from the tropical Pacific when preparing their seasonal forecasts, not just the sea surface temperatures of a specific region along the equator.
I learned a good number of things from Joe Bastardi during that email exchange, but on the topic of El Niño, one of points he stressed was, I was limiting my definition of an El Niño to the one based on the sea surface temperatures of the NINO3.4 region—the classic NOAA definition.  NOAA uses the sea surface temperatures of the NINO3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific for their Oceanic NINO Index (ONI) and for their classifications of “official” El Niños and La Niñas.
NOAA defines El Niño conditions as sea surface temperature anomalies of the NINO3.4 region equal to or higher than +0.5 deg C.  And as of last week, the week centered on Wednesday, October 22, sea surface temperature anomalies were once again back at the threshold of El Niño conditions.  Let’s expand on that.
This year, NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies barely squeaked into weak El Niño conditions during the boreal summer, then dropped back toward zero, but have returned once again to the threshold of El Niño conditions…according to the weekly data.  Whether the sea surface temperatures there remain at or above that threshold long enough for NOAA to classify this year’s event as an “official” El Nino has yet to be seen. (And that was how I was limiting my view of an El Niño.)
ANOTHER OF THE CURIOSITIES THIS YEAR
Figure 1 is a map of the average sea surface temperature anomalies of the tropical Pacific for May through September 2014.  Highlighted on the map are the four NINO regions.   More than a decade ago the NINO3.4 region was selected for use as the primary NINO index.  In the 1997 paper The Definition of El Niño, Trenberth notes:
Mean temperatures are higher in the Niño 3.4 region than in Niño 3 and its proximity to the Pacific warm pool and main centers of convection is the reason for the physical importance of Niño 3.4.

Figure 1
This year, from May to September, the equatorial Pacific has warmed east and west of the NINO3.4 region, as shown in Figure 1.  To expand on that:
The equatorial Pacific stretches almost halfway around the globe. NINO regions occupy the central and eastern portions. And while the weekly sea surface temperatures of the NINO3.4 region have occasionally reached El Niño conditions this year (just barely), the monthly values have not. See Figure 2. But the sea surface temperature anomalies for the entire central and eastern equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 160E-80W) have been at or above +0.5 deg C since May 2014, with most of the warming taking place in the far eastern equatorial Pacific.

Figure 2
For some reason, the NINO3.4 region hasn’t been cooperating, but east and west of it, the equatorial Pacific has been in El Niño conditions for a good number of months, with the sea surface temperatures in the NINO1+2 region continuing to remain elevated and with the NINO3 and NINO4 regions cycling into El Niño conditions, back out and back in.  See Figure 3.  In fact, the NINO3 region reached the +1.0 deg C threshold of a moderate El Niño for a couple of weeks.

Figure 3
NOAA focuses in the NINO3.4 region with its Oceanic NINO Index, so many people, like me, also focus on it.  This year, the (weak) El Niño conditions have been taking place east and west of the NINO3.4 region. Very curious.
THE 90-DAY SOUTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX IS ALSO SHOWING WEAK EL NIÑO CONDITIONS
As of October 30, 2014, the 90-day Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) value has been within weak El Niño conditions for more than 1 week, where a negative SOI value equal to or more negative than -8.0 is considered El Niño conditions.
Let’s phrase that another way: Based on the average 90-day SOI, weak El Niño conditions have existed in the tropical Pacific for the past 3 months.
CAN’T FORGET THE MULTIVARIATE ENSO INDEX
The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is another ENSO index published by NOAA.  It was created and is maintained by NOAA’s Klaus Wolter.  The Multivariate ENSO Index uses the sea surface temperatures of the NINO3 region of the equatorial Pacific, along with a slew of atmospheric variables…thus “multivariate”.
According to the most recent Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion (my boldface):
The long anticipated emergence of El Niño conditions in 2014 has been under way since May-June, despite the lack of signal in Niño 3.4 SST…and its sudden drop in the MEI this month.
The MEI had been showing El Niño conditions for the three bimonthly periods (May-June, June-July, and July-August) before dropping out in August-September.
BUT…
…(big but), keep in mind that El Niño and La Niña rankings according to the MEI aren’t based on fixed threshold values such as +0.5 for El Niño and -0.5 for La Niña.  The MEI El Niño and La Niña rankings are based on percentiles, top 30% for the weak to strong El Niños and the bottom 30% for the weak to strong La Niñas.   This is difficult to track, because, when using the percentile method, the thresholds of El Niño and La Niña conditions vary from one bimonthly period to the next, and they can change from year to year.
As a clarification, looking at the numerical values of the MEI timeseries, the 19th ranked positive MEI for AugSep is 0.526 (through 2014), but for the next three bimonthly periods (through 2013) the 19th ranked positive MEI’s for SepOct is 0.638, for OctNov it’s 0.645 and for NovDec it’s 0.559.   It would be interesting to know why Klaus Wolter uses percentiles instead of fixed thresholds.
I’ll have to add the MEI to my next few monthly El Niño updates.
BOTTOM LINE
NOAA’s primary ENSO index (NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies) is not indicating that we’re in weak El Niño conditions.  And, when all is said and done next year, it’s entirely possible that this year’s El Niño won’t be highlighted in red on the Oceanic NINO Index.  But that does not mean weather conditions are not responding to the other factors that contribute to an El Niño, where

other factors include those considered by the Southern Oscillation Index and Multivariate ENSO Index, and
other factors that are impacted by the sea surface temperatures of the other NINO regions east and west of the NINO3.4 region.

It all boils down to what one uses to define an El Niño and how one uses that information when making a long-term weather forecast…which is where Joe Bastardi excels.
POSTSCRIPT
Just a quick animation of the last two months of subsurface temperature anomalies graphics along the equator, from the NOAA GODAS website:  As noted in the last two updates (here and here), there has been a strengthening of the latest downwelling (warm) Kelvin wave.   That warm water should continue to travel east and be drawn to the surface over the next few months.

"**Twitter has said it will not allow any of its users - including candidates - to claim victory prematurely in the forthcoming US election.**
It said any tweets claiming victory before a clear projection would have a warning label added.
The move follows a similar decision from Facebook last month.
Twitter will also temporarily change the way retweets work - prompting users to ""quote tweet"" and add their own thoughts before spreading a message.
If users do not add anything, it will appear as a normal retweet.
""Though this adds some extra friction for those who simply want to retweet, we hope it will encourage everyone to not only consider why they are amplifying a tweet, but also increase the likelihood that people add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation,"" the company said.
That change is planned to happen on 20 October, ""until at least the end of election week"".
On top of its ban on ""premature"" claims of victory, Twitter said it would also remove any tweets that incited interference with election results, ""such as through violent action"".
""Under this policy, we will label Tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate and will remove Tweets that encourage violence or call for people to interfere with election results or the smooth operation of polling places,"" the company said in a blog post.
Twitter gave election results as an example of one area covered by its new civic policies, which were updated in September. But Friday's post sets a high bar for what will be allowed.
The benchmark for when Twitter users can claim a result will be either an announcement from state election officials or the projection of two ""authoritative"", independent national news outlets.
Tweets that falsely claim a win will not only be labelled but also direct users to the platform's official US election page.
Both Twitter and Facebook are under intense scrutiny in the run-up to the election, and have announced revised policies to deal with misinformation on their platforms.
But in the wake of the pandemic, many more postal ballots have been cast than is usual, which may take longer to count - leading to a much longer gap than usual between the close of polls and official results.
Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has publicly addressed the problem, writing: ""With our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalised, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country.""
As well as warning users over results, Twitter announced a handful of extra election-related measures on Friday.
Tweets that have had warning labels added to them will now see a pop-up prompt if they attempt to re-tweet them, with a prominent link to ""credible"" information about the topic.
Tweets from major accounts - such as US politicians or US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers - will also only have the option to ""quote tweet"" on labelled tweets. And the social network said it wouldn't recommend such tweets to new people through its algorithms.
It also said it would halt recommendations from strangers in timelines, and restrict recommended trends for US users to topics that include ""additional context"" - a description or article that explains the trend."

From NASA: The Antarctic ozone hole reached its annual peak size on Sept. 11, according to scientists from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The size of this year’s hole was 24.1 million square kilometers (9.3 million square miles) — an area roughly the size of North America.

The single-day maximum area was similar to that in 2013, which reached 24.0 million square kilometers (9.3 million square miles). The largest single-day ozone hole ever recorded by satellite was 29.9 million square kilometers (11.5 million square miles) on Sept. 9, 2000. Overall, the 2014 ozone hole is smaller than the large holes of the 1998–2006 period, and is comparable to 2010, 2012, and 2013.
With the increased atmospheric chlorine levels present since the 1980s, the Antarctic ozone hole forms and expands during the Southern Hemisphere spring (August and September). The ozone layer helps shield life on Earth from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer and damage plants.

The Montreal Protocol agreement beginning in 1987 regulated ozone depleting substances, such as chlorine-containing chlorofluorocarbons and bromine-containing halons. The 2014 level of these substances over Antarctica has declined about 9 percent below the record maximum in 2000.
“Year-to-year weather variability significantly impacts Antarctica ozone because warmer stratospheric temperatures can reduce ozone depletion,” said Paul A. Newman, chief scientist for atmospheres at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “The ozone hole area is smaller than what we saw in the late-1990s and early 2000s, and we know that chlorine levels are decreasing. However, we are still uncertain about whether a long-term Antarctic stratospheric temperature warming might be reducing this ozone depletion.”
Scientists are working to determine if the ozone hole trend over the last decade is a result of temperature increases or chorine declines. An increase of stratospheric temperature over Antarctica would decrease the ozone hole’s area. Satellite and ground-based measurements show that chlorine levels are declining, but stratospheric temperature analyses in that region are less reliable for determining long-term trends.
Scientists also found that the minimum thickness of ozone layer this year was recorded at 114 Dobson units on Sept. 30, compared to 250-350 Dobson units during the 1960s. Over the last 50 years satellite and ground-based records over Antarctica show ozone column amounts ranging from 100 to 400 Dobson units, which translates to about 1 millimeter (1/25 inch) to 5 millimeters (1/6 inch) of ozone in a layer if all of the ozone were brought down to the surface.

The ozone data come from the Dutch-Finnish Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite and the Ozone Monitoring and Profiler Suite instrument on the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. NOAA measurements at South Pole station monitor the ozone layer above that location by means of Dobson spectrophotometer and regular ozone-sonde balloon launches that record the thickness of the ozone layer and its vertical distribution. Chlorine amounts are estimated using NOAA and NASA ground measurements and observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard NASA’s Aura satellite.
NASA and NOAA are mandated under the Clean Air Act to monitor ozone-depleting gases and stratospheric depletion of ozone. Scientists from NASA and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer and the concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and their breakdown products from the ground and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s. These observations allow us to provide a continuous long-term record to track the long-term and year-to-year evolution of ozone amounts.

"In response to seven fatal attacks in the last three years by what are believed great white sharks the government of Western Australia has decided to cull all sharks larger than 3m – a pretty barbaric approach to protecting the safety of beachgoers, and one that has already claimed its first victim in the form of a 3m tiger shark. In particular, very little is known about great white shark numbers, but sharks worldwide are under threat and conservationists – even shark attack victims themselves – have called for a rethink of the cull. Even though Australia has laws that make it an offence to harm, capture or trade any member of a listed threatened species without a permit, as the Australian federal government has provided permits to fishermen the cull is above board. As recently as 2012, a report commissioned by the WA government rejected using drum lines, large floating fish hooks anchored the seabed, as an effective option to reduce shark bite risk, so that these are now being used is a huge backwards step in terms of shark conservation. Instead of killing rare, endangered and important shark species, we need to take note of other means at our disposal to keep these sea hunters at bay.   The most effective way of protecting beaches is to use a shark barrier, mesh nets and steel curtains set up around popular beaches. But there are issues around the problems with by-catch and the ability to protect only small areas of coastline. Old Dunsborough beach on the Western Coast has just installed a trial shark protection barrier that extends 100m from the shore and runs parallel with the beach for around 300m. This is the second shark barrier trial on WA beaches, the first at Coogee Beach. No dead sharks, so far.   Little has been said about the Shark Monitoring Network, set up in 2009 to monitor movements of tagged great whites off the coast of WA. Having trapped and tagged 338 sharks so far, the network uses seabed monitors and satellite technology to provide early warning when tagged sharks swim close to beaches.   Developed by the US Navy in World War II, the “Shark Chaser” relied on the belief that sharks avoided dead sharks, and that copper acetate mimicked the odour of dead, decaying sharks. While early tests suggested promise, further studies showed that sharks were not affected – they were even seen eating the containers.    Following the Shark Chaser’s failure, chemical repellents were ignored for many years. But recently the work of Dr Samuel Gruber and his team in Bimini Island, Bahamas, has led to the development of semiochemical repellents. These work by chemically triggering sharks’ flight reaction, with some chemicals able even to immobilise some species in very low doses. Clothing and equipment using these repellents are now produced by SharkDefense Technologies since 2009.       Developed in Australia in the 1960s, the bubble curtain can be described as a garden hose with holes drilled into it, through which compressed air is pumped. This generates a thick cloud of bubbles, touted as an “impenetrable wall” no shark would cross. Sold to many US hoteliers, in 1961 it was tested and found to be totally inadequate – out of 12 tiger sharks, 11 passed through, and of these some were evidently playing in the bubbles.   While commonplace in films, diver’s knives or even harpoons are highly ineffective tools to stave off a determined shark attack. And equipping swimmers with weaponry or armour would be cumbersome and pretty much eradicate any enjoyment from being in the water.   CO2-powered drogue darts are used by navies to deter sharks, but in the wrong hands they can cause more harm than good. The CO2 dart can only be fired from the side or underneath, so in murky waters a shark seen only at the last minute renders them pretty useless.   The Neptunic™ has been available on the market since the early 1980s. The wearer wouldn’t look out of place on horseback, as it’s essentially a chainmail suit of armour. And while it offers some protection, it’s quite limited. Even the advertising states it is “a last line of defence” and that if bitten “bodily harm can and most likely will occur”.  So it’s not that effective, and for an outlay of more than US$5,000 is probably a bit steep for most beachgoers.       Sharks are highly sensitive to electricity, and when confronted by small electrical currents are startled and tend to swim away. Higher voltages can paralyse or even kill. There have been brisk sales of the Shark Shield electronic shark deterrent in recent years, particularly after a spate of shark attacks in Hawaii last year – eight shark attacks in Maui alone, and 14 across the islands, including the first shark-attack death in the state since 2004. Swimmers and surfers strap the devices that emit electric pulses to their ankles or to their surf boards.  In scientific trials researchers have found these have a deterrent effect on the behaviour of white sharks, but did not deter or repel them in all situations. Nor did it attract them, which is better than nothing. Other ideas for electrical devices, such as electric fences around beaches or hand-held electric harpoons, have been dropped when development costs far outweighed the practicality or call for these devices.   So while shark barriers are expensive, have limited range, and have been found not to be fully effective on certain targets, is a cull that potentially causes serious harm to important species really the answer? Sharks have not evolved for several million years as they are apex predators in their own environment. Who are we to encroach on their domain and not expect to – however rarely – get a bite taken out of us?"

Until now conventional wisdom assumed that candidates of both major parties had to back ethanol welfare to win the Iowa caucuses. In 1988 Pete du Pont challenged agricultural subsidies, but he didn’t triumph there or in New Hampshire, after which he dropped out of the race.



In contrast, when Sen. John “Straight Talk Express” McCain ran, he flip‐​flopped on ethanol, proclaiming himself a true believer in the subsidy after criticizing it for being “highway robbery.” Sen. Hillary Clinton attacked ethanol welfare as “equivalent to a new tax” on gasoline; candidate Clinton lauded the dubious fuel for “limiting our dependence on foreign oil.”



Years ago Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute called corn equivalent to “a state religion.” At least in Iowa, which accounts for a quarter of ethanol capacity, corn, like cotton in the antebellum South, was king. No politician who hoped to become president wanted to be branded a heretic or seen as committing regicide.



Most of today’s candidates have fallen into line. For instance, Florida’s Sen. Marco Rubio, a big fan of the sugar program, which enriches growers from his state, has embraced ethanol subsidies. Why? Agriculture is “not an equal playing field” compared to other businesses, he claimed: “it’s a very weak industry.” Actually, farmers have a much more powerful lobby than do most other enterprises. Those on the ethanol dole have done especially well.





Finally a presidential hopeful who refuses to defend this subsidized obscenity.



However, Sen. Ted Cruz has broken ranks to criticize farmers’ welfare and he holds a narrow lead over Donald Trump in the upcoming caucuses. (Sen. Rand Paul also flunks the ethanol lobby’s test, but he remains far back in the race.) Cruz’s political strength has dismayed ethanol makers. The group America’s Renewable Future, whose state director is the governor’s son, is deploying 22 staffers in the presidential campaign. Some 50,000 people have signed up, saying that they will only back a friend of the ethanol lobby.



The wailing and gnashing of teeth among those dependent on federal handouts is understandable. Imagine, Iowa voters who believe there are other issues of note—war, deficits, terrorism, education, immigration, health care, and more. Worse, Iowans are prepared to cast their votes based on what they believe to be the nation’s interest rather than their own. The ethanol lobby looks like a paper tiger.



Ethanol subsidies began in 1978 and used to include a high tariff and benefit from generous tax credits, both of which expired at the end of 2011. However, the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires blending ethanol with gasoline, operates as a huge industry subsidy. Robert Bryce of the Manhattan Institute figured the requirement cost drivers more than $10 billion since 2007.



Cruz actually is a moderate on the issue, having shifted from immediate repeal to phase‐​out by 2022. He explained: “The lobbyists are trying the best they can to snooker the people of Iowa and convince the people of Iowa that a government mandate is the only way for ethanol to survive.” However, he added, “I don’t think Iowa farmers want to be dependent on Washington.” Alas, he may have more faith in them than experience warrants, given their consistent, strong support for subsidies.



Ethanol is a political creation. The American Automobile Association warned that E15, with 15 percent ethanol, could damage cars. Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute called it “an inferior fuel that damages automobile engines and fuel systems.”



Three decades ago the Agriculture Department admitted that ethanol could not survive “without massive new government assistance,” which “cannot be justified on economic grounds.” What other justification could there be for an ethanol dole?



Petroleum became the fuel of choice for economic reasons: it was the most cost‐​effective energy source available for transportation, in particular. Ethanol has only about two‐​thirds of the energy content of gasoline. Given the energy necessary to produce ethanol—fuel tractors, make fertilizer, and distill alcohol, for instance—ethanol actually may consume more in fossil fuels than the energy it yields, though solid numbers are hard to come by.



The ethanol lobby complains that oil production is subsidized. However, the answer is to end petroleum subsidies, not add ethanol welfare. Anyway, oil subsidies are modest and have little impact on gasoline prices, which are set in a global market.



The ethanol lobby claims using this inferior fuel promotes “energy independence.” However, ending imports wouldn’t insulate the U.S. from the impact of disruptions in a global market. Moreover, the price of this energy “insurance” is wildly excessive.



Bryce figured that “Since 1982, on average ethanol has cost 2.4 times more than an energy‐​equivalent amount of gasoline.” In some years the former was three times as expensive. Last year Terry Dinan of the Congressional Budget Office told House members that “the marginal cost of reducing gasoline consumption by one gallon through substituting corn ethanol would be 60 cents under the [2016 RFS standard] and would probably be between $2.30 and $3.20 under the” tougher 2017 RFS standard. With the U.S. likely to become an oil exporter, the call for energy independence makes ever less sense.



By creating an artificial energy demand for corn—an astonishing 40 percent of the existing supply goes for ethanol—Uncle Sam also is raising food prices. _Forbes_ contributor James Conca estimated that the amount of corn necessary to fill a 25‐​gallon gas tank “can feed one person for a year.” The UN Food and Agricultural Organization termed biofuels “one of the leading factors behind the increase in their prices in world markets which, in turn, has led to higher food prices.” This obviously makes it harder for poor people to feed themselves—and raises costs for those seeking to help them. Warned the peer‐​reviewed _Science_ journal: “Any reduction in global food consumption is likely to disproportionately affect some groups of the poor because they can less afford higher prices.”



Oddly, some ethanol proponents have argued that this is a good thing. Less corn going to animals and people should reduce greenhouse emissions. Taking the argument to its logical end, Washington should promote mass starvation around the globe.



Nor does ethanol welfare yield an environmental benefit, as claimed. In fact, ethanol is bad for the planet. Two years ago the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that “Increasing bioenergy crop cultivation poses risks to ecosystems and biodiversity.” _Scientific American’s_ David Biello pointed to fertilizer run‐​off from cornfields which created “vast oxygen‐​deprived ‘dead zones’ in the Gulf of Mexico.” Analysts blame the recent increase in the area’s size on the fertilizer needed to grow corn destined for ethanol.



Taylor and Van Doren also cited research which, after taking “evaporative emissions” into account, determined that ethanol mixed with gasoline “actually increases emissions of total hydrocarbons, non‐​methane organize compounds and volatile toxins.” Moreover, additional land used for corn production means “more water pollution, less water for other uses, and more ecosystems destruction.”



What of combatting climate change? One study estimated a drop of between one and five percent in greenhouse emissions from the blended fuel, which makes the cost extraordinarily high. Other reviews don’t even find this reduction. Princeton’s Timothy Searchinger told Biello: “We can’t get to a result with corn ethanol where we can generate greenhouse gas benefits.” The IPCC’s conclusion was more diplomatic but equally damning: “since for some biofuels indirect emissions—including from land use changes—can lead to greater total emissions than when using petroleum products, policy support needs to be considered on a case by case basis.”



Similarly, warned Dinan: “replacing gasoline with corn ethanol has only limited potential for reducing emissions (and some studies indicate that it could increase emissions).” He explained that any cut largely depended on a long‐​term shift in transportation from gasoline and diesel to “advanced biofuels.” And using the latter is even more expensive than ethanol. Cutting use of one gallon of gasoline through use of advanced biofuels could run _as much as $9.20_. Such a deal!



Give Ted Cruz his due, ethanol appears to be one issue on which he put principle before politics. Irrespective of his presidential ambitions, we all would benefit if Iowans engaged in a little political regicide against King Ethanol.

As we, fortunately, head towards the end of the third quiet tornado year in a row, let’s take a closer look at the intensity of tornadoes in the US.
We often hear claims that tornadoes are growing stronger as a result of global warming. But what do the facts tell us?
NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center maintains a database of tornadoes back to 1950. However, it is generally accepted by tornado experts that data is unreliable from the 1950’s and 60’s, which were known as the “tornado growth period”, as observation practices began to develop.
Another problem during these early decades was that, according to the SPC’s Greg Carbin, there were too many higher-rated tornadoes because of post rating.
Therefore, any analysis can only be reliably started from 1970.
It is also well accepted that many more small EF-0 tornadoes are spotted nowadays, that would have gone unnoticed previously, so these too need to be excluded from any analysis.
[Quick note –  The EF-Scale was introduced in 2007, to replace the F-Scale. All above references to EF-Scale refer to both.]
From the SPC data, we can therefore plot the annual number of EF-1+ tornadoes.
 

Figure 1
As we see, the number of tornadoes has been on a declining trend.
But within this total, are stronger tornadoes on the increase? We can plot the percentage totals of each category.

  Figure 2

Figure 3

Figure 4

Figure 5
The results are perfectly clear – the weakest EF-1 tornadoes have been increasing as a proportion, while all the other categories have been declining. (I have not shown EF-5’s separately, as these are such a small number, about one a year, as to make any trends meaningless).
Can we rely on tornado classifications being consistent over time? There is no easy answer to this, but when the Enhanced Fujita system was introduced in 2007, it was stressed that the new system was designed to ensure compatibility with the original Fujita scale.
In any event, NOAA themselves still publish official analyses using these classifications, stating:
To better understand the variability and trend in tornado frequency in the United States, the total number of EF-1 and stronger, as well as strong to violent tornadoes (EF-3 to EF-5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed. These tornadoes would have likely been reported even during the decades before Doppler radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports. The bar charts below indicate there has been little trend in the frequency of the stronger tornadoes over the past 55 years.

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/trends
Analysis of long term climatic trends can often be fraught with these sort of data issues, whether tornadoes, hurricane or temperatures. Nevertheless, the official data is the best we have got. And its message is clear.
Tornadoes since 1970 have been declining both in number and intensity.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf recently ordered all schools in the state to close for the rest of the academic year.



Although the governor recently signed a law preventing charter schools from being compensated for educating any new students during the crisis, some cyber charter schools are still continuing to serve new students who need them.



Adjusting to a new school can be challenging, especially when switching from a brick‐​and‐​mortar school building to a virtual setting during an unexpected pandemic. However, this challenging time might also allow families to notice previously unrecognized benefits of home‐​based education. Anecdotally, some parents have reported on social media that their children are “relaxed,” “reading better,” and “so much happier.”



Home‐​based education could allow some children to avoid many school climate problems, including physical fights, harassment, and bullying, which could lead to less anxiety and more happiness.



My new study, published as a Reason Foundation working paper, suggests that these families might be onto something.



Using publicly‐​available data from the Pennsylvania Department of Education, I find that cyber charter schools report fewer school climate problems than government‐​run schools in the 2018–19 school year.



After controlling for several observable differences in students between sectors, cyber charter schools report fewer instances of 21 types of school climate problems than government‐​run schools. For example, cyber charter schools report fewer instances of bullying, fighting, and theft on a per‐​student basis than government‐​run schools serving similar students.



However, a virtual setting is not necessary for improvements in school safety. The results also suggest that brick‐​and‐​mortar charter schools are generally safer than government‐​run schools in Pennsylvania. Twenty‐​seven of the 30 statistically significant results show that brick‐​and‐​mortar charter schools report fewer school climate problems than government‐​run schools serving similar students in the state.



The charter school safety advantages are substantial. For example, the brick‐​and‐​mortar charter school effect sizes include a 69 percent reduction in physical fights, an 89 percent reduction in aggravated assaults on students, an 82 percent reduction in harassment, a 50 percent reduction in robberies, a 27 percent reduction in vandalism, and a 15 percent reduction in arrests relative to similar government‐​run schools in the state.



These results make sense. Families generally care about the safety of their own children more than anyone else. And families consistently report prioritizing safety when they have the option to choose schools for their kids.



However, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf recently proposed a ban on all new cyber charter schools in the state. He also proposed a reduction in charter school funding and to allow government‐​run school districts to cap enrollment at their charter school competitors.



These proposals would inadvertently increase the chances that students could experience dangerous incidents next year by limiting access to schools where they feel safe. Instead, Pennsylvania should prioritize expanding access to safer schools over protecting government‐​run schools from competition.



Corey A. DeAngelis is the director of school choice at Reason Foundation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week a couple of North Sea storms swept across Europe, which is typical for this time of the year. And with them came strong winds, which are now reported to have had a detrimental impact on Germany’s power grid.
Daniel Wetzel at German flagship daily Die Welt here reports that though storms “Iwan” and “Heini” brought “a record high wind power production” of 32.6 GW to Germany, it “overloaded the power grid” and necessitated the import of expensive fossil fuel power from Austria to balance the grid and prevent its collapse.
During the stormy weather all 25,000 wind turbines in Germany produced at full capacity which overburdened the grid. Die Welt writes that national transmission line operators are forced to fall back on so-called winter reserves, or power plants in southern Germany and Austria which “are rented exclusively for stabilizing the power grid“.
“That’s expensive,” Die Welt’s Wetzel writes.
Wetzel explains that the reserve capacity of 200 und 2200 megawatts from the south are needed in order to create a sort of “counter pressure” against the wind power coming in from the north and thus keep the grid “balanced and stable.” Die Welt explains that a part of the grid stabilization process involved shutting down huge wind parks, for example Brandenburg grid operator E.dis and Tennet had to shut down hundreds of megawatts of wind capacity. This is expensive because the unproduced power still has to be paid for. This is required by Germany’s quirky renewable energy feed-in act.
In total the emergency measures needed to stabilize the power grid by Tennet alone will cost consumers 500 million euros this year, Die Welt reports.

//-->




The emergency grid intervention measures show how precarious Germany’s power grid has become. Die Welt quotes Tennet management Chairman Urban Keussen:
Both the intervention in the conventional and the renewable energy supply are emergency measures. They are not suited for securing the power supply over the long run.”
That means the grid is already on the brink. Keuseen says that these interventions are costly and that the costs will be passed on to consumers. Just in Tennet’s area alone the interventions will cost Germans 500 million euros in 2015.
According to Die Welt, Keussen describes a high voltage transmission system that is “tense” and says that there will be “more costs and risks of supply uncertainties” should the grid fail to be upgraded soon.
What a mess. We have a policy-made disaster just waiting to happen.
Germans may want to consider buying portable generators this winter.

"The annual custom of the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner suddenly seems uncomfortable if not untenable: Journalists mingling with Trump administration aides who loathe them, celebrities decrying Trump White House policies, and an entertainment headliner grappling with the tone and boldness of jokes about President Trump himself. But Samantha Bee is not waiting to see how this year’s soiree unfolds or if those involved decide to hold it at all. Instead, Ms. Bee, host of the topical TBS comedy show “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” and her colleagues are planning a   that will take place in Washington on April 29, the same night as the Correspondents’ Association dinner. This alternative gala, which is being called “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner” and was announced on Monday, will be at the Willard Hotel. Ms. Bee said that it was not an attempt to comment on or compete with that other,   banquet, but a night to include jokes about Mr. Trump that she and   comedians want to make. “We’re not trying to supersede it,” she said in a telephone interview. “We just want to be there in case something happens  —   or doesn’t happen  —   and ensure that we get to properly roast the president. ” Ms. Bee said that she and her “Full Frontal” producers got the idea for their event after Mr. Trump’s election in November. “We were talking out loud about whether we thought the White House Correspondents’ dinner would change during a Trump presidency, or if it would even exist,” she said. “And then we thought, Why don’t we just do one, just to do it in the way that we would want it done if we were hosting it?” The “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner” will probably be shown on TBS in some form Ms. Bee said that those details were still being worked out, as was a lineup of talent. “We have binders full of people, but we don’t have any specifics to offer yet,” she said. Ms. Bee said that proceeds from her event would go to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The   dinner held by the Correspondents’ Association, which advocates press accessibility at the White House and gives out journalism awards and scholarships, has come under scrutiny in recent years. Some news organizations and observers regard it as a   atmosphere for reporters to hobnob with the officials they are supposed to be covering objectively and adversarially. (The New York Times stopped sending journalists to the dinner in 2008.) The event has also been the scene of two notorious incidents. At the 2006 dinner, its featured performer, Stephen Colbert, delivered a scathing satirical takedown of President George W. Bush. Mr. Colbert’s performance, in the guise of the arrogant   political commentator he played on Comedy Central, appeared to offend Mr. Bush and several of his aides, though it was widely celebrated by television and internet viewers. (The next year, the Correspondents’ Association invited Rich Little.) In 2011, Mr. Trump, then a civilian and a guest at the dinner, sat   as he was mocked relentlessly by President Obama and Seth Meyers for having promoted the false theory that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump at the time: “Now he can get to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened at Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?” Mr. Trump lashed out the next morning, in an interview with The Times, saying Mr. Meyers had “no talent” and acknowledging his discomfort  —   “I am not looking to laugh along with my enemies”  —   while also speaking at length about possibly running for the presidency. Given the open hostility that Mr. Trump and his administration have displayed for the news media, some journalists have wondered if the Correspondents’ Association dinner is a tradition worth preserving. Would Mr. Trump even attend this year, and what entertainer could make jokes about him without getting underneath his   thin skin? Comedians have only started figuring out how to riff on Mr. Trump as president, and there is a wide gulf between what Trump supporters and detractors think is funny about him. The White House Correspondents’ Association “looks forward to hosting our annual dinner this year as we do every year to celebrate the First Amendment, reward some of the finest reporting of the past year and recognize promising young student journalists,” its president, Jeff Mason, said in a statement. The association has not announced its entertainer for the April dinner, and Ms. Bee said she had no expectation of being asked. “My assumption is that that invitation is not coming,” she said, “and I don’t blame them for that at all. ” Addressing the Correspondents’ Association, she said: “I honestly can’t imagine what they’re thinking, but I really wish them well. I think that’s going to be very challenging. Does 3 Doors Down do comedy? I don’t know, maybe they do. ”"
"The announcement came at New Year that David Cameron’s cabinet members might be about to trade in their limousines for electric vehicles. Such a move would make the UK government the world’s first to run a fleet of all-electric ministerial cars. This push adds to announcements from the end of last year that set a £10m prize for innovators who could produce a more efficient battery, and a dedicated £5m pot for testing the use of electric cars in the public sector. This fresh approach builds on existing commitments of £400m put aside to encourage consumers to buy electric vehicles, the centre-piece of which was the plug-in car grant introduced in 2011 that allowed buyers to claim back 25% of the value of a new electric car, up to a limit of £5,000. However, less than a third of that pot has been spent as consumers were reluctant to buy. It’s made the government’s supposed “year of the electric car” a bit of a damp squib. A little over 5,700 cars have been funded through the grant since it began, which is about one in every 1,000 cars sold in Britain. In addition to funding batter-powered electric vehicles, the grant also funds hybrid electrics vehicles. These have had more success than purely electric vehicles – the iconic Toyota Prius for example, which uses electricity to power the engine for parts of the journey (typically, the start), and conventional fuel for the majority. In terms of total cars on the road, the UK has 4,100 wholly electric and 125,300 hybrid electric cars on the road, from a total of 31,998,700 – just 0.04%. Even adding another 3,200 electric or hybrid vans, this is way off even a single percent of the UK’s road vehicles. So the UK lags far behind other European nations such as Norway, which boasts twice as many electric cars serving a population only a tenth the size (and a cold climate that can affect lithium battery life), or France with a similar population to the UK but nearly three times as many electric cars. In this case, the reason for such poor take-up in Britain may well lie with less generous incentives than in Norway, and/or a less comprehensive infrastructure compared to that in France. In response to such differences in approach and success, my colleagues and I at Cardiff University’s Electric Vehicle Centre of Excellence have been studying consumer attitudes to electric vehicles, as part of the ENEVATE project. We gave volunteers, ordinary car drivers, the chance to drive electric cars for the first time in a series of pilot tests. What did they think? The results show that consumers are generally keen to use electric cars. Some are attracted to the environmental benefits they offer, others by the excitement of getting to grips with a new technology. Most like the prospect of cheaper running costs by cutting out the ever-rising price of petrol or diesel. However, despite enthusiasm for the cars, there are two barriers that remain obstacles that prevent would-be electric car drivers from putting their hands in their pocket: the high initial purchase cost, and fears of the vehicle’s battery range. So it seems that these reasons are still why the UK electric car market has stalled: too much risk and responsibility is being placed on the consumer. Electric cars are expensive – £25,000 for the Nissan Leaf, or £17,500 for the Renault Fluence and £13,500 for the Renault Zoe – even with the government’s grant. And consumers are especially wary of wasting money on a technology that might become obsolete with advances in battery technology, or changes in charging infrastructure that supersede the vehicles they’ve invested in. Consumers also seem to resent having to spend so much on cars that are essentially less practical than their petrol- or diesel-powered equivalents. With maximum journey lengths of 100 miles on a single charge and recharging that takes, at best, 20-30 minutes (more likely several hours using the charging technology implemented in the UK), many rightly worry about the limitations and the need for meticulous route planning. So perhaps the government’s new approach will offer a better way forward. Instead of simply offering financial inducements to make an expensive car marginally less so, they have realised that the best way of normalising the technology is to introduce it into car fleets. Spreading the burden of buying and running electric vehicles to organisations rather than individuals seems the most sensible way of mainstreaming electric cars. Local authorities have taken the first steps in doing so, such as in Carmarthenshire and Swansea. Were the UK cabinet to do the same, it would be a flagship use of electric cars that should set an example to others – the most high-profile fleet of all. Demonstrating to the public that electric cars can be made to work, while at the same time improving battery power and cost, might just be the most significant move for the electric car’s prospects in 2014."

 ** _Policymakers should_**



• question the key assumptions that have guided U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War;  
• have a better appreciation for the limits and unintended consequences of the use of U.S. military power;  
• be mindful of the American people’s attitudes on foreign policy, including their deep skepticism of land wars in the Middle East and resentment of the free‐​riding and reckless behavior of allies in Europe and Asia; and  
• adopt a foreign policy, consistent with the nation’s founding traditions, that capitalizes on America’s key advantages and is better aligned with public sentiment today.



Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has embraced a heavily interventionist and increasingly militaristic foreign policy. The belief in this grand strategy among foreign policy elites only accelerated after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This strategy, known loosely as liberal hegemony or international primacy, purports to use U.S. military power to shape the international order, as opposed to merely defending the United States and its vital interests.



Some experts, however, have long questioned the wisdom of primacy. Their voices are now being heard, even in policymaking circles, as the high costs and dubious benefits of this policy come into sharper focus. They argue that primacy is built on flawed assumptions and is ultimately counterproductive to U.S. safety. By discouraging other countries from doing more to defend themselves and their interests, primacy imposes excessive costs on American taxpayers and unnecessary risks on U.S. troops. Meanwhile, primacy increases the likelihood that the United States will be drawn into wars that do not serve U.S. vital security interests.



The United States should adopt a different grand strategy, one that maintains a superior defense capability focused on advancing American security. Restraint takes advantage of America’s essential security and favorable strategic position. It also recognizes that excessive intervention — especially the use of military force — unleashes a host of unintended consequences that often undermines U.S. national security. Restraining the impulse to intervene militarily or diplomatically when U.S. vital interests are not threatened would reduce the likelihood that we will be drawn into foolish wars and would also provide a powerful incentive for allies to share the burdens of defense.



The object of U.S. foreign policy in the post–Cold War world, according to a Pentagon planning document prepared in 1992, was to “prevent the emergence of a new rival.” U.S. military power would not merely deter attacks against the United States, but would also deter potential challengers, including traditional U.S. allies such as Germany and Japan, from aspiring to play a larger role in their region, or globally.



Several years later, Robert Kagan and William Kristol made the case for “benevolent global hegemony,” their particular brand of primacy. They called for frequent military interventions to topple “rising dictators and hostile ideologies” and were especially keen to reject the idea that the U.S. military should focus on defending the United States. Instead, they supported going to war even “when we cannot prove that a narrowly construed ‘vital interest’ of the United States is at stake.”



At least four key assumptions underlie primacy. First, primacy holds that technology has rendered moot our traditional geographic advantages: friendly and weak neighbors to the north and south, and wide oceans to the east and west. The world is plagued by disparate and urgent threats. Any problem, anywhere, _could_ threaten America in the future. Therefore, U.S. national security policy under primacy aims to prevent all fires before they start. If that fails, the U.S. military is prepared to stomp them out.



Second, primacy asserts that the United States must take upon itself the burden of defending allies around the world. Though such a strategy can encourage free riding, primacy advocates are more worried by the prospect that allies’ self‐​defense efforts might fail, necessitating more costly U.S. intervention later and under less favorable circumstances. U.S. security guarantees, the primacists say, tamp down the natural inclination of states to want to provide security for themselves, thus preventing allies from arms buildups that might unsettle their neighbors and perhaps even unleash regional arms races.



A third assumption undergirding primacy is the belief that the proper functioning of the global economic system requires a single dominant state to enforce the rules of the road. Because the health of the U.S. economy depends upon a healthy global economy, primacy ensures both our physical and economic security.



Finally, primacy ascribes a high level of effectiveness to the use of military force. Beyond the deterrent and coercive effects of preponderant military power, primacists believe that military force is the solution to a wide range of foreign policy problems. Since the 1990s the United States has used its military to provide humanitarian aid, topple governments, impose democracy, help rebuild national economies, do police work and peacekeeping, and of course find and kill members of terrorist groups. Despite the length of that list, however, many primacists believe the United States should be using military force in even more places than it is presently.



The result of primacy’s core assumptions is an expansive definition of American national interests that encourages aggressive behavior and generates high costs without adding to America’s national security. The American response to 9/11 has cost the United States somewhere between $4 and $6 trillion to date as the “war on terror” spread from Afghanistan to Iraq to Somalia, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Pakistan. Meanwhile, the men and women in our military are regularly deployed far from our shores, and they have often paid a terrible price. Thousands have been killed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and tens of thousands have been injured. Nearly a million veterans have registered for disability claims from these two wars.



Such sacrifices might be justified if they obtained the fundamental object of _any_ nation’s foreign policy: security. Tragically, the United States has little progress to point to for all its efforts. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was born from the chaos in Iraq after the U.S. invasion, the number of jihadists and terrorist attacks in the Middle East has exploded since 2001, and all the countries in which the United States has engaged militarily are in shambles. Rather than solve problems, the primacist approach toward terrorism and the Middle East has made things worse while creating new enemies and giving more people an incentive to conduct terrorist attacks against the United States.



In stark contrast, the strategy of restraint is premised on very different assumptions about the way the world works. First, the restraint perspective asserts that the United States enjoys a fundamentally benign security environment. The fears that drive primacy’s hyperactivity are mostly exaggerated or overblown. Technology has not evaporated the seas. Large land armies cannot invade and occupy the United States. Meanwhile, potential challengers such as China or Russia face a number of problems that will constrain their ability to cause trouble, especially in the Western Hemisphere.



In other critical respects, technology enhances U.S. security. Nuclear weapons are a powerful deterrent against state actors with return addresses. Meanwhile, precision weapons and special operations forces can be used against terrorists and nonstate actors. The hard part is finding them and stopping them before they act, but intelligence and law enforcement personnel are in the best position to do this. Large land armies stationed in foreign lands may generate more terrorism than they cure.



Second, restraint also departs from primacy on assumptions about allies and regional security efforts. Thanks to favorable geography and other advantages, America doesn’t need to maintain regional balances of power to ensure its security. In fact, commitments to reassure nervous allies, deter attacks against others, and use the military to fight our allies’ enemies if deterrence fails pose a number of important challenges. Alliances, especially with countries in dangerous neighborhoods, can inadvertently increase the likelihood of conflict, as well as the likelihood of American involvement. Allies are often more willing to confront powerful rivals than they would be if they were responsible for their own defense, a classic case of moral hazard, or what Barry Posen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology calls “reckless driving.” There have always been dangers in the world, and there always will be. But primacy compounds the problem by essentially making everyone else’s problems our own.



Third, restraint takes seriously the importance of global engagement through trade but rejects the primacists’ claim that such economic interactions can only occur under the American security umbrella. The international economic order is remarkably resilient. Temporary supply or demand disruptions occur all the time. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or human‐​caused mischief such as war or banditry, can cut off the flow of oil from a particular refinery, for example, or threaten shipping through critical strategic waterways. But markets adapt. Producers respond to incentives and bring new sources of supply online. Supply routes can also be adjusted, circumventing closed or threatened transit corridors. Consumers adjust as well, substituting products as the price and availability change. Meanwhile, primacy’s frequent wars have disrupted markets as much or more than the terrorists and rogue states have.



Finally, restraint also challenges primacy’s confidence in the effectiveness of military force. A review of the past 20 years reveals that, although military force has been highly effective for achieving military objectives, its effectiveness in nonmilitary domains is extremely limited. Spreading democracy, nation building, resolving civil wars, and fighting terrorism are all well beyond the capabilities of even the American military. Moreover, as the experience in the Middle East since 9/11 has shown, military intervention can also make things worse by causing chaos and instability, creating new enemies, and fostering resentment among foreign publics.



A restraint‐​oriented grand strategy would be very different from the current American strategy. It would focus on defending U.S. vital interests, maintaining a force capable of deploying abroad when the need arises, and restraining the impulse to use that military power when U.S. vital interests are not directly engaged. And it would call on others to deal with urgent threats to their national security before they threaten their region or the globe.



American grand strategy should flow from an assessment of strategic realities. Primacists’ assessment of these realities has been faulty. As a result, the pursuit of primacy has been the biggest threat to American security and its national interests since the end of the Cold War. Primacy is costly, dangerous, unnecessary, and counterproductive. In inflation‐​adjusted dollars, the United States annually spends more on its military today than during an average Cold War year. The United States accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world’s military spending even though Americans produce just over 20 percent of global economic output and represent just 5 percent of the world’s population. We spend more than twice as much on national security as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea — combined.



In contrast, a strategy of restraint would allow the United States to reap the benefits of its benign security environment at much lower costs in lives and national treasure. Withdrawing from the painful and expensive history lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq and staying out of other local conflicts will save American lives and the tens of billions of dollars spent each year. Letting its allies take responsibility for their own security will reduce the chances that the United States gets drawn into another nation’s conflicts. A commitment to self‐​defense and diplomacy rather than confrontation and military force will help the United States regain much of the moral high ground and soft power that it has lost over the past two decades.



Beyond these points, restraint is consistent with U.S. foreign policy as it was practiced for most of the nation’s history. For over a century, U.S. policymakers and diplomats followed George Washington’s guidance from his Farewell Address: “The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations,” he explained, “is in extending our _commercial_ relations to have with them as little _political_ connection as possible.” Washington and the other Founders desired amicable relations with other countries, were anxious to trade with others, and hoped to welcome immigrants to our shores. But they were equally anxious to avoid foreign wars.



Their advice would still serve us well today. A wise grand strategy in the 21st century must take account of the resources available to execute it. It should prioritize threats and contemplate the optimal tools for addressing them. The ends are often more malleable than the ways and means. Primacy pretends that they are not. It fails to prioritize, predicated as it is on the notion that any threat, anywhere, is a matter of urgent concern for the United States. That view requires a massive, active military, one even more expensive and more active than the one we have today.



In the current domestic political context, in which U.S. federal government spending is rising faster than revenues, increasing the resources going to the Pentagon entails telling the American people to accept cuts in popular domestic programs, higher taxes, more debt, or all of these things. Primacy suggests that these difficult choices cannot be avoided. It expects Americans to make sacrifices while our allies continue to neglect their defenses and maintain their bloated domestic spending programs.



Such an approach is, unsurprisingly, deeply unpopular with the American people. “Defending our allies’ security” ranked near the bottom of Americans’ foreign policy priorities, tied with “limiting climate change,” in the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ most recent report on American public opinion and foreign policy.



After years of war in the Middle East with no end in sight and little to show for it but pain and more terrorism, the overwhelming majority of Americans now believe that neither the Afghanistan nor the Iraq invasion was worth the costs. The number of Americans who believe that the United States should mind its own business internationally is near an all‐​time high. Though Americans certainly appreciate and want the United States to maintain superior military capability, most believe that few situations justify the sort of military intervention that has characterized the past 20 years of American foreign policy. Absent a clear and present threat to national security, the public prefers diplomacy and other tools over the use of force as a means of dealing with international problems.



Rather than clinging stubbornly to an unnecessary and unwise strategy of primacy, policymakers should reconsider America’s global policing role, encourage other countries to defend themselves and their interests, and bring the object of our foreign policy in line with the public’s wishes.

 _The following letter has been sent to various MSM print outlets as well as CoL politicians._  




It was entirely predictable that we would get sensational alarmist reporting from the UN IPCC this week. We get similar stories every year and especially before each convention where Al Gore and Leonardo Dicaprio fly in on their private jets along with 25,000 other groupies and rip-off merchants.



They want to frighten us into compliance with their blatant and wasteful fraud. Madrid will be special because COP25 is where they want to set a global carbon tax that 97% of the people who live on earth violently disagree with. **The poor will pay the price** of the USD1-1.5 trillion fraud as it grows ever bigger. 



This year they have good reason for urgency. After all, the temperature above the North Pole set an all-time low record this Northern winter and the USA had the coldest and wettest winter in over 100 years. Now noctilucent clouds are forming over Antarctica due to the intense cold that signals an all-time record cold there too ([www.spaceweather.com](http://www.spaceweather.com/) ). Earth’s Thermosphere is thinning and cooling. They say that the level of atmospheric CO2 is up to 408ppm at the end of 2018. So let me see, that means it has risen by 13% from 1998 which was actually an extremely hot year due to the extraordinary El Nino event that year.



The earth did have another big El Nino event in 2016 where the temperature reached 0.1 degrees C higher than in 1998 but since then the temperature of the lower atmosphere (where we live) **has fallen.** (You can check this graph at the link above). So I take UN IPCC reports with a grain of salt. 



Arguably the global average temperature has gone up in the 20 years to 2018 by…zero. So we have a climate emergency in which CO2 goes up and the temperature doesn’t…so go figure. **That is the UN IPCC’s trick**. It is that time of the year where I need to give you journos four intensely important treats to shake your confidence in the guys who put your news in its Orwellian straight-jacket. 



**First, treat…** I have been using 412, 413 and 415ppm at various times already because those are the figures I have been getting from the NOAA commentaries. But it really doesn’t matter because atmospheric CO2 concentrations have been proven to have no significant effect on atmospheric temperature. On the contrary, there is good evidence that temperature drives atmospheric CO2 levels due to the out-gassing of the ocean when it warms, and the absorption of atmospheric CO2 when the oceans cool. 



**Second, treat** … The time has come when the solar cycles have changed from the most active eleven-year solar cycles in over 4,000 years during the 20th century (which are the likeliest cause of much of the warming since the end of “The Little Ice Age” in 1850 AD), to the start of a considerably less active cycle called a “Grand Solar Minimum”. During the eleven-year solar cycles numbered 24 and 25 when the temperature pause began after 1998, the reaction of the fraudsters pushing the Anthropogenic Global Warming Theory was to **alter the temperature data to make it look a lot hotter.** They were caught in the whistleblower release of emails from the Climate Research Unit of The University of East Anglia that showed their intent. “Climategate” took place ten years ago and because it suited the politicians, the fraudsters were never punished. So the fraudsters still fiddle with the old temperature records to suit their bankrupt narrative – even today. 



**Third treat…** In 2019 NASA and NOAA met and agreed with all invited solar researchers that solar cycle 25 would be very inactive and that the world would cool for the duration of sc25. Naturally, the lead solar and space weather researchers have known about this coming event for years. The climate strategies of Russia and China are based on the return of a 200-year cooling cycle this year which was last seen during the “Dalton Minimum” of the 18th-19th centuries. The manifestation of this change came by shortened growing seasons that only became noticeable in 2017 and 2018; but which has become a true “cold climate crop loss disaster” in 2019. Watch it unfold and weep! 



**Fourth treat…** While NASA and NOAA have been rather reluctant to embrace the notion that it is the solar cycles driving earth’s climate (they have after all been an integral part of the climate change fraud since its outset in the 1980’s), most solar scientists and astro-physicists believe we are now headed for either a 33 year cooling event like the “Dalton Minimum” or a 70 year event like the “Maunder Minimum”. 



The government crop reports are not yet in for the harvest that just ended amongst the Northern hemisphere floods and blizzards. But the stats will likely be given a good spin to avoid upsetting the politicians and fraudsters behind the Great Global Warming Fraud. Even so, by the time one or two years like 2019 have come and gone, there will be no-one left to defend the fraud. 



**What if I am wrong?…** Well, I am just a simple fraud investigator and energy investor who is not impressed by the legions of people benefiting from the Great Global Warming Fraud. I use analysis of the information provided by everyone and I start by believing none of it. I am retired and would prefer to be proven wrong because history has taught us that 20 times as many people [die during cold times](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/greta-thunberg-will-get-your-grandma-killed/) as in warm. Otherwise, I just don’t care.



No-one will go to jail in New Zealand because there are too many well-paid folks in exalted positions feeding at the trough that this silly business provides. A grand solar minimum will probably empty the trough and kill off many innocent folks. The fraud that has endured for 40 years will end when there is a ripeness of time for it to do so – like all frauds from the “South Sea Bubble” to Bernie Maddoff. I sometimes hope it will die from natural causes, rather than in a courtroom but I am just one of the millions of sceptics that you folk marginalise whenever it suits your purpose. I just wouldn’t like you to be too surprised if/when I do pounce. 



Yours sincerely

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy now most German readers here know the excellent site by global warming science skeptics Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. The two authored the book “Die kalte Sonne“, which upset the German climate science establishment. The book is also available in English under the title: The Neglected Sun.
At their Die kalte Sonne site the pair has, as usual, another outstanding post on global warming and on how it has so far been totally exaggerated.
======================================
Global Temperature Rise Far Below “Most Probable” Model Projection
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Who doesn’t like looking through old books? Recently “Die kalte Sonne” chief editor Sebastian Lüning picked out from his living room bookshelf a copy of Klimaänderungen by Christian Schönwiese, which was published by Springer Verlag in 1995:

In English the title of the book by Christian Schönwiese reads “Climate Change: Data, Analyses, Prognoses”.
Flipping through the pages one comes across a figure depicting the projected temperature rise by 2100 (page 179, Fig. 54). How did scientiosts back then estimate the temperature development in the year the second IPCC report was released? Shown in the following figure are three estimates: a high estimate (if things really get serious), a best estimate (most probable warming) and a low estimate (if the climate danger is not as bad as feared).

Figure 1: Temperature prognosis up to 2100. From: Schönwiese 1995.

Some 20 years later we are now able to look back and check to see just how well the predictions are turning out. Is the prediction right, wrong, or perhaps not even close?
We’ve taken the liberty of superimpsing on the 1995 – 2015 measured temperature curve to the above chart. To do this we used the global HadCRUT-data series. Quick and dirty, Figure 2 shows the result with the added 20 years of data.
Has nature followed along the projection? The real temperatures are actually slightly below the low estimate:

Figure 2: Temperature prognoses by Schönwiese, 1995, with superimposed temperature plot of HadCRUT 1995-2015 series (red). Chart of temperature vs time. “Schon eingetreten” – already measured; “Beobachtung” – observed; “hohe Schätzung” – high estimate; “Bestschätzung” – best estimate; “niedrige Schätzung” – low estimate. 
So what could this possibly mean? According to the IPCC reports, the ‘transient’ short term TCR climate sensitivity is somewhere between 1.0-2.5°C warming for each doubling of CO2 concentration (Figure 3). That translates to a long-term ECS Climate Sensitivity of 1.5-4.5°C. Obviously the real temperature trend is currently below the lowest scenario.
Using the IPCC range, everything is pointing to a CO2 climate sensitivity of 1.0°C (TCR) or 1.5°C (ECR). Of course this is nowhere mentioned in the latest IPCC report. In the meantime curves and data have been shifted about, jerked around, and distorted so that the original prognoses over the years can be propped up. Of course none of it makes sense, but that is just the way it is. Complaints aren’t going to help. As the old saying goes: The one in charge is the one who is pulling the strings.

From the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council
Researchers have found that the spread of an exotic honey bee parasite -now found worldwide – is linked not only to its superior competitive ability, but also to climate, according to a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
The team of researchers, including Myrsini Natsopoulou from the Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, who co-led the research alongside Dr. Dino McMahon from Queen’s University Belfast, believes that the parasite could become more prevalent in the UK in the future and their findings demonstrate the importance of both parasite competition and climate change in the spread of this emerging disease.
Myrsini Natsopoulou said: “Our results reveal not only that the exotic parasite is a better competitor than its original close relative, but that its widespread distribution and patterns of prevalence in nature depend on climatic conditions too”.
The research compared pathogen growth in honey bees that were infected with both the exotic parasite, Nosema ceranae and its original native relative, Nosema apis.
Experiments showed that, while both parasites inhibit each other’s growth, the exotic Nosema ceranae has a much greater negative impact on the native Nosema apis than vice versa. By integrating the effects of competition and climate into a simple mathematical model, the researchers were better able to predict the relative occurrence of both parasite species in nature: Nosema ceranae is common in Southern Europe but rare in Northern Europe.
Coauthor of the study, Prof. Robert Paxton of Queen’s University Belfast, added: “This emerging parasite is more susceptible to cold than its original close relative, possibly reflecting its presumed origin in east Asia. In the face of rising global temperatures, our findings suggest that it will increase in prevalence and potentially lead to increased honey bee colony losses in Britain.”

Two years ago protestors took over the streets of Istanbul, Turkey’s first city. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan beat them down and last year was elected president. Critics feared his plan to invest the largely ceremonial post with Putinesque authority. On Sunday, however, Turkish voters revoked his party’s majority.



The Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002. Erdogan initially allied with liberals to systematically dismantle the authoritarian, nationalistic, coup‐​prone system that had replaced the Ottoman Empire.



Military leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who achieved distinction defending against the allies in the infamous Gallipoli campaign, rose to power in World War I’s tumultuous aftermath. He became the first president of the Republic of Turkey and took on the name Ataturk (“Father of the Turks”), which parliament reserved for him. His ubiquitous image dominates the landscape; his mausoleum and memorial cover an entire city block in the capital of Ankara. The only comparable personality cult which I’ve seen is in North Korea.



Ataturk was no self‐​effacing republican. He ruthlessly modernized, enforced secularism, and constructed a one‐​party state. After his death there were elections but the politicians didn’t really rule. The military staged three hard coups, the last in 1980, and a softer putsch in 1997.



The generals executed and jailed opponents. Even criticism of Ataturk and “Kemalism” resulted in prosecution. Academics and journalists risked their jobs. Ruthless repression of the Kurds (which Ankara denied were a separate people) led to a 30‐​year war which cost 40,000 lives. In 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus, seized nearly 40 percent of the island, and ethnically cleansed the occupied zone of Greeks; the division of the island lives on four decades later. Religious minorities, such as the Armenian and Greek Orthodox, were marginalized. The military attempted to suppress even moderate Islamic sentiments. As Istanbul mayor Erdogan read an Islamist poem in public, for which he was ousted and imprisoned briefly.





The Turkish people must take full advantage of their opportunities in a new Turkey.



Eventually the nationalist establishment imploded. Weak coalition governments tolerated corruption and delivered economic malaise. In 2002 the AKP won a dramatic victory.



The party delivered liberty and prosperity. The AKP dismantled repressive elements of the “Deep State,” put the military back in its barracks, created a more business‐​friendly environment, moved towards Europe, and pushed social reforms. A female journalist told me that the mildly‐​Islamic AKP paid more attention to problems of domestic violence than had previous nationalist‐​secularist regimes. Author Graham Fuller argued that the AKP’s first decade was “extraordinary” and “may have been the best government Turkey has ever had since it adopted democratic rule in the 1950s.” Turkey grew wealthier and more influential, and the Turkish people rewarded the AKP with a steadily larger proportion of their votes.



However, Erdogan had foreshadowed an uglier future when he declared a couple decades ago: “Democracy, for us, is a train you get off once you reach your destination.” He apparently believed he reached his destination by 2011, when Fuller dates Erdogan’s shift. That year the AKP purged more moderate members. By then several more liberal Turks told me they were becoming increasingly concerned over the government’s direction.



Today Erdogan denounces critics domestic and foreign, using every repressive tool of the state against them. He dallies with Islamist and terrorist forces as he tries to make Turkey into a regional Weltmacht. He waxes paternalistic, discussing what Turks should eat and drink, and how many children they should have. While switching positions he constructed a $615 million presidential palace, four times the size of Versailles. No Sultan lived so opulently.



Turks see that his past accomplishments are fading. Widespread prosperity cemented his rule, but the Turkish economic engine is slowing: growth is down, unemployment is up, consumer confidence has fallen, the current account deficit is the biggest in the OECD, stock values have declined, and the lira has lost some 40 percent of its value compared to the dollar since 2013.



Growth greatly increased opportunities for corruption. Charges of misconduct reached the cabinet and Erdogan, as prosecutors began investigating. After apparent stealth recordings of damning conversations leaked to the public, Erdogan blamed an earlier ally, cleric Fethullah Gulen, and purged police, prosecutors, and judges. The charges were dropped.



Although elections remain free, political rights and civil liberties are only middling. Overall Freedom House rated Turkey as partly free. The organization downgraded Ankara in its latest report because of the government’s “more pronounced political interference in anticorruption mechanisms and judicial processes, and greater tensions between majority Sunni Muslims and minority Alevis.”



The State Department’s human rights assessment includes a list of depressing particulars. For instance, the government interferes with freedom of assembly and expression, uses excessive force in breaking up protests, makes arbitrary arrests, politicizes the judiciary, maintains impunity for security forces despite claims of torture and unlawful killings, and provides inadequate protection for vulnerable populations.



Despite some reforms, noted State, “The penal code and antiterror law retain multiple articles that restrict freedom of expression, the press, and the internet.” After battling against misuse of security laws, including against himself, Erdogan deployed the legislation against military officers and civilians. The government claimed improbably vast conspiracies, most notably the Diyarbakir KCK (Kurdish), Ergenekon (nationalist), and Sledgehammer (military) cases. Roughly 500 people were arrested and 300 charged in the Ergenekon case alone. Although some of the convictions were ultimately overturned, many defendants spent years in jail awaiting trial.



Ergodan has led a particularly virulent campaign of intimidation against journalists, with Turkey for years leading the world in the number of imprisoned journalists. As of last October roughly 150 awaited trial. In its latest media freedom report, Freedom House ranked Turkey as “not free” and 142 out of 199 countries. The group noted that press freedom continued to fall “as the government moved more aggressively to close the space for dissent.” Turkey registered the ninth biggest drop worldwide from 2010 to 2014. Of course, officials denied any impropriety; regime supporters insisted to me that the media was conspiring with the military.



However, the _New Yorker’s_ Dexter Filkins cited “an extraordinary climate of fear among journalists.” Several reporters and columnists with whom I spoke feared criticizing the prime minister; their editors were reluctant to pursue stories against the government. A number of journalists lost their jobs. Affirmed Freedom House: “Government harassment of journalists is also common, leading to self‐​censorship and dismissals.”



The government also applies sustained though often invisible pressure on media organizations, including the threat of public investigations and loss of television licenses. Last month a government prosecutor sought to ban two television stations associated with Fethullah Gulen. Businessmen privately admit that they fear political retaliation. The dearth of coverage of the 2013 protests and disproportionate attention given the supposedly nonpartisan President Erdogan campaigning for the AKP in the recent election demonstrate government tactics at work.



After taming the traditional press the Erdogan government began targeting internet freedoms, with, noted Freedom House, “an overall strategy of demonizing and discrediting social media.” Although half of Turks are online, Freedom House rated Turkey as only partly free. People face significant obstacles to access, limits on content, and restrictions on use. In recent months the government has blocked access to Soundcloud, Twitter, Vimeo, and YouTube as well as thousands of websites, arrested dozens of individuals for comments on social media, prosecuted bloggers and websites for postings, and mandated access to user information through ISPs. Those charged include a former Miss Turkey and 16‐​year‐​old student. Government critics also suffer from organized online attacks, including denial‐​of‐​service assaults on newspapers.



While relaxing unfair restrictions on Muslims—such as the ban on women wearing headscarves—the government has yet to address the lack of legal protection for religious worship and practice by every faith. Indeed, individuals critical of Islam or the Prophet Mohammed face prosecution under the blasphemy statute. Religious minorities remain particularly vulnerable to arbitrary state decisions. For instance, the government continues to interfere with internal operation of the Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches. Ankara has returned a number of confiscated religious properties, but the Greek Orthodox Halki Seminary, remains closed despite government promises to act. Jews can worship freely but, warned the latest report of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, “they remain concerned about rising anti‐​Semitism in society and in the media and occasional derogatory comments by government officials.” One Turkish Jew hoping to emigrate told the _New York Times_ : “last year the level of hate speech in Turkey reached an unnerving level.”



In short, Turkey is headed in a dangerous direction, toward a corrupt, authoritarian state. The country needs an Arab Spring of sorts, but within the democratic process. An electoral revolution, not a street putsch. The use of the rule of law to end an illiberal government. The ballot box must make political power accountable.



On Sunday that process began. One article last week pessimistically warned: “This might be Turkey’s last election.” However, the AKP received less than 41 percent of the vote, down from roughly 50 percent four years ago (and 52 percent in last year’s presidential contest). The ruling party fell 18 seats short of a majority in the 550‐​member Grand National Assembly.



None of the opposition parties is a likely coalition partner. The Republican People’s Party (CHP) upholds the Kemalist vision and is nationalist and social democratic. More extreme is the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), described as “a stone’s throw from fascist” by Aaron Stein of the RUSI think tank. Making a dramatic entrance in fourth place was the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), a liberal‐​left Kurdish‐​based coalition which came together less than three years ago. But these parties also are unlikely to form a countervailing coalition. The AKP could establish a minority ministry and dare its opponents to oust it or trigger early elections.



In any case, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu may not survive, despite claiming victory and calling the AKP the “backbone of Turkey.” Certainly Erdogan’s vision of an enhanced presidency appears dead. Said Selahattin Demitras, head of the HDP: “The discussion of executive presidency and dictatorship has come to an end in Turkey with these elections.” Even half of AKP members oppose the idea. The government no longer can even pass common legislation if the opposition unites. The electoral result also is likely to embolden Erdogan’s opponents. For the first time in more than a decade AKP rule no longer appears to be inevitable.



Indeed, Erdogan may find it hard to control his party. Past prime ministers turned presidents such as Turgut Ozal and Suleyman Demirel lost influence. Some AKP members indicate privately that they do not like being asked to subordinate their beliefs to Erdogan’s ambitions. Moreover, Prime Minister Davutoglu holds the stronger institutional position and may have grown to enjoy making his own decisions. After the president criticized some government actions and policies, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc responded that “we love our president,” but added: “please do not forget that there is a government in this country.” That sparked a call for Arinc’s resignation.



Erdogan remains his party’s most popular figure and might try to oust his critics, but an intra‐​party civil war could wreck the AKP and government. Potential aspirants for power abound, led by Abdullah Gul, a former AKP prime minister, foreign minister, and president with international credibility. Erdogan’s and Gul’s partnership ended badly and the former ostentatiously bypassed Gul in tapping Davutoglu as successor. Other senior AKP officials also have run afoul of Erdogan and might enjoy a little revenge served cold.



Of course, fear of losing power could impel Erdogan to launch a crackdown. Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum warned that the former “will barrel, bulldoze, and steamroll his way ahead, ignoring traditional and legal niceties with or without changes to the constitution.” But doubling down would be risky. Although the military is unlikely to launch a coup, it might also not stand behind the government. The regime doubted the reliability of the police in reassigning some _45,000_ officers, as well as several thousand prosecutors and judges, as suspected Gulen followers. The election demonstrated that Erdogan represents only a plurality of the population. Civil strife could risk his future.



President Erdogan made the democratic transformation of Turkish politics possible. The Turkish people must take full advantage of their opportunities in a new Turkey. Only they can ensure a prosperous and free Turkey.

Economic inequality has risen to the top of the political agenda, championed by political candidates and best‐​selling authors alike. Yet, many of the most common beliefs about the issue are based on misperceptions and falsehoods.



Although we are frequently told that we are living in a new Gilded Age, the U.S. economic system is already highly redistributive. Tax policy and social welfare spending substantially reduce inequality in America. But even if inequality were growing as fast as critics claim, it would not necessarily be a problem.



For example, contrary to stereotypes, the wealthy tend to earn rather than inherit their wealth, and relatively few rich people work on Wall Street or in finance. Most rich people got that way by providing us with goods and services that improve our lives.



Income mobility may be smaller than we would like, but people continue to move up and down the income ladder. Few fortunes survive for multiple generations, while the poor are still able to rise out of poverty. More important, there is little relationship between inequality and poverty. The fact that some people become wealthy does not mean that others will become poor.



Although the wealthy may indeed take advantage of political connections for their own benefit, there is little evidence that, as a group, they pursue a political agenda designed to suppress the poor or prevent policies designed to help them. At the same time, rather than reducing economic inequality, more government intervention may actually make the situation worse. Since policies to reduce inequality, such as increased taxes or additional social welfare programs, are likely to have unintended consequences that could cause more harm than good, we should instead focus on implementing policies that actually reduce poverty, rather than attacking inequality itself.



Over the past several years, economic inequality has risen to the forefront of American political consciousness. Politicians, pundits, and academics paint a picture of a new Gilded Age in which a hereditary American gentry becomes ever richer, while the vast majority of Americans toil away in near‐​Dickensian poverty. As economist and _New York Times_ columnist Paul Krugman puts it, “Describing our current era as a new Gilded Age or Belle Époque isn’t hyperbole; it’s the simple truth.”1



Political candidates have leapt on the issue. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, has made it one of the central themes of her presidential campaign, warning, “Inequality of the kind that we are now experiencing is bad for individuals, bad for our economy, bad for our democracy.“2 Her campaign speeches are laced with comments that “there is too much inequality” and “inherited wealth and concentrated wealth is not good for America.”3 She claims “Economists have documented how the share of income and wealth going to those at the very top, not just the top 1 percent but the top 0.1 percent, the 0.01 percent of the population, has risen sharply over the last generation.” And, echoing Krugman or Thomas Piketty, she says, “Some are calling it a throwback to the Gilded Age of the robber barons.”4



Republicans too, have tried to tap into concerns about rising inequality, albeit in more muted tones. Part of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s appeal has been an implicit criticism of an “unfair” system that has enriched some while leaving the broad middle class behind. And other candidates have laced their speeches with appeals to workers who have not participated in the economic gains of recent decades.



Polls show that the public believes that inequality is a problem. Sixty‐​three percent of respondents to a 2015 Gallup poll said they felt that money and wealth in the country should be more evenly distributed.5 In a _New York Times/​_ CBS News Poll from last year, 65 percent of respondents said they thought the gap between the rich and poor in the country is a problem that needs to be addressed now.6



It’s a compelling political narrative, one that can be used to advance any number of policy agendas, from higher taxes and increases in the minimum wage to trade barriers and immigration restrictions. But it is fundamentally wrong, based on a series of myths that sound good and play to our emotions and sense of fairness, but that don’t hold up under close scrutiny.



The basic premise for the current debate over inequality was perhaps best expressed by French economist Thomas Piketty in his widely cited 2014 book, _Capital in the Twenty‐​First Century_.7 Piketty argues that income inequality in the United States is as high as it has been in a century, and is rising. His data (Figure 1) show that a high degree of inequality was, in fact, the rule throughout much of U.S. history, but plunged rapidly in the years following World War II.



Piketty credits this post‐​war decline in inequality to a number of factors, such as the redistributionist policies of Franklin Roosevelt, high marginal tax rates on the wealthy (in particular high tax rates on capital), and the strength of the labor movement, among other things. But as these pillars of the modern welfare state have eroded, Piketty contends that inequality has risen. Today, it hovers just below its peak in 1930 (a small dip resulting from the recent recession), and is poised to rise to new heights. Piketty sees no end to this trend, ultimately “threaten[ing] our democratic institutions and values.”8



 **Figure 1. Income Inequality in the United States, 1910–2010, According to Piketty**

There have, of course, been many critiques of Piketty’s methodology. For example, it has been noted that there is a lack of citations for some of his data. Chris Giles, economics editor for the _Financial Times_ , notes that in calculating wealth share for the top 10 percent in the United States before 1950, “none of the sources Prof. Piketty uses contain these numbers, hence he assumes the top 10 percent wealth share is his estimate for the top 1 percent share plus 36 percentage points.… However, there is no explanation for this number, nor why it should stay constant over time.”9 Giles also argues that Piketty combines different data sources arbitrarily, using surveys of households in the United States versus estate tax data for Britain, for example.10 Piketty also appears to have arbitrarily added 2 percentage points to the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent of earners in the United States in 1970.11



Perhaps more significantly, Piketty insists that, over time, the return to capital always exceeds the overall growth of the economy—his famous “ _r > g_” equation, his “fundamental force for divergence.”12 This forms the heart of his case: that the average rate of return on capital will remain higher than the average rate of overall growth. In his words, “When the rate of return on capital significantly exceeds the growth rate of the economy … then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income.”13 These growing levels of wealth and income inequality will continue into the future, with inheritance and legacy playing an increasingly outsized role in the future, absent other policy changes.



But, as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist Matthew Rognlie and others have pointed out, housing—that is, home price appreciation—accounts for almost all of the long‐​term increase in the net capital share of income.14 By failing to correctly account for the role of housing, Piketty’s model fails to explain the true dynamics of wealth.



Lawrence Summers suggests that, when it comes to elasticities of substitution and diminishing returns to capital, Piketty “misreads the literature by conflating gross and net returns to capital.”15 The elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is critical for Piketty’s mechanism: if this elasticity is not greater than one, then a higher ratio of capital to income is associated with a lower share of capital income. Defining this term is also crucial, particularly the distinction of whether the measure is in gross or net terms. The net return is the gross return minus depreciation, and by subtracting depreciation net is mechanically lower than gross. When discussing the distribution of the control of resources, the net term is more relevant, as Piketty acknowledges in the book, saying “savings used to cover depreciation simply ensure that the existing capital stock will not decrease” and cannot be used to increase capital stock.16 Rognlie provides a simple illustrative example to help understand this distinction between net and gross terms: “if someone earns $1 in revenue from renting out a building but loses $0.40 as the building deteriorates, her command over resources has only increased by $0.60.”17 Focusing then, on the more relevant net term, Summers argues that “[i]t is plausible that as the capital stock grows, the increment of output produced declines slowly, but there can be no question that depreciation increases proportionally.… I know of no study suggesting that measuring output in net terms, the elasticity of substitution is greater than 1.”18 Focusing on the more relevant net term, which accounts for depreciation, it does not seem plausible that higher shares of capital would then lead to more capital accumulation due to diminishing returns.



University of California–Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach and Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute also criticize Piketty’s failure to consider risk and volatility in calculating the rate of return to capital. Using assumptions based on a simulation model developed by the National Bureau for Economic Research, they conclude that post‐​tax returns to capital remain substantially lower than growth in gross national product.19



Chairman Jason Furman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers and others have suggested that labor income plays a bigger role in the growth of inequality than returns to capital, as suggested by Piketty. Furman and former director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Peter Orszag estimate that roughly two‐​thirds of the increased share of income going to the top 1 percent since 1970 is attributable to increases in labor‐​income inequality.



Finally, in an article in the _Journal of Economic Perspectives_ , MIT economist Daren Acemoglu and University of Chicago economist and political scientist James A. Robinson note that, while readers of Piketty’s book may be given the “impression that the evidence supporting his proposed laws of capitalism is overwhelming.… He does not present even basic correlations between _r–_ _g_ and changes in inequality, much less any explicit evidence of a causal effect.”21 They run cross‐​country regressions to analyze the relationship between top‐​level inequality and the gap between _r_ and _g_ ; whereas Piketty’s theory would predict a significant positive relationship between the two, they find a statistically insignificant negative estimate.



Some of these criticisms have been answered with greater or lesser satisfaction, while others have not been answered at all. And it is important to note that other, less heralded, critiques of inequality have avoided some of Piketty’s errors while reaching similar conclusions about a general increase in market income inequality.22



However, such technical debates, while important, miss a more fundamental problem with claims of record inequality.



Most claims that income inequality is at a record high in the United States, including Piketty’s, are based on a measure of “market income,” which does not take into account taxes or transfer payments (or changes in household size or composition). The failure to consider those factors considerably overstates effective levels of inequality.23



What the pundits, politicians, and others fail to understand is that the U.S. tax and transfer system is already highly redistributive. Taxes are progressive, significantly so. The top 1 percent of tax filers earn 19 percent of U.S. income, but in 2013 they paid 37.8 percent of federal income taxes.24 The inclusion of other taxes (payroll, sales, property, and so on) reduces this disparity, but does not eliminate it: a report from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the top 1 percent paid 25.4 percent of all federal taxes in 2013, compared to 15 percent of pre‐​tax income.25 The wealthy pay a disproportionate amount of taxes.



At the same time, lower‐​income earners benefit disproportionately from a variety of wealth transfer programs. The federal government alone, for example, currently funds more than 100 anti‐​poverty programs, dozens of which provide either cash or in‐​kind benefits directly to individuals. Federal spending on those programs approached $700 billion in 2015, and state and local governments added another $300 billion.26



Figure 2 shows the amount of redistribution taking place within the current tax and transfer system. In 2012, individuals in the bottom quintile (that is, the bottom 20 percent) of incomes (families with less than $17,104 in market income) received $27,171 on average in net benefits through all levels of government, while on average those in the top quintile (families with market incomes above $119,695) pay $87,076 more than they receive. The top 1 percent paid some $812,000 more.

Taking this existing redistribution into account significantly reduces inequality. According to the CBO, accounting for taxes reduces the amount of inequality in the United States by more than 8 percent, while including transfer payments reduces inequality by slightly more than 18 percent. By fully accounting for redistribution from taxes and transfers, true inequality is almost 26 percent less than it initially appears. (Figure 3.)

Note: The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is a common measure of income inequality based on the relationship between cumulative income shares and distribution of the population. The measure typically ranges from 0, which would reflect complete equality, and 1, which would correspond to complete inequality. Some sources, such as the World Bank, use an equivalent range of 0 to 100.



  




A new study from the Brookings Institution reaches similar conclusions. The study, by Jesse Bricker, Alice Henriques, and John Sabelhaus of the Federal Reserve Board and Jacob Krimmel of the University of Pennsylvania, found that while the concentration of wealth and income of the top 1 percent has indeed increased since 1992, it increased far less than prior research, including Piketty’s, has claimed. By including government transfers and in‐​kind compensation in their calculations, the study’s authors found that the share of income earned by the top 1 percent rose from 11 percent in 1991 to 18 percent in 2012, substantially less than, for instance, the 23 percent estimated by Piketty and his colleague Emmanuel Saez in their updated work on the issue.27



In another study in the _American Economic Review_ , Philip Armour, Richard Burkhauser, and Jeff Larrimore controlled for changes in household composition (that is, adjusting for size and dependency) and transfers (both cash and in‐​kind), and found that there were significant gains across the income spectrum from 1979 to 2007 and for the period 1989–2007. However, gains at the top were smaller than gains at the bottom, meaning by this measure, inequality actually _decreased_ from 1989 to the Great Recession.28



Given these problems, a better way to measure inequality might be to look at differences in consumption between income groups.



A study by Hassett and Aparna Mathur, also of the American Enterprise Institute, found that the “consumption gap across income groups has remained remarkably stable over time. If you sort households according to their pretax income, in 2010 the bottom fifth accounted for 8.7% of overall consumption, the middle fifth for 17.1%, and the top fifth for about 38.6%. Go back 10 years to 2000—before two recessions, the Bush tax cuts, and continuing expansions of globalization and computerization—and the numbers are similar. The bottom fifth accounted for 8.9% of consumption, the middle fifth for 17.3%, and the top fifth for 37.3%” (Figure 4).29



 **Figure 4. Share of Consumption Expenditure across Income Quintiles, 2000 and 2010**

Although Hassett and Mathur did not specifically look at the top 1 percent of incomes, their study does demonstrate that, even if there have been gains at the top, it has not resulted in adverse consumption effects for those further down the income ladder.



Of course, these different conclusions depend in part on different measures of economic inequality. Piketty and others are more concerned about the disparity in accumulated wealth, the residue of year after year of income. The highest quintile, after all, may be saving their increased wealth rather than spending it. Over time, this can lead to increasing disparity. But even here, the evidence shows that the disparity in wealth distribution has not increased nearly as fast as Piketty and his supporters believe. For example, Bricker and his colleagues also found that the share of total wealth held by the top 1 percent increased from roughly 27 percent to 33 percent over that period, compared to the 42 percent share estimated by Saez and Gabriel Zucman in updated work related to Piketty’s.30



Bricker’s study actually shows a larger increase in wealth disparity than some others. For example, according to research using the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans held 34.4 percent of the country’s wealth in 1969. By 2013, the last year for which data are available, that proportion had barely risen, to roughly 36 percent.31



Moreover, the recent recession hit the wealthy especially hard. Indeed, the Tax Foundation has found that from 2007 to 2009 there was a 40 percent _decline_ in the number of tax returns with at least $1 million in earnings. Among the “super‐​rich,” the decline was even sharper: the number of tax returns reporting more than $10 million in earnings fell by 54 percent.32 In fact, while in 2006 the top 1 percent earned almost 20 percent of all income in America, that figure declined to just over 15 percent in 2009.33 Such volatility reflects the greater exposure that the wealthy face to risks associated with investment income. The stock market, for example, declined sharply during the recession, as did, obviously, the value of real estate. If inequality is your big concern, you should have been delighted by the recession. Inequality _declined_.



It appears, then, that inequality may not be as big a problem as commonly portrayed. After considering taxes, transfers, and other factors, the gap between rich and poor is neither as large nor growing as rapidly as Piketty and others have alleged. But even if it were, the question arises as to why that should be condemned. Why is inequality ipso facto bad?



Much of the debate over inequality is tied together with notions of fairness. Fairness, after all, is one of the most fundamental values of American politics.



Americans don’t necessarily resent wealth or the fact the some people are wealthier than others. For instance, a 2015 Cato/​YouGov poll found that Americans agreed with the statement “people who produce more should be rewarded more than those who just tried hard” by a 42–26 percent margin.34 But this belief is counterbalanced by a feeling that the rich haven’t “earned” their wealth. For example, a study published in the _International Journal_ _of Business and Social Research_ found that while the so‐​called “Horatio Alger effect” still meant that Americans admired wealthy entrepreneurs, there is “‘relative disdain’ for those who inherit their wealth or obtain it from financial trading.”35



Inherited wealth, after all, is pretty much the quintessential definition of “unearned” reward. The parents may have earned their estates through hard work, but the heirs did nothing beyond an accident of birth—pure, random luck—to earn an inheritance.



And, in the wake of recent Wall Street malfeasance, the bank bailout, and the recent recession, the public increasingly believes that financial traders are up to no good. After all, how many people really understand what derivative trading and other financial activities are and how they benefit the overall economy? Movies such as _The Big Short_ regularly portray Wall Street operators as shady. And there certainly has been more than a little outright criminal activity in the finance industry. Recall Bernie Madoff.



But do the stereotypes hold? Are the wealthy really either trust fund babies who inherited their money or shady Wall Street traders?



Although Piketty and others worry a great deal about the role of inherited wealth, the evidence suggests that inheritance plays a very small role in how people become wealthy. Surveys vary, but it can be said with a fair degree of accuracy that the overwhelming majority of the rich did not inherit their wealth. For example, a study of billionaires around the world finds that fewer than 3 in 10 American billionaires got to that position by inheriting their wealth, and that “the share of self‐​made billionaires has been expanding most rapidly in the United States.”36 And while that represents the richest of the rich, the slightly less wealthy may be even less likely to have inherited their wealth. A report from BMO Financial Group found that two‐​thirds of high‐​net‐​worth Americans could be considered self‐​made, compared to a mere 3 percent who inherited the majority of their wealth. Interestingly, this study also found that nearly a third of these people are either first‐​generation Americans or were themselves born elsewhere. Among these wealthy “new Americans,” 80 percent reported that they earned, rather than inherited, their wealth.37 Finally, a survey by US Trust found that 70 percent of wealthy Americans grew up in middle‐​class or lower‐​income households. Even among those with assets in excess of $5 million, only a third grew up wealthy.38



Moreover, the role of inheritance has diminished over the last generation. A recent study by finance professors Steven Neil Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Joshua Rauh of Stanford found that fewer of those who made it on to the Forbes 400 list in recent years grew up wealthy than in previous decades, falling from 60 percent in 1982 to just 32 percent today.39 Roughly 20 percent of the Forbes 400 actually grew up poor, roughly the same percentage today as it was in 1982. Nor did most individuals on the Forbes 400 list inherit the family business. Kaplan and Rauh found that 69 percent of those on the list in 2011 started their own business, compared with only 40 percent in 1982.40 Similarly, an analysis by finance researchers Robert Arnott, William Bernstein, and Lillian Wu for the _Cato Journal_ concluded that “half of the wealth of the 2014 Forbes 400 has been newly created in one generation.”41



Further support for the minor role of inheritance can be seen from the fact that wage income is responsible for a majority of net worth for wealthy Americans. Among the top 10 percent in terms of net worth, wages accounted for 47 percent of their income in 2013, higher than the proportion in 1989 (Figure 5). Components such as interest, dividends, or capital gains, which are more likely, but by no means exclusively, derived from an inheritance, accounted for less than 18 percent of income for the top decile.42



 **Figure 5. Income Composition of Households in the Top Decile of Net Worth**

In fact, it is not entirely clear that inheritance plays a role in increasing inequality: a recent paper by economists Edward Wolff of New York University and Maury Gittleman of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that wealth transfers tend to be equalizing, because although richer households receive greater wealth transfers than poorer ones, “ _as a proportion of their current wealth holdings,_ wealth transfers are actually greater for poorer households.”43 As an illustration, although white households receive greater wealth transfers, a third of wealth in black households come from wealth transfers, compared to a fifth in white households. The same dynamic holds for younger households and low‐​income households, in general.



Nor are the rich primarily involved in stock trading or other financial services. According to one survey of the top 1 percent of American earners, slightly less than 14 percent were involved in banking or finance.44 Roughly a third were entrepreneurs or managers of nonfinancial businesses. Nearly 16 percent were doctors or other medical professionals. Lawyers accounted for slightly more than 8 percent, and engineers, scientists, and computer professionals another 6.6 percent.45 Sports and entertainment figures comprised almost 2 percent (see Figure 6).46 The ultrawealthy are somewhat more likely to be involved in finance, but not much more. Roughly 22 percent of those earning more than $30 million are involved in “finance, banking, and investments.”47

Overall, the rich get rich because they work for it. And they work hard. For example, research by economists Mark Aguiar of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Erik Hurst of the University of Chicago found that the working time for upper‐​income professionals has increased since 1965, while working time for low‐​skill, low‐​income workers has decreased.48 Similarly, according to a study by economists Peter Kuhn of the University of California–Santa Barbara and Fernando Lozano of Pomona College, the number of men in the bottom fifth of the income ladder who work more than 49 hours per week has dropped by almost 40 percent since 1980.49 But among the top fifth of earners, work weeks in excess of 49 hours have increased by almost 80 percent. Dalton Conley, chairman of NYU’s sociology department, concludes that “higher‐​income folks work more hours than lower‐​wage earners do.”50



Research by Nobel Economics Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman showed that those earning more than $100,000 per year spent, on average, less than 20 percent of their time on leisure activities, compared with more than a third of their time for people who earned less than $20,000 per year. Kahneman concluded that “being wealthy is often a powerful predictor that people spend less time doing pleasurable things and more time doing compulsory things.”51



None of this is to suggest that luck and privilege and government policies (see below) don’t play a role in who becomes wealthy. Clearly they do. But, for the most part the rich become wealthy because they earn it. And they earn it by creating, producing, or providing goods and services that improve the lives of the rest of us. This would seem to fit exactly the sort of wealth accumulation that Americans believe is “fair.”



Certainly some families stay wealthy for generation after generation. Yet it is also true that wealth often dissipates across generations; research shows that the wealth accumulated by some intrepid entrepreneur or businessperson rarely survives long. In many cases, as much as 70 percent has evaporated by the end of the second generation and as much as 90 percent by the end of the third.52



Even over the shorter term, the composition of the top 1 percent often changes dramatically. If history is any guide, roughly 56 percent of those in the top income quintile can expect to drop out of it within 20 years.53 Of course, they may retain accumulated wealth, but even by this measure shifts can occur rapidly. Indeed, just as rises in capital markets can make some people rich, declines can wipe out their wealth quickly. It is notable that of those on the first edition of the Forbes 400 in 1982, only 34 remain on the 2014 list, and only 24 have appeared on every list.54 Some dropped about because they died, of course, but most simply did not see their wealth grow sufficiently to maintain their place. And, this would not have required major gains. For instance, Lawrence Summers estimates that even a 4 percent real rate of return on their wealth would have kept them on the list.55 That they were unable to meet even this modest goal suggests that the rich are not continuing to increase their wealth at rates well above the rate of economic growth as claimed by Piketty.



The heirs of great fortunes have done especially poorly. For example, we might think of the du Ponts or Rockefellers as personifying multigenerational wealth. Thirty‐​eight people from those two families appeared on the 1982 list but none of the 16 du Pont heirs are currently on the Forbes 400 list and there is just one Rockefeller, 100‐​year‐​old David Sr. Nor are there any heirs to the Hearst fortune. The Mellons are out too, as are the Dursts and the Searles.56 Inheritance does not play an outsized or increasing role in the composition of the list: since 2005, those that inherited their money comprised just 10 percent of newcomers and 15 percent of newcomer’s wealth. The descendants of families on the inaugural list account for only 39 percent of the total wealth on the 2014 list.



For those who reach the 1 percent of income, spending long periods of time in that bracket is relatively rare. According to Hirschl and Rank, only about 2.2 percent of people spend five or more years in the top 1 percent of the income distribution from age 25 to 60. Just 1.1 percent spend 10 or more years in the top 1 percent. Attaining 10 consecutive years in the top 1 percent of income is even rarer: just over half of 1 percent do so.57 In short, there is no calcified class of 1 percenters who stay there, earning enormous incomes year after year.



At the same time, it remains possible for the poor to become rich, or, if not rich, at least not poor. Studies show that roughly half of those who begin in the bottom quintile move up to a higher quintile within 10 years.58 A more recent working paper found that 43 percent of families in the poorest income quintile and 27 percent of those in the second quintile saw earnings growth of at least 25 percent over a two‐​year period.59 These numbers may be somewhat distorted by one‐​time asset sales (such as a house), but still show considerably more economic mobility than commonly understood.



And their children can expect to rise even further. One out of every five children born to parents in the bottom income quintile will reach one of the top two quintiles in adulthood.60

Moreover, these studies focus on relative income mobility. Looking at absolute mobility, which considers whether children grow up to have higher incomes than their parents after adjusting for things like cost of living and household size, the vast majority of Americans have family income higher than their parents (Figure 8).

Economic mobility may not be as robust as we would like. In particular, upward mobility has been sluggish for decades. There is plenty of room to debate causes and solutions for this problem. But, it is simply untrue to suggest that the rich will stay rich and the poor will stay poor.



Perhaps the reason that there is so much concern over economic inequality is that we instinctively associate it with poverty. After all, poverty is the flip side of wealth. And, despite across‐​the‐​board gains in standards of living, too many Americans remain poor (at least by conventional measures). Slightly less than 15 percent of Americans lived in poverty in 2014, including 16 percent of women, 26.2 percent of African‐​Americans, and 21.1 percent of children.61



But, it is important to note that poverty and inequality are not the same thing. Indeed, if we were to double everyone’s income tomorrow, we would do much to reduce poverty, but the gap between rich and poor would grow larger. Would this be a bad thing?



There is little demonstrable relationship between inequality and poverty. Poverty rates have sometimes risen during periods of relatively stable levels of inequality and declined during times of rising inequality. The idea that gains by one person necessarily mean losses by another reflects a zero‐​sum view of the economy that is simply untethered to history or economics. The economy is not fixed in size, with the only question being one of distribution. Rather, the entire pie can grow, with more resources available to all.



Comparing the Gini coefficient, the official poverty measure, and two additional poverty measures (one based on income and accounting for taxes and transfers, and one based on consumption) developed by economists Bruce D. Meyer of the University of Chicago and James X. Sullivan of Notre Dame reveals no clear relationship between poverty and inequality (Figure 9).62 While the Gini coefficient has increased almost without interruption, the official poverty rate has fluctuated mostly in the 13–15 percent range and the two measures from Meyer and Sullivan have both decreased markedly since 1980.63 Again, the mid‐​1990s was an interesting period because the inequality was markedly higher than previously, but both the supplemental poverty measure (SPM) and the official rate saw significant decreases.

Comparison with the consumption‐​based poverty measure is especially interesting, with poverty showing a substantial decline despite rising inequality. Since many observers believe that consumption is the best measure of the poor’s actual standard of living, this suggests that not only does rising inequality not correlate with greater poverty, but a rising tide may truly lift all boats. That is, those same economic factors that make it possible for the rich to become rich may make life better for the poor as well.



One can see similar results from comparing the poverty rate to the share of after‐​tax income earned by the wealthiest 1 percent. There is no discernable correlation (Figure 10).64

The relationship between poverty and inequality remains unclear, in part because the number of confounding variables and broader societal changes make any kind of determination difficult. But what research there is generally finds that poverty cannot be tied to inequality.



For instance, a recent paper by Dierdre Bloome of Harvard finds “little evidence of a relationship between individuals’ economic mobility and the income inequality they experienced when growing up.… Over a twenty year period in which income inequality rose continuously, the intergenerational income elasticity showed no consistent trend.” While most studies examine these trends at the national level, she delves into state‐​level variation in inequality and social mobility. Again, she finds no evidence of a relationship, as “the inequality to which children were exposed in their state when growing up provides no information about the mobility they experienced as adults.”65



We should also note that international experience parallels the United States. Using World Bank data, which puts the Gini coefficient on a scale of 100, we can see that there are multiple countries where this has been the case recently.66 For example, China had a Gini coefficient of 32.43 in 1990 and it rose to 42.06 in 2009, meaning China became much more unequal. At the same time, the proportion of the population living below $1.25 a day (adjusted for purchasing power parity), the measure usually used for international poverty lines, fell from 60.18 percent in 1990 to only 11.8 percent in 2009.



Moreover, in discussing poverty and inequality, we should keep in mind that while the official poverty rate in the United States has been relatively stable since the mid‐​1970s, the sort of deep poverty that was once common among poor Americans has been largely eliminated despite whatever increase in inequality has occurred over the last 50 years. Take hunger, for example. In the 1960s, as much as a fifth of the U.S. population and more than a third of poor people had diets that did not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for key nutrients. Conditions in 266 U.S. counties were so bad that they were officially designated as “hunger areas.”67 Today, malnutrition has been significantly reduced. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, just 5.6 percent of U.S. households had “very low food security” in 2013, a category roughly comparable to the 1960s measurements.68 Even among people below the poverty level, only 18.5 percent report very low food security.69



Housing provides another example. As recently as 1975, more than 2.8 million renter households (roughly 11 percent of renter households and 4 percent of all households) lived in what was considered “severely inadequate” housing, defined as “units with physical defects or faulty plumbing, electricity, or heating.” Today that number is down to roughly 1.2 million renter households (1 percent of all households).70 In 1970, fully 17.5 percent of households did not have fully functioning plumbing; today, just 2 percent do not.71



And if you look at material goods, the case is even starker. In the 1960s, for instance, nearly a third of poor households had no telephone. Today, not only are telephones nearly universal, but roughly half of poor households own a computer. More than 98 percent have a television, and two‐​thirds have two or more TVs. In 1970, less than half of all poor people had a car; today, two‐​thirds do.72 Clearly, the material circumstances of poor families have improved significantly despite any possible increase in inequality.



Not only do more people across the income distribution have access to more of these things, but adoption of new technologies and products is speeding up. Whereas it took decades for the telephone and electricity to make their way into the majority of American homes, new products, such as the cellphone and Internet, have a much faster adoption rate, as indicated in

Thus, even as inequality, as measured by Piketty and others, has risen, people at the bottom of the income scale have better standards of living. It becomes an open question, therefore, whether inequality matters as long as everyone is becoming better off. In other words, if the poor are richer, do we care if the rich are even richer?



Recently, a new argument against inequality has come to the fore: that inequality skews the political process in ways that benefit the wealthy and penalize the poor. In doing so, it locks in the status quo, limiting economic mobility, and enabling the wealthy to become still wealthier. There is certainly some merit to this argument. The federal government can and does dispense favors to those with connections to the levers of power. This has enabled some individuals to accumulate wealth that they could not have earned in a truly free market. In that sense, disparities of political power may exacerbate inequality. On the other hand, there is far less evidence that the wealthy are able to use their political power to enact a broad agenda that favors the wealthy or penalizes the poor.



A complete review of campaign finance law is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the assumption that all wealthy people share a similar political orientation is simply not supported by the data. According to a Gallup Poll, about one‐​third of the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans self‐​identify as Republicans, compared to roughly a quarter who self‐​identify as Democrats, a statistically significant, but far from overwhelming, tilt toward Republicans.73 Wealthy Americans are slightly more likely to call themselves conservatives than liberals, but so is the American public as a whole. As for policy preferences, while there are some signs that there are some policy areas where the very wealthy hold different views, on most issues they do not diverge significantly from the rest of the public.74 Simply look at such wealthy political activists as George Soros, Charles Koch, Sheldon Adelson, and Tom Steyer. Clearly, there is no common political denominator in that group.



Moreover, while many wealthy individuals are politically active, that activism is often offset by groups that represent lower‐​income individuals, or groups whose politics cut across the socioeconomic spectrum. For example, 14 of the top 25 spenders during the 2012 election were unions, which ostensibly advocate for the working class.75



Even if the wealthy were more uniform in their political involvement, there is little evidence to show that money can buy elections. Obviously, a certain minimum amount of money is necessary to become a viable candidate. For a U.S. House candidate, for example, the first $500,000 or so is considered crucial to establishing a viable campaign. After that, additional funds and spending have diminishing returns.76



Finally, as noted above, the U.S. system is highly redistributive. The wealthy pay a disproportionate share of taxes. The regulatory state and the overall size of government have grown substantially. If the wealthy are attempting to tilt the playing field in favor of the rich, they have been remarkably unsuccessful.



That said, and as noted previously, we should not ignore the fact that some individuals and businesses are able to secure favors and privileges from the government, often to the detriment of their competitors. A recent study by Didier Jacobs for Oxfam International claimed that as many as three‐​quarters of the richest Americans owe their wealth to factors such as cronyism, Ricardian rents (meaning excess profits that are gained because of advantaged positions in the marketplace), and monopolies.77 The study itself is not especially rigorous and inflates its conclusions by lumping everything from corporate welfare to asymmetries of information into its broad definitions of unfairly earned wealth. Nonetheless, it does raise an important issue: the degree to which government itself exacerbates inequality through policies that reward favored businesses, punish the unfavored, protect monopolies, and otherwise limit competition.



In the popular imagination, it is an unrestrained free market that gives rise to inequality, and a powerful government is necessary to act as a counterweight. In reality, big government is often complicit with, and frequently the cause, of inequality.



Inequality caused by such crony capitalism may be particularly pernicious on economic grounds as well as principles of fairness. For instance, some studies suggest that high degrees of inequality can actually slow economic growth or reduce the amount of freedom in a country. Among them, a study by Southern Methodist University economist Ryan Murphy for the _Cato Journal_ found “inequality appears to have a negative impact on economic freedom.”78 But, other studies show that the key component in this equation is whether the inequality results from normal free‐​market forces or from government‐​dispensed favors. According to economists Sutirtha Bagchi of the University of Michigan and Jan Svejnar of Columbia University, “When we control for the fact that some billionaires acquired wealth through political connections, the effect of politically connected wealth inequality is negative, while politically unconnected wealth inequality, income inequality, and initial poverty have no significant effect.”79



By most measures, cronyism is a far smaller contributor to inequality in the United States than in many other countries, such as Russia, Malaysia, or Ukraine. One index of crony capitalism ranks the U.S. 17th in the world in terms of the proportion of billionaire wealth generated in industry sectors with a high degree of government involvement.80 The United States also has a higher percentage of billionaire wealth generated in non‐​cronyist sectors than most other countries. This listing may overstate the degree of cronyism in the United States since cronyist sectors include casinos; infrastructure; ports and airports; oil, timber, and mining; banking and finance; and real estate—many of which are far more open in the United States than they are in other counties. We should also understand that not everyone who earns wealth in a crony‐​controlled industry is involved in cronyism **.**



Still, it is easy to see that some U.S. industries, and therefore some fortunes, benefit from government action. And it is undeniable that politically derived benefits are far more likely to go to those who already have wealth, power, and the connections that flow from them. But there is little to suggest that inequality lies at the heart of the problem. Indeed, many of the countries that rank higher than the United States in terms of cronyism have much smaller Gini coefficients.



Another way to measure the effect of crony capitalism is to consider various indexes of economic freedom. The degree of economic freedom in a country can be considered a fair proxy for the lack of cronyism. That is, the freer an economy is, the less likely that it is dominated by cronyism. Studies measuring Gini coefficients over time against indexes of economic freedom (adjusted to exclude exogenous factors such as educational levels, climate, agricultural share of employment, and so forth) show a small but statistically significant _reduction_ in inequality in countries with high economic freedom scores.81 In other words, countries with less government intervention in the economy tend to have lower levels of inequality. It is worth noting, however, that not all areas of economic freedom had the same effect. For example, sound monetary policy, property rights, and a fair legal system reduced inequality more than did trade liberalization.



Consider, for example, how government regulations can prevent competition, thereby entrenching currently successful companies and reducing the economic mobility—both up and down the income scale—that might otherwise occur. Economic theory holds that companies can enjoy only a brief period of competitive advantage, during which they can make extremely high profits, and after which competitors will enter the marketplace, driving profits down. However, as _The Economist_ points out, American business profits have been unusually high for an unusually long period of time, and profitable firms have maintained their profits for longer periods than in the past. In the 1980s, for example, the odds that a very profitable U.S. company would still be as profitable 10 years later were about one out of two. Today, those odds are about 80 percent.82 _The Economist_ attributes much of this change to decreased competition.



Increasingly, costly and restrictive regulations can create barriers to entry that reduce competition and preserve excess profits in regulated industries. The U.S. rate of new business creation is half of what it was in the 1980s, and the United States is 33rd in the World Bank’s rankings of how easy it is to start a business.83 _The Economist_ warns, “Small firms normally lack both the working capital needed to deal with red tape and long court cases, and the lobbying power that would bend rules to their purposes.”84 The result may be undeservedly high profits for existing firms and unearned wealth for those who manage and invest in them.



Government may intervene even more directly to support businesses with political connections. The Cato Institute, for example, estimates that the federal government spends more than $100 billion every year on corporate welfare. Most of this spending provides favors to the politically powerful and well connected, rather than tax breaks meant to increase overall economic growth.



It may be reasonable to say, therefore, that far from being the enemy of inequality, big government can actually be an engine, or at least an accomplice, to greater inequality. It is not that inequality tilts the political playing field so much as it is that government provides the mechanism through which inequality can flourish.



Of course, even if one accepts the premise that inequality is increasing, undeserved, and leads to the problems discussed above, the more interesting question from a policy perspective is what we can—or should—do about it. There are, after all, two ways to reduce inequality. One can attempt to bring the bottom up by reducing poverty, or one can bring the top down by, in effect, punishing the rich.



Traditionally, we have tried to reduce inequality by taxing the rich and redistributing that money to the poor. And, as noted above, we have achieved some success. But we may well have reached a point of diminishing returns from such policies. Despite the United States spending roughly a trillion dollars each year on anti‐​poverty programs at all levels of government, by the official poverty measure we have done little to reduce poverty.85 Even by using more accurate alternative poverty measures, gains leveled out during the 1970s, apart from the latter part of the 1990s when the booming economy and the reform of the welfare system produced significant reductions in poverty. Additional increases in spending have yielded few gains. Thus, while redistribution may have reduced overall inequality, it has done far less to help lift people out of poverty.



And even in terms of attacking inequality, redistribution may have reached the limits of its ability to make a difference. A new study from the Brookings Institution, for example, suggests that further increasing taxes on the wealthy, accompanied by increased transfers to the poor, would have relatively little effect on inequality. This study by William Gale, Melissa Kearney, and Peter Orszag looked at what outcome could be expected if the top tax rate was raised to 50 percent from its current 39.6 percent, and all additional revenue raised was redistributed to households in the lowest quintile of current incomes. To bias the study in favor of redistribution, the authors assume no change in behavior from the wealthy in an effort to reduce their exposure to the higher tax rate. The tax hike, therefore, would raise $96 billion in additional revenue, which would allow additional redistribution of $2,650 to each household in the bottom quintile—an amount that would not significantly reduce inequality. The authors conclude, “That such a sizable increase in the top personal income tax rate leads to a strikingly limited reduction in income inequality speaks to the limitations of this particular approach to addressing the broader challenge.“86



Indeed, many advocates of increased taxes for the wealthy seem to concede that their efforts would do little to reduce poverty. Rather, they would reduce inequality from the top down. Piketty, for example, argues for a globally imposed wealth tax and a U.S. income tax rate of 80 percent on incomes over $500,000 per year.87 He acknowledges this tax “would not bring the government much in the way of revenue,” but that it would “distribute the fruits of growth more widely while imposing reasonable limits on economically useless (or even harmful) behavior.”88



Other critics of inequality seem equally concerned with punishing the rich. Hillary Clinton, for instance, argues that fighting inequality requires a “toppling” of the one percent.89 But the ultimate losers of such policies are likely to be the poor. Piketty’s plan might indeed lead to a society that would be more equal, but it would also likely be a society where everyone is far poorer.



Economic growth, after all, depends on people who are ambitious, skilled risk‐​takers. We need such people to be ever‐​striving for more in order to fuel economic growth. That means they must be rewarded for their efforts, their skills, their ambitions, and their risks. Such rewards inevitably lead to greater inequality. But as Nobel Economics Prize–winning economist Gary Becker pointed out, “It would be hard to motivate the vast majority of individuals to exert much effort, including creative effort, if everyone had the same earnings, status, prestige, and other types of rewards.”90



To be sure, since the 1970s the relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction has been uneven at best. But we are unlikely to see significant reductions in poverty without strong economic growth. Punishing the segment of society that most contributes to such growth therefore seems a poor policy for serious poverty reduction.



But one needn’t be a fan of the Laffer curve to realize that raising taxes on the rich can have unforeseen consequences. Recall 19th‐​century French economist and classical liberal Frédéric Bastiat’s _What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen_ , which argues that the pernicious effects of government policies are not easily identified because they affect incentives and thus people’s willingness to work and take risks.91 And recall that money earned by the rich is either saved or spent. If saved, it provides a pool of capital that fuels investment and provides jobs to the non‐​rich. Likewise, if spent, it increases consumption, similarly providing increased employment opportunities for the non‐​rich.



Back in 1991, for example, Congress decided to impose a luxury tax on such frivolous items as high‐​priced automobiles, aircraft, jewelry, furs, and yachts. The tax “worked” in a sense: the rich bought fewer luxury goods—and thousands of Americans who worked in the jewelry, aircraft, and boating industries lost their jobs. According to a study done for the Joint Economic Committee, the tax destroyed 7,600 jobs in the boating industry alone.92 Most of the tax was soon repealed, although the luxury tax provision lasted until 2002.



Too much of the debate over economic inequality has been driven by emotion or misinformation. Yes, there is a significant amount of inequality in America, but most estimates of that inequality fail to account for the amount of redistribution that already takes place in our system. If one takes into account taxes and social welfare programs, the gap between rich and poor shrinks significantly. Inequality does not disappear after making these adjustments, but it may not be as big a problem or be growing as rapidly as is sometimes portrayed.



But even if inequality were as bad as advertised, one has to ask why that should be considered a problem. Of course, inequality may be a problem if the wealthy became rich through unfair means. But, in reality, most wealthy people earned their wealth, and did so by providing goods and services that benefit society as a whole. Moreover, there remains substantial economic mobility in American society, although as noted above, there are policy reforms often unmentioned in the inequality debate that could expand the opportunities available to people toward the bottom of the income distribution, such as education reform, reducing occupational licensing and other regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship, reforming the criminal justice system, and eliminating the perverse incentives of the welfare system. Those who are rich today may not remain rich tomorrow. And those who are poor may still rise out of poverty.



While inequality per se may not be a problem, poverty is. But there is little evidence to suggest that economic inequality increases poverty. Indeed, policies designed to reduce inequality by imposing new burdens on the wealthy may perversely harm the poor by slowing economic growth and reducing job opportunities.

23\. Use of income data may also overstate the growth in inequality because changes in the tax code have caused more private business income to pass through to the owners’ individual tax returns via partnerships, LLCs, and Subchapter S corporations. From 1980 to 2007, according to the Congressional Budget Office, “the share of receipts generated by pass‐​through entities more than doubled over the period—from 14 percent to 38 percent.” See Richard V. Burkauser, Philip Armour, and Jeff Larrimore, “Levels and Trends in United States Income and Its Distribution: A Crosswalk from Market Income Towards a Comprehensive Haig‐​Simons Income Approach,” _Southern Economic Journal_ 81, no. 2 (October 2014): 271–93. Moving capital income from one tax form to another did not mean the wealth of the top 1 percent increased, it was simply shifted around. In addition, tax changes from 1981 to 1997 required that more capital income of high‐​income taxpayers be reported on their individual returns, while excluding most capital income of middle‐​income savers and homeowners. And, finally, there were significant increases in reported capital gains among the top 1 percent after the capital‐​gains tax was reduced in 1997 and 2003.

30\. Bricker et al., “Measuring Income and Wealth at the Top Using Administrative and Survey Data.” The difference is attributable to different data sources and the more comprehensive definition of income that these sources allow Bricker and colleagues to incorporate. They analyze families instead of individual tax units and their use of the Survey of Consumer Finances and National Income and Product Accounts data sources provide a much more comprehensive measure of total income, including in‐​kind and untaxed transfers.

The “very low food security” category identifies households in which food intake of one or more members was reduced and eating patterns disrupted because of insufficient money and other resources for food. Households classified as having low food security have reported multiple indications of food access problems and reduced diet quality, but typically have reported few, if any, indications of reduced food intake. Those classified as having very low food security have reported multiple indications of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns because of inadequate resources for food. In most, but not all, households with very low food security, the survey respondent reported that he or she was hungry at some time during the year but did not eat because there was not enough money for food.

Port‐​Au‐​Prince, Haiti—Haitians voted for a new president. With 54 candidates seeking the post a run‐​off seems inevitable. Whoever wins will face overwhelming challenges, none greater than the threat from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola, to expel hundreds of thousands of ethnic Haitians



Haiti was an oppressive French slave colony, liberated in 1804 in a bloody, 13‐​year revolt inspired by the French Revolution. Slave‐​holding America was ambivalent toward Haiti’s revolution and the two countries developed in very different directions. For instance, Haiti’s liberator declared himself emperor and slaughtered many whites. “Liberated” peasants were forbidden from leaving plantations to revive the farming economy.



Haiti never developed into a stable, prosperous democracy. Rather, the country suffered through some 30 coups over the years and was occupied by the U.S. military for nearly two decades a century ago. More recently Haiti went through three decades of rule by father and son dictators, “Papa Doc” and “Baby Doc” Duvalier, which ended only in 1986, followed by botched elections, military coups, violent conflict, populist politics, international sanctions, and a threatened U.S. invasion in 1994, followed by reinstatement as president of the violent demagogue Jean‐​Bertrand Aristide. (One of his former ministers, Maryse Narcisse, is on today’s ballot.)



In January 2010 an earthquake devastated Haiti. Estimates of dead ranged widely, to more than 300,000. At least 1.5 million people were displaced. Haiti received almost $10 billion in foreign aid in the following three years, but little long‐​term benefit is evident. The government is legendarily incompetent and corrupt. Today President Michael Martelly, a popular musician elected in 2011, rules virtually alone. He and the opposition were unable to agree to the composition of the Provisional Electoral Council, preventing scheduled parliamentary polls from taking place. At the moment Haiti has only 10 elected officials besides the president.



Secretary of State John Kerry dropped into Port‐​au‐​Prince earlier this month to urge “free and fair elections that take part without intimidation, without violence.” So far Washington has contributed $30 million toward the legislative and presidential polls.



Alas, the campaign was not smooth. The first round legislative vote in August, contested by _128 parties_ , suffered several violent incidents, closing some polling places and requiring a revote for 25 (of 139) seats. Later that month presidential candidate Michelet Nestor was assaulted while campaigning. At least 15 people were killed earlier this month in Port-au-Prince’s infamous slum, Cite Soleil. Some residents blamed gang disputes over distribution of money handed out by candidates, a traditional corrupting practice.



Candidate disqualifications have led to controversy and party boycotts. In early October a member of the Provisional Electoral Council resigned, criticizing election planning. Jessica Hsu of the NGO Haiti Communitere complained that residents were being treated as “pawns by politicians,” as in past elections. At least the presidential vote went surprisingly well.



Haiti’s economic problems are equally severe. The country should not be poor. The Caribbean is inviting, capital city is active, people are entrepreneurial, and successful live well. Residents of the Dominican Republic, who share Hispaniola Island, have left behind extreme poverty.





Haiti is one of the Caribbean’s most sustained tragedies.



However, Haiti’s hardship is evident when one arrives at the country’s decrepit airport. The nation’s per capita GDP ran $846 last year, less than one‐​seventh that in the DR, making the former the poorest nation in the region. Six million out of 10.4 million Haitians live in poverty; more than 2.5 million suffer in extreme poverty. Despite recent GDP growth, Haiti’s per capita GDP has fallen an average of .7 percent annually _since 1971_. Per capita electricity use is just two percent of that in neighboring DR. Haiti’s human development index is the lowest in the region.



The economy is largely agricultural, with much subsistence farming. Mining and tourism, mostly tied to cruise ships, also are important. Manufacturing never has fully recovered from Clinton‐​era sanctions imposed to return Aristide to power. Haitians rely heavily of remittances from relatives overseas.



Even an honest and competent president will have a difficult time transforming Haiti. According to the “Economic Freedom of the World report,” the openness of Haiti’s economy, a key determinant of growth, has remained largely static since 2000. Opined the _Wall Street Journal’s_ Mary Anastasia O’Grady: “Haiti is a failed state, devoid of institutions, transparency and the rule of law.”



The country does particularly poorly in protecting property rights and providing justice, which underlie a market economy. Intrusive labor regulations, trade barriers, restrictions on foreign investment, and impediments to starting a business are additional serious problems. The latest World Bank “Doing Business” survey found that it takes 97 days to legally start a new enterprise in Haiti, more than three times the Latin American average. Explained Douglas Clayton of Leopard Capital: “investors have to navigate lots of obsolete regulations and procedures to invest in Haiti.” Three years ago the government opened the Caracol Industrial Park, expected to become the largest such facility in the Caribbean. Yet it sits unfinished, having attracted but a fraction of the intended number of firms and jobs.



Corruption is pervasive and limits development. The well‐​connected dominate many critical markets. While democracy nominally reigns, noted O’Grady: “The political class still uses its power for personal aggrandizement, as the infamous dictators Francois Duvalier and his son Jean‐​Claude did for almost 30 years.”



While Haiti at best ran in place, other countries moved forward. In 2000 Haiti ranked 58 of 123 countries, right in the middle, of the economic freedom index. In 2012, Haiti ranked 92 of 152, barely above the bottom third. (The only good news is that Haiti was edging upward.) By punishing entrepreneurship and investment, the government is allowing its people to fall further behind.



Candidates know the economy must be energized, but aren’t sure how to do so. Some even talked of promoting import substitution—building domestic industries to preclude the need for imports. But that’s an old leftwing panacea which was discredited decades ago as its Latin American practitioners fell further behind economically. Arbitrary attempts to foster domestic industry inevitably are manipulated by influential domestic interests.



A better approach would be to create a competitive, low regulation environment to encourage efficient enterprises, irrespective of whether they import or export. This export‐​led model worked brilliantly for the East Asian “tigers.” Remove economic barriers, which discourage business creation, domestic entrepreneurship, and foreign investment, and produce better goods for less. But this strategy requires delivering honest and efficient administration, convincing a newly elected legislature to reform economic controls, creating a safe and stable investment climate, and persuading foreign enterprises to conduct business in Haiti. Achieving these objectives would be difficult in the best of circumstances.



Unfortunately, the circumstances likely will not be good. For the past year the Dominican Republic has been threatening to expel nearly 300,000 ethnic Haitians who have lived in the DR, many for their entire lives. The consequences for as poor and divided a nation as Haiti could be catastrophic.



Relations between the two countries have been troubled since their beginnings. In 1822 Haiti gained control of the colony of Santo Domingo, which shared Hispaniola Island and had declared its independence from Spain. However, in 1844 Santo Domingo won its independence from Haiti and became the Dominican Republic, occupying almost two‐​thirds of the island.



In 1934 DR dictator Rafael Trujillo, of partial Haitian heritage, stoked nationalism by targeting Haitians. In pursuing a policy we now call ethnic cleansing his forces killed as many as 25,000 Haitians in the Parsley Massacre. Ethnic Haitians later were routinely deported, “tracking cycles of economic and political difficulties,” wrote Michele Wucker of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Indeed, she witnessed mass deportations in 1991, including of ethnic Haitians with official citizenship documents, triggered by the Haitian government’s criticism of the DR’s treatment of migrant labor. More recently ethnic Haitians have found themselves criticized as part of a Haitian “invasion” and targeted by violent attacks. Yet over the years Haitians continued to move to the DR in search of better economic opportunities, especially in DR’s sugar industry.



The 1929 DR constitution, in effect until 2010, granted “birth right” citizenship, meaning anyone born in the DR, other than of a diplomat or someone “in transit,” interpreted as a short‐​term tourist, was a citizen. However, after a surge of desperate economic migrants following the earthquake, the DR revised its constitution to restrict citizenship to children of “residents.” In 2013 the country’s top court reinterpreted the 1929 constitution, treating undocumented migrants who came for work as being “in transit,” leaving hundreds of thousands of ethnic Haitians stateless, stripped of the only nationality which they ever possessed. Already a vulnerable and oft‐​mistreated community, Haitians were left “in a precarious state, unable to reclaim their most basic rights, and denied nationality documents necessary for basic transactions, including registering children at birth, enrolling in school and university, participating in the formal economy, and traveling within the country without risk of deportation,” reported Human Rights Watch.



The government responded by pushing what became the Naturalization Law, to allow those affected to legalize their residency or citizenship. However, warned HRW: “the law has been riddled with design and implementation flaws that have thwarted the re‐​nationalization process, and which continue to prevent individuals from exercising their right to a nationality.” Indeed, the law reflects the wariness of many in the DR to welcome Haitians. Warned Wucker, “the scheme is riddled with problems rooted in a decades‐​long struggle over the legal status of Haitians born in the Dominican Republic.”



In practice, noted the Open Society’s Justice Initiative, “the new law’s recognition of citizenship is based not on the fact of birth itself on Dominican territory, but rather on whether a birth was officially registered at the time.” Many were not, which results in an enormous problem in documentation, which is poor on both sides of the border. As a result, many ethnic Haitians in the DR are unable to prove that their parents were in the country legally. HRW reported on the difficulties facing DR citizens of Haitian ethnicity in negotiating the “regularization” process and handling the problems arising from the lack of proper documentation.



Moreover, HRW criticized the DR government for violating human rights even as people attempted to comply with the new law: “military and immigration authorities have harassed, detained, and expelled individuals seeking to enter the civil registries through the registration process as well.” Indeed, in at least one case public officials entered the “registration office to try and deport people as they were handing in their applications.”



Private violence supplements government efforts. Reported Arian Terrill, a DR aid worker, many of those who “voluntarily” depart for Haiti “are actually leaving under harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence by the security forces and Dominican street gangs acting as plainclothes proxies.” These erratic expulsion efforts soon could become systematic. In June the deadline for registering to reacquire citizenship expired and the DR government began preparing for large‐​scale deportations. Although the authorities later extended the deadline, by September the government had denied almost 80,000 of 289,000 regularization applications.



Officially, only the undocumented are supposed to be targeted. However, police have engaged in indiscriminate round‐​ups of ethnic Haitians, even those born in the DR. While detainees usually are released when their nationality papers are produced, in June HRW’s Celso Perez observed that the authorities “had become increasingly bold” in deporting suspected Haitians. Explained HRW, “deportations protocols are practically nonexistent and people are targeted on the basis of appearance, with little or no verification of their identity and nationality.” Thousands of ethnic Haitians have left or been forced to leave the DR. Hundreds of thousands more could be forced into Haiti, where most have never lived.



The DR knows it has an image problem and hired a PR company in the U.S. Of course, as an independent nation the DR is entitled to set naturalization policies. Sadly, Washington is in little position to criticize given America’s immigration travails. However, retroactively changing the rules at great cost to those concerned—ethnic Haitians, Haiti, and potentially neighboring countries—raises important moral and practical issues.



The deportations have become a political issue in Haiti. A number of presidential candidates, including Jean Bony Alexandre, Jean Bertin, Michelet Nestor, and Eric Jean Baptiste, have noted the potential adverse impact of mass repatriation. However, as in talking about the economy, no one in government or the campaign has an answer.



In fact, there is little that Haiti can do. The government could better assist ethnic Haitians seeking documentary support to regularize their status in the DR. In fact, the new president should emphasize improving the documentation process for all Haitians.



Haiti is preparing to ban select DR imports, but that will hurt its own citizens as much if not more than people in the Dominican Republic. Haiti has no military option, which would not be justified anyway. Yet the Haitian government cannot afford to support tens or hundreds of thousands of new entrants in an economy which doesn’t work and offers few opportunities.



Unsurprisingly, Haitians are appealing for assistance from their neighbors, the Organization of American States, and particularly the U.S. Nestor, for instance, predicted that if the DR forces many more ethnic Haitians into Haiti they will head for Florida: “they will not stay here but will become a big crisis for the U.S.” He may be right.



The number of Haitian boat people seeking refuge in America surged in the late 1970s under the “Baby Doc” dictatorship, and continued through the Cuban Mariel boatlift into the following decade. The number rose again in the early 1990s. However, few were granted asylum; tens of thousands were repatriated to Haiti.



Washington surely wants to avoid a repeat performance. Wucker proposed that the U.S. suspend military assistance to the DR “until the country shows respect for international human rights norms. The aid can be used more effectively to support civilian agencies and organizations.” In fact, there’s no obvious reason to underwrite the DR anyway. But given nationalistic sensitivities, sustained, quiet diplomacy might be more effective than public pressure in persuading the DR to adopt an approach which meets humanitarian necessities while moderating domestic political pressures. America, which already is home to some 850,000 ethnic Haitians, also could accept more refugees with nowhere to go.



Haiti is one of the Caribbean’s most sustained tragedies. The Haitian people deserve better political leadership, to be sure. Economic reform should top the new president’s agenda. Whoever they elect also will have to work with the DR to address the threat of mass expulsions. Haiti and the Dominican Republic should cooperate for the benefit of all.

"**Facebook will begin paying UK news publishers for some articles with the launch of Facebook News in January.**
The feature adds a dedicated news tab to the Facebook app, and has already launched in the United States.
Facebook said it will ""pay publishers for content that is not already on the platform"" and prioritise original reporting.
It comes after years of tension between Facebook and news publishers, who have often accused it of ""stealing"" content.
But hundreds of UK news outlets are already signed up to deals for the new feature, Facebook said.
They include publishers such as Hearst (Cosmopolitan, Elle, Esquire); the Guardian Media group; regional newspaper giant JPI Media; and the Midland News Association.
Facebook said it expects more publishers to join after the launch.
The news tab is only available on the mobile app - not in a web browser.
But Facebook said its launch in the US has shown it that 95% of the traffic to Facebook News publishers through that tab, are new readers who ""have not interacted with those news outlets in the past"".
That may sound promising for news outlets trying to increase their audience on Facebook, as news accounts for only about 4% of a user's main ""news feed"".
The deals struck between Facebook and publishers are not public, so it is not known how lucrative they could be for struggling news outlets.
But previous efforts to bring publishers into the fold have not always been a success.
Over the years, Facebook has encouraged news publishers to produce video for its platform and has changed the algorithms that govern its main user feed at the expense of news.
It has also tried to drive publishers to use its instant articles feature, which limits advertising and other features of the publisher's website.
Facebook has always insisted it doesn't want to make editorial decisions. It outsources fact-checking to organisations like Full Fact, and will outsource curation of this news service to an organisation called Upday, tasked with surfacing ""reliable"" and ""relevant"" news, whatever an on-the-day editor decides that means.
This initiative crosses a commercial rubicon. The company has always directed traffic back to publishers, but this is the first time that Facebook will pay news publishers for their work.
For more than a decade, the likes of Rupert Murdoch's News UK - as well as many local publishers - have argued that big tech companies carry their content without paying for it, and so act as leeches.
This move will begin to weaken that argument. Some of the publishers paid by Facebook will be struggling local titles, dependent for their future on the flattering interest of a Californian tech giant.
Yet, as recently as 2018, Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't pay publishers for content.
This new move is a loud gesture to British regulators, saying Facebook will invest in public goods such as journalism, provided the regulatory environment is favourable."
"**Instagram has launched new technology to recognise self-harm and suicide content on its app in the UK and Europe.**
The new tools can identify both images and words that break its rules on harmful posts.
It will make posts less visible in the app and, in extreme cases, remove it automatically.
Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it was an ""important step"" but the company wanted to do ""a lot more"".
Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri detailed the new system, which uses artificial intelligence, in a blog post on its website.
The technology already exists outside Europe on Facebook and Instagram.
Posts identified as harmful by the algorithm can be referred to human moderators, who choose whether to take further action - including directing the user to help organisations and informing emergency services.
But Instagram told the UK's Press Association news agency that human referral was not currently part of the new tools in the UK and Europe because of data privacy considerations linked to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The social media firm said implementing a referral process would be its next step.
""In the EU at the moment, we can only use that mix of sophisticated technology and human review element if a post is reported to us directly by a member of the community,"" Instagram's public policy director in Europe, Tara Hopkins, said.
She added that because in a small number of cases a judgement would be made by a human reviewer on whether to send additional resources to a user, this could be considered by regulators to be a ""mental health assessment"" and therefore a part of special category data, which receives greater protection under GDPR.
Facebook and Instagram have come under fire in recent years for a lack of regulation over suicide and self-harm material.
Fears about the impact of this content on young and vulnerable people been raised since the suicide of 14-year-old schoolgirl Molly Russell.
Molly's father, Ian, has previously said the ""pushy algorithms"" of social media ""helped kill my daughter"".
In September, social media companies including â¯Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, Twitter and Pinterest agreed to guidelines published by mental health charity Samaritans, in an effort to set industry standards on the issue.
""While we have seen a number of positive steps in the right direction in recent months, we know that there is still more work that needs to be done in order to tackle harmful online content,"" said Lydia Grace, Samaritans programme manager for online harm.
""We need regulation to ensure technology platforms take swift action to remove harmful content and that they can use the tools at their disposal to do this, while ensuring vulnerable users can access supportive content when they need it.
""Our Online Excellence Programme aims to develop a hub of excellence in suicide prevention and the online environment. As part of this, we recently launched our new guidelines for the technology industry to help sites and platforms to create safer online spaces by minimising access to potentially harmful content relating to self-harm and suicide, and maximising opportunities for support.""
But Instagram said it also wanted to be a place where users could admit they have considered self-harm or suicide.
""It's okay to admit that and we want there to be a space on Instagram and Facebook for that admission,"" Ms Hopkins added.
""We're told by experts that can help to destigmatise issues around suicide. It's a balancing act and we're trying to get to the right spot where we're able to provide that kind of platform in that space, while also keeping people safe from seeing this kind of content if they're vulnerable.""
This IS a step forward, but even one Instagram insider admitted to me that it represented only ""limited progress"".
So what's actually changed?
Well, before today in the EU, Instagram's complex algorithms could only hunt for images - now they can trawl for both images AND text.
That's really important because a seemingly innocent image can be accompanied by wording that breaches guidelines.
Once found those posts will be pushed out of the ""Explore"" feature, making them harder but not impossible to find.
It also means that the very worst posts will be automatically deleted, after 24 hours.
But the truth is even after these changes, users in the EU will not be protected from harmful content in quite the same way as those in the rest of the world.
The algorithms which analyse posts outside the EU automatically send suspect ones direct to human moderators for a final decision. Inside the EU that still won't happen.
That's because European Data Regulators are concerned about Instagram's ability to respect rules on privacy.
Privacy apart, Instagram globally is still struggling with a complex balancing act.
How does it allow support groups and those in recovery to post about self harm and suicide?
While at the same time protecting its most vulnerable users - many of them children."

The Dutch Government climate hypocrisy has come home to roost. Like our benevolent CoL they thought enshrining climate action in law was a good idea, but the Dutch have now found that politicians can be held accountable for failing to meet fantasy climate targets. 



The highest court in the Netherlands has upheld a ruling requiring the government to slash greenhouse gas emissions by **at least 25% of 1990 levels by the end of next year.**



The case was brought six years ago by the Urgenda environment group in a bid to force ministers to go well beyond EU targets.



However, the chances of the government reaching the target look slim.



By the end of 2018, emissions were down only 15% on 1990 levels.



Dutch environment researchers believe that levels could be cut by 23% by the end of 2020 but believe the reduction could be as low as 19%.



The government in The Hague presented its climate accord at the end of June, with plans for a 49% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and phasing out coal-fired power generation starting in 2020.



While there have been cuts in methane and nitrous oxide as well as other gases, levels of carbon dioxide emissions have changed little in the Netherlands since 1990.



Last month, under pressure to act over a nitrogen oxide pollution crisis, Dutch ministers **announced a cut in the daytime speed limit to 100km/h (62mph).** The Council of State forced the government to act in that case, by **declaring that rules for granting building and farming permits were in breach of EU law protecting nature.**



In its decision on Friday, the Supreme Court said it had based its ruling (in Dutch) on the UN climate convention and the **state’s legal obligation to protect the lives and well-being of Dutch citizens.**



“There is a great deal of consensus in the scientific and international community over the urgent need for a reduction in greenhouse gases by at least 25% by developed countries,” the court said.



While the EU target for a cut in carbon emissions is 20% of 1990 levels, Urgenda **took up the case on behalf of 886 Dutch citizens** , arguing that their government had a legal duty to prevent climate change and should seek a bigger reduction.



They first won their case in June 2015 but it was challenged by the government all the way to the Supreme Court.



This is a natural consequence of enshrining UN (or in their case EU) Conventions in national laws. Labour, Greens, NZ First and National are all guilty. They trip over themselves in their rush to be the first to sign UN treaties on anything at all.



With the current lot and what is quaintly known as ‘The Opposition’ all in the same camp on the climate crisis, we have fallen into the same hole as the Dutch. The only thing in our favour is that we have not settled on 2020 as a ‘year of delivery’ for emission cuts.



The Dutch have and it has now been legally enforced. For a country with a high agricultural output there is going to be a huge amount of economic pain.

"WASHINGTON  —   The whirlwind first week of Donald J. Trump’s presidency had all the bravura hallmarks of a Stephen K. Bannon production. It started with the   inauguration homily to “American carnage” in United States cities   by Mr. Bannon, followed a few days later by his “shut up” message to the news media. The week culminated with a blizzard of executive orders, mostly hatched by Mr. Bannon’s team and the White House policy adviser, Stephen Miller, aimed at disorienting the “enemy,” fulfilling campaign promises and distracting attention from Mr. Trump’s less than flawless debut. But the defining moment for Mr. Bannon came Saturday night in the form of an executive order giving the rumpled   agitator a full seat on the “principals committee” of the National Security Council  —   while downgrading the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence, who will now attend only when the council is considering issues in their direct areas of responsibilities. It is a startling elevation of a political adviser, to a status alongside the secretaries of state and defense, and over the president’s top military and intelligence advisers. In theory, the move put Mr. Bannon, a former Navy surface warfare officer, admiral’s aide, investment banker, Hollywood producer and Breitbart News firebrand, on the same level as his friend, Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, a former Pentagon intelligence chief who was Mr. Trump’s top adviser on national security issues before a series of missteps reduced his influence. But in terms of real influence, Mr. Bannon looms above almost everyone except the president’s    Jared Kushner, in the Trumpian pecking order, according to interviews with two dozen Trump insiders and current and former national security officials. The move involving Mr. Bannon, as well as the boost in status to the White House homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, and Mr. Trump’s relationships with cabinet appointees like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have essentially layered over Mr. Flynn. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bannon  —   whose Breitbart website was a magnet for white nationalists, antiglobalists and conspiracy theorists  —   always planned to participate in national security. Mr. Flynn welcomed his participation, Mr. Spicer said, but the general “led the reorganization of the N. S. C. ” in order to streamline an antiquated and bloated bureaucracy. Former White House officials in both parties were shocked by the move. “The last place you want to put somebody who worries about politics is in a room where they’re talking about national security,” said Leon E. Panetta, a former White House chief of staff, defense secretary and C. I. A. director in two Democratic administrations. “I’ve never seen that happen, and it shouldn’t happen. It’s not like he has broad experience in foreign policy and national security issues. He doesn’t. His primary role is to control or guide the president’s conscience based on his campaign promises. That’s not what the National Security Council is supposed to be about. ” That opinion was shared by President George W. Bush’s last chief of staff, Josh Bolten, who barred Karl Rove, Mr. Bush’s political adviser, from N. S. C. meetings. A president’s decisions made with those advisers, he told a conference audience in September, “involve life and death for the people in uniform” and should “not be tainted by any political decisions. ” Susan E. Rice, President Barack Obama’s last national security adviser, called the arrangement “stone cold crazy” in a tweet posted Sunday. Mr. Spicer said the language the Trump White House used in its N. S. C. executive order is, with the exception of Mr. Bannon’s position  —   which was created during the transition  —   almost identical in content to one the Bush administration drafted in 2001. And Mr. Obama’s top political operative, David Axelrod, sat in on some N. S. C. meetings, he added. There were key differences. Mr. Axelrod never served as a permanent member as Mr. Bannon will now, though he sat in on some critical meetings, especially as Mr. Obama debated strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. “It’s a profound shift,” Mr. Axelrod said. “I don’t know what his bona fides are to be the principal foreign policy adviser to the president. ” But Mr. Bannon’s elevation does not merely reflect his growing influence on national security. It is emblematic of Mr. Trump’s trust on a range of political and ideological issues. During the campaign, the sly and provocative Mr. Bannon played a paradoxical role  —   calming the easily agitated candidate during his frequent rough patches and egging him on when he felt Mr. Trump needed to fire up the white   base. The president respects Mr. Bannon because he is independently wealthy and therefore does not need the job, and both men ascribe to a    credo when put on the defensive, according to the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Mr. Bannon is a deft operator within the White House, and he has been praised by Republicans who view him skeptically as the most knowledgeable on policy around the president. But his stated preference for blowing things up  —   as opposed to putting them back together  —   may not translate to his new role. The hasty drafting of the immigration order, and its scattershot execution, brought a measure of Mr. Bannon’s chaotic and hyperaggressive political style to the more predictable administration of the federal government. Within hours of the edict, airport customs and border agents were detaining or blocking dozens of migrant families, some of whom had permanent resident status, until John F. Kelly, the new homeland security secretary, intervened. Mr. Kelly’s department had suggested green card holders be exempted from the order, but Mr. Bannon and Mr. Miller, a   on immigration, overruled him, according to two American officials. Mr. Priebus, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, indicated a softening of the stance, saying the order would not block “green card holders moving forward”  —   but said anyone seeking to enter the country from the listed countries would be subjected to tighter scrutiny. People close to Mr. Bannon said he is not accumulating power for power’s sake, but is instead helping to fill a staff leadership vacuum created, in part, by Mr. Flynn’s stumbling performance as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn still communicates with Mr. Trump frequently, and his staff has been assembling a version of the Presidential Daily Briefing for Mr. Trump, truncated but comprehensive, to be the president’s main source of national security information. During the campaign, he often had unfettered access to the candidate, who appreciated his brash style and contempt for Hillary Clinton, but during the transition, Mr. Flynn privately complained about having to share face time with others. Mr. Flynn “has the full confidence of the president and his team,” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said in an email. Emails and phone calls to Mr. Flynn and his top aide were not returned. A president who likes generals and abhors political correctness, Mr. Trump found in Mr. Flynn  —   who joined Trump backers in an   “lock her up!” chant during the campaign  —   perhaps the most politically incorrect general this side of his hero, Gen. George S. Patton. But Mr. Flynn, a lifelong Democrat sacked as head of the Pentagon’s intelligence arm after clashing with Obama administration officials in 2014, has gotten on the nerves of Mr. Trump and other administration officials because of his sometimes overbearing demeanor, and has further diminished his internal standing by presiding over a chaotic and opaque N. S. C. transition process that prioritized the hiring of military officials over civilian experts recommended to him by his own team. Mr. Flynn’s penchant for talking too much was on display on Friday in a meeting with Theresa May, the British prime minister, according to two people with direct knowledge of the events. When Mrs. May said that she understood wanting a dialogue with Mr. Putin but stressed the need to be careful, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Flynn when the two were scheduled to speak. Mr. Flynn replied it was Saturday  —   he had delayed it to fit in Mrs. May’s meeting for “protocol” as a United States ally, adding at length that Mr. Putin was impatient to chat. Mr. Trump, the person said, appeared irritated by the response. Still, the episode that did the most damage to the   relationship occurred in early December when Mr. Flynn’s son, also named Michael, unleashed a series of tweets pushing a discredited conspiracy theory that Clinton associates had run a child   ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. Mr. Trump told his staff to get rid of the younger Mr. Flynn, who had been hired by his father to help during the transition. But Mr. Trump did so reluctantly because of his loyalty during the campaign, when dozens of former military officials were dismissing Mr. Trump as too unstable to command. “I want him fired immediately,” Mr. Trump said in a muted rendition of his “You’re fired!” line in “The Apprentice,” according to two people with knowledge of the interaction. That has not stopped the general’s son from spouting off: On Saturday, at a time when Trump surrogates were pushing back on the idea that the executive order did not discriminate against any religion, the younger Mr. Flynn tweeted his approval of the policy, adding “#MuslimBan. ” The tweet was subsequently deleted his entire account disappeared later in the day. Still, the national security adviser has also continued to dabble in the kind of   behavior that concerns Mr. Trump’s allies, such as planning to attend an   “Deploraball” event at the time of the inauguration. He was urged to skip it by Trump allies, and ultimately agreed. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon still regard Mr. Flynn as an asset. “In the room and out of the room, Steve Bannon is General Flynn’s biggest defender,” said Kellyanne Conway, another top adviser to the president. But it is unclear when the maneuvers to reduce Mr. Flynn’s role began. Two Obama administration officials said Trump transition officials inquired about expanded national security roles for Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner at the earliest stages of the transition in November  —   before the younger Mr. Flynn became a liability  —   but after Mr. Flynn had begun to chafe on the nerves of his colleagues on the team. Mr. Flynn’s reputation has raised questions among some in the cabinet. Two weeks ago, both men held a meeting with Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump’s pick to run the State Department, Mr. Mattis and Mike Pompeo, now the C. I. A. director, to discuss coordination  —   Mr. Flynn was invited but did not attend. Part of the meeting was devoted to discussing concerns about Mr. Flynn, according to an official with knowledge of it."
"Brigid, another Atlantic storm, has hit Britain with heavy rain and gale-force winds, especially the already sodden west coast. The last few months have seen very wild weather, including 100mph winds during October’s St Jude’s storm, heavy rain and flooding, and one of the highest ever storm surges off the east coast. During these storm surges, large increases in sea level can last from a few hours to several days and span hundreds of square kilometres. Low atmospheric pressure allows the sea level to rise and, with the combination of gale force winds and the Earth’s rotation, water is forced towards the coastline.  The same physics apply whether they are caused by European weather systems (known as extra-tropical cyclones) or those in the tropics (hurricanes). Sea levels during a storm surge can rise by up to 8m in tropical areas, and by more than 3m in the North Sea. A combination of high tide, storm surge, wind and wave conditions can overtop or breach coastal defences, and it is often the storm surge that provides the additional power that drives waves to destructive levels. Worldwide, storm surges cause significant damage and loss of life. For example, in 1970 a devastating surge during the Bhola cyclone killed perhaps 300,000 people in Bangladesh, and in more recent years Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in the US have demonstrated their power. Coastal flooding around the UK can be life-threatening in addition to wreaking economic and environmental destruction. The worst in modern times was the North Sea floods of 1953. Huge waves breached flood defences, and coastal towns in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent were devastated as seawater rushed into the streets. In the Netherlands 1,800 people were killed while in England and Scotland the toll was 326, and over 600km2 were flooded. An inquiry found that along the 1,600 km of coast affected there were 1,200 breaches, at an estimated cost of £40-£50m – around £1 billion at today’s prices. Today, assets worth £150 billion and 4m people are at risk from coastal flooding in Britain. Analysis by the Environment Agency shows that some 500,000 homes are at risk of flooding in the Thames floodplain. The sequence of storms that battered Britain in December and January were some of the most severe we’ve seen in recent years. During the 5th and 6th December, measured sea levels in parts of the North Sea were the highest since the 1953 floods, and the Thames Barrier and Dutch flood barriers were closed for several tides. The largest storm surges struck the northeast coast of England, from Tyneside to Norfolk. Around 400 homes were flooded near Hull, and about 10,000 homes were evacuated in Norfolk and Suffolk. The fact the damage was so limited compared to the tragedy of 1953 is thanks to significant government investments in coastal defences, flood forecasting and sea level monitoring. The UK now has a sophisticated network of 42 coastal tide gauges for flood forecasting. Unfortunately there is little data from 1953 which makes a direct comparison difficult. Water levels at North Shields in December 2013 were 4m, 0.5m higher than in 1953, and the 2013 levels at the Hull Barrier were at 5.8m - the highest ever recorded there. Conversely, water levels in 2013 at Harwich and Sheerness in the Thames estuary were 4.1m, about 0.5m lower than in 1953. While a detailed scientific analysis of the event will take place over the coming months, the emerging picture is of a storm surge very similar to that of 1953 but which struck with greater force in the north of England, which is explained by the 2013 storm’s more northerly trajectory. Those who study Britain’s never-dull weather know that no two storms are identical, which is why complex statistical methods have been devised to gauge water levels around the coast. The coastal flood warning system, UK Coastal Monitoring and Forecasting (UKCMF), is a partnership of agencies monitoring wind, wave, tides and weather conditions. It combines computer models of storm surges and waves with real-time monitoring of coastal sea levels, all interpreted by a team of expert forecasters working around the clock. The numerical models are subject to continuous improvement as more powerful computers and new scientific insight becomes available. The whole system depends on accurate weather prediction, and it is because of better forecasting that it was possible to provide warnings for the December 2013 storm days in advance. The system also makes use of a technique called ensemble forecasting to quantify the inherent uncertainty in short-term weather prediction. The weather model is run several times, adjusting conditions and parameters to provide a range of outcomes that can then be used to judge the reliability of the forecast. Any increase in the frequency or severity of flooding would have a serious impact on the economy, society and ecosystems. In global studies based on tide gauge data, trends in extreme sea level have been shown to be controlled by changes to mean sea level rather than changes in storminess. For the UK there is no observational evidence of long-term trends in storm surges.  For the time being we should assume that changes to flood water levels will be governed by a rise in the mean sea level. And while the jury is out on changes to mid-latitude storminess in the future, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is unequivocal in its assessment of the gradual rise in mean sea level: the projected rise in globally averaged sea level for the year 2100 is in the range 0.29-0.82m, depending on greenhouse gas emissions. Even if there is no change to the storm climate of northern Europe, this rise in sea level is bound to increase the frequency of high water levels, and so the chances of flooding. Investment in weather prediction, flood warning mechanisms and coastal defences must not be neglected."

Are political considerations superseding scientific ones at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?



When confronted with an obviously broken weather station that was reading way too hot, they replaced the faulty sensor — but refused to adjust the bad readings it had already taken. And when dealing with “the pause” in global surface temperatures that is in its 19th year, the agency threw away satellite‐​sensed sea‐​surface temperatures, substituting questionable data that showed no pause.



The latest kerfuffle is local, not global, but happens to involve probably the most politically important weather station in the nation, the one at Washington’s Reagan National Airport.





Are political considerations superseding scientific ones at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?



I’ll take credit for this one. I casually noticed that the monthly average temperatures at National were departing from their 1981–2010 averages a couple of degrees relative to those at Dulles — in the warm direction.



Temperatures at National are almost always higher than those at Dulles, 19 miles away. That’s because of the well‐​known urban warming effect, as well as an elevation difference of 300 feet. But the weather systems that determine monthly average temperature are, in general, far too large for there to be any significant difference in the _departure from average_ at two stations as close together as Reagan and Dulles. Monthly data from recent decades bear this out — until, all at once, in January 2014 and every month thereafter, the departure from average at National was greater than that at Dulles.



The average monthly difference for January 2014 through July 2015 is 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit, which is huge when talking about things like record temperatures. For example, National’s all‐​time record last May was only 0.2 degrees above the previous record.



Earlier this month, I sent my findings to Jason Samenow, a terrific forecaster who runs the _Washington Post_ ’s weather blog, Capital Weather Gang. He and his crew verified what I found and wrote up their version, giving due credit and adding other evidence that something was very wrong at National. And, in remarkably quick action for a government agency, the National Weather Service swapped out the sensor within a week and found that the old one was reading 1.7 degrees too high. Close enough to 2.1, the observed difference.



But the National Weather Service told the Capital Weather Gang that there will be no corrections, despite the fact that the disparity suddenly began 19 months ago and varied little once it began. It said correcting for the error wouldn’t be “scientifically defensible.” Therefore, people can and will cite the May record as evidence for dreaded global warming with impunity. Only a few weather nerds will know the truth. Over a third of this year’s 37 90‐​degree‐​plus days, which gives us a remote chance of breaking the all time record, should also be eliminated, putting this summer rightly back into normal territory.



It is really politically unwise not to do a simple adjustment on these obviously‐​too‐​hot data. With all of the claims that federal science is being biased in service of the president’s global‐​warming agenda, the agency should bend over backwards to expunge erroneous record‐​high readings.



In July, by contrast, NOAA had no problem adjusting the global temperature history. In that case, the method they used _guaranteed_ that a growing warming trend would substitute for “the pause.” They reported in _Science_ that they had replaced the pause (which shows up in every analysis of satellite and weather balloon data) with a significant warming trend.



Normative science says a trend is “statistically significant” if there’s less than a 5 percent probability that it would happen by chance. NOAA claimed significance at the 10 percent level, something no graduate student could ever get away with. There were several other major problems with the paper. As Judy Curry, a noted climate scientist at Georgia Tech, wrote, “color me ‘unconvinced.’ ”



Unfortunately, following this with the kerfuffle over the Reagan temperature records is only going to “convince” even more people that our government is blowing hot air on global warming.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
  
—   
  
  
In this issue of _You Ought to Have a Look,_ we focus on what we think is an extremely important article, written by Richard Horton, long‐​time editor of _The Lancet_ —a British medical journal considered to be one of the world’s most prestigious.   
  
  
Horton addresses what is increasingly becoming recognized as the biggest problem in modern science: an incentive system that promotes style (i.e., “attention grabbing”) over substance. The headlong pursuit of headlines is leading not only to sloppy science, but selective science. The result is that the course of human knowledge is being perturbed, and not for the better.   
  
  
Horton’s comments are particularly salient as this week witnessed the retraction of another headline‐​grabbing paper in a prestigious journal.   
  
  
Here, we reproduce the bulk of Horton’s essay in which he addresses “the idea that something has gone fundamentally wrong with one of our greatest human creations”:   




The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.The Academy of Medical Sciences, Medical Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council have now put their reputational weight behind an investigation into these questionable research practices.The apparent endemicity of bad research behaviour is alarming. In their quest for telling a compelling story, scientists too often sculpt data to fit their preferred theory of the world. Or they retrofit hypotheses to fit their data.Journal editors deserve their fair share of criticism too. We aid and abet the worst behaviours. Our acquiescence to the impact factor fuels an unhealthy competition to win a place in a select few journals. Our love of “significance” pollutes the literature with many a statistical fairy‐​tale. We reject important confirmations. Journals are not the only miscreants. Universities are in a perpetual struggle for money and talent, endpoints that foster reductive metrics, such as high‐​impact publication. National assessment procedures, such as the Research Excellence Framework, incentivize bad practices. And individual scientists, including their most senior leaders, do little to alter a research culture that occasionally veers close to misconduct.   
  
  
Can bad scientific practices be fixed? Part of the problem is that no‐​one is incentivised to be right. Instead, scientists are incentivised to be productive and innovative. Would a Hippocratic Oath for science help? Certainly don’t add more layers of research redtape. Instead of changing incentives, perhaps one could remove incentives altogether. Or insist on replicability statements in grant applications and research papers. Or emphasise collaboration, not competition. Or insist on preregistration of protocols. Or reward better pre‐ and post‐​publication peer review. Or improve research training and mentorship. Or implement the recommendations from our Series on increasing research value, published last year.One of the most convincing proposals came from outside the biomedical community. Tony Weidberg is a Professor of Particle Physics at Oxford. Following several high‐​profile errors, the particle physics community now invests great effort into intensive checking and rechecking of data prior to publication. By filtering results through independent working groups, physicists are encouraged to criticise. Good criticism is rewarded. The goal is a reliable result, and the incentives for scientists are aligned around this goal. Weidberg worried we set the bar for results in biomedicine far too low. In particle physics, significance is set at 5 sigma—a _p_ value of 3 × 10–7 or 1 in 3.5 million (if the result is not true, this is the probability that the data would have been as extreme as they are). The conclusion of the symposium was that something must be done. Indeed, all seemed to agree that it was within our power to do that something. But as to precisely what to do or how to do it, there were no firm answers. Those who have the power to act seem to think somebody else should act first. And every positive action (eg, funding well‐​powered replications) has a counterargument (science will become less creative). The good news is that science is beginning to take some of its worst failings very seriously. The bad news is that nobody is ready to take the first step to clean up the system.



This issue is especially near and dear to our hearts at the Center for the Study of Science. For those interested in more on this topic (and we hope that is most of you), please see our recent Working Paper and various other writings and presentations.   
  
  
This is an extremely important issue that is far from receiving the level of attention that it deserves.

Never have the U.S. and Chinese economies been more interdependent than they are today. Never has the value of the bilateral trade and investment relationship been greater. Never has the precarious state of the global economy required comity between the United States and China more than it does now. Yet, with Donald J. Trump ascending to power on a platform of nationalism and protectionism, never have the stars been so perfectly aligned for the relationship to descend into a devastating trade war.



Bilateral trade frictions are nothing new. Over the years they ebbed and flowed, but the tensions were managed well enough to avoid any major meltdowns. For the past eight years, the U.S.-China relationship has been under increasing duress, taxing patience and requiring great restraint from Washington and Beijing. Both governments imposed trade restrictions, but they did so in manners plausibly consistent with the prevailing rules of international trade.



The election of the impetuous Trump, who sees trade as a zero‐​sum competition between countries that either win or lose, renders restraint temperamentally improbable and strategically illogical. Because the United States runs a large bilateral trade deficit with China, President Trump views Beijing as the more dependent party in the relationship, with more to lose from a trade war. Perceiving the consequences of a trade war as relatively benign for the United States makes that course of action a realistic option for Trump. This thinking amounts to a major departure from over 80 years of U.S. trade policy orthodoxy.



Trump’s dangerous economic views didn’t just appear out of the blue. Receptivity in the United States to a more strident, protectionist, “America First” approach to trade relations — especially with respect to China — has been growing in recent years. Prominent are perceptions that unfair Chinese economic policies — and feckless U.S. responses to those policies — were the proximate cause of manufacturing jobs losses over the years, especially among those whose livelihoods were most affected. Belief is widespread that China “gamed the system” to become stronger at America’s expense and now challenges the United States for global strategic and economic preeminence. Today, it is more common than ever before to hear regret over the U.S. decision to engage China economically and allow her into the global trading system with too few strings attached.



Although Trump’s rise renders a trade war dangerously likely, the state of the bilateral economic relationship is the culmination of a long, inexorable progression to the edge of the abyss.



 **The Long March toward Trade War**  
In the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, the George H. W. Bush administration decided it would continue the U.S. policy of engagement with China. At that time, bilateral trade amounted to a mere $17.6 billion, and direct, cross‐​border investment was trivial. But the potential economic benefits of broader trade and investment ties were obvious, and continued engagement — it was argued — would be more likely to spur economic and political liberalization in China than would policies designed to punish and isolate her. Besides, it was reasoned that sanctions would hurt the Chinese people more than the Chinese government, and cede business opportunities to European companies.



So for the next 20 years, U.S. policy toward China was premised on the idea that the economic relationship had great promise and was worth cultivating and nurturing, regardless of important differences between Washington and Beijing over matters such as human rights and geopolitics. Trade and economics were sacrosanct and would be prioritized, and the more incendiary matters de‐​emphasized.



In the first half of this period, the Chinese central and provincial governments implemented all sorts of market reforms to unshackle their economy and to meet the requirements of membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). By the time China joined the WTO, in 2001, twoway trade had increased to $121.3 billion and direct investment was $12 billion. By 2008 the value of bilateral trade reached $409 billion and investment hit $56 billion.



China had evolved from an agrarian economy to a basic manufacturing economy to a full‐​fledged industrial powerhouse in the course of about 20 years. The increase in trade and investment lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty and benefitted workers, businesses, and consumers on both sides of the Pacific. But the process generated plenty of friction with U.S. industries along the way.



U.S. economic policy toward China was essentially conducted as a balancing of two broad sets of interests. On one side were import‐​competing U.S. industries and organized labor, which sought to impede Chinese exporters’ penetration of the U.S. market. They had opposed granting China “Normal Trade Relations” status over the years and had opposed China’s bid to join the World Trade Organization. They demanded tariffs, quotas, and other policies to redress their concerns — both real and imagined — about objectionable Chinese practices, such as dumping, subsidization, currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, and labor and environmental abuses.



On the other side were U.S. multinational companies and exporters, which favored a more cautious and less antagonistic approach. They preferred the idea of accommodating China as it fumbled its way forward in the process of joining and integrating with the global economy. These groups counselled against policies and actions that could jeopardize U.S. access to the promising Chinese market. Their advocacy was buttressed by the research of economists, academics, and think‐​tank scholars, who argued that remaining open to trade with China also served the interests of U.S. import‐​using industries and consumers, especially lower‐​income households.



U.S. policy generally split the difference between these perspectives: China would be welcomed into the community of nations, and its companies and products would be treated on par with all other nations. But U.S. industries would have recourse to trade remedy laws and special China‐​specific safeguards, and the U.S. government would be able to bring formal complaints about Chinese policies to the WTO. The Strategic Economic Dialogue (created during the George W. Bush administration and renamed the Strategic _and_ Economic Dialogue in the Obama administration) and other high‐​level, bilateral channels of communication were established to discuss and resolve issues that would inevitably arise, as the trading relationship evolved. By and large, this formula worked reasonably well to ensure that frictions were managed effectively and never ignited an inferno.



But after 20 years, things suddenly changed in 2009. The U.S. economy was rocked by financial crisis and a deep recession. The financial meltdown, followed by economic contraction, slow recovery, persistent high unemployment, the specter of millions of more job losses, and out‐​of‐​control government debt shook the U.S. public’s confidence. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy was continuing its near‐​double‐​digit annualized rate of growth, surpassing the United States as the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter, and edging closer to becoming the world’s largest economy. The Chinese government had officially become the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt, giving it special leverage over U.S. policymakers in the minds of many commentators.



Perceptions that the United States and China were trading places emboldened Chinese leaders to speak out where they had been publicly silent before — admonishing U.S. policymakers for fiscal imprudence and digging in their heels over issues where they might have relented in the past. The tenor of the public rhetoric became more strident. Historically minor tiffs became flashpoints, and Americans’ angst became more palpable. The situation prompted some deep soul‐​searching in the United States.



Many questioned whether America’s best days were behind her. Many wondered where the United States had gone wrong and what China had done right. Some policymakers and pundits, like Tom Friedman of the _New York Times_ , marveled at what the Chinese were able to accomplish with their “enlightened autocracy” and suggested that the United States should emulate China’s allegedly successful industrial policies. Others concluded that U.S. policy had been too permissive of China’s rise, prompting calls for greater trade enforcement.



Meanwhile, the U.S. business community in China, which has long counseled against precipitous actions that could frustrate their plans in the Chinese market, began to register concerns and air grievances about proliferating Chinese protectionism. U.S. companies issued warnings that China’s market liberalization — evident through the early part of the last decade — had stopped and was beginning to reverse. An annual white paper published by the American Chamber of Commerce in China identified rising protectionism, lack of regulatory transparency, inconsistent enforcement, and favoritism toward local firms as big and growing problems in 2009. A separate report from the American Chamber of Commerce exposed “a web of industrial policies,” as well as Chinese government plans to build national champions by “borrowing” Western technology.



Publication of those reports and reaction to them inspired a change in sentiment within the U.S. multinational community. Perceptions of threats to U.S. business interests increased, while perceptions of realistic opportunities diminished. Pessimism rose, optimism sunk, and enthusiasm softened among U.S. multinationals for making the case for an accommodating, tolerant U.S. policy. This produced a shift in the weighting of interests influencing U.S. policy toward China in favor of those interests seeking a more combative approach, including more rigorous enforcement and more trade restrictions. It also meant that bilateral trade matters no longer would be considered separate and apart from the broader geopolitical picture. Trade disputes now would be magnified by our geopolitical differences.



 **Obama Flexes Some Muscle**  
U.S. trade policy toward China during the eight years of the Obama administration reflected this new tone. Early on, President Obama authorized tariffs on Chinese tires under a special safeguard provision of U.S. law, which President Bush had balked at invoking on three previous occasions. That action prompted a WTO challenge from China (which it lost), as well as a slew of Chinese “retaliatory” trade remedy actions against U.S. products, including chicken and automobiles. (Retaliatory is in quotes because the measures were ostensibly imposed in compliance with WTO‐​permitted domestic trade remedy laws, but the haste with which those measures were imposed, and the ultimate finding by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body that China’s actions against U.S. chicken ran afoul of its WTO obligations suggest there may have been a tit‐​for‐​tat motive at play.)



The U.S. countervailing duty law (a law to redress the effects of foreign government subsidization of exports), considered inapplicable to “nonmarket” economies by previous administrations, was suddenly opened up to U.S. industries, which brought a record number of unfair trade cases against China during the Obama presidency. Obama’s Office of the U.S. Trade Representative also increased by five‐​fold — relative to the Bush administration — the number of U.S. complaints against China in the WTO. It more closely scrutinized prospective Chinese investments in the United States, blocking a proposed Chinese acquisition of some windfarms in Oregon and ordering a Chinese technology company to divest itself of a U.S. firm it had recently purchased. Concerns over cyberespionage put Chinese technology companies in the crosshairs of the Obama administration and Congress, which took the extraordinary measure of barring purchases and use of Chinese telecommunications products by U.S. government agencies. The gloves had come off.



Meanwhile, Beijing didn’t sit passively. As the Obama administration ramped up enforcement, the Chinese government (under President Hu and then President Xi) enacted a slew of new laws governing — among other things — foreign investment, competition policy, and cybersecurity. Many of these laws were quickly perceived by U.S. businesses as discriminatory. Reports of U.S. companies being harassed, subjected to onerous documentation requirements, denied business opportunities, and compelled to turn over trade secrets and encryption keys became commonplace.



Ongoing negotiations between the two governments over a prospective bilateral investment treaty, and talks among several governments to liberalize trade in environmental goods and government procurement were among the handful of initiatives offering the prospect of a positive turn in the relationship. But they all faltered — again and again — and the pessimism within the American multinational community about China’s political situation and the direction of the business climate in China was reinforced.



As 2016 began the typical election‐​year anti‐​trade campaign rhetoric was more acerbic than usual. Chinese trade policies were under attack from both ends and across the political spectrum. Publication of “The China Shock,” a bombshell of an academic article, which concluded that the adjustment costs for workers who had been most exposed to competition from Chinese imports in the early 2000s had been much greater than previously assumed, put proChina trade advocates on their heels and galvanized public opinion behind calls for a more combative approach to China’s trade policies.



In 2016 alone, the Obama administration filed four new complaints against China in the WTO, and the Commerce Department initiated (or imposed punitive duties in) 24 new antidumping and countervailing cases against Chinese exporters. But, perhaps the most provocative action of all was an inaction — the failure of the United States to grant China “market economy” status, which was something it was to have done by no later than 15 years after China’s accession to the WTO. That date came and went on December 11, 2016, without any changes in status or policy. On December 12 China initiated WTO dispute proceedings over this issue, which is sure to be a major source of contention and ill will going forward.



 **At the Cliff’s Edge**  
The year 2016 began with the stock of cross‐​border, bilateral investment at $90 billion and trade flows having just reached $600 billion per year. It ended with the election of a president who seems not to understand what that level of interdependence means and who is intent on asserting U.S. leverage to change the nature of the economic relationship with China. Many of the once‐​vocal, pro‐​trade interests in Washington have fallen silent, heeding perceptions that it is no longer politically correct to speak of the virtues of U.S.-China trade without paying homage to its alleged U.S. victims. Fear of political retribution for taking positions contrary to the president’s has also quelled public debate. It’s generally considered “not good for business” to have the company name (or stock ticker symbol) featured in one of the president’s menacing tweets.



Trump appears to be undeterred and unconcerned about the possibility of a trade war — or worse — with China. He seems to have a mandate to do whatever he wants — “to blow things up,” as it was succinctly summarized at a recent conference. The president has been most vocal about China’s alleged currency manipulation, which has inspired his call for a 45 percent tariff across‐​the‐​board on imports from China. Of course, currency manipulation is an outdated complaint. The Chinese have not intervened in currency markets to suppress the value of the yuan for over a decade and, in recent years, have been struggling to prop up its value in the face of rampant capital flight.



There are other sources of tension in the relationship that could provoke a descent into the abyss. Discrimination against U.S. businesses in China, favoritism toward stateowned enterprises, massive subsidization of industries, intellectual property theft, cyberespionage, deeper U.S. scrutiny of Chinese acquisitions in the United States, U.S. discrimination against Chinese telecommunications companies, and U.S. refusal to treat China as a market economy all remain prominent points of contention in the relationship.



As President Trump and his advisers point to China’s large bilateral trade surplus as evidence of unfair trading practices and promise to take remedial actions, the Chinese government is threatening to shift its purchases of aircraft from Boeing to Airbus, and agricultural products from the United States to Australia and Canada. Surely, the Chinese are contemplating other strategic targets for retaliation — companies and industries that would be likely to exert political pressure on Congress to do something to rein in the president.



But what is particularly troubling is that, from a domestic Chinese political perspective, President Xi might actually welcome a trade war with the United States. With 6.5 percent economic growth (the slowest in 25 years), popular discontent with stalling incomes, corruption, and environmental degradation, and tightening media and internet restrictions, Xi might benefit politically from the distraction. The party and the Chinese people might rally to Xi’s side, as he blames U.S. trade measures for stagnation and the economic hardships that will arise. Tapping into China’s vast reservoir of nationalistic pride and purpose would provide China with the staying power to endure a long, drawn out trade war with the United States — especially as the U.S. government continues to alienate friends and make enemies in the region.



Ironically, the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, which is frequently and mistakenly characterized as an anti‐​China initiative, offers more incentive for China to adhere to the rules of global trade than does any other tool at the disposal of U.S. policymakers. As a living agreement, the TPP is open to new members that are able to meet its relatively high standards. Many countries beyond the original 12 signatories were lining up to join, undertaking all sorts of domestic reforms to qualify for membership, motivated in part by the fear of being left on the outside looking in, as investment and supply chains developed around the new agreement. China was definitely interested in joining the TPP in due course, probably in conjunction with an eventual name change to something like the “Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.” But the leverage the United States would have had to finally resolve some of the long‐​standing and emerging frictions with China was rejected with President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the TPP during his first week in office.



For the moment, the prevailing rules of international trade remain intact and continue to ensure that the worst kinds of infractions — unilateral resort to protectionist measures — remain frowned upon and discouraged. Continuing to pursue resolution of trade disputes through the WTO and relying on the system’s “legal protectionist remedies” would reduce the likelihood of a trade war erupting. But with a president who speaks of winning such wars and a Chinese government that promises not to back down, a trade war seems only a matter of time.



Like a slow‐​motion train wreck, we can see what’s coming but are powerless to stop it. No longer do facts matter. No longer is there an appetite for cautious deliberation. No longer can we assume cooler heads will prevail. The guardrails and emergency brakes that prevented the relationship from running off the tracks in the past have fallen into disrepair. Where else to go but into the abyss?

"Satellite images have revealed 11 previously unknown emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica, boosting the number of known colonies of the imperilled birds by 20%. The discoveries were made by spotting the distinctive red-brown guano patches the birds leave on the ice. The finds were made possible by higher-resolution images from a new satellite, as previous scans were unable to pick up smaller colonies. Two of the colonies were a particular surprise. They were found far from the coast, living on sea ice that is anchored to grounded icebergs, a location never seen before. The new colonies are thought to number a few hundred penguins each, which is smaller than average, so the discoveries increase the total population of emperor penguins by a smaller proportion of about 5-10%. Emperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, rather than land, making them especially vulnerable to the climate crisis. All the new colonies are in areas that are at risk and researchers say these will be the “canaries in the coal mine” as global heating increasingly affects Antarctica. “The [new colonies] are an exciting discovery,” said Peter Fretwell, at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who led the research. “Whilst this is good news, the colonies are small and so only take the overall population count up to just over half a million penguins.” Philip Trathan, also at BAS, said: “The new breeding sites are all in locations where recent model projections suggest emperor penguins will decline. These birds are therefore probably the canaries in the coalmine – we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.” Fretwell said one of the colonies was 112 miles (180km) from the Antarctic continent: “Many of the penguin scientists we have talked to were disbelieving, as normally you expect them to be at the coast.” Emperor penguins need stable sea ice, usually attached to land, for nine months of the year to breed successfully. There were only 30 colonies known a decade ago, as they are usually in remote and inaccessible locations, where temperatures can fall as low as -50C in winter. But then Landsat satellite images began to be used. These have a resolution of 30 metres, which is enough to spot the larger colonies. The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in June 2015 and has a resolution of 10 metres. This enabled a search for the smaller penguin colonies, as reported by the BAS scientists in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation. Emperor penguins were expected to be present at fairly regular intervals around the coast of Antarctica, so the search was targeted in areas where none were known. “In every gap where we thought there might be a colony, we found one,” said Fretwell. Three of the 11 colonies found had been suspected following ship or aeroplane sightings of penguins in the 1960s and 1980s, but Sentinel-2 images confirmed their presence. There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. “There may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,” said Fretwell. The next step is to direct satellites with very high, 30cm-resolution cameras over the colonies to enable the penguins to be counted. “It is dark at the moment in Antarctica, so we can’t count them yet,” said Fretwell. “The sun will come up either later this month or next month in most of these locations, and then we will start.” Previous studies have estimated that 90% of known colonies will be lost by the end of the century if no further action is taken to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global heating. Even in the best case scenario, where deep and fast cuts to carbon emissions limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5C, the population of emperor penguins is projected to fall by 30%. • This article was amended on 5 August 2020. An earlier version misnamed Peter Fretwell as “Thretwell” on subsequent mentions of his name."

Guest essay by David Archibald –

They used to be against us, but now Hollywood is on the side of the angels in mocking global warming
The science of climate has had intense scrutiny for the last ten years and more with the result that we now know why the planet warmed in the second half of the 20th century and why it is going to cool instead from here. Yet the meme of global warming continues, seemingly unstoppable and immune to facts.
Politically, global warming peaked out at COP 15 in Copenhagen in December 2009 when heads of state of countries accounting for the bulk of the world’s GDP were in attendance. They don’t bother to attend now – it is mainly time-servers who turn up. But global warming’s momentum is still resulting in destructive and pointless legislation and regulation in the English-speaking parts of the planet.
Commercial storytelling in the form of movies has reinforced the global warming meme. As a plot device, global warming itself isn’t scary enough as the result of global warming would simply be warmer rain. So, for the movie world, global warming was somehow the cause of intense cooling. This was the plot device of the film The Day After Tomorrow in which the protagonist battles wolves in a frozen New York.
A movie just out, Kingsmen: The Secret Service, indicates that the cultural tipping point has been reached. It is now safe and commercially profitable for moviemakers
to mock belief in global warming. The plot is that an evil billionaire by the name of Richard Valentine believes that humans, who cause global warming, are a virus killing the planet. To stop global warming, he sets out to kill a large proportion of humanity. His evil plan, which is much the same as the dreams of the green movement, is thwarted by people who dress well and have impeccable manners.
Instead of working against truth and beauty, Hollywood is now on the side of the justly righteous. The next stage will be when, to indicate a character’s gullibility, insanity or mental instability, it is mentioned that he once believed in global warming. Of course Hollywood does not have any moral scruples and mocking global warming is only a business decision. But mocking something is the first stage of destroying it and we should be duly thankful.

His most recent book is Twilight of Abundance (Regnery, 2014).

"**Twitter has hidden some of Donald Trump's first tweets the day after a US election which remains undecided.**
In one, the President wrote his vote advantage in key Democrat-run states had ""started to magically disappear"", and in another that 500,000 votes in key states were at risk.
The messages are now hidden behind warnings that say the claims are disputed and might be misleading.
The moves also limit users' ability to like and reply to the posts.
Twitter had earlier taken similar action over a post in which Trump said for the first time that his opponents ""are trying to steal the election"".
Facebook has added fact-check boxes to some of the messages on Mr Trump's profile on its platform, clarifying that final results might take longer than normal - but did not restrict engagement.
One of the tweets said: ""Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key states, in almost all instances Democrat run and controlled.
""Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE.""
He followed that with: ""They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear - ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!""
Twitter took just over half an hour to react on each occasion.
Mr Biden's first tweet of the day said ""we won't rest until everyone's vote is counted"".
Twitter has not acted on any of Mr Biden's tweets.
But it has hidden a post by the chair of Wisconsin's Democratic Party Ben Wikler who posted that ""Joe Biden just won Wisconsin"".
On Tuesday, the Trump campaign claimed that ""Silicon Valley continues its campaign to censor and silence the president"".
Facebook has also been automatically adding labels to all recent posts on Trump and Joe Biden's accounts.
They inform readers that votes are still being counted and that the winner of the US presidential election has not been projected.
Facebook has begun placing notifications at the top of the timelines for all US users, explaining that the election had not yet been decided.
""Once President Trump began making premature claims of victory, we started running notifications on Facebook and Instagram that votes are still being counted and a winner is not projected,"" it said.
Twitter said it had labelled Mr Trump's tweet about the election being ""stolen"" because it violated the firm's civic integrity policy.
But the network appears to be allowing some claims of victory, despite warning that it would not.
An earlier tweet from Mr Trump that he had enjoyed ""a big win!"" has been left untouched, as has a carefully-worded tweet from Mr Biden that said ""we believe we are on track to win this election"".
**By Olga Robinson, disinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring**
It's been a busy 24 hours on social media. There's been numerous unsubstantiated or false claims about election fraud, voter intimidation and conspiracy theories about attempts to steal the election doing the rounds.
And we are likely to see more misinformation like this in the days to come.
The delay in announcing the final result means a lot for time for misleading claims to flourish online.
Conspiratorial claims about rigged elections can spread like wildfire, in particular if they are amplified by politicians and online influencers.
Premature claims of victory - like the one President Trump made while votes are being counted - can further fuel misinformation and potentially impact how people perceive the final result.
This is exactly what some experts have been concerned about: that viral misinformation about voter fraud and ""rigged"" elections might have the potential to undermine people's trust in democratic process for years to come.
The clampdown comes after months of preparation for a disputed election.
The social media firms have overhauled their policies to deal with false claims of victory and other misinformation about the vote.
Both Twitter and Facebook said they had suspended a range of recently created accounts.
Twitter said the accounts it targeted had violated its spam and manipulation policies - particularly those that seek to artificially influence online conversations.
YouTube also shut down live-streamed fake election results which were being broadcast via several accounts on its platform.
The Election Integrity Partnership said that one of them had come up as a top search result within YouTube when users searched election information in key swing states.
The research group estimated that more than 26,000 people had viewed the fake results.
YouTube said it that ""after careful review"" it was removing livestreams that broke its rules.
In a separate incident of apparent election interference, the FBI has said it is investigating a series of robocalls.
According to the Washington Post, an estimated 10 million automated calls were made over recent days telling people to ""stay safe and stay home"".
They did not specifically mention voting, and their origin remains unknown."
"WASHINGTON  —   In his first, rocky week as President Trump’s press secretary, Sean M. Spicer was scolded by his boss, pilloried as a liar, hammered by journalists, mocked by Stephen Colbert, taunted by the   ice cream brand Dippin’ Dots and held up as the poster child for an administration that can play fast and loose with the facts. No wonder he was looking for his flak jacket. “Is this bulletproof?” Mr. Spicer asked one afternoon last week, peering into a closet in his sparse West Wing office as he hunted for the combat vest that, by cheeky tradition, is passed down from one presidential spokesman to the next. Until recently, Mr. Spicer was the public voice and chief strategist of the Republican National Committee, the epitome of establishment Washington. Now he is the face of an administration bent on upending the status quo and waging war on the news media, surprising colleagues here with how comfortably he has embraced Mr. Trump’s ire toward the press. The day after the inauguration, he marched into the White House briefing room on Mr. Trump’s orders and lambasted stunned reporters as “dishonest” while claiming, against available evidence, that the inauguration had been the most attended in history. (He later said his count included viewers watching online.) The ironic hashtag #spicerfacts was soon trending online. Days later, Mr. Spicer defended Mr. Trump’s false claims about rampant voter fraud, referring to studies that do not back up the assertion and saying the president “believes what he believes. ” On Thursday, he had to walk back his suggestion that Mr. Trump would impose a major tax on Mexican imports, jolting global markets. The reaction has been harsh. “There’s no learning curve on a moral compass,” said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who has advised Senator John McCain of Arizona and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio. “You don’t need a learning curve to tell the truth from fiction. ” If he’s bothered by the blowback, Mr. Spicer, 45, who had long dreamed of standing behind the White House lectern, is not showing it. “We have a free press  —   I get it,” Mr. Spicer said last week during an interview in his office, where a giant television broadcasts four   stations at once. “But the press doesn’t like it when you call out their errors the same way they call out everyone else’s. ” Statements from the White House, Mr. Spicer argued, should be given the same leeway afforded a news organization. “I don’t know how many corrections are in The New York Times any given day,” Mr. Spicer said. “But I don’t wake up every day and go, ‘O. K. you’re all liars. ’” Over a   conversation, Mr. Spicer  —   who ate   ice cream from a cup branded with the presidential seal  —   was by turns defensive and relaxed, and still excited by the novelty of working in the West Wing. Grabbing a history book, he flipped to a page with a list of previous press aides. “Diane Sawyer had that office!” he said, proudly. A framed photograph of himself at the White House lectern, taken days earlier, was displayed on a mantel. A note from Barack Obama’s press secretary, Josh Earnest, was nearby. “It was very, ‘What an amazing honor it is,’” Mr. Spicer said of the letter. Asked if he was bothered by Mr. Trump’s unpredictable Twitter posts, Mr. Spicer shrugged. “You get the ability to wake up and have an issue or an idea become front and center in a second,” he said. “That’s a huge thing. ” The president “drives the news,” Mr. Spicer said. “I help provide updates. ” A stocky Navy reservist who grew up in   Rhode Island, Mr. Spicer prides himself on persistence. He attended a prestigious Catholic high school on a scholarship, sending away for brochures for the school without his parents’ knowledge. After graduating from Connecticut College, he bounced around working on campaigns, briefly living in an R. V. without heat or hot water. Years ago, a line drive at a softball game smacked into Mr. Spicer’s jaw, leaving his mouth wired shut for weeks. “Be careful,” his teammate told doctors on the way to the hospital. “He talks for a living. ” He climbed his way up the Washington ladder, representing Republicans in Congress before landing in the office of the United States trade representative in the George W. Bush administration. His jaw has since recovered: The Washington Post reported that Mr. Spicer chews, and swallows whole, more than 20 pieces of Orbitz cinnamon gum a day. He is still finding his place in Mr. Trump’s   inner circle. A Washington insider among political outsiders, Mr. Spicer joined the Trump campaign in August, against the advice of friends who warned against tying himself to an unpredictable candidate. On the eve of the election, Mr. Spicer privately told several journalists that Mr. Trump’s odds of victory were slim. Expressing those misgivings may have been a move to soften the blow to the party in case of a Trump defeat, but was the sort of disloyalty that is anathema in Trump World. “Sometimes he was a little less enthusiastic about our direction than other times,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist. “But he hung in there. ” Mr. Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, rarely speaks to reporters on the record. But he reached out to a reporter unprompted to praise Mr. Spicer after learning of this profile, a sign of the Trump White House’s support for Mr. Spicer after a tumultuous first week. Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Spicer’s initial fiery appearance in the White House briefing room, urging him to wear a sharper suit and appear more confident, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations. (“He was disappointed with how the overall news cycle was going,” Mr. Spicer said in the interview, declining to elaborate.) But Mr. Trump was pleased with Mr. Spicer’s   briefing on Monday, calling Mr. Spicer a “superstar. ” “He’s a fighter,” Mr. Bannon said in a telephone interview, during which he also urged the news media to “keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. ” “Sean Spicer is much too polite to the media,” Mr. Bannon added. “I’m the guy who wanted them out of the building. ” (He was referring to a proposal, scrapped for now, to move the White House briefing room from its current West Wing home.) Mr. Spicer has also heard from supporters who say his   of the news media was long overdue. “Accountability goes both ways,” said former Representative Mike Pappas, a New Jersey Republican who hired Mr. Spicer in the 1990s, adding that Mr. Spicer’s complaints were  . “There’s a clear bias against people like me, and people like him, and people like the man he works for,” Mr. Pappas said. “You have a right to your bias, but don’t report it as factual. ” Clifford Hobbins, Mr. Spicer’s high school history teacher, dismissed questions about his former student’s integrity. “He is as honest as the day is long,” said Mr. Hobbins, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. “I’ve been very proud of the way he handled himself. ” Mr. Spicer, who was barely known outside Washington, is still adjusting to national fame. More than five million people tuned in for his first formal press briefing last week, with cable news channels and some broadcast networks taking the proceedings live. The discovery that he had posted on Twitter multiple times about his disdain for Dippin’ Dots, and its slogan, “The Ice Cream of the Future,” prompted the company to send him an open letter that went viral. Mr. Spicer sounded exasperated when the subject came up. ”It’s a joke,” he said. “How long can they be ‘the ice cream of the future’? You can’t actually be the future forever. ” Finishing his ice cream  —   which was not    —   Mr. Spicer shrugged. “You’re not here to be someone’s buddy. You’re here to enact the president’s agenda,” he said of his job. “And if you think it’s going to be anything bad, then this isn’t the job for you. ” Still, when asked about his first weekend, when he blasted the news media on instructions from an aggrieved boss, Mr. Spicer allowed himself a grimace. “That wasn’t the Saturday I thought I was waking up to,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Paris thousands, if not tens of thousands, of climate delegates, activists, government officials are now meeting for the 21st time with the aim of hammering out a binding climate treaty to “rescue the planet”.
Not only has the endless string of conferences been getting on the nerves of informed skeptics, but also on those of some major media outlets, like Spiegel here.
Spiegel journalist, doomsday believer, Christoph Seidler writes he has totally low expectations over the outcome of COP21 and what may be agreed on. He writes:
The climate summit in Paris is not going to rescue the planet. There is not going to be a treaty that will solve the problem of global warming.”
In short nothing substantial is going to happen – no matter how historic some may proclaim the outcome to be in the end. The travelling circus will continue for years and years. Seidler is sure of it, and predicts of COP21:
In the end the news of a big success will not come to pass. There is not going to be a treaty on the table that is going to save the planet. […] At most there will be a small step down a long road.”

google_ad_height = 200;

Seidler does believe the planet is on the way to catastrophe, and that urgent action needs to be taken, but he is not optimistic anything is going to happen in Paris. On latter point many of us agree.
Perhaps the strategy of taking of small steps is intentional and is the way out of the madness. Move slowly and eventually the problem will go away before any real painful changes ever get enacted. By 2017 we will be feeling the full impact of the expected La Nina, and the embarrassing temperature plateau will have persisted over 20 years. Moreover the US may have a president who may have a far less sympathetic stance on the issue. The timeframe for reaching the theoretical 2°C target will also become even more absurd. Goalposts will be moved yet again, all accompanied by howls of laughter.
Indeed lots of sand is yet to be poured into the gears of the treaty machinery as it moves down “the long road”.
One reason Seidler is so pessimistic is that the treaty needs to be agreed upon by some 190 nations, all of whom are trying to tweak the text in their own favor. In the end it gets so complicated that no one is able to really understand it.
For Seidler the conference circuses are tough to witness, but in the end he concludes they are at least budging the process forward in the right direction. Seidler concludes, “All the senselessness makes sense.”

"If there is one thing Elaine Fludgate wants to emphasize, it is that she is not the neediest. Nope, not her. What she is, she said, is the luckiest, the most grateful: She was caught before she actually fell through the cracks. For 40 years, Ms. Fludgate, 62, has lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her most recent job was as an administrator for the Kimmel Center for University Life at New York University, where in 2013 she was a recipient of the college’s    Award for outstanding work. She had a loving partner, Michael, by her side. Ms. Fludgate had a good life. But everything changed in late 2013, after Ms. Fludgate learned that her partner had liver cancer. She left her job to care for him, helping him until he died in March 2015. “The depth of my grief was really unbearable,” Ms. Fludgate said. “He was my life for 32 years. That was just us. So he’s gone, and I’m nothing. ” Ms. Fludgate retreated to her apartment, sitting at times in the dark, leaving her solitude only when her cats needed food. As her savings dwindled, Ms. Fludgate resorted to selling items like furniture and jewelry on eBay. She got rid of almost everything, hanging on to only a few items, including a sentimental pair of earrings she has had since she was 18. “It’s embarrassing,” she said. “I had a great job at a university. And then my life just fell apart. ” After seven months of painful grief, she finally forced herself from the couch, venturing to the Center at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, an assistance center for older adults, to see what help it could offer her. “I realize you can only go so far deep into the rabbit hole,” Ms. Fludgate said. “So I came here, and I was truly a basket case. ” At the center, she was connected to the Service Program for Older People. She joined a bereavement group, was assigned a social worker and therapists and was prescribed antidepressants. “It was very cathartic to be with people who have experienced the hell of losing a loved one,” Ms. Fludgate said. Then in April 2016, eviction notices started appearing on her apartment door. “If I got thrown out, of course, I’d live in a women’s shelter on Park Avenue because I could tell people I was living on Park Avenue,” Ms. Fludgate said, her coping response characteristic of her humor, not haughtiness. Fortunately, in June, she successfully applied for disability and Social Security benefits, which included enough money to pay off her rental arrears, as well as mounting credit card debt. “It’s incredible, but I just want to get across how quickly, especially in this city, you come from the heights and then to get the depths of depression and the whole thing,” Ms. Fludgate said. She currently receives $1, 570 a month in Social Security, $154 in food stamps and a small stipend from a   job as a counselor for seniors, a job that ends this week. Last summer, her caseworker at the Service Program for Older People asked Ms. Fludgate if she needed anything, but she said she at first felt too guilty and too proud to tell the truth. Before long, Ms. Fludgate acknowledged she could use help and expressed her desire for new furniture to spruce up her barren apartment. The caseworker, Carola Chase, contacted FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases. It secured a $1, 000 grant in Neediest Cases funds to allow Ms. Fludgate to buy a sofa, a chair and a console table. “It’s really made a big difference,” she said. “I have had people to my house since I got the new furniture. ” Little by little, her life had been improving. On the first day of this year, Ms. Fludgate lost her health insurance coverage and could no longer afford her medication or receive the services that helped her with her grief. She maintains regular contact with the new friends she made in her bereavement group and leans on them often for assistance. She said she was grateful for every bit of support. “If I had stayed sitting on the couch, I would have lost another 20 pounds, but you wouldn’t have got me anywhere,” Ms. Fludgate said. She is considering trying to   the work force full time, she said. But she worries she is at the age where landing a job may be impossible. “I don’t have a   goal,” Ms. Fludgate said. “I’m just trying to do baby steps. ”"

Letter to the Editor Watts Up With That?
31st October 2014

For decades green extremists have been spreading doomsday forecasts of global warming.
But where do we find the greatest abundance of life on land? Follow the equator around the globe – the Amazon, the Congo, Kenya, Indonesia and New Guinea – all places where it is warm and wet.
And where is life such a struggle that few species live there? Go towards the poles – Siberia and the cold deserts of Antarctica and Greenland.
Where do most tourists go in winter? Few go to Alaska or Iceland – most head towards the warmth of the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, the Black Sea and Bali.
Which season is most welcomed? It is not the first frost, nor the first snowstorm, but the first cherry blossoms, the first robins, and the welcome green shoots of new spring pasture.
Land life multiplies in summer – many mammals hibernate or die in winter.
Every nurseryman knows that plants grow best in a warm greenhouse with added carbon dioxide. Global warmth speeds up the life-supporting water and carbon cycles – warming oceans expel the gases of life (carbon dioxide and water vapour) producing more clouds, more precipitation and more plant growth.
This is why the warm eras of the past are remembered as periods of plenty – the cold eras are times of hunger, migrations and war.
Life on Earth has never been threatened by greenhouse warming. It is the sudden plunge into an ice age that we need to fear.
Green alarmists should venture from their cosy offices and coffee shops and celebrate the welcome warmth of our global greenhouse while it lasts.
Warmth is good.

"**Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says there have been airstrikes on military targets in Tigray state, whose leaders have fallen out with the national government.**
But there has been no confirmation that the targets have been hit.
Tigray's governing party said on Thursday that there had been airstrikes but a senior official told the BBC that nothing had happened on Friday.
Some fear this could be the start of a civil war.
Long-standing tension between Ethiopia's federal government and Tigray, the country's northernmost state, boiled over into clashes this week.
The head of the United Nations has called for an ""immediate de-escalation of fighting"".
Speaking on the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr Abiy said airstrikes had happened on Thursday and Friday and would continue.
He said missiles, radar equipment and rockets had been destroyed, adding that the rockets had a range of 300km (186 miles).
Earlier, speaking on state television in Tigrinya, the language of the Tigray region, AFP news agency quotes the prime minister as saying that ""these air strikes aren't aimed at civilians but rather at targets stored by this dangerous group"".
He was referring to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which governs the state, and the weapons that it allegedly holds.
But officials in Tigray have denied to the BBC that an air attack took place on Friday.
In a statement earlier on Friday, Mr Abiy insisted that the military operation in Tigray had ""clear, limited and achievable objectives"".
Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael previously accused Mr Abiy's administration of plotting to invade the state.
Details are scanty as very little confirmed information is getting out, but on Thursday Mr Debretsion said there had been clashes in the west of Tigray.
Ethiopia's federal army is sending more troops to the region, according to Gen Berhanu Jula, deputy army chief of staff, who said they were being mobilised from across the country.
That's to provide support for the Northern Command, which is based in Tigray and whose base was captured by the TPLF.
Gen Berhanu has accused regional troops loyal to the TPLF of treason.
This came after Mr Debretsion said his troops had seized ""almost all"" of the weaponry at the Command.
A statement from the prime minister's office on Friday said that under the six-month state of emergency he declared in the region, a new taskforce under the control of the military chief of staff would have the power to:
It is difficult to know how intense the clashes have been and how many people have been killed.
That's partly because the internet and phone lines have been cut off in Tigray. However, electricity has now been restored to the region.
On Friday, schools and shops in the regional capital, Mekelle, were open, and transport services to other towns have resumed, but local residents say there is a sense of fear over what the coming days may bring.
Tension has been mounting for some time as relations between the TPLF and the federal government have deteriorated.
The TPLF used to be the dominant force in Ethiopia's ruling coalition but its power has waned since Mr Abiy became prime minister in 2018.
Last year, he dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Friday morning's statement from the prime minister's office also said that some members of the TPLF were ""fugitives from justice"" and suggested they opposed Mr Abiy's attempts to reform the way Ethiopia was run.
Relations took a significant turn for the worse after the TPLF held a regional election in September.
The Tigrayan authorities went ahead with the vote in defiance of a nationwide postponement that was put in place following the outbreak of coronavirus.
The federal government described that election for the Tigray parliament as ""illegal"".
The vote raised concerns that the TPLF was laying the groundwork for the creation of a breakaway state, with a parliament and government taking office without the blessing of the federal government.
The TPLF said that it was committed to keeping the region within Ethiopia, but insisted it would defend ""self-rule"" and oppose what it called Mr Abiy's attempt build a strong ""unitary"" state.
This week, Mr Abiy accused the TPLF of attacking the military base and sent in the Ethiopian military.
The UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""deeply alarmed"" and called for an ""immediate de-escalation of fighting"".
Previously, on Wednesday, amid the drama of the US election, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also called for an end to any fighting.
""We are saddened by the tragic loss of life and urge immediate action to restore the peace and de-escalate tensions... the protection of civilian safety and security is essential,"" he said in a statement.
The African Union, whose headquarters are in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, is pushing for talks but the government is not willing to negotiate, sources told the Reuters news agency."
"President Trump’s executive order barring millions of refugees and citizens of seven   countries from the United States has spurred a surge in donations to humanitarian and rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. The A. C. L. U. has raised more than $24 million in online donations since Saturday, the first full day of the immigration ban, said Stephen Smith, a spokesman for the group. That is nearly seven times as much raised online in 2015, roughly $3. 5 million, he added. Those donations came from at least 356, 306 individual donors, and about   of those who gave money were believed to be   donors, said its executive director, Anthony D. Romero. “The response from the public has been remarkable,” Mr. Romero said. “It clearly shows that people are exercised over the proposed policies of Donald Trump. ” The A. C. L. U. also gained 150, 000 to 200, 000 new members. It had 400, 000 when Mr. Trump was elected in November, he said. “Clearly, this executive order has hit a live nerve with the American people,” Mr. Romero said. Thousands of protesters flooded airports across the country and took to the streets as word spread that immigrants and refugees were being blocked from entering the country, detained for hours by customs officials or taken off planes during the weekend, after Mr. Trump signed the executive order at 4:42 p. m. on Friday. The order, coming off a campaign promise, suspends the entry of all refugees for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prevents citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. Critics noted that the order for “extreme vetting” was in effect a ban on Muslims, and did not target countries in which Mr. Trump has had business interests. The move stunned the global community, drawing criticism from business leaders, European heads of state and Christian leaders, though many Trump fans were unfazed. Besides the A. C. L. U. other groups have seen a rise in donations. The National Immigration Law Center, which joined the A. C. L. U. in a suit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees detained on Saturday, has raised $269, 000 since the Trump order was signed, its executive director, Marielena Hincapie, said. Ms. Hincapie said donations had increased “across the board” and were now larger, more frequent and coming from more individual donors than her group had ever seen. A surge of individual donations after the election in November also boosted the law center’s annual budget to $7. 5 million from $5. 5 million, she added.   for her organization was usually “slow and tedious work,” but not anymore, she said. “Trump’s election completely changed that and set us on a new path and has allowed us to be a stronger and more nimble organization,” Ms. Hincapie said. Humanitarian groups have seen a boost in donations, as well. Kal Penn, an actor and a former official in the White House Office of Public Engagement under President Barack Obama, started an online   appeal for the International Rescue Committee, which works in conflict and disaster zones around the world. Mr. Penn said the   had been inspired by an internet “troll” who told him he didn’t belong in the United States. “To the dude who said I don’t belong in America, I started a   page for Syrian refugees in your name,” Mr. Penn wrote on Twitter. That tweet was shared more than 35, 000 times, and by Sunday, the site had raised over $390, 000. The I. R. C. began its own   effort on Sunday with the goal of bringing in $5 million to help the organization respond to the needs of refugees in the United States. The group said it was the first time it had launched an appeal for people in the United States. The   efforts were promoted by at least one actress during the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night, Sarah Paulson, who urged people to donate to the A. C. L. U. “to protect the rights and liberties of people across this country. ” Many of the winners, including Julia   of TV’s “Veep” and Mahershala Ali of the film “Moonlight,” used their acceptance speeches to denounce  the policies of Mr. Trump. The A. C. L. U. sees itself as a leader in the opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda. It lead the charge on Saturday with the lawsuit in New York that resulted in an emergency ruling by a federal judge blocking the deportation of detainees who had already landed here. The court order was the second legal action filed by the group against the Trump administration, which is little more than one week old. Even before Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration, the A. C. L. U. had received more than $47 million from 400, 000 donors, Mr. Romero said. The organization used the money  —   the largest surge in donations in its 97 year history, he said  —   to hire 200 staff members, primarily lawyers. “That is the Trump Effect,” Mr. Romero said. “Those 400, 000 people, who donated to us, I did not go after them they came to us. In fact, our website crashed we had so many donations, we could not handle it. ”"
"The combined impacts of human-caused sea level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding within the next 30 years, even with relatively ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, a new global study has found. In a worst-case scenario where emissions continue to rise and no efforts are made to adapt to the rising sea levels, coastal assets worth US$14.2tn – about 20% of global GDP – could be at risk by the end of the century.  Rising sea levels caused by global heating that expands the oceans and melts land-based ice could mean that one-in-100-year floods occurring now would become one-in-10-year floods by the end of the century. As much as 4% of the world’s population could be affected by flooding. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, identified “hotspot” regions at risk of extensive flooding. South-eastern China, Australia’s north, Bangladesh, West Bengal and Gujarat in India were especially at risk. In the United States, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland were considered to be most exposed, as were the UK, northern France and northern Germany. But the study also shows how the risk of damage from rising sea levels and storm surges will continue to rise even if emissions are kept to a level that would keep the global temperature rise to well below 2C by the end of this century. The new study builds on findings published by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2019 that predicted extreme sea level events could be near annual occurrences by the middle of this century on many coastlines. Prof Ian Young, a co-author of the study at the University of Melbourne, said: “We certainly need to mitigate our greenhouse gases but that won’t solve this problem. “The sea level rise is already baked in – even if we reduce emissions today the sea level will continue to rise because the glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years.” According to the study, about 148 million people globally are exposed to flooding events today. If greenhouse gas emissions rise moderately – the equivalent of 1.8C of global warming by the end of the century – a further 54 million people will be exposed. But if emissions are allowed to spiral in a worst-case scenario, then this number rises to 77 million. About US$10.2tn of coastal assets are exposed to coastal flooding in 2100, even with emissions kept at moderate level, according to the study. All the figures modelled in the study assume that no adaptive measures are taken, illustrating the benefits of taking early action to reduce the impact of flooding events. Young said: “When most people think of sea level rise they think about 3 or 4mm per year, but when flooding occurs it happens it’s when you also have a storm. “That happens today and we have seen that on the coast of New South Wales last week. Sea level rise exacerbates the magnitude – and increases the frequency – of these flooding events. ‘There are significantly larger areas of land flooded and that will have significant economic impacts on infrastructure. “Even if we mitigate greenhouse gases it does not make much effect. We have to adapt to this – it is going to happen so we have to look at either hard engineering solutions, or do we look at planned retreat and move populations and that’s incredibly difficult, or there are nature-based coastal defence systems.” Ebru Kirezci, the lead researcher, also of the University of Melbourne, said: “We need to adapt to sea level rise and climate change. “Adaptation is the only way out and we need to adopt some risk mitigation strategies like sea walls and dykes and develop forecasting and warning systems, or coastal retreat, which means the relocation of coastal communities to safer places.” Prof John Church, a leading expert on sea level rise at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were valuable. He said the study had brought together several elements to estimate extreme impacts, but there was more work to be done to understand additional impacts from changes to the severity of storms and waves. He said there was also likely to be significant impacts along estuaries and it was important to note that “sea level rise will not stop in 2100 under any scenario”. He said: “With more emissions the higher the [sea level] rises, with commitments of metres of sea level rise over coming centuries with the higher scenarios. The impacts to 2100 are the introduction to the future.” While coastal flooding could impact 20% of global GDP this, he said, was a reflection of a society that “love the coast”. “We need more thoughtful and forward-looking planning.”"
"The recent storms have transformed many of the nation’s coasts – blasting away the sand from beaches, eroding cliffs, and damaging properties. More surprising is the sudden and often dramatic appearance of huge amounts of plastic debris, dredged up from the deep and thrown onto the shore. Ranging from the banal to the curious, these fragments of modern life deposited at sea are a signature of a serious problem threatening our oceans. Plastic litter is now almost everywhere in the world’s oceans, extending from the coast to far out to sea, and down through the water column to the ocean floor. Large pieces of plastic such as bottles, plastic bags, cigarette lighters and old toys can be found on most beaches and are readily spotted from the decks of ships at sea. And microplastic fragments smaller than 5 mm, and even smaller nanoscale plastic fragments less than 1mm in size, can be found in sand, sediment, and even the tissues of marine organisms. An obvious cause of this global problem is increasing use of plastics, with annual production increasing from just 1.5m tonnes in the 1950s to a staggering 280m tonnes in 2011. Despite the ubiquity of plastic in the ocean, our knowledge about the effects of this debris is limited. As if to underline the issue, a recent horizon scan of global conservation issues identified microplastics as a serious emerging global environmental threat. Numerous organisations have drawn attention to the plastic litter issue, but the scale of the problem is not yet widely appreciated by either the public or politicians. And right on cue, research is beginning to show that plastic litter is affecting a number of marine animals including birds, turtles and invertebrates, with plastic fragments showing up in their guts, respiratory tracts and tissues. Yet few, if any, practical measures have been put in place to manage the situation. Last year I was one of more than 100 scientists who met at the University of Siena in Italy to clarify what is known, and what still remains to be investigated, concerning this problem. We discussed several important areas that need further investigation, including the need for answers to such questions as: how much plastic is getting into the marine environment each year, where is it coming from, and where do the different types of plastic litter accumulate? Is plastic taken up by marine organisms and is it damaging to them? What is the extent of economic, environmental and human health costs that result from the marine plastic litter? Identifying questions like these allows us to focus our combined research efforts, and ensure we’re targeting the right areas with the limited funding that is available. But science alone cannot solve the rising possibility of a future where beaches of plastic, rather than sand, are commonplace. We need public education programmes to increase awareness of the scale and severity of the problem. And we need guidelines and regulations to ensure that plastics are disposed of safely, not dumped at sea – and we need to ensure that these are enforced. Ultimately, we need to reduce our use of plastics worldwide and develop environmentally friendly alternatives. There is clearly much to be done in order to bring this issue to the attention of the public and politicians. Fortunately, the European Commission and other organisations around the world have at last begun to support the research that will give us the answers to our questions. But as is the case with the many environmental problems of our time, it is undeniable that we need to take immediate action to limit plastic debris in the ocean."
"Modern safety engineering follows the aphorism, “there is no such thing as zero risk, only acceptable risk”. However, calculating chances and risk is a finicky process, especially when played out against factors of cost, time and complexity. Major accidents such as at Fukushima Dai-ichi – still unfolding as it approaches its third anniversary – demonstrate how essential it is to correctly assess risks and safeguards. Risk is expectation of loss, and is dependent on the chance of a loss-event occurring combined with its magnitude. The chance can be tiny, but the loss huge, and the risk therefore considerable. Analyses of the possibility that the universe would collapse when operating the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) were undertaken, despite the infinitesimal chance. Calculating risk is now de rigeur in big engineering projects, but it wasn’t always so. Built in the late 1940s, the Windscale piles, Britain’s first two nuclear reactors, used air blown over the core and up a chimney as their cooling. Exhaust filters were added to the chimneys only as an afterthought, insisted on by designer Sir John Cockcroft at some expense – the so called “Cockcroft’s Follies”. During a procedure to release pent-up energy in the graphite core in 1957, there was a fuel meltdown, and radioactive material escaped up the chimney into the environment. This was handled to all intents by brave, indeed heroic, people doing what they could. But the events were kept as concealed from the surrounding civilians as possible. This was, after all, a facility for producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. Nowadays it would be unthinkable, indeed illegal, for any organisation including the government to keep information of such a release of poison from its possible victims. English case law already contained a legal judgement (Lord Asquith, Edwards vs National Coal Board) that required industrial risks to be reduced “as low as reasonably practicable”. But there is no indication in Windscale’s final design or operation that a meltdown risk was objectively assessed, nor of any efforts to mitigate that risk – we can be grateful in retrospect for Cockcroft’s Follies, which afterwards appeared a good investment. Lessons were learnt. Containment would have been desirable. The Boiling Water Reactor Mark 1 (BWR) is a US design that contained its core entirely inside a pressure vessel, with a removable cap to insert and remove fuel rods. The pressure vessel contained water and steam, forming part of a closed-circuit heat-exchange mechanism. The pressure vessel itself is fully enclosed within a steel-and-concrete bulb known as “primary containment”. And the primary containment itself is enclosed within a building, which constitutes “secondary containment”. BWR Mark 1 designs were commissioned from the 1970’s – the first was at Fukushima Dai-ichi in Japan in 1971, 14 years after Windscale. The chances and extent of things going wrong must nowadays be calculated. The theoretically possible accidents and their precursors (“hazards”) must be listed and the concomitant risk assessed. Methods for this such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) have evolved over more than 60 years.  What were the chances of a core melt at Fukushima? Cooling requires electricity, generated either by the plant, from the electricity grid, or from emergency generators or last-resort batteries. Four different systems providing “defence in depth”, as required. Except that the electrics and emergency systems, all in the basement, are susceptible to simultaneous failure from flooding. This was known since the 1990’s, and widely published in a book by organisational sociologist Charles Perrow, The Next Catastrophe, in 2007. With Fukushima Dai-ichi’s six reactors (and another four at Fukushima Dai-ini further down the coast) sitting low on the coast, Japanese experts had pointed out the risk from exceptional tsunamis to Fukushima Dai-ichi’s operator Tepco and the nuclear regulator prior to the earthquake. It seems they had begun to react, but the changes required cost lots of money. Another engineering aphorism says “if you think safety is expensive, wait till you have to pay for an accident”. While Fukushima had 40 years of uninterrupted successful operation, in a highly industrialised country where engineers are technical perfectionists, with regulatory regimes in place and a risk-averse government, situations can quickly change. Quite suddenly, heroics were required, again. And again as at Windscale, and Chernobyl in 1986, they were available. How did the engineers and planners get their numbers so wrong? Calculations are only ever as good as the assumptions, for example that flooding was not going to be a problem. And not everything that is known feeds accurately into the calculations.  Some years ago, a common commercial aircraft type started suffering a series of critical failures. The chance them occurring had been painstakingly evaluated as orders of magnitude less than once in the present or future history of the universe. The cause was fortunately discovered and remedied before the plane was grounded. Big numbers usually tell you that you have a problem. But small numbers are not so good at saying that you don’t. So, do we build nuclear plants to avoid fossil fuel pollution? Even with the best people and organisations, can we avoid accidents and disasters that lead to major contamination? The best guess is: maybe, and maybe not. Some, such as Lee Clarke in his book Worst Cases, argue that the worst case scenario should be considered without an estimated chance of its happening. The LHC analysts performed worst-case analysis. Mitigating worst cases, though, is often expensive. One bad accident every 25 years appears sufficient to make nuclear power amongst the costliest in terms of reparations according to some calculations. And in a sense we’ve been lucky, as Windscale, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima could all have been much worse – perhaps as bad as Chernobyl. For example, what if the process of unloading spent fuel assemblies from the damaged reactor pool taking place at Fukushima Dai-ichi goes wrong, and all that radioactive material burns off into the atmosphere? Are we content with weighing numbers representing risk, or do we need to go beyond – even far beyond – someone’s idea of “reasonably practical” to ensure that such events cannot happen? The LHC commissioners took the worst case very seriously.  By their own admission, the Fukushima regulator and operator did not. There is likely no single “right” approach. Whatever we decide, the outcome may not be as relatively benign next time."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE 2: Tremendous interest in Ewert’s findings: shared or liked 2400 times up to now. I’ve decided to take the day off from blogging and let this one run another day.
UPDATE 1: Also read here.
Veteran journalist Günter Ederer* writes a piece reporting that massive alterations have been found in the NASA GISS temperature data series, citing a comprehensive analysis conducted by a leading German scientist. These results are now available to the public.

Professor Dr. Friedrich Karl Ewert. Source: University of Paderborn
Ederer reports not long ago retired geologist and data computation expert Professor Dr. Friedrich Karl Ewert began looking at the data behind the global warming claims, and especially the datasets of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS).
Ewert painstakingly examined and tabulated the reams of archived data from 1153 stations that go back to 1881 – which NASA has publicly available – data that the UN IPCC uses to base its conclusion that man is heating the Earth’s atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. According to Ederer, what Professor Ewert found is “unbelievable”:
From the publicly available data, Ewert made an unbelievable discovery: Between the years 2010 and 2012 the data measured since 1881 were altered so that they showed a significant warming, especially after 1950. […] A comparison of the data from 2010 with the data of 2012 shows that NASA-GISS had altered its own datasets so that especially after WWII a clear warming appears – although it never existed.”
Ederer writes that Ewert particularly found alterations at stations in the Arctic. Professor Ewert randomly selected 120 stations from all over the world and compared the 2010 archived data to the 2012 data and found that they had been tampered to produce warming.
The old data showed regular cycles of warming and cooling over the period, even as atmospheric CO2 concentration rose from 0.03% to 0.04%. According to the original NASA datasets, Ederer writes, the mean global temperature cooled from 13.8°C in 1881 to 12.9°C in 1895. Then it rose to 14.3°C by 1905 and fell back under 12.9°C by 1920, rose to 13.9°C by 1930, fell to 13° by 1975 before rising to 14°C by 2000. By 2010 the temperature fell back to 13.2°C.
But then came the “massive” altering of data, which also altered the entire overall trend for the period. According to journalist Ederer, Ewert uncovered 10 different methods NASA used to alter the data. The 6 most often used methods were:
• Reducing the annual mean in the early phase.
• Reducing the high values in the first warming phase.
• Increasing individual values during the second warming phase.
• Suppression of the second cooling phase starting in 1995.
• Shortening the early decades of the datasets.
• With the long-term datasets, even the first century was shortened.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The methods were employed for stations such as Darwin, Australia and Palma de Mallorca, for example, where cooling trends were suddenly transformed into warming.
Ewert then discovered that NASA having altered the datasets once in March 2012 was not enough. Alterations were made again in August 2012, and yet again in December 2012. For Palma de Majorca: “Now because of the new datasets it has gotten even warmer. Now they show a warming of +0.01202°C per year.”
Using earlier NASA data, globe is in fact cooling
The veteran German journalist Ederer writes that the media reports of ongoing global warming are in fact not based on reality at all, but rather on “the constantly altered temperatures of the earlier decades.” Ederer adds:
Thus the issue of man-made global warming has taken on a whole new meaning: Yes, it is always man-made if the data are adjusted to fit the theory. The meticulous work by Ewert has predecessors, and fits a series of scandals and contradictions that are simply being ignored by the political supporters of man-made climate change.”
Ederer also brings up the analysis by American meteorologists Joseph D’Aleo and Anthony Watts who examined 6000 NASA measurement stations and found an abundance of measurement irregularities stemming in large part from serious siting issues. According to Ederer the findings by Professor Ewert are in close agreement with those of Watts and D’Aleo.
Ederer writes of the overall findings by Professor Ewert:
Using the NASA data from 2010 the surface temperature globally from 1940 until today has fallen by 1.110°C, and since 2000 it has fallen 0.4223°C […]. The cooling has hit every continent except for Australia, which warmed by 0.6339°C since 2000. The figures for Europe: From 1940 to 2010, using the data from 2010, there was a cooling of 0.5465°C and a cooling of 0.3739°C since 2000.”
Ederer summarizes that in view of the magnitude of the scandal, one would think that there would be in investigation. Yet he does not believe this will be the case because the global warming has turned into a trillion-dollar industry and that that too much is tied to it.
All datasets are available to the public at any time. The studies by Prof. Ewert may be requested by e-mail: ewert.fk@t-online.de.

"A second major Korean backer of Adani’s Australian coal operation has said it won’t provide any more financial support for the controversial miner, which faces potential debt difficulties related to its Abbot Point export terminal. Guardian Australia has seen a letter from Korean brokerage firm Hanwha Securities – sent to the climate group Tipping Point on 30 July – which stated the firm would cease financing Adani’s coal projects.  Last month, the ratings agency S&P Global downgraded its outlook on Adani’s Abbot Point terminal to “stable” after the company’s efforts to refinance debts were hindered by the coronavirus pandemic. The terminal’s Indian parent company, Adani Enterprises, urgently injected $100m needed to meet repayments due in May. Adani Abbot Point has also drawn down on about $170m of shareholder loans to pay off debt – owed to Commbank and Westpac – that was due to mature in November. Adani plans to export coal from its under-construction Carmichael mine from Abbot Point, which has total debts of about $1.5bn. Those debts include about $1.1bn due for repayment by December 2022, according to S&P Global. As the company postpones its efforts to refinance the most immediate Abbot Point debts, environmental activists have now secured withdrawal commitments from two large Korean financiers. Last month, Samsung group company Samsung Securities pledged to cease its financial backing of Adani, just days after protests began to target the group’s electronics branch. Hanwha Securities has now followed suit. The Hanwha conglomerate’s solar brand, Hanwha Q Cells, is the manufacturer of the most popular photovoltaic panels in Australia, the US, UK, Japan and Korea. It is understood the withdrawal of Hanwha Securities was hastened after the anti-Adani group, Galilee Blockade, held a protest at the Sydney office of the Hanwha Q Cells last week. “[Hanwha Securities] undertook its own review and eventually approved the investment for the terminal in the form of debt financing,” the company’s chief executive Kwon Hee-Baek said in the letter to Tipping Point. “During such review and approval process, Hanwha Securities confirms it had no knowledge of the various environmental issues related to the Carmichael mine. “In fact, Hanwha Securities was informed by the borrower, Adani, that the Terminal strictly adhered to applicable environmental laws and regulations in Australia as well as having a positive impact on the local community by contributing to job creation. “Given what has transpired, Hanwha Securities will not be providing any further financing for the terminal or any of Adani’s coal projects, in line with its commitment to promote value creation through environmentally friendly means to create a brighter and healthier future for our planet.” Jointly, Samsung Securities and Hanwha Securities purchased about $120m of debt in the Adani-owned Abbot Point coal terminal in 2019. Adani said it had postponed refinancing debt maturities due this year and next year “due to prevailing market conditions”. “In year 2017 and 2018, the company had successfully refinanced large tranche of debt issued for the terminal in 2013,” a spokesman said. “The specific details of our funding arrangements for the terminal are commercial in confidence. “Those who invest in and support export ports do so knowing the strategic and economic importance of these assets to the Australian economy. “Ports like the Abbot Point terminal are gateways for exports and will play a vital role in Australis’s post-Covid-19 economic recovery.” Pablo Brait, a campaigner at investor action group Market Forces, said Hanwha’s commitment “shows how damaging any association with Adani … is for corporate reputations”. “All other Adani creditors and bond arrangers shouldn’t wait until the protesters have arrived in their foyer to join Hanwha and Samsung in committing to no further involvement with Abbot Point or any of Adani’s plans to expand dirty coal,” Brait said. “Abbot Point coal port is an essential link in the chain that makes up the climate-destroying Carmichael coal project.”"

Guest essay by Steve Goreham
Originally published in Communities Digital News.
The year 2014 was another year of futility in the fight against climate change. Climatists redoubled efforts to convince citizens that urgent action is needed to stop dangerous global warming. But the gap between public warnings and actual events produced an endless stream of climate irony.
January began with a frosty bang as an arctic air mass descended on the central United States, following a similar event in December. What was once called a cold snap is now ominously christened a “polar vortex.” Record-low daily temperatures were recorded from Minnesota to Boston, along with all-time seasonal snowfalls in many cities.
In a White House video released on January 8, John Holdren, chief science advisor to President Obama, made the paradoxical statement, “But a growing body of evidence suggests that the kind of extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States as we speak is a pattern that we can expect to see with increasing frequency as global warming continues.”
Also in January, passengers of the research ship Akademik Shokalskiy were rescued after the ship was locked in ice for 10 days near the antarctic coast. The expedition lead by professor Chris Turney had intended to study how weather patterns near Antarctica were changing due to man-made global warming.
On February 16, during a presentation in Indonesia, Secretary of State John Kerry stated that climate change was “perhaps the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.” Only two days later, protestors set fire to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, leading to the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. In March, Russia seized the Crimea. In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, and political unrest continues today. In the Middle East, slaughter of innocent civilians and beheading of western captives became a growing trend. Man-made climate casualties seem remarkably scarce in comparison.
In March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations released Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, part of its Fifth Assessment Report. The report said that man-made climate change would reduce world agricultural output. Lead author Dr. Mark Howden stated, “There’s increasing evidence that climate change is also impacting on agriculture, particularly on some of the cereal crops such as wheat and maize. The negative impacts are greater and quicker than we previously thought.”
Meanwhile, farmers continued to ignore the warnings of the IPCC. According to the US Department of Agriculture, world agricultural production set all-time records for all three major cereal crops in 2014, with rice output up 1.1 percent, wheat up 11.2 percent, and corn up a whopping 14.0 percent over 2013.
The Obama administration continued its attack on coal-fired power plants, which provide about 40 percent of US electricity. In June, the EPA proposed new restrictions on carbon emissions that would make it virtually impossible to build a new coal-fired plant in the US. At the same time, more than 1,200 new coal-fired plants are planned across the world, with two-thirds to be built in India and China.
In his 2007 Noble Prize acceptance speech, former Vice President Al Gore warned that the arctic ice could be gone in “as little as seven years.” But arctic sea ice rebounded in 2014 and antarctic sea ice has been growing for decades. According to the University of Illinois, satellites measured global sea ice area at above the 30-year average at the end of 2014.
In September, the United Nations held a climate summit in New York City to urge the world to conserve energy and reduce emissions. Spokesman Leonardo DiCaprio stated, “This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make.” Mr. DiCaprio neglected to mention his frequent flights on carbon-emitting private jets or his ownership of the world’s fifth largest yacht, purchased from a Middle East oil tycoon.
In October, climate skeptics reported the eighteenth straight year of flat global temperatures. Satellite data shows no temperature increase since 1997. The “pause” in global warming is now old enough to vote or to serve in the military.
Hurricanes and tornados are favored events for generating alarming climate headlines, but US weather events were few in 2014. US tornadic activity was below average and the lack of strong hurricanes continued. No Category 3 or stronger hurricane has made US landfall for more than eight years, the longest period since records began in 1900.
The last half of 2014 witnessed a steep drop in world petroleum prices from over $100 per barrel to under $60 per barrel. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, technologies perfected by US geologists and petroleum engineers over the last two decades, produced an explosion in US oil production and triggered the fall in world prices.
But the concurrent drop in US gasoline prices to two dollars per gallon is not welcomed by man-made global warming believers. Former Energy Secretary Stephen Chu said in 2008, “So we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.” English journalist George Monbiot has lamented, “We were wrong about peak oil: there’s enough in the ground to deep-fry the planet.”
With all the climate fun in 2014, what will 2015 hold?

"LONDON  —   It had all been going so well. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain had just left Washington on Friday evening after a tense but successful first visit with President Trump for a   flight to Ankara, Turkey, for her next awkward encounter, with the increasingly autocratic Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. By the time she had landed in Turkey, however, Mr. Trump had signed his executive order halting entrance to the United States of all Syrian refugees and of most citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mrs. May was beginning to feel the backlash. After she termed the executive order an American issue, criticism erupted even among her own members of Parliament. She was accused of appeasement by a former British diplomat. Protesters gathered outside Downing Street on Monday night, and more than 1. 5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that Mrs. May rescind her invitation for Mr. Trump to visit Queen Elizabeth II. A close relationship with any American president is regarded as crucial by allies and foes alike, but especially by intimates like Britain, Canada, Japan and Mexico. Yet like moths to the flame, the leaders of those nations are finding that they draw close at their peril. While Mrs. May is the latest prominent figure to suffer repercussions for her handling of Mr. Trump, the leaders of those other three close allies have also felt the sting of public anger soon after what seemed to be friendly telephone calls or encounters. They then find themselves facing a   situation, either openly criticizing the leader of their superpower ally or pulling their punches and risking severe criticism at home. One Western leader to escape this fate so far is the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has kept a cool distance from Mr. Trump. In a telephone call on Saturday, she reminded him of Washington’s obligations under the Geneva Conventions to accept refugees fleeing war, a view underlined by her official spokesman. The danger of playing nice with Mr. Trump should come as little surprise to his country’s allies. Besides campaigning on an “America First” platform, he has regularly argued that allies have been taking the United States for a ride, in trade, security and financial terms. While he has been cordial in public settings with the leaders of those allied nations, Mr. Trump has turned on them soon afterward. “The problem for May is that Trump doesn’t value relationships. He values strength and winning,” said Jeremy Shapiro, the director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior State Department official. “If you rush to the White House to offer a weak hand of friendship, you guarantee exploitation. ” While Mr. Trump’s executive order was clearly not aimed at Britain, he signed it on Friday, just a few hours after Mrs. May left. “You can show up at his doorstep and hold his hand so he doesn’t fall down a ramp, but that doesn’t mean a few hours later when he’s signing an order he thinks at all about how it affects you, your politics or your citizens,” Mr. Shapiro said. Particularly problematic for Mrs. May was her offering the invitation to Mr. Trump to undertake a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II this year, which was accepted. The internet petition to Parliament calling for the cancellation of the invitation says the visit “would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen. ” By Monday evening in Britain, there had been more than 1. 5 million signatures, and some were enjoying themselves watching the numbers rise in real time. At a large protest outside Downing Street, people urged Mrs. May to cancel the state visit and said that while relations with Washington were important, they should be cooler toward Mr. Trump. Amber Curtis, 21, a film student who is   and   said that she worried for her family and friends in America. “It sends a bad message if he comes here after this ban,” Ms. Curtis said of Mr. Trump. “I wouldn’t say that I want no relationship at all, but he cannot come here under the terms of this ban. The terms need to be renegotiated. ” Negma Yamin, 50, a teacher of Pakistani origin, was in tears. “I’m so upset as a fellow Muslim I hate the persecution,” she said. Mrs. May “should absolutely have no relationship with him,” she added. “You can’t negotiate with a person like that. What is he going to do with the people? He’s dividing the U. S. he’s dividing the world. ” On Monday, Downing Street insisted that the invitation stood. But who knows how Mr. Trump will react? The Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has had a similar experience to Mrs. May’s  —   twice. Last year, in the name of conciliation and dialogue, he invited Mr. Trump to Mexico, a somewhat questionable move given Mr. Trump’s contempt for Mexico and his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, raise tariffs, deport millions of Mexicans, and build (or finish) a border wall and make the southern neighbor of the United States pay for it. The visit was widely viewed in Mexico as a national humiliation. It left Mr. Trump looking stronger and Mr. Peña Nieto looking weaker, especially when Mr. Trump, in an immigration policy speech in Phoenix the same day, insisted again that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mr. Peña Nieto persisted after Mr. Trump’s election, apparently aiming, like Mrs. May, to influence the new president and to moderate what many hoped was just hyperbolic campaign talk. But just before the two men were to meet in Washington, Mr. Trump issued executive orders calling for the wall and greatly restricting immigration. Mr. Peña Nieto called off the meeting only when Mr. Trump threatened on Twitter to cancel it unless Mexico agreed to pay for the wall. Embarrassed and cornered, Mr. Peña Nieto moved first, an act of defiance that provided a rare moment of public approval for the unpopular president. But given the importance of bilateral ties, he did speak to Mr. Trump the next morning for an hour, without setting a new date to meet. “This is neither a victory nor a defeat,” said Fernando Dworak, an analyst in Mexico City. “It is the bell ringing in a boxing match. ” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has the distinction of being among the first to feel the sting of Mr. Trump’s actions. In a meeting in November in New York, Mr. Abe urged Mr. Trump, then the   not to abandon a major trade deal, the   Partnership. One of Mr. Trump’s first actions in office was to abandon the deal, which many considered a victory for China, even though the pact had already been blocked in the Senate. Mr. Trump has long questioned the United States’ financial and military commitment to Japan’s security, and he has criticized the automaker Toyota for planning to produce cars in Mexico. An editorial in the Mainichi Shimbun, a   paper in Japan, questioned why Mr. Abe was not taking a stronger stand against Mr. Trump: “It is hard to understand why the prime minister is defending a president who destroyed the trade accord  —   formed after nearly six years of arduous negotiations  —   on his fourth day in office. ” Given the stakes, Mr. Abe has refrained from open criticism of Mr. Trump and is scheduled to meet with him in Washington early in February. The Trump effect has been felt even in Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has come under criticism for saying it is not his job to comment on the domestic policies of other countries. This after securing a pledge from the president on Sunday to honor an Obama administration agreement to accept refugees detained on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus. In Canada, too, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has had his Trump moments. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular in the country, but as Mr. Trudeau’s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, once said, proximity to America “is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly or temperate the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt. ” So instead of provoking a fight, Mr. Trudeau moved swiftly to make contact with officials in the new administration and reshaped his cabinet to promote ministers with experience in the United States. Mr. Trump made problems right away for the Canadian leader by giving the   to the Keystone XL pipeline, putting Mr. Trudeau in an uncomfortable position between environmentalists and oil producers. If Mr. Trump goes after Canada on trade issues, as seems likely, Mr. Trudeau is expected to become significantly more vocal and critical. But to date he has avoided public criticism of the American president, a reticence that may have helped over the weekend, after Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration. Canada was able to get quick clarification from the White House that the directive would not affect the movement of Canadian citizens and dual nationals into the United States. After fumbling its initial response, Britain got essentially the same clarification 15 hours later, which London hailed as a result of its special relationship with Mr. Trump. While Britain may have been influential, however, the White House was already narrowing the initial interpretations of the executive order. But not before Mrs. May was attacked for timidity in the face of outrage by her own legislators and by the opposition. Still, the “special relationship” has never been an equal one, so some degree of humiliation often goes with the territory. As one message on Twitter, posted by the user @Locke1689, a professed “progressive conservative,” read: “Actively snubbing the world’s only superpower would be gross diplomatic  . ”"
"It is an enduring mystery how juvenile salmon, at 12cm long and weighing perhaps only 20g, can leave a Scottish river in springtime, undertake a sojourn of thousands of kilometres around the North Atlantic, and return between one and four years later to their rivers to spawn. This is for good reason. A returning salmon, known as a grilse, will have grown 100-fold in size from the rich feeding to be found at sea. But the journey is not without risk. Between 80-90% of grilse, and fewer still multi-winter fish, will not survive their journey. But the serious problems wild salmon now face at sea go beyond the hardships of their itinerant lifecycle. These have been intensively researched throughout Europe and North America, and it’s clear that in recent decades salmon mortality rates at sea have increased enormously. While possible causes include natural predation, disease and parasites, or being caught up in fishery by-catch, the truth is we just don’t know. My research, in collaboration with Marine Scotland Science, has focused not on mortality rates and population decline, but on the changes in size and quality of salmon returning to Scottish rivers over the past 50 years. This variation seems to stem from the effects of climate change on the ocean, and the anomalously high temperatures salmon find in the North Atlantic. In 2008 we published a study of quality, or condition factor, of adult salmon returning to Scotland between 1993-2006. This was measured by dividing the observed weight by the expected weight for a fish of that length. The skinny fish, top, is less than its expected weight by more than a quarter (26%), while the bottom fish is illustrative of the long-term norm, being only 4% underweight for its length. Some individual salmon return in spectacularly good condition, perhaps by chance finding areas of rich feeding. But far more common in recent years are less well nourished salmon showing poor growth. Examining extensive salmon records dating back to 1963, we can see the long-term pattern. Between 1963-1993 there was nothing unusual. During the late 1990s the average condition increased to a high in 1997, but then fell precipitously until 2006.  Salmon anglers in Scotland recall 2006 as the “year of skinny grilse” – understandably so, because that year’s salmon were not only in poor condition but also unusually short. Since 2006 the average salmon length of salmon has increased slightly but the average condition factor is consistently low, fluctuating around at least 7% below average. The data up to 2013 show no signs of improvement. For example, between 1997-2010 the average weight of grilse returning to the River North Esk in east Scotland fell by 29% from 2.35kg to 1.67kg. And for summer-returning salmon that stayed at sea for two winters the average has plummeted from 6.18kg to only 3.63kg. Clearly, salmon are currently having a tough time of it at sea. Warming of the North Atlantic is exerting an indirect effect on the fish, as rising temperatures change the abundance and quality of the plankton salmon feed upon. These major, climate-related shifts in oceanic plankton are well documented throughout the North Atlantic. But this is more problematic still for salmon, as they stop feeding before re-entering the river and then starve themselves while swimming upstream, relying entirely on stored fats to survive the months ahead before their autumn spawning. We’ve found that, at the point the re-entry to the river, the skinniest salmon, as much as a third underweight, have up to 80% less fat reserves than the norm, with obvious implications for their chance of survival and reproduction. Taken together, this presents a rather dismal prospect for wild salmon. Many fish are returning smaller, skinnier and with lower fat reserves than in the past. Smaller fish produce fewer eggs, and their lack of fat reserves probably means they are of poorer quality. The next generation of juvenile smolts that arise from spawnings migrate to sea and encounter North Atlantic waters that are persistently warmer and food-poor. The concern is that this might comprise a downward spiral for wild salmon. Pragmatically, there is not a great deal that fishery managers can do to alleviate the salmon’s problems at sea. And in fairness salmon anglers are increasingly aware of conservation needs; catch and release is widely practiced on most salmon rivers in Scotland. But we can manage freshwater habitats to maximise survival and spawning success of those salmon that do return to our rivers, and of juveniles prior to their journey to sea. As an ecologist, I am endlessly curious as to how salmon are able to migrate such distances across the ocean, with no prior experience, parental guidance or SatNav – although part of me actually hopes we never do unravel this intriguing migration mystery. But for us to effectively conserve salmon stocks for the future it is critical to fully understand why our salmon are currently suffering so, in rivers and at sea, and to do all we can to maximise the production of juveniles.  This approach might be considered as “lambs to the slaughter”, but over millions of years salmon have survived ice ages and eras of global warming. Helping salmon populations recover naturally is clearly a better strategy than rearing them artificially."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman site EurActiv.de here reports that Poland’s new president Andrzej Duda refuses to extend the UN Kyoto Treaty until 2020. EurActiv writes this “blocks the ratification process” just a month before the historic UN climate summit in Paris (COP21)”. Duda’s move comes just two days after the victory of his conservative Law and Justice Party in Poland’s parliamentary election.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 pl via Commons – https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andrzej_Duda_portret.JPG#/media/File:Andrzej_Duda_portret.JPG
According to the EurActiv report, Duda is requesting a more detailed analysis of the matter on climate, writing in a statement:
Binding Poland to an international agreement that will affect Poland’s economy and the therein connected social costs should require a detailed analysis of the legal and economic impacts. These impacts have not been sufficiently explained.”
EurActiv.de explains that the 1992 Kyoto Treaty expired back in 2012 and that a number of countries have yet to ratify an extension. Duda’s party won Poland’s national parliamentary elections just two days earlier in a landmark victory, promising voters that the country’s coal industry would be protected. 90% of Poland’s electrical power is generated by coal. Analysts expect a bumpy ride ahead regarding relations with the EU. The European Union agreed last year to cut greenhouse gases by 40 percent by 2030.
Experts see little chance of preventing Duda’s move. Kamila Pacquel of the Brussels-based Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) AFP wrote the AFP that the new signals coming from Poland “does not help things”.
Greenpeace Poland called Duda’s announcemtn a “bad sign” the could stall Europe’s movement on emissions limitation by the 28 member states.

Congratulations, New Zealand. You lost at the rugby and cricket World Cups again, but at least you finished ahead of Australia. Now you can also claim the dubious prize of out-virtue-signalling Australia on climate change.



The passage of the Zero Carbon Act has New Zealand head and shoulders above Australia’s action to prevent dangerous climate change, according to a new trans-Tasman analysis.



A score card published by climate action advocates 350.org has praised New Zealand’s “global leadership” on reducing emissions, while Australia’s policy inaction is described as “a source of great shame”.



350.org is, of course, the activist group led by alarmist flog Bill McKibben, who was last seen standing in an unseasonal snow-storm in Washington, shouting that it was “getting hot in here”. New Zealand is being damned by faint praise from the peanut gallery.



To get an idea of how unhinged McKibben’s little clown car activist group really are, they’re busily shouting the same, debunked (by actual climate scientists, no less) idiocy that Australia’s current bushfires were somehow “caused” by the Morrison government.



Linking policy paralysis on climate change to the bushfires ravaging many parts of Australia this month, 350 is urging local politicians to follow the lead set by their New Zealand counterparts.



“As we can see with these devastating fires, there are real consequences to the political games our politicians want to play,” 350 Australia deputy chief executive Glen Klatovsky said.



The fires are a consequence of the current drought, which is part of a long-term natural cycle afflicting Australia, and which climate scientist Andy Pitman explicitly ruled out being linked to climate change.



Jacinda Ardern’s government legislated not only their Paris Agreement target this month, but went further by committing to becoming a net zero carbon-emitting country by 2050.



Cross-party support for the law and the establishment of an independent climate commission has relegated debate on climate change from a top-line political issue.



New Zealand also boasts an emissions trading scheme, already operational for over a decade, an ambitious goal to plant one billion trees by 2028 and another to have its entire electricity needs met by renewable energy by 2035.



“Ambitious goals” and “Jacinda Ardern” are something of a running joke, of course. She spouts lots of “ambitious goals” – and then [completely fails to deliver](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/perfectly-pathetic-ardern-achieves-nothing/). [Kiwibuild](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/government-should-be-held-to-account-on-kiwibuild/), anyone?



As for the Zero Carbon goal, that’s just more Ardern smoke and mirrors. By [excluding biogenic methane](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/ardern-the-ultimate-climate-hypocrite/) from the “zero” goal, Ardern has deceitfully shifted the shell hiding the gigantic pea that is New Zealand’s single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. In any case, both countries’ emissions are minuscule. Reducing them or not will make nine-tenths of bugger-all difference to the climate.



But, hey, it’s climate activism. Deceitful virtue-signalling is almost mandatory.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman scientists Lüning and Vahrenholt bring up two recent papers on what by now is obvious to almost everyone.
=================================
The sun drives the climate
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Antarctica is a fantastic place for a research laboratory. A number of research stations are scattered on the continent, including the Russian Vostok station.
Using ice cores, the climate history of the past 11,000 years has been reconstructed in detail. In January 2015 Zhao and Feng published a paper in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics. In this paper they compared the temperature development to solar activity. In the temperature curve the scientists found the characteristic cycles that correspond to the solar Suess-de Vries cycle (208 years) and the Eddy cycle (1000 years). What stood out was the slight time delay of 30 to 40 years between the solar trigger and the temperature reaction. The scientists concluded that solar activity fluctuations played a large role in the development of the Antarctic climate.
Here’s the abstract:
Correlation between solar activity and the local temperature of Antarctica during the past 11,000 years
The solar impact on the Earth’s climate change is a long topic with intense debates. Based on the reconstructed data of solar sunspot number (SSN), the local temperature in Vostok (T), and the atmospheric CO2 concentration data of Dome Concordia, we investigate the periodicities of solar activity, the atmospheric CO2 and local temperature in the inland Antarctica as well as their correlations during the past 11,000 years before AD 1895. We find that the variations of SSN and T have some common periodicities, such as the 208 year (yr), 521 yr, and ~1000 yr cycles. The correlations between SSN and T are strong for some intermittent periodicities. However, the wavelet analysis demonstrates that the relative phase relations between them usually do not hold stable except for the millennium-cycle component. The millennial variation of SSN leads that of T by 30–40 years, and the anti-phase relation between them keeps stable nearly over the whole 11,000 years of the past. As a contrast, the correlations between CO2 and T are neither strong nor stable. These results indicate that solar activity might have potential influences on the long-term change of Vostok’s local climate during the past 11,000 years before modern industry.
Related to this is also a paper by Volobuev, which was published in the May 2014 journal of Climate Dynamics. For the region around the Vostok station the author described a “relatively high climate sensitivity” for the solar temperature drive. Here’s the abstract:
Central antarctic climate response to the solar cycle
Antarctic “Vostok” station works most closely to the center of the ice cap among permanent year-around stations. Climate conditions are exclusively stable: low precipitation level, cloudiness and wind velocity. These conditions can be considered as an ideal model laboratory to study the surface temperature response on solar irradiance variability during 11-year cycle of solar activity. Here we solve an inverse heat conductivity problem: calculate the boundary heat flux density (HFD) from known evolution of temperature. Using meteorological temperature record during (1958–2011) we calculated the HFD variation about 0.2–0.3 W/m2 in phase with solar activity cycle. This HFD variation is derived from 0.5 to 1 °C temperature variation and shows relatively high climate sensitivity per 0.1 % of solar radiation change. This effect can be due to the polar amplification phenomenon, which predicts a similar response 0.3–0.8 °C/0.1 % (Gal-Chen and Schneider in Tellus 28:108–121, 1975). The solar forcing (TSI) is disturbed by volcanic forcing (VF), so that their linear combination TSI + 0.5VF empirically provides higher correlation with HFD (r = 0.63 ± 0.22) than TSI (r = 0.50 ± 0.24) and VF (r = 0.41 ± 0.25) separately. TSI shows higher wavelet coherence and phase agreement with HFD than VF.”

Leftist darling Tim Flannery is well known for his unfortunate habit of making dud climate predictions, then flatly denying ever having made them. Less remarked is his habit of letting slip with statements which raise the ire of his lefty chums. For instance, in his _The Future Eaters_ , Flannery argued that New Zealand’s Maori population had over-consumed their natural resources to the extent that they were reduced to cannibalism to survive. The arrival of Europeans, he hinted, saved the Maori from self-extinction.



Flannery was suitably chastened for his “racist” view – in much the same way that Aboriginal academic Marcia Langton has berated Flannery for what she claims is his “racist belief that indigenous Australians are ‘enemies of nature’”.



Then there was Flannery’s sensible argument that a well-regulated whaling industry should be considered. You can guess how well that went over.



Flannery has also argued that Australia should secure its future by remaining a low-population agricultural nation – the “food bowl of Asia” – and concentrating its defence efforts on keeping out regional powers who might think to grab all that food-producing land for themselves.



Who wants to take bets on how long that argument will last, now that the wicked farmers are taking a stand against the virtuous environmentalists and animal activists?



Finally! The National Farmers Federation has announced that it will implement a long-term public relations campaign to mobilise public and political support for a major expansion of the agricultural industry in Australia and to combat the zealotry of animal rights activists and green extremists. Such a response is well overdue.



The NFF is making the same argument as Flannery: Australia is well placed to be the major food supplier to a growing world population. But the NFF has, belatedly, realised that it is fighting a deeply-entrenched elite which views all agriculture as the “rape of Mother Earth”. This urban elite is implacably dedicated to attacking and shutting down development in almost all forms.



Australia is afflicted with deeply entrenched anti-development forces. It must therefore re-affirm its national identity as a frontier society, ready to engage in nation-building projects on a continental scale, and prepared systematically to harness the natural and human resources required to develop a thriving, highly productive society. This is a battle that must be won in the realm of culture, and it can no more be ignored than the financial or physical infrastructure requirements of this gigantic project can be ignored.



Radical environmentalists have had a free ride in Australia for decades, shutting down innumerable worthwhile projects and strangling others in green tape and with “law-fare”…complex, capital-intensive projects will be slandered, stymied, suffocated and sabotaged by a well-resourced cadre of cosseted vandals (“protesters”) aided and protected by an array of political, legal, judicial, academic and media supporters.



Even worse, these modern-day Luddites are funded by the taxpayer, not just through the dole, but through publicly-funded bodies like the “Environmental Defenders Office”.



Put succinctly, the primary industry sector (both agriculture and mining) in Australia is facing a crisis because neither it nor various governments over the past fifty years have been prepared to combat the corrosive impact of the black-armband view of history. They opted out of the ideological struggle and now they are paying the price.



Nevertheless, the challenge must be undertaken.



That the hero-myths of the bushman, jackaroo and jillaroo, the ANZAC, and other heroic characters refuse to die suggests how deep the love of the frontier is embedded in the Australian psyche.



Moreover, there is significant latent popular support for the nation-building, frontier society ethos that historically underpinned the development of Australia […]for generations the opportunities provided by this nation-building project attracted millions of settlers and immigrants determined to make their lives in Australia and to hand something on to their children and future generations. It is this ambitious, forward-thinking and optimistic nation-building spirit that explains the ease with which our society remains remarkably cohesive despite the fact that a huge proportion of its population is overseas-born.



Vast numbers of Australians want to make something of their country and to contribute significantly to the world. Hopefully, the NFF and the federal and New South Wales governments are now recognising that a once-in-a-generation opportunity now exists to re-kindle the foundational spirit of Australia as a frontier society. However, fine talk will not suffice, and these key actors must be prepared to engage vigorously in an ideological struggle if the enormous damage inflicted on Australia by fifty years of Green-Left propaganda is to be successfully combated and the enormous potential of our country is once again to be realised.

Germany’s DWD national weather service now presents the preliminary weather results for October 2015 in Germany, a region that finds itself in the middle of Europe.
Like September, also October is coming in cooler than normal, i.e. no sign of climate change. The real fact of the matter is that if it weren’t for all the multibillion-dollar funded hype in the media, nobody would even know that there is any climate change going on. The DWD writes that October was “a bit too cool; a really typical October“.
Typical? Not really. We need to recall that “typical” is hardly what the models say we should be having now. According to the data recorded by Germany’s almost 2000 weather stations, the country’s mean temperature for October 2015 was only 8.4 °C, which is 0.6°C below than the 1961-1990 mean and 0.8°C below the 1981-2010 mean. Climate models on the other hand projected that today’s October mean temperature by now should be some 1.2°C warmer than the mean, i.e. near 10.2°C. That means that October 2015 was in fact close to 2°C below what was expected by models.
It really is now time to start comparing measured observed temperatures to the modeled projections, and not to the mean of some arbitrarily chosen reference period. Obviously October’s observed difference is gaping and the failure of the models is becoming ever more glaring with each passing year.
Along with the cold temperatures, October 2015 in the Vaterland also brought with it snow – down to the flatlands. Moreover the town of Treuen, northeast of Plauen, saw 12 cm of the white stuff. The coldest temperature recorded was -7.5°C at Deutschneudorf-Brüderwiese.
On the 14th of October in the city of Gera the temperature did not even climb above +1°C. The DWD writes that “on this day almost all of the state of Thuringia disappeared under a blanket of snow, where at Weimar-Schöndorf the greatest snow depth of 8 cm was reached”.
Overall in Germany October was the 9th driest on record, and it was 11 percent less sunny than normal. How does this compare to the models? They projected wet and mild falls and winters, and so from a precipitation point of view here too the models are totally off. Well, at least they got the sunshine a little bit right.
Austria more than 1°C colder than model projections
Germany’s southeastern neighbor Austria also came in cooler …0.1°C below the “long-term average”, so reports the Austrian ZAMG national weather service. That means Austria was more than 1°C colder than what the models projected we should have for this time. Strangely the ZAMG writes that since 2000, 124 months were warmer than normal and 66 were too cool. How these months are distributed over the period and what the trend has been since 2000 gets no mention at all. Hmmm. Are they hiding something? Well, at least the DWD’s new website no longer carries the graphic of rising temperatures.
Unlike Germany, Austria saw a very wet and gray month. The ZAMG writes that “it was wetter than average (40 percent more precipitation) and gray (15 precent less sunshine hours)“.

"“Born on a perilous rock” is the title of a classic book by W J Lewis which describes Aberystwyth past and present; last weekend the town fully lived up to this description.  To all intents and purposes, 3 January started as a normal mid-winter day in Aberystwyth with a gale howling in off the sea and spectacular waves crashing off the sea front. Most of the university had extended the Christmas vacation to have a few more days’ rest and less that 150 of the 700 plus students who live in our sea front halls had returned to prepare for their exams. That it was going to be an unusual evening became apparent when John received a call from his mother-in-law, living in sheltered accommodation by the harbour, saying she was being asked to leave because of the storm.  At much the same time Rebecca received a call saying Ceredigion County Council workers were trying to deliver leaflets by hand to all student residences, advising their occupants that evacuate the promenade at least one hour before the high tide at 9.11pm. How does one evacuate numerous buildings in darkness in the teeth of a storm on a midwinter night and transport people to a place of safety? The answer was to intercept the leaflets and set off the fire alarms in each building in turn, advising the assembled residents to prepare a bag of essentials to be ready to be taken to the main campus.  Transport was by requisitioning the small fleet of minibuses owned by the student unions and directing the students to a central place, in a street behind the sea front and from there to the Penglais Campus, several hundred feet above sea level, where we opened up our main refectory and fed and watered our evacuees. By 8.45pm the evacuation was complete.  Having taught and researched hazard management for 20 years John had the opportunity to put theory into practice as it was apparent that his research field had come to him.  It was clear we had to make a number of decisions. When could our students return to their halls?  This was straightforward, once National Resources Wales issued this advice and when we had checked our buildings we transported our students back to their halls at 1.30am. Had the risk of spring tide coupled with storm surge diminished?  No. The weather forecast predicted a number of storm events coupled with high tides through to the morning of the 7th. Was travel to Aberystwyth easy?  No, the transport infrastructure was breaking down and trains were not reaching Aberystwyth, being stuck in various flooded stretches of the railway. Could we easily evacuate 1,000 students from the seafront in the middle of the night during a storm? No. By midnight on the 3rd, having established these points we made two key decisions: First, discourage all students from travelling to Aberystwyth from their homes until further notice and certainly no earlier than the 8th.  This guidance was issued by email and a variety of social media. Second, postpone all scheduled examinations by one week. These bought us the space and the capacity to manage the sequence of storm surges and tides we then faced. On the morning of the 4th it was clear the seafront in Aberystwyth was badly damaged but we had no need to evacuate during the day as the wind speeds had fallen. On the evening of the 4th given the slightly lower wind speed, we announced a partial evacuation of the sea-facing rooms but not of the whole building at high tide. On the 5th it was clear we were facing exceptionally high spring tides, storm force winds and a significant storm surge.  All students were clearly briefed by email, social media and video and were evacuated to Penglais Campus again, where they were very well fed and given a bed for the night. The clear lesson learned for us was to break the problem down into its constituent parts, establish what our priority was and then make the decisions we needed to make, however large and potentially disruptive they may be. We are now planning for the next spring tides in late January and early February and in particular the very high 5.8 metre tide scheduled to arrive late at night on 2nd February. Wish us luck."

Just recently, one Tasmanian council had the guts to swim against the tide of local government virtue-signalling and almost unanimously reject a motion to declare a “climate emergency”.



Despite the outrage of the green lobby, the council made the right decision. Firstly, there was no action plan attached to the motion: it was literal virtue-signalling. Secondly, claims of a [“climate emergency”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/auckland-councillors-declare-climate-emergency/) are plain hysteria which do nothing but whip up panic. They are inimical to the cause of sensible climate action. People in a panic do not make rational decisions.



For a good case study of the danger of panicked decisions – and a solid refutation of the greens’ beloved [“precautionary principle”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle)– we need only look to Japan.



A newly released study of deaths in the aftermath of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has called for precaution with regard to the much-touted Precautionary Principle.



The study, by economists at the universities of Columbia (United States), Nagoya (Japan) and Verona (Italy), and published by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, an independent economic research institute in Bonn, Germany, concluded that the closing of Japan’s nuclear power plants after the 2011 acci­dent at Fukushima resulted in death from cold of thousands of people.



Domestic electricity costs rose by up to 38 per cent after the closures of the nuclear plants, making life-sustaining home-heating unaffordable for many people, especially the elderly.



The Fukushima disaster was about as bad as nuclear accidents get, beaten only by the monumental cock-up of Chernobyl. Unlike Chernobyl, however, the accident itself caused no deaths and the resultant radiation is unlikely to do so in the future. What it **did** cause, though, was a panic. Japan quickly shut down all its nuclear plants.



In reality, there had been no damage to any of the nuclear plants other than Fukushima Daiichi, and none had any demonstrable risk of radiation leaks. There was no scientific reason for closing these plants. Doing so was a precaution – and an unnecessary precaution that cost the population dearly.



The sudden loss of the reliable (and safe) nuclear power forced Japan to import expensive fossil fuels. Power prices spiked. Consequently, many power consumers simply could not afford to keep their heaters on that winter. At least 1280, and up to 4500, deaths are attributed to this rapid spike in power prices. But these are not the only deaths laid at the feet of the precautionary principle.



The Japanese Government had acted prudently in immediately evacuating the region exposed to the risk of radiation and contaminated water, but then erred in maintaining the evacuation for several years. Over 1200 deaths are officially attributed to physical and mental trauma caused by the evacuation and prolonged residence in shelters, with 90 per cent of the victims aged over 66.



Radiation levels back in their empty homes were at levels common throughout the world and perfectly safe. Maintaining the evacuation as a precaution was unnecessary and a disaster for many…Applying the “precautionary principle” beyond the Fukushima region, and for so long at Fukushima, did more harm than good.



The precautionary principle emphasises the worst-case scenario and justifies action on the grounds that no harm will be caused if those worst fears prove unfounded. This study provides a salient reminder that this assumption is flawed: there is always a downside to the precautionary principle.



That reminder is timely for Australia, where the rush into renewable energy sources has already pushed up the cost of electricity to homes and industry.



As already reported by _The BFD_ , the push to adopt renewables in Britain is estimated to have led to [5500 deaths last year](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/yes-greta-people-are-dying-you-your-friends-are-killing-them/), mostly of the poor and elderly. The precautionary principle is invoked as a virtuous rule for life by the Greens. In practice, like much Green ideology, it is a disastrous folly which most hurts the poor and vulnerable merely to massage the consciences of wealthy twits.

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuestion. What happens when the German public television puts out a report that happens to be honest and skeptical when it comes to climate change? Answer: Viewers are so surprised that they actually take the time to upload it at YouTube!

Hat-tip: here.
The above clip by MDR German public television features seasoned meteorologist Thomas Globig, who somehow managed to get his message broadcast during a recent weather report. He begins by asking: “Is CO2 a climate killer, or not?”
Surprisingly his response was what we typically expect to hear from the skeptic side. It’s a surprise he hasn’t been fired by now.
Scientists are in dispute
At 0:35 he tells his viewers that the scientific opinions on CO2 and its impact on climate are in fact split among the experts. “The opinion of climate scientists are totally divergent.” Contrary to the 97& consensus that often gets claimed, Globig tells us there is no consensus and that the subject is in heated dispute. He adds that the global warming theory is far from being clear.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




And there are good reasons there is no consensus, Globig explains. At 1:25 he reminds us that CO2 is only a trace gas that makes up only 0.04% of the atmosphere and that over the past 160 years atmospheric CO2 increased only 0.01%. In the past Globig reminds that the earth at times saw “much higher concentrations of CO2“, and that even at times of higher CO2 concentrations the earth saw ice ages.
Globig: Man cannot stop climate change
At 2:22 he says that climate change is normal and that it is never constant. Man trying to stop climate change can never work and it would be like trying to stop the next storm.
At 2:40 he poses the real question that needs to be answered: Is the warming caused by man, or by nature? Globig says he cannot answer that question in the segment but points out that both weather and climate are non-linear, chaotic systems and thus neither can be predicted. “Neither can the climate be accurately forecasted over 20, 30 or 50 years.”
Also last year on MDR television Thomas Globig questioned the intensity of global warming. Below he is shown presenting a temperature chart for his viewers in the city of Dresden:

"**One of Joe Biden's senior aides has attacked Facebook over its handling of conspiracy theories, calls to violence and disinformation in the days following the US election.**
""Our democracy is on the line. We need answers,"" tweeted Bill Russo, who is deputy press secretary to the US president-elect.
Facebook responded saying it had introduced ""new products and policies"".
These include a ""probation"" measure to tackle problems in its groups.
It involves tasking the administrators of some politically themed pages with checking that all members' posts within them follow Facebook's rules. They have been warned that failure to comply could lead to their groups being shut down.
""We built the largest third-party fact-checking network of any platform and they remain actively focused on claims about the election, including conspiracy theories,"" the firm added in a statement.
""We changed our products to ensure fewer people see false information and are made aware of it when they do, and highlighted reliable election information where nearly everyone on Facebook and Instagram saw that Vice President Biden was the projected winner.""
Facebook has also removed a network of pages linked to President Donald Trump's ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon, which anti-disinformation campaigners had said were using ""co-ordinated activity to spread voter fraud misinformation at scale"".
The social network has also frozen Mr Bannon's personal page, preventing him from posting further content, according to the Washington Post.
But Mr Russo said it should have gone further.
""Steve Bannon literally called for the beheading of FBI director Wray and [infectious disease expert] Dr Fauci in a video on November 3,"" he wrote.
""It was live on Facebook for 10 hours before it was removed after a journalist inquired about the video.
""Bannon? His page is still live on Facebook.""
Twitter suspended Mr Bannon last week.
Other complaints by Mr Russo included that Facebook had:
Mr Russo's comments point to Facebook facing further scrutiny over the months ahead.
In December, Mr Biden told the New York Times: ""I've never been a fan of Facebook, as you probably know. I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he's a real problem.""
Mr Biden went on to suggest Facebook should lose legal protections that prevent it being sued for ""propagating falsehoods they know to be false"".
Ben Rhodes - who was the US deputy national security adviser when Mr Biden was vice-president to Barack Obama, and has been tipped to return in the next administration - has also criticised the social network.
""The fact that the leading source of information in America is a profit algorithm-driven cesspool of disinformation and hate speech has to be addressed through regulation,"" he tweeted.
Mr Zuckerberg is likely to face questions about all this next week when he testifies to Senate about Facebook's handling of the election.
Mr Zuckerberg has previously benefited from Facebook board member Peter Thiel's close relationship with President Trump, including being invited to a private dinner at the White House attended by the three men in November.
There has been some speculation he might now turn to Sir Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, for similar help.
In his former role as the UK's deputy prime minister, Sir Nick met with Mr Biden many times, and after quitting politics interviewed the US politician on his personal podcast.
""They did get on well and had a very constructive relationship,"" someone who worked with Sir Nick in government, who asked not to be identified, told the BBC.
""The fact that he knows him obviously gives [Facebook] a start, but I couldn't say anything about what the Biden administration now thinks.""
Another possible point of contact would be Jessica Hertz, formerly one of Facebook's senior lawyers, who joined the Biden campaign in September.
The Guardian has also previously reported that Facebook uses lobbyists include a former assistant to Mr Biden among others with connections to the Democrats.
But one tech industry watcher suggested one of the biggest things Facebook had going in its favour was that Mr Biden faced having a House of Representatives with a smaller Democratic majority, and a possible Republican-led Senate.
""Facebook could come under real pressure to make changes, in part because Twitter has been much more interventionist,,"" said Stephanie Hare, who has authored a forthcoming book about technology ethics.
""But that might not come via legal action - because of the political situation - but rather via giving statements to the press and playing the tech companies off against each other."""

==================================
Global temperatures plummet in just a single week – NH one degree colder
By Schneefan
After the global temperature anomaly reached a peak in early December, 2015, we witnessed the global mean temperature plummeting massively in just a single week in mid December. The temperature anomalies of the northern hemisphere even fell a full 1°C:
 
The chart shows the daily deviations in global 2-m temperatures with respect to the international WMO 1981-2010 climate mean for the period January 1 to December 19, 2015. After reaching a peak in early December 2015, the global temperature anomalies dropped 0.5°K in just a single week in mid December (black line). The NH (blue line) dropped from 1.2 to 0.2°K. Source: weatherbell.com/temperature.php.
With a global temperature deviation of 0.27°K, 2015 thus far, as of 19 December, is rank 6 and will remain there. Chart MouseOver Tool

So it is certain: 2015 will not be a record warm year!
The cause for all this  – and the high warm deviation over November and early December 2015 and the recent plummet – is the powerful but in no way record-setting El Niño event, which likely reached its high point in November/December 2015.  Also helping was the huge drop in global tropical temperature anomalies.

The chart shows the daily deviations of the global 2 m temperatures (black curve) and the tropics (20°S-20°N, red curve) with respect to the international WMO 1981-2010 climate mean for the period January 1 to December 19, 2015. After reaching a peak in early December 2015, the global temperature anomalies dropped 0.5°K in just a single week in mid December. In the tropics the drop was 0.4°K. Source: weatherbell.com/temperature.php.
And so it goes with the global temperature: ENSO models: La Niña coming in the second half of 2016.
From this the question arises: After 2014 and 2015, will 2016 also not be a global record warm year? Have world climate conferences become quickly senseless?
And how will the current very mild winter weather in Germany and Europe proceed? According to the latest model forecasts, indications are mounting that this is about to change after Christmas time.

"**Children's charity the NSPCC has said a drop in Facebook's removal of harmful content was a ""significant failure in corporate responsibility"".**
Facebook's own records show its Instagram app removed almost 80% less graphic content about suicide and self-harm between April and June this year than in the previous quarter.
Covid restrictions meant most of its content moderators were sent home.
Facebook said it prioritised the removal of the most harmful content.
Figures published on Thursday showed that as restrictions were lifted and moderators started to go back to work, the number of removals went back up to pre-Covid levels.
""We want to do everything we can to keep people safe on Instagram and we can report that from July to September we took action on 1.3m pieces of suicide and self-harm content, over 95% of which we found proactively,"" said Instagram's head of public policy Tara Hopkins in a statement.
""We've been clear about the impact of Covid-19 on our content-review capacity, so we're encouraged that these latest numbers show we're now taking action on even more content, thanks to improvements in our technology.
""We're continuing to work with experts to improve our policies and we are in discussions with regulators and governments about how we can bring full use of our technology to the UK and EU so we can proactively find and remove more harmful suicide and self-harm posts.""
After the death of the teenager Molly Russell, Facebook committed itself to taking down more graphic posts, pictures and even cartoons about self-harm and suicide.
But the NSPCC said the reduction in takedowns had ""exposed young users to even greater risk of avoidable harm during the pandemic"".
The social network has responded by saying ""despite this decrease we prioritised and took action on the most harmful content within this category"".
Chris Gray is an ex-Facebook moderator who is now involved in a legal dispute with the company.
""I'm not surprised at all,"" he told the BBC.
""You take everybody out of the office and send them home, well who's going to do the work?""
That leaves the automatic systems in charge.
But they still miss posts, in some cases even when the creators themselves have added trigger warnings flagging that the images featured contain blood, scars and other forms of self-harm.
Mr Gray says it is clear that the technology cannot cope.
""It's chaos, as soon as the humans are out, we can see... there's just way, way more self-harm, child exploitation, this kind of stuff on the platforms because there's nobody there to deal with it.""
Facebook is also at odds with moderators about their working conditions.
More than 200 workers have signed an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg complaining about being forced back into offices which they consider unsafe.
The staff claimed the firm was ""needlessly risking"" their lives. Facebook has said many are still working from home, and it has ""exceeded health guidance on keeping facilities safe"" for those who do need to come in.
The figures published on Thursday in Facebook's latest community standards enforcement report again raise questions about the need for greater external regulation.
The UK government's promised Online Harms Bill would impose a statutory duty of care on social media providers and create a new regulator.
But it has been much delayed and it is thought legislation won't be introduced until next year.
Ian Russell, Molly's father, said there was a need for urgent action.
""I think everyone has a responsibility to young and vulnerable people, it's really hard,"" he explained.
""I don't think the social media companies set up their platforms to be purveyors of dangerous, harmful content but we know that they are and so there's a responsibility at that level for the tech companies to do what they can to make sure their platforms are as safe as is possible.""
The NSPCC is more forthright.
""Sadly, young people who needed protection from damaging content were let down by Instagram's steep reduction in takedowns of harmful suicide and self-harm posts,"" said Andy Burrows, the charity's head of child safety online policy.
""Although Instagram's performance is returning to pre-pandemic levels, young people continue to be exposed to unacceptable levels of harm.
""The government has a chance to fix this by ensuring the Online Harms Bill gives a regulator the tools and sanctions necessary to hold big tech to account.""
Last week, Instagram announced it was deploying new software tools across the EU that would lead to more automatic removals of the worst kind of content.
Facebook said ""our proactive detection rates for violating content are up from the second quarter across most policies"".
It put this down to the development of AI tools that have helped it detect offending posts in a wider range of languages.

"SAN FRANCISCO  —   On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration. By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination. Mr. Trump’s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley’s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its    approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump’s actions “are so   it pains us all” and that “it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. ” Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. “We must stand with those who are affected,” he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the   man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He   obliged. “I’m here because I’m a refugee,” Mr. Brin said, according to a Twitter post by the Forbes writer Ryan Mac. The tech companies’ reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did. That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple   whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump’s order proclaimed that “the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States” and would be suspended indefinitely. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said that his   had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam. “Like many of you, I’’m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Friday. Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump’s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was “not the best way to address the country’s challenges. ” Mr. Musk was born in South Africa. Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that “on every level  —   moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.  —   this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. ” Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, “there was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is. ” Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. “Almost every company’s products  —   Google, Apple, Airbnb  —   has a global customer base,” Mr. Levie said. “These policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors. ” The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that “  or   of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia,” an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a   December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. “We’re going to be there for you,” Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha   24, an   software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. “It may be my naïveté about how politics and industries interact, but I don’t interpret the tech community’s opposition to the president as a political stance,” Mr. Tameemi said. “It seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them. ” The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was “concerned. ” Apple said, “It is not a policy we support. ” Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards” and said it would create “collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values. ” Microsoft was not the only company to become bolder in a few hours. Around 10 a. m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying “open doors bring all of US together. ” By 6 p. m. he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump’s new policy was “a direct obstacle to our mission. ” It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. “It feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,” said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company’s product  —   a platform for free speech  —   and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg’s, as a director on Facebook’s board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump’’s campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory team. That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled “Standing up for what’s right,” Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers  —   largely immigrants  —   began a   work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order. Uber did not follow suit. Instead, it posted on Twitter that it was suspending surge pricing at Kennedy Airport. That prompted accusations that it was trying to break the strike, which the company awkwardly denied in another Twitter post. On Sunday morning, its competitor Lyft said it was donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years “to defend our Constitution. ” On Sunday afternoon, Uber sharpened its criticism of the ban, calling it “wrong and unjust. ” Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s most prominent   incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen. “After the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,” Mr. Altman said. “Now they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come. ” Mr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p. m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join."

"Reducing waste should be uncontroversial. While the government’s newly published waste prevention programme represents an improvement on previous strategies, it could have been – should have been – far bolder. The 5p tax on single-use plastic bags was welcome and overdue, but it is essentially a token gesture that will not reduce the volume of waste we generate significantly. The government’s waste report highlights several interesting developments, particularly recent work on longer lasting clothing by the publicly-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme – more than 1m tonnes of clothing are discarded each year in the UK. But too often it is unclear how laudable proposals in theory will be put into practice. For instance, the government proposes that products should be designed for environmentally optimal lifespans, with longevity, repair, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling in mind. But it doesn’t explain the process whereby companies might respond to its plea. How does one change the commercial logic that all too often favours short-lived goods, with frequent replacement? Not by fine words alone. A key design requirement for goods should be ease of repair and maintenance. Products must be quick to disassemble in order to minimise labour costs. Spare parts must be available and, crucially, affordable. Yet all too often products suffer from poor design and spare parts are wildly overpriced. When repair work costs more than half the price of a new product, as is frequently the case, it makes no sense to repair when one could buy a new replacement. This is needless waste. It’s simply the case that many companies prefer users to replace faulty products in order to maximise their revenues. And if this has driven, or works hand-in-hand with, our throwaway culture, then it is up to governments to present proposals that will set about changing how we think and act. One intriguing idea in the report is the possibility of emphasising the hiring of goods as a resource-efficient business model. In theory, if the supplier retains ownership of the product – remember when we all used to hire televisions? – then this encourages creating products with greater intrinsic durability. But advocating hire sounds unconvincing coming from a government whose policies have forced the closure of hundreds of specialists with hire expertise – public libraries. A new Community Partnership Fund has been announced to support communities to take steps to tackle waste and encourage reuse and repair. This is excellent, as we can only tackle the waste problem if people work together. But the paltry sum allocated, just £800,000, amounts to £470 per town in England and Wales, which is not going to change the world very fast. It’s tokenism rather than a serious effort to reshape our economy. The Chartered Institute of Wastes Management called the programme “lacklustre”. And seen beside the specific targets for waste reduction implemented by the legislatures in Scotland and Wales, it’s frankly embarrassing. Waste begins when we shop, and the report recognises that consumers need more information about the anticipated life expectancy of their purchases. We’re too often left in the dark. So it’s imperative that more is done to develop some form of lifespan labelling, or that far longer guarantees are offered, replacing the “extended warranties” of dubious value. People need to be able to judge when it is worth paying more for premium priced products. Ultimately, any product will reach the end of its lifespan and become waste. Successive governments have been reticent to introduce weight-related charges for household waste disposal (“pay as you throw”) such as those used in other countries, and in this regard the new waste prevention programme represents – another – missed opportunity. At its heart waste is discarded resources, resources that are finite in supply, and frequently growing in cost. It’s only right that the less a household throws away, the less it should pay in tax."
"QUEBEC  —   In a world often hostile to migration, Canada has stood out, welcoming thousands of refugees fleeing war and seeking a haven. It has been a   time for Canada, proud of its national tolerance. On Sunday, that was upended when a man walked into a mosque and started shooting, killing six people and wounding eight. The man accused of being the gunman, Alexandre Bissonnette, was charged with six counts of murder on Monday. The nation quickly rallied after the attack. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an act of terrorism, and there was a collective outpouring of remorse and empathy. But the attack also forced Canadians to confront a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root particularly among some people in this   corner of the country. It was also a wrenching event for a country not accustomed to mass killings and even less used to the acrimonious immigration debate that has echoed from across the United States. Before Sunday, many Canadians were watching the immigration ban there with fascination and, for the most part, disgust. “Muslim Canadians are valued members of every community and wherever they live they deserve to feel safe they are home here,” Mr. Trudeau said at a memorial near the mosque in the Ste. Foy neighborhood in Monday evening’s biting cold. “We are all Canadians. Let peace unite us all. ” Yet while Canadian public figures of all stripes closed ranks quickly to reaffirm their solidarity with Muslims in Canada and tighten their embrace of multiculturalism, the killings remained a tear in the fabric of a nation in transformation. “Canada took in roughly 30, 000 Syrian refugees in a   period  —   proportionate to the U. S. taking in 225, 000 over that time,” said David B. Harris, a lawyer and a director at Insignis Strategic Research, a counterterrorism consultancy. “These are dramatic developments in the life of any nation. ” Mr. Bissonnette, 27, who was also charged with five counts of attempted murder, appeared at the Quebec City courthouse looking boyish in a white jumpsuit. He was not charged with terrorism, which under Canada’s Criminal Code requires a broad proof of intent to intimidate the public. The shooting was the first time anyone had been killed in a mosque in Canada in such circumstances and was, at least in recent times, a rare event outside the Muslim world. The attack was particularly shocking for Quebec City, where the bulk of the population of 750, 000 works for the provincial government, universities or in tourism. Until Sunday there had not been any murders in the city for 21 months. Mr. Bissonnette was well known to people who monitor   groups in Quebec, where he frequently commented on sites speaking about immigration and Islam. He was a particularly vocal supporter of Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far right, when she visited the city last year. He was a student of anthropology and political science at Laval University, just minutes from where the shooting took place, according to people who monitored his online activities. “He was not a leader and was not affiliated with the groups we know,” said François Deschamps, a job counselor at Carrefour Jeunesse, a community organization that helps young people find jobs. Mr. Deschamps, who also runs an online group to help refugees called Bienvenue aux Réfugiés, said he had watched Mr. Bissonnette’s   postings for about a year. “The minute I saw his picture this morning, I recognized him,” Mr. Deschamps said by telephone, adding that Mr. Bissonnette used his real name online. Mr. Bissonnette and his family live in   a western suburb of Quebec City that lies in the shadow of a towering railroad trestle. Neighbors said there was nothing remarkable about the quiet young man. “We knew the family for 30 years,” said Alain Dufour, a neighbor. He said Mr. Bissonnette and his brother were “normal kids, nothing indicating bizarre behavior. ” Even outspoken critics of the religion recoiled at the prospect that an increasingly acrimonious debate over rising Islamic immigration may have contributed to the violence. Kellie Leitch, a conservative member of Parliament who has proposed screening immigrants for “Canadian values,” issued a statement calling the attack “not just on those gathered in a house of worship but on the very fabric of Canadian society. ” Quebec has had a history of confrontations with the Muslim community. In 2005, the province became the first to explicitly ban the use of Shariah law and, less than a decade later, the Parti Québécois government tried to pass a “charter of values” that would have banned provincial employees from wearing Muslim head scarves and other “overt” religious symbols. Quebec City, meanwhile, is a conservative bastion within the province and home to   radio talk shows that push an   agenda  —   unusual for Canadian broadcasters. Lise Ravary, a columnist for the tabloid Journal de Montreal, said it might be time for the debate to calm down. “I am a very vocal opponent of Islamism, and I realize now that whenever I condemn ISIS a lot of people view this as me condemning every Muslim on earth,” she said by telephone on Monday. “  looms for the common good. ” Mohammed Amin, in charge of social activities at the mosque, said the community had a “cordial relationship” with its neighbors. He dismissed the pig’s head that was left at the mosque’s door last year as “a small incident” that could happen anywhere. But other leaders at the mosque said there have been hate letters, and swastikas painted on its door, episodes that led to the installation of eight security cameras. “We’ve had to be very, very vigilant, careful for our community,” said Boufeldga Benabdallah, a   of the mosque. Of the victims, he said, “The prayed beside us and they were shot in the back because they prayed. ” Ste. Foy, the postwar suburb where the attack occurred, is far from the walled city center, which is stuffed with historic buildings and tourists. The victims came from a variety of countries of origin and occupations. Azzeddine Soufiane, 57, was a butcher with a shop down the street from the mosque. Khaled Belkacemi, the oldest victim at 60, was a professor of soil and   engineering at Laval University, according to members of the mosque. Mamadou Tanou Barry, an information technology worker, and Ibrahima Barry, a provincial public servant, were brothers,   reported. Aboubaker Thabti, 44, came to Canada in 2011 from Tunisia and had two children. A programming analyst with the provincial government, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, was father to three daughters. “Certainly Islamophobia has been increasing for some time,” Samer Majzoub, president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, said by telephone from Montreal. But he said the attack was nonetheless shocking. “It is overwhelming, unthinkable,” he said."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
With Thanksgiving coming up, I thought I’d write about something other than science. A few weekends ago, I went by kayak across Tomales Bay from Marshall to Lairds Landing, where I lived for nine months or so when I was about twenty-five with a wonderful friend and his lady and their son. It had been fifteen years since I was last there, I’d gone for the wake not long after my friend died. I went on this trip with a long-time shipmate of mine, a gifted artist, builder, and blacksmith.
Now, there are lots of words for the gradations of friendship—friends, acquaintances, work-mates, BFFs, room-mates, colleagues, and the like. “Shipmate” means more than any of those to me. It means someone who I’ve been through some storms with at sea.
A shipmate is a relationship based on the fact that at sea, when I go to sleep, I place my life in my shipmate’s hands. And in the same way, when he sleeps he depends on my vigilance and ability. It is a relationship based on dangers faced, storms survived, and obstacles overcome through teamwork and mutual support. A shipmate is someone who I have lived cheek to jowl with, someone whose actions and moods and strengths and weakness are as clear to me as mine are to my shipmate. A shipmate is someone I can wake up early if I’m three-quarters of the way through my midnight-to-four watch and I can’t stay awake no matter what I do, and he dresses and comes on deck with no word of reproach, checks the course, eyes the sails and the wind, takes the helm, and tells me to get some rest, he’s got it … just as he knows I’ve done for him and would again. A good shipmate is a rare thing and a treasure.
In any case, my shipmate had a great history with my friend at Laird’s Landing as well. I’d introduced them, both artists. It was a journey of remembrance for him as much as it was for me. So we tossed the kayaks on his truck, and put in at Marshall. Tomales is a bay with a curious geological history. You know the famous San Andreas fault, the one that caused so much damage in the 1906 earthquake? Well … in the aerial view, you’re looking at it. It runs right down the middle of Tomales Bay. The land on the west (left) side of the bay was once off of LA and (like many Californians) moved north from there. The plants and ecosystems of the land on the left are often different from that on the right.
We paddled across a choppy sea, wind in our face and low fog overhead. There were some whitecaps, what we called “popcorn” when I was a commercial fisherman, but the wind was fresh rather than strong. It was good to come on the place slowly, by boat, just as I had done so many times back when I’d lived there. As we neared the shore, I saw one thing I’d forgotten, the string of small sea-level caves. At one certain stage of the tide and wind, the small bay waves transform the caves into a natural musical instrument. They break across the mouth of the caves, and each one emits an unearthly bass note, with the pitch of the note determined by the size of the cave. When a number of them got going back in the day, I could hear them in my little sugar shack up on the hill above Clayton’s place. Here’s how that all came about.
After my girlfriend and I split up around 1971, the house on the land we’d bought seemed empty. I was hitchhiking one day near the south end of Tomales Bay and I was picked up by an old guy who introduced himself as Clayton Lewis. At least he seemed like an old guy when I was 24, although in fact he was only about 55 at the time. As we were riding along, he mentioned that needed some help with a big piece of oak he had in the back. I offered to help him. We went to the shop of a guy named Blind John, who was a blind boatbuilder in the town of Point Reyes on Tomales Bay. No kidding. Clayton introduced me to him. The guy was stone blind, but he built beautiful boats. His hands were like living creatures, ceaselessly exploring the world around him.
Clayton was a renowned artist and he knew all the really good artists and artisans and craftsmen in the area. We hauled the piece of oak into John’s shop. John had a big bandsaw, Clayton only had a small one. John came and ran his hands over the piece, his restlessly moving fingers questing, appraising the wood. He asked Clayton what it was for. Clayton said he was cutting out a new stem for a Monterrey boat that he was rebuilding. I said I’d fished on Monterrey boats, it was a boat design I loved. Clayton said he was fishing commercially in Tomales Bay. Intrigued, at his invitation I went out to see his place.
Clayton lived in one of the world’s lovelier spots, “Laird’s Landing”. It is a small cove, with a beach, on the west side of Tomales Bay. It was an inholding, surrounded on all sides by the land of the Point Reyes National Seashore. Clayton had a “life estate” on the property. Twenty-five years later, after his death it became part of the National Seashore.
I became close friends with Clayton, and after a few months I put my house and property on the market and moved out to a tiny sugar-shack I built at Laird’s Landing. (My property finally sold a year later. I contacted my girlfriend and sent her half the money. That was the deal and she had more than fulfilled her part, she’d worked as hard as I had on the land and the house.)
Clayton was an artist, and a jeweler, and a boatbuilder, and a fisherman, and a crusty old bugger. He owned three boats, all of them with beautiful lines. I was going to buy a boat once, because it was cheap, even though it was ugly. “Don’t buy it,” he warned, “owning an ugly boat is bad for a man’s spirit.” I didn’t buy it, and I definitely added that to my rules of thumb.
He and his good lady, Judy Perlman, were both jewelers. He’d learned a lot of the art from her, her work is awesome. So I got to learn a lot about jewelry as well. Living with Judy and Clayton and eight-year-old Marcos Lewis for almost a year was like going to the finest boatbuilding/fishing/art/sculpture/woodwork/jewelry school in the world.
For years Clayton had fished one of the world’s most romantic fisheries. It was a night fishery using what’s called a “beach seine”. Clayton had a gorgeous, hundred-year-old ship’s longboat from San Francisco. It had been built in the 1850s and used as a “wherry”, a boat to row goods and passengers to and from the ships anchored out from the piers. It had two sets of oars, with what we used to call “smuggler’s oarlocks”. These are special oarlocks that, unlike the regular kind, are perfectly silent in use. On that boat we used them to avoid scaring the fish, rather than to avoid alerting the Coast Guard.
We’d set out after dark, with both of us wearing hip boots, both of us rowing, and we’d pull for one of the nearby beaches. Tomales Bay is long and narrow with a bar across the mouth, so there’s rarely a big swell. We’d row into the beach. I’d jump out and run the net anchor a little ways inshore from the water’s edge, bury it in the sand, and get in the boat again. As we rowed back out, the anchor rope would start pulling the net off of the back of the boat. We’d set the net in a semicircle, and return to the beach some distance from where we started. Our net had floats at the top, and leads at the bottom, and it now walled off that entire section of the sea. I’d jump out and run down the beach to where I’d set the anchor. Clayton and I would start pulling the net up on the beach and walking towards each other. Eventually, all the fish were in a small area of net in the middle. We’d take out the fish we wanted and let the rest go.
We were fishing for surf perch, but because the net walled off that section entirely we’d catch anything that was there. Stingrays were the most common species besides perch. Some nights we’d catch ten or twenty in every set of the net. We’d pull them aside, take out the fish, and put the stingrays back in the water. Clayton and I were both advocates of disturbing the ocean as little as possible consistent with commercial fishing. We’d pull the rowboat alongside the net, and put the perch, sorted by species, into boxes, along with the odd flounders and other fish that we could sell. Then we’d release the small fish and the ones without commercial value. Here’s His Crustiness at his finest, with the century-old boat we used …

After releasing the fish we didn’t want, we’d walk the boat down the beach in the shallow water. Stack the nets back in the boat, walk up the beach and get the anchor, break out the oars and move on to the next set of the net. In the course of a night we’d do four or five sets.
Then we’d row back to Laird’s Landing and catch a little nap. Get up at six am or so, load the fish into Clayton’s truck and we were off to where Clayton had always sold his fish Chinatown in San Francisco. Now, I’d sold fish in Chinatown before, and I wasn’t sure how I’d be received … here’s what had happened. Some years before, I’d worked as a crewman for a Sicilian guy named Sam Mazzerino, and we sold our fish in Chinatown.
Now, doing business with Chinese folks hasn’t always gone in the direction I expected it to take. There’s always some curious twist in the story. We’d put the fish in the back of Sam’s truck and drive up to Chinatown in San Francisco. Sam knew all the merchants. We went to the first one. “How much-a you pay,” Sam said. He actually talked like that, like some Italian in a cartoon. “Fi’ cent” came the answer. “Five-a cent! Last-a time you give ten”. I eyed the young Chinese guys cleaning and gutting fish while Sam talked to the owner. They all used razor-sharp cleavers. A cut, a slice, a few well-aimed chops and it was done.
One day, after weeks and weeks of this same stuff, Sam couldn’t take it. He stomped out, irate at the eight cent offer for Extra Medium pompano or something. We went to the next guy. “Seven cent,” he said. The next guy said six. We went back to the first guy. He offered “fi’ cent”. We went on the street. Sam swore in Sicilian, unusual for him, I could see the steam coming out of his ears. His usual big swear was “Jesakreisalminey”, which was so slurred it had taken me a week to translate to “Jesus Christ Almighty”. He pulled over and parked in the street. He opened the back. He said, “Sell-a quick, boys, we no gotta much time. ” He sang out “Cheap-a pompano! Caught last night! Fresh Pompano!” Immediately we were swamped in a tide of Chinese housewives, a shopping rugby team which gives no quarter. The crowd kept growing and pressing in on us in a Chinese scrum. We charged a dollar a bag, we charged a dollar for three fish and a dollar for five fish. We gave no ground, we offered no change. At some point, Sam tapped my arm and pointed.
Three Chinese guys were leaning against a storefront. They all had their fish buyer aprons on. They all had their razor-sharp cleavers that they were rhythmically slapping against the palm of their other hand. They were all looking at us. One of them silently pointed down the street. We nodded. We shut the back door, and drove out of Chinatown.
Anyhow, when Clayton and I went to Chinatown, I saw the guy who was the “fi’ cent” man, but I guess he and the guys with the cleavers had forgotten my face, there was never a problem. We’d sell the fish and drive home.
But that’s just what we did for money. The main thing we did that occupied most of our time was the rebuilding of the “Angelina”, Clayton’s Monterrey-style wooden commercial fishing boat. It was about 26 feet (8 m) long, with the sauciest lines imaginable. It had fallen on hard times, there was rot, planks were gone. Over the course of about a year, Clayton and I rebuilt that boat. I should say Clayton rebuilt the boat, and I worked with him throughout. He was a genius of a boat builder. Most of what I know I learned from him.
By training, Clayton was an artist and a sculptor, he’d been to school for that, his works were valuable then and are more valuable now. His artworks are in the permanent collection of the LA Los Angeles County Art Museum, in the French Postal Museum in Paris, and the California Historical Society in San Francisco. His bed, the bed he slept in when I lived at Lairds Landing, is in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. His bed. That’s how deeply his art was intertwined with his life.
When we kayaked out there, we looked in the small house where the bed was. My shipmate wondered where it had gone. When I told him it was at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), he cracked up. When he’d stayed with Clayton at Laird’s Landing with his girlfriend, that had become the guest bedroom … so the very bed where he and a lovely woman had made great sport in his younger days was now in the Museum of Modern Art. As an artist he found that priceless, he said it was likely the only way his DNA would ever end up in the MOMA …

My shipmate and I and Clayton had sat and laughed and talked story many times in the main house, now fallen to ruin, gone along with the guest bedroom shown above. Since Clayton’s death the place reverted to the park, and now it’s fallen to pieces and scrawled with graffiti … but even so Clayton’s spirit lives on, even the graffiti are not your usual:

He brought his artist’s eye to his boatbuilding. An example was the piece of oak I’d helped him cut the day I met him. It was for the stem of the Angelina. The stem is the “S” shaped piece of wood at the very front of the hull of the boat. All of the planking of the boat comes together at the stem. It has a subtle 3-D shape.
Clayton had simply gone out into the woods and cut a large oak limb that had exactly the shape that he needed. I asked him how he’d done it. Clayton often measured things with knots in a piece of string. He said he’d measured the length he needed with a piece of string. But how did he measure the shape of the limb, I asked, to make sure it would fit the complex curve?
Oh, he assured me, he’d just taken a look at the old stem and sketched the curve. It was too heavy to haul around in the woods himself, so he’d just looked at it with his trained sculptor’s eye for shape, drew it on paper freehand with a blunt carpenter’s pencil, tied some knots in a piece of string, walked out in the woods, and looked at his sketch and measured with his string until he found a limb that looked the same. Easy.
He knew all the old ways to do things. Most guys steam-bend wood using, well, steam. They have a boiler where the water is boiled, and then insulated pipes carry the steam to a wooden or metal box. The box is filled with the pieces of wood to be steamed, the cover is put on and the boiler fired up. Soon the steam heats the oak. Oak is great for steam-bending, when it gets hot it bends like rubber, it’s amazing to see.
Clayton scorned all that complexity, he just boiled the oak. He had an old piece of 16 inch (400 mm) steel pipe. He welded a piece of flat plate to cap off one end of the pipe. He welded a couple of legs on the other end, to hold it up off the ground so it sat at an angle. He put it down by the beach and filled it up with sea water. He said sea water was better than fresh because it boils at a higher temperature. He’d put in the  oak he wanted to bend, and then build a fire under the pipe. After while the water would boil. He’d cook them good, then pull them out of the boiling water and bend them to the desired shape. Old school ways, Clayton knew them all.
Alas, in my world even the best of projects have a fixed ending date. In my case, I’d moved out to Laird’s Landing to help Clayton rebuild the Angelina. Finally, most of the work was done. Clayton hated engines, he much preferred oars and horses. So I’d rebuilt the engine, and gotten it started, and tuned it up. Now, even that was done, the engine was running sweetly. The new planking was in and fastened with boat nails, the seams between the planks were caulked, everything was painted. I’d learned from Clayton how to caulk a boat the old school way, with oakum and a caulking chisel, listening for the sweet ringing sound of the chisel that means the seam is filled perfectly. She was painted and tarted up like the San Francisco waterfront lady she’d been in her youth. Clayton had carved a sternboard with her name, and carved the bowsprit (the short wooden pole sticking forward from the frontmost part of the boat). The tiller for steering the boat was a gorgeous example of his art, lovingly sanded smooth and sensuous to the touch of the helmsman. I learned that indeed, having a beautiful boat was good for a man’s spirit. We had launched her and put her through her sea trials, and she was anchored off the beach. We used her for a couple of months to avoid the long tiring rows to distant fishing beaches. We’d go to those beaches in the Angelina, towing the rowboat behind. Then we’d anchor the Angelina and fish from the rowboat. Modern luxury.
I can’t tell you how much I learned from Clayton, including a curious rule of thumb. I live my life in part by rules of thumb that I’ve learned over the years, rules that help cut through my confusion. One rule I got from Clayton. I asked him how much rent he paid for Lairds Landing, which comprised I think fourteen acres, two houses, the jewelry shop, the sculpture and metal casting shop, and a detached bedroom, the well, the garden area, all in a secluded cove surrounded by Point Reyes National Seashore.
He said he didn’t pay any rent at all. He stayed there for free. I was shocked. I asked how he found it. He said it wasn’t all that hard. He said when you’re looking for places to live that are cheap, you have all this competition. Everyone wants to find a cheap place to rent. But when you look for a place that’s free, almost nobody is doing that, so you have the field to yourself. I noted that as a valuable rule, “When you look for the unusual, there’s not much competition.”
Clayton and I parted the best of friends, and remained that way until his death a quarter of a century later. His official website is at here, with a picture of the crusty old man on the front porch of his house at Lairds Landing, and many examples of his amazing art. Judy moved to New Mexico and is still producing gorgeous jewelry. Her web site is here, worth a look. And their son Marcos, true to his blood, is an amazing potter. In addition to learning about jewelry and life from Judy, the rule of thumb I learned from her was “Men sweep round rooms”, meaning that in menial tasks we missed the corners in both a physical and metaphorical sense … and I could hardly argue. I use that rule of thumb to move myself to sweep the corners.
But the job was done, the Angelina was bobbing happily at her mooring just off the beach, and it was time to move on. I said a fond farewell to Clayton, to Judy, and to Marcos, and went down the road. I had no money saved up, so I took a job as the summer assistant to a “shade-tree butcher”. That’s a guy hired by the farmers and ranchers to come out to their land and kill and butcher up one of their animals. Then we’d either put it in the farmer’s freezer, or take it to the cold storage meat lockers at the butcher shop. For the next three months or so I handled more cow guts and pig intestines and sow’s ears and hides and various animal parts than you can imagine … but at least I could save my money. So when the fall came and the job ended, I retired again, and I hitchhiked down to the border and crossed over into Mexico  … but that’s another story, this one’s done.
A warm and welcome Thanksgiving to all,
w.

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
UPDATE:  It has come to my attention that some persons believe I ridiculed Dr. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh and Dr. Roger Pielke Sr. in this post.  That was not my intent and, on rereading this post, is far from the truth.  I have the utmost respect for both climate scientists.  I simply used Dr. van Oldenborgh’s blog post as a springboard for this one.  Geert Jan has since written a follow-up post about lower troposphere temperature data.  See Is there a pause in the temperature of the lower troposphere?   And I referred to Dr. Pielke in this post for two reasons. First, he is known to skeptics, and, second, he agrees with Dr. van Oldenborgh about the importance of ocean warming.   I simply put ocean warming into terms that are more familiar with most readers…deg C, instead of 10^22 Joules.
My apologies to Geert Jan van Oldenborgh and Roger Pielke Sr. if they believed I was ridiculing them.  I was not.

The blog ClimateLabBook is hosted by Ed Hawkins of NCAS-Climate at the University of Reading.  A guest post Hiatuses in the rise of temperature by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) has gained some attention in the past few days.  Many of you will remember Dr. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh as the scientist at KNMI who created and maintains the KNMI Climate Explorer.  It is a marvelous tool that provides public access to numerous climate-related datasets, to the outputs of climate models stored in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives and to statistical analysis tools.  I will once again thank Dr. van Oldenborgh for the Climate Explorer.
Please take a few minutes to read Dr. van Oldenborgh’s post Hiatuses in the rise of temperature.  In it, he prefaces the discussion:
The old argument that the world is no longer warming was that the global mean temperature has ceased to increase after 1998.
He then provides a couple of interpretations of the hiatus.
The first is that there has been no warmer year than 1998.
He then goes on to discuss that surface temperatures have exceeded the 1998 value a couple of times in the 21st Century, so that definition of hiatus no longer works.  Then Dr. van Oldenborgh adds:
The second, better, interpretation of the argument that the earth is no longer warming would be that a trend line starting in 1998 would be zero or negative.
Both are very strict definitions of “hiatuses in the rise of temperature”.  I’m sure you can think of many others, including:

the continued divergence between modeled and observed global surface temperatures, or
a trend line starting in 1998 that shows a statistically insignificant trend, not necessarily a zero trend.

Dr. van Oldenborgh notes that a trend line of global land+sea surface temperatures starting in 1998 is positive so it does not comply with his second definition for the hiatus. He then states:
The new argument therefore is that the temperature has not risen over the last 10 years. This is indeed correct, both the GISTEMP series and the HadCRUT4 dataset in which missing areas have been interpolated by Cowtan & Way show a trend of 0.00 K/decade over 2005–2014. To investigate further why the trend has been zero since 2005 it is useful to consider the land and ocean separately.
Much of the remainder of Dr. van Oldenborgh blog post presents the problems associated with discussions of surface warming over that short a time period (2005 to 2014). His maps of surface temperature trends with starting years of 2003 and 2004, and his discussions of them under the heading of “Patterns” are very informative.
The first thing that struck me as I was reading the blog post was, there’s a dataset missing from the analysis—a dataset that is commonly used to represent global temperatures. That dataset, of course, is satellite-based Lower Troposphere Temperature, aka TLT, which is the temperature of the atmosphere from zero to about 12,500 meters (about 41,000 feet) above sea level, but dominated by samples at less than 3,000 meters (about 9,800 feet). Of the three satellite-based atmospheric temperature datasets, the lower troposphere data are nearest to the surface.
Figure 1 is a time series graph of the annual (November to October) lower troposphere temperature anomalies for the periods ending in 1980 to 2014. The two suppliers, RSS and UAH, are compared.  The anomaly for the year ending in October 2010 was the same as 1998 with the UAH data but cooler with the RSS data, so both would pass the “no warmer than 1998” test.

Figure 1
Figure 2 compares the linear trends of the two lower troposphere temperature anomaly datasets starting with the year ending October 1998.  The UAH data failed the “trend line starting in 1998 would be zero or negative” test while the RSS data passed. For the sake of argument, someone might want to average the two datasets.  Because the UAH warming rate is comparable to the RSS cooling rate, the trend line for the average would basically be zero.

Figure 2
NOTE:  I used the period of 1981 to 2010 as the reference years for anomalies in Figures 1 and 2, because the two suppliers use different base periods. [End note.]
Then Dr. van Oldenborgh moves on to deep ocean warming, presenting and discussing NODC ocean heat content data for the depths of 0-700 meters and 0-2000 meters.  In doing so, however, Dr. van Oldenborgh changed topics of discussion from temperature to ocean heat content in term of Joules times 10^22.  Ocean heat content is a useful metric if you’re a climate scientist looking for the missing heat—the ocean heat predicted by climate models that has not been found in observations.  Along with Dr. van Oldenborgh, Roger Pielke Sr. has been an advocate of using ocean heat content as the primary metric of global warming for a number of years.
But while ocean temperature data (and salinity data) are used to calculate ocean heat content, ocean heat content is not a temperature dataset, and the topic of Dr. van Oldenborgh’s post is “Hiatuses in the rise of temperature”.
The NODC does have subsurface ocean temperature datasets at depths of 0-100 meters, 0-700 meters and 0-2000 meters. They have recently been added to the KNMI Climate Explorer, on their Monthly observations webpage.  Figure 3 presents the vertically averaged temperature anomalies to depths of 0-2000 meters for the global oceans. The NODC depth averaged temperature data for the depths of 0-2000 meters starts in 2005 at the Climate Explorer, which is precisely the time period we’re looking for.  Even the IPCC acknowledges there are so few measurements of the temperatures at depth in the oceans prior to the ARGO era that the datasets from 1955 to the early 2000s cannot be used for global warming attribution studies.  See the post AMAZING: The IPCC May Have Provided Realistic Presentations of Ocean Heat Content Source Data.

Figure 3
As we can see, yes, the oceans to depths of 2000 meters (about 1.25 miles) have warmed according to the NODC data, but note the warming rate.  It is only +0.03 deg C/decade.  That’s read 3 one-hundredths of a deg C per decade, which is a very tiny warming rate.  It would be even tinier if we had data for the oceans from the surface to the ocean floor.
The oceans are deeper than the 2000 meters reached by the ARGO floats.  So we have to look elsewhere to see if the deep oceans below 2000 meters have warmed. The title of Llovel et al. (2014) explains the findings of the paper Deep-ocean contribution to sea level and energy budget not detectable over the past decade.  “Not detectable” says it all. Phrased differently, there has been no detectable warming of the deep ocean (below 2000 meters) from January 2005 to December 2013, the time period covered by Llovel et al. (2014), which happily coincides to the period we’re discussing.
From the NOAA OceanToday webpage Deep ARGO, we learn that the depths of 0-2000 meters include only about one-half of the volume of the global oceans.
Based on those findings, we can assume the trend in the temperature of the oceans, from surface to ocean floor, from 2005 to present, is one-half the +0.03 deg C/decade trend calculated for the depths of 0-2000 meters, or a warming rate of +0.015 deg C/decade. That’s read 15 one-thousandths of a deg C per decade.
That minuscule warming rate of the oceans serves only as the background for the surface warming.  It can’t magically come back to haunt us.  That warming rate is trivial compared to the unrealized surface warming predicted by climate models.  See Figure 4, which presents the temperature anomaly difference between the GISS global land-ocean temperature index data and the simulations of global surface air temperatures based on the multi-model mean of the climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report. That graph is discussed in more detail at the beginning of the October 2014 Global Surface (Land+Ocean) and Lower Troposphere Temperature Anomaly & Model-Data Difference Update.

Figure 4
CLOSING
Global surface temperatures in 2014 are very likely to be at record high levels in 2014. We are going to see that framed in many ways in months to come.  However, we understand the reason for those record high levels to be the unusual warming of the eastern North Pacific.  See the June sea surface temperature update and the post On The Recent Record-High Global Sea Surface Temperatures – The Wheres and Whys.
The climate science community has also acknowledged that the weather-related unusual warming of the eastern extratropical North Pacific was the reason for the record high global surface temperatures this year.  See the post Axel Timmermann and Kevin Trenberth Highlight the Importance of Natural Variability in Global Warming…
On the other hand, as illustrated in this post, it is very likely that 2014 will not be at record high levels with another of the global temperature datasets, Lower Troposphere Temperature. Those are shown in Figures 1 and 2 above.
Ocean heat content during the ARGO era is a useful dataset, but when discussing global temperatures, the vertically averaged temperature data for the oceans is more appropriate.  While the oceans continue to warm, based on the NODC data, in terms of temperature, that warming is trivial.
And as illustrated in the final graph, the record high surface temperatures this year hardly put a dent in the difference between the observed and modeled surface warming.

PS:  Dr. van Oldenborgh’s  discussions of the short-term surface warming (or lack thereof) from 2005 to 2014 will make a lot more sense to the average person than some statistical analysis.
The blog ClimateLabBook is hosted by Ed Hawkins of NCAS-Climate at the University of Reading.  A guest post Hiatuses in the rise of temperature by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) has gained some attention in the past few days.  Many of you will remember Dr. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh as the scientist at KNMI who created and maintains the KNMI Climate Explorer.  It is a marvelous tool that provides public access to numerous climate-related datasets, to the outputs of climate models stored in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives and to statistical analysis tools.  I will once again thank Dr. van Oldenborgh for the Climate Explorer.
Please take a few minutes to read Dr. van Oldenborgh’s post Hiatuses in the rise of temperature.  In it, he prefaces the discussion:
The old argument that the world is no longer warming was that the global mean temperature has ceased to increase after 1998.
He then provides a couple of interpretations of the hiatus.
The first is that there has been no warmer year than 1998.
He then goes on to discuss that surface temperatures have exceeded the 1998 value a couple of times in the 21st Century, so that definition of hiatus no longer works.  Then Dr. van Oldenborgh adds:
The second, better, interpretation of the argument that the earth is no longer warming would be that a trend line starting in 1998 would be zero or negative.
Both are very strict definitions of “hiatuses in the rise of temperature”.  I’m sure you can think of many others, including:

the continued divergence between modeled and observed global surface temperatures, or
a trend line starting in 1998 that shows a statistically insignificant trend, not necessarily a zero trend.

Dr. van Oldenborgh notes that a trend line of global land+sea surface temperatures starting in 1998 is positive so it does not comply with his second definition for the hiatus. He then states:
The new argument therefore is that the temperature has not risen over the last 10 years. This is indeed correct, both the GISTEMP series and the HadCRUT4 dataset in which missing areas have been interpolated by Cowtan & Way show a trend of 0.00 K/decade over 2005–2014. To investigate further why the trend has been zero since 2005 it is useful to consider the land and ocean separately.
Much of the remainder of Dr. van Oldenborgh blog post presents the problems associated with discussions of surface warming over that short a time period (2005 to 2014). His maps of surface temperature trends with starting years of 2003 and 2004, and his discussions of them under the heading of “Patterns” are very informative.
The first thing that struck me as I was reading the blog post was, there’s a dataset missing from the analysis—a dataset that is commonly used to represent global temperatures. That dataset, of course, is satellite-based Lower Troposphere Temperature, aka TLT, which is the temperature of the atmosphere from zero to about 12,500 meters (about 41,000 feet) above sea level, but dominated by samples at less than 3,000 meters (about 9,800 feet). Of the three satellite-based atmospheric temperature datasets, the lower troposphere data are nearest to the surface.
Figure 1 is a time series graph of the annual (November to October) lower troposphere temperature anomalies for the periods ending in 1980 to 2014. The two suppliers, RSS and UAH, are compared.  The anomaly for the year ending in October 2010 was the same as 1998 with the UAH data but cooler with the RSS data, so both would pass the “no warmer than 1998” test.

Figure 1
Figure 2 compares the linear trends of the two lower troposphere temperature anomaly datasets starting with the year ending October 1998.  The UAH data failed the “trend line starting in 1998 would be zero or negative” test while the RSS data passed. For the sake of argument, someone might want to average the two datasets.  Because the UAH warming rate is comparable to the RSS cooling rate, the trend line for the average would basically be zero.

Figure 2
NOTE:  I used the period of 1981 to 2010 as the reference years for anomalies in Figures 1 and 2, because the two suppliers use different base periods. [End note.]
Then Dr. van Oldenborgh moves on to deep ocean warming, presenting and discussing NODC ocean heat content data for the depths of 0-700 meters and 0-2000 meters.

"**Three of the largest social networks have said they will join forces with fact-checkers, governments and researchers to try to come up with a new way of tackling misinformation.**
Vaccine misinformation has been rife on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, with many questioning their efficacy.
At the same time, countries are preparing to roll out coronavirus vaccines in a bid to end the pandemic.
It is unclear how the initiative will improve the fight against fake news.
Fact-checking charity Full Fact will co-ordinate the collaboration.
Taking part in the effort alongside Facebook, Google-owned YouTube and Twitter are the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism; Africa Check; Canada's Privacy Council Office; and five other international fact-checking organisations.
With funding from Facebook, an initial framework will launch in January, setting out new standards for tackling misinformation, as well as a set of aims on the best way to respond to such information.
This latest initiative to try to agree a common approach to coronavirus and vaccine misinformation may not convince critics of the social media giants that they are doing enough.
By January when FullFact says an ""initial framework"" should have been agreed, countries should be starting to roll out vaccines to populations which have been subjected for months to a flood of scare stories about them. They will have seen stories ranging from suggestions that the vaccines have serious side-effects or haven't been properly tested to allegations that they are part of a plot involving Bill Gates to implant microchips in people and track them.
FullFact, which is one of the organisations providing fact checking for Facebook, says it has published 160 fact checks about the coronavirus and vaccines this year, with warning labels then being applied to many thousands of posts.
But the campaign group the Centre for Countering Digital Hate says 95% of such material on social media is not removed and reaches a vast audience.
The other challenge for this initiative will be getting social media giants with very different approaches to misinformation to agree a common set of rules. Meanwhile, politicians are getting impatient - in the UK the Labour Party has called for emergency legislation to stamp out anti-vaccine misinformation.
Full Fact said collaboration and ensuring that people had a good supply of reliable information would be core principles.
Will Moy, chief executive of Full Fact, added: ""Bad information ruins lives, and we all have a responsibility to fight it where we see it. The coronavirus pandemic and the wave of false claims that followed demonstrated the need for a collective approach to this problem.""
With a coronavirus vaccine potentially only months away, he said the concern was that ""bad information could undermine trust in medicine when it matters most, and ultimately prolong this pandemic"".
Facebook said it welcomed the effort ""to discuss and develop new strategies"" for tackling misinformation."

Gruber
Accumulation of fraudulent EPA regulations impacts energy, economy, jobs, families and health
Guest essay by Paul Driessen
Call it the Gruberization of America’s energy and environmental policies.
Former White House medical consultant Jonathan Gruber pocketed millions of taxpayer dollars before infamously explaining how ObamaCare was enacted. “Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” he said. “It was really, really critical to getting the bill passed.” At least one key provision was a “very clever basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.”
The Barack Obama/Gina McCarthy Environmental Protection Agency is likewise exploiting its lack of transparency and most Americans’ lack of scientific understanding. EPA bureaucrats and their hired scientists, pressure groups and PR flacks are getting rich and powerful by implementing costly, punitive, dictatorial regulations “for our own good,” and pretending to be honest and publicly spirited.
EPA’s latest regulatory onslaught is its “Clean Power Plan.” The agency claims the CPP will control or prevent “dangerous manmade climate change,” by reducing carbon dioxide and “encouraging” greater use of renewable energy. In reality, as even EPA acknowledges, no commercial-scale technology exists that can remove CO2 from power plant emission streams. The real goal is forcing coal-fired power plants to reduce their operations significantly or (better still) shut down entirely.
The agency justifies this by deceitfully claiming major health benefits will result from eliminating coal in electricity generation – and deceptively ignoring the harmful effects that its regulations are having on people’s livelihoods, living standards, health and well-being. Its assertion that reducing the USA’s coal-related carbon dioxide emissions will make an iota of difference is just as disingenuous. China, India and other fast-developing nations must keep burning coal to generate electricity and lift people out of poverty, and CO2 plays only a tiny (if any) role in climate change and destructive weather events.
The new CPP amplifies Obama Administration diktats targeting coal use. Companion regulations cover mercury, particulates (soot), ozone, “cross-state” air pollution, sulfur and nitrogen oxides that contribute to haze in some areas, and water quality. Their real benefits are minimal to illusory … or fabricated.
American’s air is clean, thanks to scrubbers and other emission control systems that remove the vast majority of pollutants. Remaining pollutants pose few real health problems. To get the results it needs, EPA cherry picks often questionable research that supports its agenda and ignores all other studies. It low-balls costs, pays advisors and outside pressure groups millions of dollars to support its decisions, and ignores the cumulative effects of its regulations on energy costs and thus on businesses, jobs and families.
Now, for the first time, someone has tallied those costs. The results are sobering.
An exhaustive study by Energy Ventures Analysis, Inc. tallies the overall effects of EPA regulations on the electric power industry and provides state-by-state summaries of the rules’ impacts on residential, industrial and overall energy users. The study found that EPA rules and energy markets will inflict $284 billion per year in extra electricity and natural gas costs in 2020, compared to its 2012 baseline year.
The typical household’s annual electricity and natural gas bills will rise 35% or $680 by 2020, compared to 2012, and will climb every year after that, as EPA regulations get more and more stringent. Median family incomes are already $2,000 lower since President Obama took office, and electricity prices have soared 14-33% in states with the most wind power – so these extra costs will exact a heavy additional toll.
Manufacturing and other businesses will be hit even harder, the study concluded. Their electricity and natural gas costs will almost double between 2012 and 2020, increasing by nearly $200 billion annually over this short period. Energy-intensive industries like aluminum, steel and chemical manufacturing will find it increasingly hard to compete in global markets, but all businesses (and their employees) will suffer.
The EVA analysis calculates that industrial electricity rates will soar by 34% in West Virginia, 59% in Maryland and New York, and a whopping 74% in Ohio. Just imagine running a factory, school district or hospital – and having to factor skyrocketing costs like that into your budget. Where do you find that extra money? How many workers or teachers do you lay off, or patients do you turn away? Can you stay open?
The CPP will also force utility companies to spend billions building new generators (mostly gas-fired, plus wind turbines), and new transmission lines, gas lines and other infrastructure. But EPA does not factor those costs into its calculations; nor does it consider the many years it will take to design, permit, engineer, finance and build those systems – and battle Big Green lawsuits over them.
How “science-based” are EPA’s regulations, really? Its mercury rule is based on computer-generated risks to hypothetical American women who eat 296 pounds of fish a year that they catch themselves, a claim that its rule will prevent a theoretical reduction in IQ test scores by an undetectable “0.00209 points,” and similar absurdities. Its PM2.5 soot standard is equivalent to having one ounce of super-fine dust spread equally in a volume of air one-half mile long, one-half mile wide and one story tall.
No wonder EPA has paid its “independent” Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee $181 million and the American Lung Association $25 million since 2000 to rubberstamp its secretive, phony “science.”
Rural America will really be walloped by the total weight of EPA’s anti-coal regulations. Nonprofit electricity cooperatives serve 42 million people in 47 states, across three-fourths of the nation’s land area. They own and maintain 42% of America’s electric distribution lines and depend heavily on coal. They have already invested countless billions retrofitting coal-fired generators with state-of-the-art emission control systems, and thus emit very few actual pollutants. (CO2 fertilizes plants; it is not a pollutant.)
EPA’s air and water rules will force these coal units to slash their electricity generation or close down long before their productive lives are over – and before replacement units and transmission lines can be built. Electricity rates in these rural areas are already higher than in urban areas, but will go much higher. Experts warn that these premature shutdowns will slash electricity “reserve margins” to almost zero in some areas, make large sections of the power grid unstable, and create high risks of rolling blackouts and cascading power outages, especially in the Texas panhandle, western Kansas and northern Arkansas.
The rules will thus put the cooperatives in violation of the Rural Electrification Act and 16 other laws that require reliable, affordable electricity for these far-flung communities. EPA’s actions are also putting rural hospitals in greater jeopardy, as they try to cope with “Affordable Care Act” rules and other burdens that have already caused numerous closings. As USA Today reported, the shuttered hospitals mean some of the nation’s poorest and sickest patients will be denied accessible, affordable care – and people suffering strokes, heart attacks and accidents will not be able to reach emergency care during their “golden hour,” meaning many of them will die or be severely and permanently disabled.
EPA never bothered to consider any of these factors. Nor has it addressed the habitat, bird, bat and other environmental impacts that tens of thousands more wind turbines will have; the “human health hazards” that wind turbines have been shown to inflict on people living near them; or the high electricity costs, notorious unreliability, and increased power grid instability associated with the wind and solar installations that EPA seems to think can quickly and magically replace the coal-based electricity it is eliminating.
Congress, state legislators and attorneys general, governors and courts need to stop these secretive, duplicitous, dictatorial Executive Branch actions. Here’s one thought. Heartland Institute Science Director Jay Lehr helped organize the panel that called for establishing the Environmental Protection Agency. In a persuasive analysis, he says it’s time now to systematically dismantle the federal EPA and replace it with a “committee of the whole” of the 50 state environmental protection agencies.
The new organization would do a far better job of protecting our air and water quality, livelihoods, living standards, health and welfare. It will listen better to We the People – and less to eco-pressure groups.

"**Facebook has said it will stop running all political and social-issue adverts after polls close in the US presidential election on 3 November.**
It said the temporary measure would ""reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse"" ahead of results.
Facebook has already banned ads that prematurely declare victory in the election.
But one digital-rights campaign group said the change ""isn't going to fix the problem at all"".
Fight For The Future said misinformation was often spread through Facebook Groups, which are promoted by the social-network's algorithms.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would remove any Pages, Groups or Instagram accounts representing a conspiracy theory known as QAnon.
But the social network has been criticised for deciding not to fact-check posts by politicians.
In a blog post, it said it would label politicians' posts, if a candidate or party ""declares premature victory before a race is called by major media outlets"".
It will also display notifications directing users to its own voting-information page.
Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren, who is often critical of Facebook, said the social network had made ""performative changes"".
""The problem isn't the ads themselves,"" she said.
""The problem is Facebook's refusal to regulate its ads, change its broken algorithm, or take responsibility for the power it's amassed.""
Rival social networks, including TikTok and Twitter, do not allow paid political ads.
On 3 September, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote a lengthy blog post about what he and his teams were doing to ""protect our democracy"".
This latest announcement shows he feels those steps may not have been enough.
Facebook is responding to concerns groups may try to delegitimise the election result in the the hours and days after polls close.
But how much of a problem was paid-for advertising really going to be at that stage in the election?
Would a campaign hold back election funds to spend big on adverts to deliberately delegitimise the outcome of the vote?
You couldn't bet against it in this election - but it seems unlikely.
The real challenge will be for Facebook to stop the spread of misinformation via organic content such as Group or Page posts.
Those posts are routinely far more widely shared, more engaged with and potentially more dangerous than political ads."
"While the prime minister has shown unequivocal support for exploiting Britain’s shale gas reserves, stating the country should “go all out for shale gas”, more cautious voices point to possible effects such as minor earthquakes, contamination of water sources and industrialisation of the countryside. Besides these, shale gas will contribute to climate change in two ways, from carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions when the gas is burnt, and from the fugitive emissions of underground methane (CH4) that leak into the atmosphere as the gas is extracted. These concerns have led to protests against the drilling of shale gas exploratory wells. Others are more willing to accept shale gas, but as a fuel used only for a few years as the country gears up for a low carbon future. How are we to make sense of this? One approach is to avoid the all-or-nothing rhetoric and instead insist that the companies producing shale gas, like every other polluter, should pay for the environmental damage shale gas will bring upon future generations through its contribution to climate change. How much should they pay? For every tonne of CO2 emitted when the shale gas is burned, the company producing it should pay the amount by which it increases the impacts of climate change. This is known as the social cost of carbon. In a similar fashion, for every tonne of methane that escapes into the atmosphere it should pay for the social cost of methane. The social cost of carbon has been well studied over the years. The model we use to calculate it, the PAGE09 integrated assessment model, employs simple equations to simulate the results from more complex, specialised, scientific and economic models. It does this while accounting for the profound uncertainty that exists around climate change. Calculations are made for eight world regions, ten time periods to the year 2200, for four types of impact (sea level rise, economic impacts, non‐economic impacts, and discontinuities, such as the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets). On our present emissions path, the best estimate is that the social cost is a little more than US$100 per tonne of CO2. The social cost of methane has been much less studied. We know from estimates of Global Warming Potentials – the warming effects of each greenhouse gas – that methane, tonne for tonne, is much more potent than CO2. Initial results from the PAGE09 model indicate that at our present rate of emissions, the best estimate is that the social cost of methane is a little over US$1,500 per tonne. This is why the prospect of considerable methane emissions from fracking has caused such concern. How would this approach work in practice? Every company involved in shale gas exploration and production would know from the start that they would have to pay a tax equivalent to the social cost on each tonne of CO2 emitted, and another equivalent to the cost of each tonne of methane escaping from their wells. Many prospects that initially look promising will turn out not to be worth pursuing once these taxes are factored into the calculation. The better, cheaper, prospects where fugitive emissions can be minimised will be favoured. Should shale gas be a transitional fuel? Tax will determine this. If we carry on along our present path, the social cost of carbon increases in real terms by a little more than 2% per year, doubling in about 30 years. For methane, the cost rises a little faster, doubling in about 20 years. So fewer and fewer shale gas prospects will look attractive as time goes by.  On the other hand, if the world is very successful at bringing global greenhouse gas emissions under control, the social costs will not increase over time, and shale gas will be able to play more of a role for longer. If climate change “lukewarmists” are right and the effects of greenhouse gases on the climate has been overstated, then these social costs will end up lower, around US$65 and US$1,000 per tonne respectively, which would allow more shale gas development. Applying climate change-based taxes like these to shale gas should be attractive to the government. It is a market-based approach which encourages cleaner development and innovation to reduce environmental impact. It offers the prospect of significant tax revenues, which start at US$100 per tonne of CO2 and US$1,500 per tonne of methane, but which will rise in real terms – all at a time of austerity when the budget deficit is still a concern.  Under the Institute of Directors’ central production estimate, and with a central methane leakage rate of 2%, the tax revenues will be about £6bn per year (in current prices) by the time shale gas production really gets going in the latter half of the 2020s. This is all based on the polluter-pays principle that should be at the heart of this self-described “greenest government ever”. The government’s “sweeteners”, of 1% of shale gas revenues to local communities and handing local authorities all of the business rates arising from shale gas wells, can be seen as a financial compensation for the disruption fracking will cause locally. The introduction of climate change taxation would tackle the far greater global disruption that the climate effects of shale gas would otherwise bring."

Poor Simon, why bother [voting for the Zero Carbon Bill ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/a-national-mp-on-national-voting-for-the-zero-carbon-bill/)when you are still going to be targeted as a denier? 



Simon Bridges’ office was defaced overnight by climate change activists.



The National Party leader posted an image to Twitter on Sunday showing a dark liquid resembling oil coating the doorstep to his Tauranga electorate office. The liquid had been used to draw an Extinction Rebellion logo.



“I respect your right to protest Extinction Rebellion but not when it comes to defacing people’s property as you’ve done to my electorate office overnight,” he wrote.



Extinction Rebellion has gained attention around the world for its protests, which have included blocking roads, disrupting transport, spraying paint and vandalism.



The group aims to force governments to transform the current economic model so that radical action can be taken against climate breakdown, biodiversity loss and the risk of social and ecological collapse.



In a post to Facebook, Extinction Rebellion showed the group holding a large banner while member Doug Doig poured the organic molasses.



“It’s time for us Boomers to start getting vocal about what dirty oil is doing to this country,” he said in the post.



“This is a climate and ecological emergency – we need people like National Party leader Simon Bridges to tell the truth about the state of things. We need to move out of fossil fuels and into a new, justice-based vision of Aotearoa.”



Justice-based vision? What’s that?



These ~~people~~ smelly hippies are either stupid or are begging to be arrested, as their Facebook post helpfully named the vandal ( **Doug Doig** ) and the photo showed him in the act of vandalism as well as the faces of all those who supported him. He should be held accountable for his actions and should be fined an amount that would make him think twice before doing it again. 



Simon was fortunate that it wasn’t poo, as that’s [what the smelly hippies are smearing on restaurants in the UK](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7742143/Extinction-Rebellion-activists-smeared-faeces-restaurant-walls.html).

"President Trump announced on Tuesday that Neil M. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge, was his nominee for the Supreme Court. Following is the transcript of the announcement, held in the East Room of the White House, as prepared by Federal News Service. Read our coverage of the announcement.  TRUMP: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court. I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written. TRUMP: This may be the most transparent judicial selection process in history. Months ago as a candidate, I publicly presented a list of brilliant and accomplished people to the American electorate and pledged to make my choice from among that list. Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for president. I am a man of my word. I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time. Today. .. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Today I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court to be of the United States Supreme Court. And I would like to ask Judge Gorsuch and his wonderful wife, Louise, to please step forward  —   please, Louise, Judge. Here they come. Here they come. (APPLAUSE) So was that a surprise? Was it? TRUMP: I have always felt that after the defense of our nation, the most important decision a president of the United States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. Depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years and his or her decisions can last a century or more and can often be permanent. I took the task of this nomination very seriously. I have selected an individual whose qualities define  —   really, and I mean closely define  —   what we’re looking for. Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support. When he was nominated to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, he was confirmed by the Senate unanimously. Also  —   that’s unanimous, can you believe that? Nowadays, with what’s going on? (APPLAUSE) Does that happen anymore? Does it happen? I think it’s going to happen. Maybe it will. Also with us tonight is Maureen Scalia, a woman loved by her husband and deeply respected by all. I am so happy she’s with us. Where is Maureen? Please, stand up. Thank you, Maureen. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, Maureen. She is really the ultimate representative of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, whose image and genius was in my mind throughout the   process. Not only are we looking at the writings of the nominee  —   and I studied them closely  —   but he is said to be among the finest and most brilliant oftentimes the writings of any judge for a long, long time. And his academic credentials, something very important to me, in that education has always been a priority, are as good as I have ever seen. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia with honors. He then received his law degree from Harvard, also with honors, where he was a Truman Scholar. After Harvard, he received his doctorate at Oxford, where he attended as a Marshall Scholar, one of the top academic honors anywhere in the world. After law school, he clerked on the Supreme Court for both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. It is an extraordinary résumé. As good as it gets. Judge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado and was taught the value of independence, hard work and public service. While in law school, he demonstrated a commitment to helping the less fortunate. He worked in both Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Projects and Harvard Defenders Program. Brilliance being assured, I studied every aspect of his life. He could have had any job at any law firm for any amount of money, but what he wanted to do with his career was to be a judge, to write decisions and to make an impact by upholding our laws and our Constitution. The qualifications of Judge Gorsuch are beyond dispute. He is the man of our country and a man who our country really needs and needs badly to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. I would like to thank Senate leadership. I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once for the good of the country. TRUMP: Congratulations to you and your family. May God bless you, may God bless our glorious nation. Judge Gorsuch, the podium, sir, is yours. (APPLAUSE) GORSUCH: Thank you. Mr. President, thank you very much. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, you and your team have shown me great courtesy in this process, and you’ve entrusted me with a most solemn assignment. Standing here in a house of history, and acutely aware of my own imperfections, I pledge that if I am confirmed I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country. For the last decade, I’ve worked as a federal judge in a court that spans six Western states, serving about 20 percent of the continental United States and about 18 million people. The men and women I’ve worked with at every level in our circuit are an inspiration to me. I’ve watched them fearlessly tending to the rule of law, enforcing the promises of our Constitution and living out daily their judicial oaths to administer justice equally to rich and poor alike, following the law as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs. I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of the people’s liberties under law and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. The towering judges that have served in this particular seat of the Supreme Court, including Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson, are much in my mind at this moment. Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench shared his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him. I began my legal career working for Byron White, the last Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, and the only justice to lead the N. F. L. in rushing. (LAUGHTER) He was one of the smartest and most courageous men I’ve ever known. When Justice White retired, he gave me the chance to work for Justice Kennedy, as well. Justice Kennedy was incredibly welcoming and gracious, and like Justice White, he taught me so much. I am forever grateful. And if you’ve ever met Judge David Sentelle, you’ll know just how lucky I was to land a clerkship with him right out of school. Thank you. These judges brought me up in the law. Truly, I would not be here without them. Today is as much their day as it is mine. In the balance of my professional life, I’ve had the privilege of the working as a practicing lawyer and teacher. I’ve enjoyed wonderful colleagues whose support means so much to me at this moment, as it has year in and year out. Practicing in the trial work trenches of the law, I saw, too, that when we judges don our robes, it doesn’t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what’s expected of us: Impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward with speaking with members from both side of the aisle, to answering their questions and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the Constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge. .. (LAUGHTER) . .. stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. I am so thankful tonight for my family, my friends and my faith. These are the things that keep me grounded at life’s peaks and have sustained me in its valleys. To Louise, my incredible wife and companion of 20 years, my cherished daughters who are watching on TV, and all my family and friends, I cannot thank you enough for your love and for your prayers. I could not attempt this without you. Mr. President, I am honored and I am humbled. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) END"
"SEOUL, South Korea  —   President Trump assured South Korea’s acting president on Monday of the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to defend the country, agreeing with Seoul to strengthen joint defense capabilities against North Korea. Mr. Trump’s assurances came amid anxiety in South Korea over the future of the alliance with the United States. During his campaign, Mr. Trump cast some doubt on the United States’ defense and trade commitments, saying that South Korea was not paying enough to help keep 28, 500 American troops in the country. But speaking by phone to Hwang   the acting president of South Korea, Mr. Trump said that the coming visit to South Korea by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reflected the close friendship of the two countries and the importance of their alliance. Mr. Mattis is scheduled to visit South Korea on Thursday on his first official trip abroad, which also includes a stop in Japan. “President Trump reiterated our ironclad commitment to defend the R. O. K. including through the provision of extended deterrence, using the full range of military capabilities,” the White House said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s phone conversation with Mr. Hwang, using the initials for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea. “The two leaders agreed to take steps to strengthen joint defense capabilities to defend against the North Korean threat. ” Mr. Hwang’s office quoted Mr. Trump as saying that the United States would cooperate with South Korea “100 percent” and that bilateral relations would be “better than ever before. ” The two leaders shared the need for firm action to persuade North Korea to rethink its nuclear weapons development program and vowed to respond strongly if the North attempted military provocations, it said. Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Hwang followed North Korea’s recent warnings that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile “anytime and anywhere,” in a rebuke to Mr. Trump. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can cover the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly over the Pacific. In a New Year’s Day speech, Kim   North Korea’s leader, said his country had reached a “final stage” in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. The next day Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post, “It won’t happen!” It remains unclear how close North Korea is to building a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile, although North Korea has boasted of successfully testing crucial technology in the past year, such as   engines and heat shields for such a missile. Mr. Hwang, the prime minister of South Korea, is serving as acting president because President Park  ’s powers were suspended after the country’s Parliament voted to impeach her in December on charges of corruption and abuse of power. The Constitutional Court of South Korea is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether to formally end her presidency or reinstate her."
"In the polarised and fractious debate over the use of genetic modification in agriculture, few issues have raised hackles as much as the proposed use of genetic use restriction techniques (GURT), more commonly known as “terminator technology” or – to its many opponents – “suicide seeds”. The idea behind GURTs is to produce seed or offspring which are sterile in order to restrict the spread of new genes which have been introduced into the target plant. Campaigners against the technology have long alleged that terminator seeds would enslave farmers by preventing them from saving seed from one season to the next, making them dependent on re-purchasing seeds from big biotech companies. The furore over a decade ago led to a global moratorium on GURT development, agreed under the aegis of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 2000. The popular fear about terminator seeds has since become something of a zombie myth: constantly cited by opponents of GM technology as a reason for their campaigning, despite GURT never actually having come into existence. Lurid claims continue to be circulated, such as the allegation – originally by Indian anti-technology activist Vandana Shiva – that sterility would somehow be inherited and transferred unintentionally to other plants, despite this being biologically, as well as logically, impossible. Following renewed campaigning by anti-GM groups, a recent article disinterred these zombie myths once again. It suggested that new legislation under consideration in Brazil could lead to “suicide seeds” that might “threaten the livelihoods of millions of small farmers around the world”. But the truth in Brazil is very different to this media sensationalism and renewed activist myth-making. It is true that Brazil is considering relaxing regulations that prohibit research on GURTs. However, this would be applied to pharmaceuticals, not food crops. It is aimed in particular at allowing scientists to examine whether the technology could have biosafety applications – applications that would safeguard the environment against the unintended release and spread of modified genes. Currently the law prohibits scientists even from conducting research – a ban on knowledge gathering that is senseless and potentially damaging. Among the pharmaceutical uses where GURT technology might be useful is the development of “bioreactor” plants such as lettuce modified to produce a vaccine to prevent Leishmaniasis, a disease that causes serious deformities or scarring in victims. Around 12m people are believed to be infected, with an estimated 1-2m new cases each year, and a further 350m people, mainly in poor countries, are at risk. Plants are good candidates for the production of the necessary antibodies because, like animals, their cells are eukaryotic and able to reproduce the necessary complex proteins at a large scale.  Another example is genetically-modified lettuce to assist in the diagnosis of Dengue fever, where early detection dramatically increases the chance of survival. In both cases there is currently a shortage of the materials needed both to identify and treat the disease, which can only be produced in extremely secure facilities. If GURT restrictions were loosened, genetically modified plants could potentially produce the needed vaccines and diagnosis tools on a larger scale without fear of the altered genes spreading into the environment. Many other crops, including tobacco, alfalfa, banana and soybean have been considered for bio-pharming to produce drugs against conditions that range from cancer to HIV/AIDS. Industrial applications have also been proposed, such as genetically modified trees with reduced lignin content which would enable the use of less toxic chemicals for pulp and paper production, as well as to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. In all these cases, sterility could have a biosafety justification, in order to safeguard against unintended gene release. Indeed, last week researchers at the University of Oregon announced the conclusion of successful trials using sterile, genetically modified poplar trees. These grow faster and are more resistant to insects, potentially more productive for biofuels, and are intended to be able to reduce land wastage and the use of pesticides. It is somewhat ironic that with all their focus on terminator technology, anti-GM activists seem to fail to realise that either sterility or seeds that do not breed true are already widely used in conventional agriculture. Seedless grapes, watermelons and bananas are prized by consumers around the world, and despite their sterility have apparently not yet enslaved the farmers who grow them. F1 hybrids – the offspring of two different parent varieties of the same crop – also require farmers to buy seeds anew each year, because their second-generation seeds do not breed true. But their use has been increasing for decades because farmers value highly the increased productivity, and therefore profits, that come from the seeds’ hybrid vigour. Almost all the world’s commercial corn crop is grown from F1 hybrid seed, for example. As these existing examples show, this application of modern technology to agriculture need not be remotely scary, but activists stoke fears in order to secure prohibitions on scientific research which conflicts with their ideological preferences. Opponents of innovation frequently cite the precautionary principle as a reason to stop scientific work, but neglect the flip-side: namely future benefits foregone when technologies are not pursued. A continued ban on GURT may sound sensible and precautionary, but could harm our potential to develop lifesaving vaccines and environmentally beneficial crops. Scientists should be allowed to conduct research, and society can later decide– through open, inclusive and democratic debate – how or if these technologies are later deployed more widely.

"**Can Facebook do anything to stem the flow of disinformation which its critics say is a threat to democracy?**
If Mark Zuckerberg hoped the spotlight on his company's role in spreading misinformation would move away once the US election was over he must have been sorely disappointed.
This week, as President Trump and his followers have angrily claimed - without evidence - that the election has been stolen from him, complaints about Facebook's role in amplifying that message have grown louder.
Mr Zuckerberg will worry that some of the harshest criticism has come from the camp of President-elect Joe Biden. Former Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes tweeted: ""It will take a generation to undo the damage that Facebook has done to American democracy.""
The social media giant has been completely ineffective in dealing with the barrage of misinformation, according to Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.
""Facebook was basically caught flat-footed, even though anybody who studies American politics would have known that one of our two political parties would do everything it could to delegitimise the process,"" he told Tech Tent.
He speculates that Facebook may have been afraid of offending the Republicans - but goes on to suggest that the nature of the platform itself makes it impossible to stop misinformation spreading.
""Facebook is designed to amplify any content that generates strong emotion, and what generates strong emotion greater than that your country is being destroyed from the inside? That's a powerful message that generates incredible reaction.""
Facebook gave us a statement stressing the measures brought in to combat misinformation before the election and saying that effort was continuing.
""We changed our products to ensure fewer people see false information and are made aware of it when they do, and highlighted reliable election information where nearly everyone on Facebook and Instagram saw authoritative information at the top of their feeds,"" it said.
The company also posted a blog this week saying most of what users were seeing on the platform was not about politics - suggesting Facebook is really all about photos of babies, not election conspiracy theories.
And Siva Vaidhyanathan accepts that, for its individual users sharing family news, there isn't a problem.
""Facebook is good for me, it's good for you, it's good for almost all of those 2.7 billion people individually or they never would have signed up and they would have resigned long ago. The problem is that collectively Facebook is a disaster for us.""
He compares it to car ownership - great for individuals, but hugely damaging for the planet. But getting people to give up Facebook may be even harder than persuading them to abandon their cars.
As Apple makes big claims about the M1 processor at the heart of its new Mac computers, we ask what it says about where the chip industry is heading. Former chip designer and Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton tells us that Moore's Law, which says processing power doubles every two years, is running out of steam because the miniaturisation of chips can go no further.
""It's coming to an end as much as anything else, because we're running out of atoms. You've gone from structures which are hundreds of atoms wide to structures which are tens of atoms wide - these things are not going to work when they're a handful of atoms wide.""
And in the week when the Virgin Hyperloop celebrated its first short trip with passengers on board, railway engineer Gareth Dennis tells us not to get too excited. While Hyperloop's backers suggest it could whisk passengers from Edinburgh to London in 40 minutes, he warns that the economics don't add up.
""It has a capacity of around 3,000 to 4,000 passengers per hour, which is about the same as a decent bus service. So this isn't going to transform anything if it's got capacity that is that low.""
In 2017, one of Virgin Hyperloop's founders said there could be three systems in operation by 2021. Tech Tent will check in next year to see how that's going."
"**Facebook has taken down a string of racist and misogynistic posts, memes and comments about US Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris.**
The social network removed the content after BBC News alerted it to three groups that regularly hosted hateful material on their pages.
Facebook says it takes down 90% of hate speech before it is flagged.
One media monitoring body described the pages as ""dedicated to propagating racist and misogynistic smears"".
However, despite the pages being places where hate-speech is regularly directed towards the vice-president-elect, Facebook said it would not take action on the groups themselves.
Media Matters president Angelo Carusone said: ""Facebook's removal of this content only after it's been flagged to them by the media confirms that the rules and guidelines they establish are hollow because they put little to no effort into detection and enforcement.
""We are talking about the lowest of low-hanging fruit from a detection perspective.
""And yet, these escaped Facebook's notice until flagged by a third party.""
The pages included accusations Ms Harris was not a US citizen - because her mother was from India and her father from Jamaica.
Other comments suggested she was not ""black enough"" for the Democrats.
Another post said she should be ""deported to India"".
And, in several memes, her name is mocked.
One of the pages has 4,000 members, another 1,200.
A series of other sexually graphic and misogynistic submissions were also removed.
Facebook has been repeatedly criticised by advertisers and civil-rights groups for not doing enough to tackle hate speech.
In August, hundreds of companies stopped advertising on the platform in protest.
Previously, other campaigners have told BBC News racism and hate speech is not picked up by Facebook's internal moderation tools - and in some situations even promoted.
Rishad Robinson, from the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, told BBC News Facebook had ""created a set of algorithms that incentivise people to spread hate"".
Facebook's own civil-rights audit, in August, said the company had made ""vexing and heartbreaking"" decisions about hate speech that represented ""significant setbacks for civil rights"".
And last week, one of Joe Biden's senior aides attacked Facebook over its handling of conspiracy theories, calls to violence and disinformation in the days following the US election.
""Our democracy is on the line,"" tweeted the US president-elect's deputy press secretary, Bill Russo.
""We need answers."""

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
This post presents a very simple way to illustrate the tempering effect of the oceans on global warming. The idea for this simple presentation came from the response of the reality-impaired wing of the catastrophic human-induced climate change movement to the deep-ocean-warming portion of yesterday’s blog post On The Blog Post “Hiatuses in the rise of temperature” at ClimateLabBook. The cross post at WattsUpWithThat is here, and an archived edition of the response from Miriam O’Brien (a.k.a. Sou) at HotWhopper is here.
It is often said that more than 90% of the heat caused by manmade greenhouse gases is absorbed by the oceans.  But as skeptics often note, the absorbed heat has little impact on the temperatures of the oceans to depth, and that’s because of the seemingly limitless capacity of the oceans to store heat.
INTRODUCTION
More than 3000 ARGO floats were distributed around the global oceans in the early 2000s to the measure temperature and salinity in all ocean basins for the depths of 0-2000 meters, about 1.25 miles…from the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica to the Arctic Ocean.  From that ARGO-based data and other measurements, the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) now determines and provides data for the annual change in the heat stored by the oceans, starting in 2005.  Ocean heat content data from the NODC for the depths of 0-2000 meters are presented in terms of Joules*10^22 (here), and the NODC provides the vertically average temperature anomaly data (here) from which the heat content is calculated (along with the salinity data).  The temperature data are presented in terms many people are familiar with, degrees C.
The units used to present the ocean heat content (Joules times 10 to the 22nd power) look like an astronomically large number. Feel free to add 22 zeroes in your mind to the following graphs.  And since few people have any idea what those units mean, we helpful people try to present them in more-familiar terms (deg C) as well.
The reality-impaired wing of the catastrophic human-induced climate change movement doesn’t like it when we present data in familiar terms.  They claim silly things like we don’t want our readers to know data indicate the oceans are absorbing heat. Again, see the archived version of the post here.  What’s really strange about that is, if you were to do a Google Image search of “NODC ocean heat content” the vast majority of the images presented by Google are those I prepared for my blog posts and the posts at WattsUpWithThat. In Figure 1, I’ve highlighted all of the illustrations I prepared or that were prepared by others and included in my posts that show up on a screen cap.

Figure 1
To me, it doesn’t look like I’m trying to hide the fact the oceans have absorbed heat.  In fact, I’ve explained, using data, the naturally occurring processes that cause the oceans to warm at the surface and at depth. See the free illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” (42MB).
THE SIMPLE PRESENTATIONS OF THE TEMPERING EFFECT OF THE OCEANS ON GLOBAL WARMING 
Well, I came up with a very simple way to keep alarmists AND skeptics happy.  I’ve presented the NODC ocean heat content data in terms of Joules*10^22 and the NODC vertically averaged temperature data in terms of deg C—ready for this?—on the same graph. See Figure 2.  In it, the data have been zeroed at 2005.

Figure 2
The caption for it and Figure 3 reads, A hypothetical energy imbalance resulting from the emissions of manmade greenhouse gases has caused the oceans to absorb heat from 2005 to 2013 at a rate of about 8.6*10^22 Joules/decade, according to the NODC data for the depths of 0 to 2000 meters, but due to the heat capacity of the oceans, the oceans for those same depths have only warmed at a rate of about 0.03 deg C/decade, also according to NODC data.
For those who would prefer the NODC data to not be zeroed at 2005, see Figure 3.

Figure 3
Again, the warming rate illustrated in Figure 2 and 3 is only +0.03 deg C/decade. Let me repeat a portion of yesterday’s post:
That’s read 3 one-hundredths of a deg C per decade, which is a very tiny warming rate.  It would be even tinier if we had data for the oceans from the surface to the ocean floor.
The oceans are deeper than the 2000 meters reached by the ARGO floats.  So we have to look elsewhere to see if the deep oceans below 2000 meters have warmed. The title of Llovel et al. (2014) explains the findings of the paper Deep-ocean contribution to sea level and energy budget not detectable over the past decade.  “Not detectable” says it all. Phrased differently, there has been no detectable warming of the deep ocean (below 2000 meters) from January 2005 to December 2013, the time period covered by Llovel et al. (2014), which happily coincides to the period we’re discussing.
From the NOAA OceanToday webpage Deep ARGO, we learn that the depths of 0-2000 meters include only about one-half of the volume of the global oceans.
Based on those findings, we can assume the trend in the temperature of the oceans, from surface to ocean floor, from 2005 to present, is one-half the +0.03 deg C/decade trend calculated for the depths of 0-2000 meters, or a warming rate of +0.015 deg C/decade. That’s read 15 one-thousandths of a deg C per decade.
That minuscule warming rate of the oceans serves only as the background for the surface warming.  It can’t magically come back to haunt us.
CLOSING
I want thank Miriam O’Brien (Sou) from HotWhopper. Without her nonsensical response, I would not have come up with the idea for this post. Now, in the not-too-distant future, every time someone performs a Google Image search of “Tempering Effect of the Oceans on Global Warming”, or some derivative thereof, they’ll see Figures 2 and 3 from this post…and read the all-important caption.
(Sarc on.) I’d like to also thank the always-helpful William Connolley of Wikipedia fame and the blog Stoat for trying to post my full name and address on that thread at HotWhopper. A special thanks to Mariam O’Brian for leaving the U.S. Copyright Office website address for my book Who Turned on the Heat?  (On sale for only U.S.$5.00.) Now global warming skeptics from all around the world can easily find my name, address, phone number and email address.  When they’re in the neighborhood, they can take me out for a cup of coffee*. Or those who have always wanted to tip me for my work, but didn’t want to use PayPal, can now send me checks by mail.  How convenient! (Sarc off.)
*PS: Please call first.
*PPS:  Skeptics can also use my new-found home address to send me Christmas cards

UPDATE:  The following is a screen cap of a Google Image search (from the morning of December 1, 2014, a day after this post was originally published): The Tempering Effect of the Oceans on Global Warming

That didn’t take long. Never does.  As I wrote above… every time someone performs a Google Image search of “Tempering Effect of the Oceans on Global Warming”, or some derivative thereof, they’ll see Figures 2 and 3 from this post…and read the all-important caption.
Once again, thank you, Sou (Miriam O’Brien).  Someday Miriam will figure out she’s helping skeptics, not hurting them.  Will that stop her rants?   I think not.  It will simply make her madder.
UPDATE 2:  Believe it or not, this is one of the posts that Sou (Miriam O’Brien) has chosen to comment on at HotWhopper. See my post Miriam O’Brien says: Warmer oceans matter.  It includes an archived version of her painfully flawed rebuttal. Miriam has also given me another idea for a post on ocean warming.

"The origins of the world’s historic agreement to tackle climate change, in Paris in 2015, have some familiar themes. Back in 2007, there was a Republican president in the White House who had long been hostile to any action on climate change. George W Bush had refused to give US backing to a new global roadmap on the climate. Fortnight-long UN talks had dragged on long past the deadline, through the night and into the next afternoon. Every other country wearily signed up, and still the US would not budge. Delegate after delegate pleaded publicly and privately, there were even tears, to no avail. Then finally, to loud cheers, the representative from Papua New Guinea summed up the whole developing world’s frustration as he called to the US officials: “If you’re not willing to lead, please get out of the way.” That stung. And what followed, in December 2007, was a dramatic moment on the international stage, as the White House – under Bush – publicly backed down. The UN’s resolution passed and the so-called Bali roadmap, precursor to the Paris agreement, came into effect. It took another eight tortuous years for the Paris accord – the only global agreement binding nations to hold global heating within scientific limits – to be signed by another US president, Barack Obama. But that moment in Bali was crucial, because it clearly demonstrated for the first time the limits of US power. Bush had sought to stymy progress for years, but ultimately even an intransigent US administration could not prevent the rest of the world moving forward on the climate crisis, if other countries showed a united front. This year, the world will face a similar watershed. Donald Trump began the process of withdrawal from the Paris agreement in June 2017, but for legal reasons it will take effect only on 4 November this year, the day after the US presidential election. The withdrawal comes at a crucial point, as the Paris accord requires countries to come forward this year with new strengthened commitments to cut emissions, ratcheting up their inadequate initial targets from 2015. Only with fresh commitments from all nations can the aims of Paris be fulfilled, as current pledges would take the world to a potentially catastrophic 3C of warming. “This really is absolutely vital,” says Mary Robinson, twice a UN climate envoy and ex-president of Ireland. “How can we reach the level of ambition that we need? We need leadership.” The possibility of a Trump delegation blinking at the last minute, as Bush did, is remote. The 45th president pays far less respect to a rules-based international system than his Republican predecessor. But some in the developing world are sanguine about the prospect of a US withdrawal. Mohamed Adow, director of the thinktank Power Shift Africa, and a longtime observer at the UN talks, argues: “Trump has actually proven the resilience of the Paris agreement. When it was signed, very few people thought that it would have survived a US withdrawal, and yet here we are, the accord is still intact and no other country has followed Trump’s lead and pulled out. Trump has been the ultimate stress-test, and although he’s clearly caused damage, it’s actually shown that the global consensus is that we need to address the climate crisis.” Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, and an adviser to developing countries, draws parallels with the US performance on Covid-19. “Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement has been ignored by the rest of the world, as countries have gone on without the US. However, the damage that Trump is doing to his own citizens by ignoring climate science and virology science is killing his own citizens in alarming numbers.” The world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries are also prepared to push ahead without the world’s biggest economy, and focus on encouraging new commitments from other developed nations. “The US withdrawal is regrettable,” says Carlos Fuller, lead negotiator of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), many of which face inundation at 1.5C or more of warming. “One can only hope that it is not the final chapter for them, and they will return. As for the rest of the world, there is no excuse for further climate inaction and paralysis. The stakes are simply too high, and the window for meaningful action is closing rapidly.” The divisions Trump’s stance has opened up within his own nation have also been starkly in evidence at the annual UN climate talks, where for the last three years, two different American groups have been showing up. One occupies a brightly lit central pavilion hosting prominent politicians, celebrities, business leaders and top investors, attracting big audiences for glitzy presentations on clean technology and green jobs. These are congressional Democrats, state leaders and city mayors, commanding huge budgets and able to slash emissions and foster green schemes, but without the levers of federal power. The real US delegation – the one with the power to vote and veto at the UN – sits down in the hall, in a small drab office with only a diminutive Stars and Stripes and photocopied sign on the firmly shut door, denoting its presence. The official delegation has been as quiet as its understated appearance suggests. Unlike the Bush administration, the Trump White House has made little attempt to disrupt the UN process, and few interventions of any kind. Supporters of Paris have greeted this somnolence with relief, eager to avoid another showdown like Bali. Opponents of Paris have viewed it as an opportunity, however, and that is where the real impact has been felt. Trump’s stance has emboldened other populist leaders and countries with previously veiled hostility to Paris. Last year’s UN climate talks in Madrid sputtered to a close without agreement on the key issues after Brazil held out, with Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and India accused of assisting in the obstruction at various points. “There has been bad behaviour in the negotiations,” says Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “When you have a player as big as the US not moving forward, that enables others to hide behind them.” This year, the coronavirus crisis has forced a postponement of the Cop26 summit to November 2021. While the delay is worrying to many, who fear time and focus will be lost, it also neatly solves a diplomatic dilemma. The talks, called Cop26, were due to start in Glasgow on 9 November, just days after the withdrawal date and the US election. For the UK hosts running the summit, the balancing act was to keep good relations with the Trump White House – which would lead the US Cop26 delegation even if Trump lost, because the presidential handover happens in January – and prevent a blow-up that would scupper any hopes of a deal. At the same time, they were also expected to keep warm backchannels with the Democrats, in case of a Biden victory. By the rescheduled date, either a resurgent Trump will have long departed from the Paris fold and the UK will be dealing with the fallout, or Joe Biden will be president and will have begun the process of taking the US back in. In some ways, the plan for a Trump victory is simpler. The world has already had years to prepare, and long experience of moving on without the US. China and the EU have a summit planned, originally for this year and now delayed, at which they are expected to forge a common approach to Cop26 and fulfilling the Paris agreement. Indeed, the climate crisis looks one of the lesser problems, notes Robinson: “If Trump gets elected, climate will be only one of many disasters with consequences that do not bear thinking about.” Biden has promised the opposite of Trump: a return to the Paris agreement, a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, emphasising renewable energy, low-carbon technology, and a switch from jobs in fossil fuels to green jobs with long-term prospects. That would give fresh impetus to the Cop26 talks, and hearten activists. But no one should think it would be straightforward, warns Yvo de Boer, UN climate chief from 2006 to 2010, who oversaw Bali and the Copenhagen talks in 2009. “You have to remember that there is nothing between the US Senate and God – certainly not the UN,” he says. “So you can’t have any kind of regime that tries to impose things on a sovereign state, no targets to be imposed, no review processes to be intrusive, and if you want to say things about financial obligations it has to be made in loose language.” The US has proved a difficult partner in the past, even under Obama who made climate a key issue, but frustrated the Europeans with lists of demands and vetoes. That close control was demonstrated in Paris, when the conclusion of the accord was almost derailed in the final moments as the US found a single “should” had been mis-transposed as a “shall” in the text. The world was put on tenterhooks for an afternoon while it was fixed. Biden and Trump may not even be the biggest headache the UK faces in trying to forge a new global plan at Cop26. As the White House’s U-turn showed in 2007, a united front among developing countries and enough rich world allies can overcome or bypass US recalcitrance. Far more concerning for the prospects of a breakthrough next year is the position of the world’s other superpower, and biggest emitter: China. Relations between China and the UK, hosts of Cop26, have sunk to a new low. That may turn out to be a far greater obstacle to progress than anything Donald Trump can manage."

“Action Now!” radicalism has destroyed the slow-moving, consensus-based Paris Agreement. It is not just COP 25 that failed; the UN climate change machinery has collapsed. This is good news, even though the reason is bad news.



I have been writing about the climate alarmism movement tearing itself apart for months now. [For example here](https://www.cfact.org/2019/09/28/is-climate-alarmism-tearing-itself-apart/).



The new radicalism is at war with the establishment moderates. This great gulf between radicals and moderates hit the COP 25 summit in Madrid with a vengeance. These annual summits are normally protracted exercises in compromise among the almost 200 nations represented. Not this time.



In Madrid the Action Now! radicals would not even consider compromise. Their extremism then caused the moderates to take hard-line positions as well, so the COP stalled out and failed to act on any significant issue. That what the radicals demand is impossible did not help. The negotiating machinery ground to a noisy halt.



So now we have two very different versions of the alarmist rhetoric and a lot of people on each side. I call them the “Action Now!” hysterics (Greta, XR, etc.) and the moderates. The Paris Accord reflects the slow-moving moderate view. It turns out that a lot of national delegations now take the hysterical view, especially the small island states and the Africans (both of which stand to make the most money).



You could see the breakdown coming on, as Madrid was hyped as the “action COP” when it was nothing of the sort. Even the COP leaders took part in this foolish rhetoric. Yet the sorts of radical national actions being called for were simply not on the agenda. I doubt the moderate negotiators on the ground in Madrid had the authority to even consider the radical’s hysterical demands for immediate drastic action.



Nor is such radical action on upcoming COP agendas. It is not part of the Paris Accord process and therein lies the problem for the Action Now! radicals. They demand what cannot happen.



The hysterics are calling for radical action at next year’s Glasgow COP at the latest. This is highly unlikely, to say the least.



In fact, the harassed moderates in Madrid pointed out that most countries, including all of the major emitters, do not have to file new emission reduction plans until 2030. China and India, the first and fourth biggest emitters, have already said that is their intent. Additionally, their plans allow for unlimited emission increases until 2030, which is intolerable for the Action Now! hysterics.



America, the number two emitter, is certainly not going to file a radical action plan. U.S. membership in the Paris fiasco officially ends the day before the 2020 Glasgow COP begins in November.



If the Action Now! radicals continue their intransigence **then the Paris Accord is essentially dead.** This is almost certain to happen. Ironically the Paris Agreement has been killed by the irrational fear of climate change that spawned it in the first place. Is that cool or what?



The death of the silly Paris Accord is fine by me. My only real concern is that the hysterics might somehow do real damage. So far this seems unlikely, given that what they are demanding is impossible.



This is why I cherish the hysterics. They are wrecking the climate scare political movement. It is like I am fighting an enemy force and suddenly it is having an endless civil war. I am all for that.

"It is an idea universally indulged that escaping to a   spot, preferably surrounded by landscapes of stunning natural beauty, will spark bouts of unnatural creativity. Four years ago, I tested that proposition when my wife and I left London for a tiny cottage in a remote valley in the Black Mountains of South Wales. It felt like another world. The view from the window was of sheep rather than the top deck of red London buses. Our nearest neighbor was a farm a   walk across three fields. We couldn’t hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper. I found that, true enough, with no job, no friends and no television, a lot of writing is possible. I never stopped to consider the cost. Social interaction was so rare that after weeks alone in my writing shed, my ability to regulate conversation atrophied: A friendly question in the post office would elicit a   response. I began to fear the prospect of friends visiting as a threat to my   “space. ” Then, after a year or more, just as the arrival of our first child transformed our isolation from a creative asset into a psychological liability, Rachel, our midwife, came with news. “Oh, there’s another author round here whose baby I just delivered. ” Loneliness and prideful smugness did battle: An unspoken obligation loomed. The author in question turned out to be Owen Sheers. In due course, we admitted to each other the drawbacks of our rural situation. Yes, with nothing but my wife and sheep for company, I had written a second book much faster than the first. But I did like talking about books as well as writing them. In the now popular saying, cities are where ideas go to have sex. So much of contemporary cultural production and consumption takes place in urban settings, and, globally, the pace of urbanization is accelerating. Owen and I shared a latent fear: What were we missing out on? Owen knew several other writers in the area, the nonfiction writer Oliver Balch and the novelist Tom Bullough. I suggested a writers’ book club to discuss a different book every month from the perspective of craft, technique, style. “Yes, a few of us tried that before,” said Tom, wearily. “But someone said something unforgivable about Gogol, and that was the end of it. ” Before the first meeting, we went to a reading and met two more. They, in turn, spread the word further and the net wider. In these hills, writers, it seemed, were more common than vermin. And their enthusiasm for the book club was palpable. To taciturn writers for whom small talk is a kind of torture, it was, I think, a convenient alibi for company. British sociability can often be a perilous obstacle course of implicit obligation where the goal of social occasions is to emerge unscathed without being caught in a web of suffocating reciprocity. We were explicitly gathered not to talk about ourselves, but about books. Now each month we assemble like a clandestine congregation of nonconformists in the basement of a charming local pub: the Bridge End Inn, Talgarth. After several months, we quickly overwhelmed our allotted table and colonized the whole room. Our membership is now pushing 18. Ideas, it seems, are desperate for their monthly hookup. So what of the product? Do the magic ingredients of peace, quiet and stimulating company make any difference to creative output? It’s hard to say. The main factor, we’d all agree, is the cost of time. Money vaporizes in London before you’ve even put your hand in your pocket. But will we write different books outside the city? Maybe not immediately, but the constellation of serious writers in a rural setting is an interesting phenomenon that, I think, reflects wider changes in the global economy and climate. Artists are getting priced out of global cities, and climate change has politicized the rural in new ways. The first book we read was “10:04,” by Ben Lerner. Although the group on the whole reacted badly to the narrow New York focus of the book, the example of the author’s supreme   of place (it is taken as   that Brooklyn is where anyone would want to live) has struck a chord in many discussions since. Away from the city, climate change as a totalizing political and cultural concern is hard to avoid. “How can anyone, now, justify writing a book that is not, in some way, about our relationship to this planet,” our dear late member Rebecca Loncraine said. It would be difficult, here, to write one of those   nature books, with which Britain is currently awash, idealizing the natural world as a zone of innocence untouched by human influence. Lately, we have spent time talking, as all writers do, about the inadequacy of language of the need for a new vocabulary to describe things that humans have denatured, violated. The sea is no longer the same sea that the word initially signified. The air is no longer the air it once was, and so on. Pretentious perhaps, but urgent too. Strangely, I have met more writers in these hills than I ever knew in all the global cities in which I have lived: New York, Chicago, Nairobi, London. Not only has moving away from the city increased my productivity, but I am blessed with that rare thing: a fresh view. My citybound friends still refer to where I live as “the middle of nowhere,” but to me, it increasingly feels at the heart of things."

Jacinda Ardern’s Government has also [villainised farmers](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/national-backs-farmers-marching-against-govt-policies/) through draconian law change proposals that include punitive taxes on livestock emissions and unworkable water quality restrictions. These will undermine a backbone industry that the country relies on for export earnings.



Under the Labour Government, social wellbeing is also deteriorating.



New Zealand is continuing to slide in education. According to the latest three-yearly Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which compares 15-year-olds from 65 countries in reading, science, and maths, [New Zealand is failing to improve its rankings.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/labours-fails-series-education/)



When the tests [started](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/pisa-results-confirm-education-challenge) in 2000, New Zealand ranked 3rd in reading, 7th in science and 4th in mathematics. The latest results of 6,200 New Zealand students from 194 schools produced a ranking of 11th in reading and 12th in science – the same as the 2015 result – while maths has slipped from 21st to 27th. 



In the latest tests, China led in every subject, followed by Singapore, with Macau in third place.



Shamefully, the New Zealand report also indicated an alarming increase in bullying, a significant rise in truancy, and an increasingly negative attitude towards school by students.



Under Labour, health [outcomes](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=12291653) are also in serious decline. Since health targets were removed in 2017, for the first time in a decade, the number of elective surgeries performed in New Zealand has dropped – by 6,000. Immunisation rates have fallen from 92.2 percent to 90.1 percent, the proportion of cancer patients treated within the timeframe guidelines has declined from 93.2 percent to 87.6 percent, and Emergency Department patients seen within six hours has fallen from 93.1 percent to 90 percent.



Meanwhile, [hospital waiting lists](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/labours-fails-series-health-services/) in many parts of the country have exploded with thousands more sick people waiting for specialist assessments and operations.



In spite of employers crying out for workers, the latest benefit statistics from the Ministry of Social Development show the total number of working age New Zealanders on welfare has risen from 277,000 when Labour came to office, to almost 300,000.



The number of Jobseekers has risen 18 percent to 143,000 – the highest level since the global financial crisis.



MSD has [admitted](https://www.nzcpr.com/soft-on-welfare/) that this is largely due to a Government directive **changing their focus from getting people into jobs, to providing financial assistance.** As a result, while the number of special needs grants has increased by 75 percent from 200,000 to 350,000 a year, there is no pro-active work expectation for almost 80 percent of the unemployed.



When it comes to climate change, the rise of [Greta Thunberg](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/what-is-really-happening-in-sweden-greta/), a 16-year-old Swedish girl with Asperger’s Syndrome as the anointed leader of the climate movement, highlights how the United Nations global warming agenda has become a social justice cult. The irony is that while we live in an information age, it’s no longer scientific facts that are being shared, but social hysteria.



Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is part of the problem. With her eyes firmly on the global stage, she has forced the world’s most [punishing carbon restrictions](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/listen-to-the-reactions-after-national-supported-the-zero-carbon-bill/) onto New Zealand. She expects Kiwis to make significant economic sacrifices, while other leaders in other countries like China and India continue their focus on growing their economies and lifting living standards.



This year has also shown us just how determined the Maori sovereignty movement is to gain power – and how successful they have been. Their demands for race-based ‘solutions’ now pervade virtually every aspect of our community including the criminal justice system.



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, veteran journalist Bob Edlin of the Point of Order blog, [outlines how](https://www.nzcpr.com/reforms-to-restore-prisoners-mana/) Labour’s Minister of Corrections Kelvin Davis is appeasing Maori sovereignty activists by ‘softening’ prison vocabulary “to reduce reoffending”:



“Davis is keen to have miscreants’ mana restored in establishments where prison officers are encouraged to regard the people in their custody not as a ‘prisoner’ or ‘offender’ but as ‘men in our care’ (at least in a prison for men). In Tongariro Prison the flawed citizens in their care are being called ‘paihere’… a term developed in consultation with local iwi, Ngati Tuwharetoa.”



Bob explains that with 10,000 prisoners in its custody, Corrections’ new strategy will require staff to refer to prisoners as ‘clients’, ‘people in our care’, ‘paihere’, or to call them by their first names. Words like ‘muster’ will also be banned.



But going soft on prisoners is madness – and that’s what many prison officers are saying about these new changes. Prison is meant to be a punishment – a deterrent to help prevent crime. It is not supposed to be a holiday camp.



The timing of Labour’s decision to make prisons a kinder place is particularly bizarre, since thousands of criminals are being deported back to New Zealand from Australia.



A 2014 Australian law change allowed non-citizens sentenced to a year in prison to be sent back to their home country. Many of the more than 1,200 Kiwis who have been returned are gang members, and as a result, Australian gangs – including the Rebels, Comancheros, Bandidos, and the Mongols – are now setting up chapters in New Zealand.



This is contributing to the number of patched gang members now growing at the fastest rate since the 1970s, with an increase of 1,400 in the past two years – a 26 percent rise since Labour became the Government.



With over 6,700 gang members in New Zealand, what this country does not need is a government that’s going soft on crime.

"Flooding in localised areas around Sydney will happen almost every week by the middle of this century because of human-caused sea level rise, according to a study by scientists at the Bureau of Meteorology. The frequency of flooding around parks, gardens and footpaths had already gone up from less than two days per year in 1914 to a present day rate of about eight days per year, the study found.  If greenhouse gas emissions remained high and no measures were taken to adapt to rising sea levels then flooding events caused simply by tides would be a daily occurrence in Sydney by the end of the century, the study found. Published in the journal Earth’s Future, the study concluded that between 1970 and 2015, human-caused sea level rise had likely been the cause of eight out of 10 flooding events in the Sydney region. Minor inundation had occurred on 248 days since 1970, the study found, but 203 of those days of minor flooding would not have happened without sea level rise. Human-caused global heating has caused sea levels to rise because as oceans warm up, they expand and take up more space. The melting of ice attached to the land – such as ice sheets and glaciers – also raises sea levels. Ben Hague, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology who led the study, said: “What we are talking about here [is] the flooding of streets and car parks and gardens like December 2017 when parts of the Royal Botanic gardens were flooded.” Examples given in the study include the flooding of jetties and gardens at Browns Bay, Woolloomooloo and Elizabeth Bay in January 2014; flooded roads at Como in 2013 and major flooding of roads at Ku-ring-gai in January 2018. High tide now at Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens .. “Never seen it this high” says one gardener. A taste of things to come. pic.twitter.com/h7ICq6h2Qx As well as analysing past minor flooding events, the study also looked at projections of sea level rise for the future to work out how often these flooding events would happen. The study, which included scientists from Monash University, did not account for flooding events exacerbated by storm surges coinciding with high tides. “All the estimates for 2050 are around weekly flooding with a low [greenhouse gas] emissions scenario, where we expect about 47 days per year and, for a higher emissions scenario, about 70 days per year.” By the end of the century, if emissions were reduced dramatically then flooding would occur “every second day”, Hague said, but if emissions were allowed to continue at current high rates then flooding would be a daily occurrence in the Sydney area. You may have seen last night's Supermoon, but did you know that this can cause a #kingtide? The higher than normal water levels have caused some flooding near Fleet Steps today, so please be careful if you're in this area today until flooding subsides. #RBGSydney pic.twitter.com/WtoV1ds5AN Hague said the results in the study presumed that no structural or engineering measures were taken to adapt to the flooding. “But we hope this study helps to improve risk assessments and forecasts and increases our resilience to coastal floods in the future,” he said. According to a 2019 United Nations report on climate change and the oceans, the world’s sea levels will be rising faster by the end of the century even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced quickly. Sea levels will rise by between 43cm and 84cm by the end of the century from their average levels between 1986 and 2005, depending on how much CO2 is emitted. A study in July found that combining rising sea levels with storm surges and high tides would likely expose an extra 23 million people around the world to coastal flooding in the next 30 years, even if greenhouse gas emissions were cut dramatically. Prof John Church, an expert on sea level rise at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, said the findings of the study of Sydney flooding were broadly consistent with previous studies. He said: “The big uncertainties in future sea level rise are really the large-scale issues – climate sensitivity, the future of the ice sheets, and the regional distribution of sea level rise – rather than local issues. Of course local authorities need to be aware of the various local issues, including subsidence. “The general message here is absolutely correct – I have been stating for many years now that the historical one-in-100 year coastal flooding event will be occurring several times a year by 2100 in some locations for high emission scenarios. “This is clearly something we are going to have to deal with. This is the very important aspect of climate change and particularly sea level rise that I have argued for – while the impact today maybe moderate, if we take no action we are locking in very significant impacts in the future. And of course sea level rise does not stop in 2100.” Prof Matthew England, an oceanographer also at the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre, said the study was “credible”, adding that melting ice sheets could push sea levels even higher than current projections. “The numbers are already confronting and just with the thermal expansion of the oceans can make inundation a daily event.” Prof Kurt Lambeck, of the Australian National University, said the most serious issue related to sea level rise would be how it interacted with an increase in the magnitude of storms. “The underlying cause of the anthropogenic sea level change is the rising global temperature. Action on that is required to reduce the likelihood that current rates of sea level rise do not accelerate.”"
"**Facebook and Google have aided the Vietnamese government in censoring criticism and repressing dissent, says rights group Amnesty.**
In a new report, the group accuses the tech giants of ""far-reaching complicity"" by blocking content deemed critical of authorities.
Vietnam's authorities have a reputation for restricting freedom of speech.
In recent years several bloggers have been jailed for publishing articles critical of the Communist state.
""In the last decade, the right to freedom of expression flourished on Facebook and YouTube in Vietnam. More recently, however, authorities began focusing on peaceful online expression as an existential threat to the regime,"" said Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International's deputy regional director for campaigns.
""Today these platforms have become hunting grounds for censors, military cyber-troops and state-sponsored trolls. The platforms themselves are not merely letting it happen - they're increasingly complicit.""
Amnesty's 78-page-report is based on dozens of interviews with human rights defenders and activists, including former prisoners of conscience, lawyers and writers.
The activists claim that their content posted on Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google, has been increasingly blocked in Vietnam.
In one instance, freelance journalist Truong Chau Huu Danh posted on Facebook about an alleged corruption scandal in Vietnam, but was later notified that his posts had been restricted in Vietnam due to ""local legal restrictions"". He was not given any way to contest this, he said.
Facebook announced in April it would ""significantly increase"" compliance with Vietnamese government requests to take down content.
Since then, the number of times the social media platform has restricted content in Vietnam has gone up by 983% , from 77 in the second half of 2019 to 834 in the first half of 2020, according to the company's latest Transparency Report.
Similarly, Google received 74 requests to remove ""government criticism"" in the second half of 2019, up from 44 in the first half of the year, said Amnesty. This included a request to remove over 3,000 YouTube videos that criticised the party and government.
The rights group also noted that a military unit of ""cyber-troops"" and ""troll armies"" of Communist Party volunteers were actively harassing human rights activists on social media platforms.
Amnesty estimates there are 170 prisoners of conscience in Vietnam, of which 69 were in jail ""solely for their society media activity"".
Vietnam is one of the biggest markets in South East Asia for tech firms.
In 2018, Facebook's revenue from Vietnam was nearly $1bn (Â£750m) - almost one third of its revenue from South East Asia - according to industry estimates quoted by Amnesty. Google is said to have earned $475m during the same period, primarily from YouTube advertising.
Vietnam has never banned social media companies, but in April this year, two sources at Facebook told news agency Reuters that their local servers were taken offline until they agreed to significantly increase the censorship of ""anti-state"" posts for local users.
A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We don't always see eye to eye with governments on issues like speech and expression, including in Vietnam, but we work hard to defend this right around the world.
""Over the past few months, we've faced additional pressure from the government of Vietnam to restrict more content, however, we will do everything we can to ensure that our services remain available so people can continue to express themselves.""
Google said in a statement to Amnesty that it took the ""least restrictive approach to removal by blocking [content] in the relevant jurisdiction, while still making it available in other jurisdictions globally""."
"President Trump on Tuesday night named Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court. But there’s a long way to go before the new nominee is confirmed. Judge Gorsuch will immediately face a public and private gantlet of scrutiny, and could end up at the center of fevered political maneuvering. Just 51 votes are needed to confirm him, but one big question looms: Will the Senate Democrats  filibuster the nomination? That would require 60 votes to overcome. Expect the task to drag on for months: Elena Kagan was confirmed 87 days after she was nominated, in 2010 Sonia Sotomayor’s confirmation in 2009 took 66 days, and Samuel Alito Jr. was confirmed 82 days after his nod, in 2006. Events would have to unfold very smoothly for the nominee to be confirmed by April 26, the date of the last scheduled arguments in the current court term, which typically ends in late June. The next term begins in October. Here’s what to expect in the nomination process. The nominee must fill out an elaborate questionnaire, which the Senate will examine. He will be asked to list every client he has ever represented, sources of income, speaking fees, travel destinations, media interviews, writings  —   everything short of where he went to summer camp. The questionnaire often runs hundreds of pages long. The F. B. I. will immediately begin a background check, and the staff members of senators on the Judiciary Committee will start their own investigations. As others pore over documents, the nominee will be calling and meeting with as many senators as possible. The   meetings typically take 15 minutes to an hour, said Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. The senators are typically looking to learn about how the nominee thinks and what makes the    tick, while the nominee is trying to learn what concerns the senators might have, Mr. Wermiel said. There will most likely be political jostling over how the confirmation hearing is conducted. Democrats and Republicans will haggle over issues such as when it will occur, how many rounds of questioning will unfold, how long the rounds will last and how many outside witnesses will be allowed. Republicans will likely try to minimize the length of the hearings, Mr. Wermiel said. The nominee will probably undergo mock questioning from advisers in what is known politely as a “murder board. ” It’s similar to the practice sessions presidential candidates go through with their staff before squaring off in a televised debate advisers try to anticipate the questions that senators will ask. “Ideally, their goal would be that a nominee goes in there facing no question that he had not already heard in one of those sessions,” Mr. Wermiel said. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. once called the hearings a “Kabuki dance. ” Justice Kagan called them a “vapid and hollow charade. ” Nonetheless, the televised hearings will be conducted by the 20 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is made up of 11 Republicans, including Ted Cruz, Orrin Hatch and Lindsey Graham and nine Democrats, including Dianne Feinstein, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. Its chairman is Chuck Grassley, a Republican. There’s an art to the questioning, since nominees must be careful not to take positions on issues that might come before the court. For example, if a nominee directly expressed a preference to overturn Roe v. Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion across the nation, the judge may have to be recused from a future case. So committee members typically ask more roundabout questions, hoping to read the tea leaves about how the nominee’s judicial philosophies would apply to   issues. “It’s this sort of odd dance in which the Senators are trying to elicit some sense of how the nominee thinks about important constitutional questions, but they can’t really ask the things that they want to ask,” Mr. Wermiel said. Recently, the hearings have lasted for three or four days. Expect the senators to question the nominee for a few days, plus an additional day for outside witnesses. At least a week after the hearings, the committee will vote on sending the nomination to the full Senate. A simple majority is needed, but there’s a twist: By tradition, Supreme Court nominations are sent to the Senate even if the nominee is rejected by the committee. Then it’ll be in the hands of all 100 senators, where Republicans hold a   advantage over Democrats (two independents caucus with the Democrats). Both Democrats and Republicans will have difficult decisions to make with vast political consequences. If the Democrats filibuster the nomination, Republicans would need 60 votes to end the filibuster, requiring some Democrats to join the Republicans. That is, unless Republicans use the   nuclear option, a rare maneuver to end the filibuster. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has not ruled out the possibility, but is considered to be a strong believer in the traditions of the Senate, including the right of the minority party to filibuster. In 2013, Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat and the majority leader at the time, used the tactic to push through the Obama administration’s judicial and executive nominees. Furious Republicans vowed that Democrats would regret it once control of the Senate flipped. Mr. McConnell was among those who condemned the tactic at the time. But he said in November that any Republican retaliation by using the nuclear option themselves could backfire. “I don’t think we should act as if we’re going to be in the majority forever,” he said."
"**Ethiopia's parliament has voted to dissolve the government of the northern Tigray region, amid a dispute which has escalated into armed conflict.**
In an emergency session, parliament declared the Tigray administration illegal and voted to replace it.
On Friday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said air strikes had been carried out on military targets in Tigray.
There are fears the conflict could lead to civil war, which could also destabilise neighbouring countries.
The leaders of Tigray dominated Ethiopia for many years until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests and curbed their influence.
They say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed elections due to coronavirus.
The UN has called for a ""de-escalation in the fighting"".
The House of Federation - one of Ethiopia's parliamentary chambers - said the Tigray leadership had ""violated the constitution and endangered the constitutional system"", according to the state-owned broadcaster EBC.
It said a new caretaker administration would hold elections and ""implement decisions passed on by the federal government"".
The simmering row boiled over in September after Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government.
**By Kalkidan Yibeltal, BBC News, Addis Ababa**
Parliament's move signals that the crisis is deepening even though international calls for restraint and de-escalation are increasing.
In a tweet on Saturday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said the military operation he ordered in the state ""aims to end the impunity that has prevailed for far too long"" and ""to hold accountable individuals and groups under the laws of the land"".
For its part, the TPLF, in a statement posted on Facebook, said that ""through their capacity and in the just war they are engaged in, the Tigray people will win"".
Such statements suggest solving the crisis without further military confrontation is increasingly becoming unlikely.
Both the TPLF and the federal government say they will win the conflict in a short period of time but that might not happen.
Prime Minister Abiy has said that there were airstrikes on Friday to destroy missiles, radar equipment and rockets, and that these will continue. The TPLF respond that they have modern weapons.
So, it appears that the conflict is intensifying and it's possible that it might spill over to other parts of the country - and the region.
It's hard to get much detail because the internet and phone lines to Tigray have been cut and the national government is not saying much.
But there are reports that the fighting is spreading along Tigray's border with the Amhara region, which is backing the federal government. There have also been reports of clashes near the border with Eritrea and Sudan, which has partially closed its frontier with Ethiopia.
While Mr Abiy said various military targets had been destroyed, officials in Tigray have denied to the BBC that an air attack took place on Friday.
In a statement earlier on Friday, Mr Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for helping to end a long-standing conflict with Eritrea, insisted that the military operation in Tigray had ""clear, limited and achievable objectives"".
He previously declared a six-month state of emergency in the region and gave a new military taskforce the powers to ""restore law and order"".
Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael previously accused Mr Abiy's administration of plotting to invade the state.
Tension has been mounting for some time as relations between the TPLF and the federal government have deteriorated.
Although Tigray represents just 6% of Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, the TPLF used to be the dominant force in Ethiopia's ruling coalition but its power has waned since Mr Abiy became prime minister.
Last year, he dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically-based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
A statement from the prime minister's office on Friday said that some members of the TPLF were ""fugitives from justice"" and suggested they opposed Mr Abiy's attempts to reform the way Ethiopia was run.
This week, after TPLF leaders accused the government of preparing to invade, they seized a federal army base in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, prompting Mr Abiy to mobilise the army."

"It was as though time had stood still at Latisha Hopewell’s apartment in Lower Manhattan. A colorfully decorated Christmas tree again stood near the entrance of her mostly unadorned apartment. Freshly opened presents for her daughters, Shaun and Shani Bates, were stacked beneath the tree, as the girls sat next to their mother on a large, green sofa in their living room. Two years ago, the setting was the same. Ms. Hopewell had gone back to college a year and a half earlier to set an example for her daughters and to finally secure not another job, she said, but a career. Though she was stretched exhaustingly thin among classes, a   job and parenting, she talked about a renewed dedication to completing a path she had begun nearly 20 years earlier, and how a degree would allow her to provide for her daughters in a way she had always wanted. Now Ms. Hopewell, 37, is ebullient, and full of smiles, hugs and laughs. After spending the last three and a half years studying forensic psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Midtown, it was official: She was a college graduate, the first in her family. “It feels great,” she said, adding that “it will feel better once I walk down that aisle. ” She finished her degree in December but is saving the big celebration for after the graduation ceremony later this year. She has already rewarded herself in other ways, though: After her last class, she took a few days off work to spend time with her daughters during their winter break from school and to catch up on   sleep. This milestone has been a long time coming for Ms. Hopewell. She attended Buffalo State College from 1997 to 2001, but left before graduating to get a job to pay off tuition debt. It was meant to be a brief hiatus  —   until, she said, life happened. She became pregnant with Shaun and then with Shani several years later. There were low points and hardships, including living in a homeless shelter for three years. She has largely raised her daughters on her own. Though she always knew she would find her way back to school, Ms. Hopewell said the motivation she needed came from an unexpected place. “She started it,” Ms. Hopewell said, pointing at her older daughter, Shaun, who is 13. She would needle her mother when Ms. Hopewell was stumped by Shaun’s homework despite having gone to college. “I didn’t finish,” Ms. Hopewell recalled telling her daughter. But that line will not work anymore. “I have no excuses now,” she said. Ms. Hopewell said Shaun had taken on the “super   role,” picking up the slack to take care of Shani, who is 8, when her mother went back to college. Their days typically began with Shaun waking up her sister and Ms. Hopewell seeing the girls off to school before she headed to John Jay. After her morning classes, Ms. Hopewell said, she would go home to make dinner for her children before leaving for her   job as a medical data clerk. Though friends and family pitched in to help look after her daughters when they could, there were times when she had no choice but to take Shaun and Shani to the library so that she could use a computer to write papers. The family made it work, but some of the pressure was lifted in 2014. After hearing of her struggles, a social worker from Educational Alliance, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped Ms. Hopewell get a laptop so she could do schoolwork at home. The organization used $1, 525 from the fund to help Ms. Hopewell in 2014, including $500 for the laptop. Despite the challenges, Ms. Hopewell said she never doubted she would graduate. “There were plenty of nights I cried and asked why I did this to myself,” Ms. Hopewell said. “But at the end of the day I know it’s beneficial for my family and I want bigger and better things, and I have to do it. ” Among those things is a house in Atlanta and financial security. “I don’t want my kids to have to worry about anything,” Ms. Hopewell said. “I want to leave a legacy for my kids when I leave this earth, and living paycheck to paycheck is not going to get it. ” The laptop is still being put to good use. Even Shaun borrows it for her homework when her mother does not need it. Though going back to school meant less time together as a family, Ms. Hopewell said she thought the experience had brought them closer, and they continue to inspire one another. “It’s quite amazing actually  —   juggling work and school and us,” Shaun said of her mother’s achievements. “I’m very proud of her for taking the time to go back to school so she can be a role model for us. ” And her mother’s drive, Shaun said, has been infectious. “Now that she believes in herself more, she instills that motivation in me more,” Shaun said. The   student said she hoped to study neuroscience at Harvard one day. There is more class time in store for Ms. Hopewell as well. She is looking into graduate programs for social work at several local colleges and hopes to start as early as this fall. The goal is to become a licensed counselor for   adolescents. But for now, the adolescents she is most focused on are the two in her apartment, she said. She hopes they see from her experiences that education is the best way to avoid repeating her struggles. “This experience showed me that I’m raising   young ladies who can adapt to any situation and make the best of it,” Ms. Hopewell said. “Their capabilities are endless. ”"
"The children around the world who need emergency international assistance the most come mainly from the countries singled out in President Trump’s order barring entry to the United States, according to a United Nations assessment. Five of the seven countries where children are most imperiled are on Mr. Trump’s list of nations where visas are suspended: Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The children most at risk are Syrian, whether they have fled as refugees or are still in their country, according to Unicef, the United Nations’ children’s agency. All Syrians have been barred indefinitely from entering the United States under Mr. Trump’s executive order. Other countries where Unicef says children are imperiled include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Sudan. They are not part of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visas  —   though the order also bars all refugees, regardless of where they come from, for 120 days. “This shows who the ban really impacts: the world’s most vulnerable, women and children who are fleeing terror,” said Jennifer Sime, a senior vice president at the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organization focused on refugees. “America is turning away from its leadership role on refugee resettlement, and it is refugees who are paying the price. ” The United Nations compiled the assessment weeks before Mr. Trump signed the executive order and published it on Tuesday. Here is what the Unicef report says the agency needs for the five countries included in the executive order where children are most at risk. The United Nations says it needs around $1 billion to aid children displaced by six years of conflict in Syria. Calling the Syrian refugee crisis “the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II,” Unicef says there are more than 2. 2 million children living as refugees in countries neighboring Syria. The organization is also asking for more than $300 million to help more than 5. 8 million children still living in the   country. It says most of that money is needed for water, sanitation, hygiene and medical aid. Unicef is seeking about $200 million in aid for Yemen, which is in a civil war and straining from a devastating famine. The organization says the bulk of that money would go to feed 6. 9 million children this year. More than 5. 1 million children are in need in Iraq, about   of them displaced from their homes by conflict. The United Nations is seeking about $160 million to vaccinate more than five million children under 5 against polio. The United Nations plans to help more than two million Sudanese children under 5 who are acutely malnourished. Unicef is seeking more than $100 million, most of it for nutrition programs. “Somalia remains in a state of chronic humanitarian crisis,” Unicef said in its appeal for more than $60 million, estimating that as many as 850, 000 children there who are under 5 will be acutely malnourished in 2017."
"As the climate crisis intensifies, scientists and experts agree that systemic change is critical. But while individual efforts alone aren’t enough to reverse global heating, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing we can do. We asked several climate scientists and advocates about individual actions that can make a difference. Katharine Hayhoe, atmospheric scientist: I have transitioned over 80% of the talks I give to virtual online events (100% these days!), and when I do travel, I bundle my requests and commitments such that I am doing anywhere from 4-5 to as many as 15-25 events in each location that I fly to, in order to minimize the carbon footprint of each individual event. Adrienne Hollis, climate justice and health scientist: I am being mindful about the water shortage. I like to plant around my deck, and I use my rain barrel to water my plants. It’s a small thing, and it’s a big thing. I get up at about 6 to water my plants, and I grow my herbs and peppers. It makes me feel like I am making a difference. And feeling like you’re making a difference is important. It’s finding your way of contributing. It makes you feel like you’re a part of the fight. Sonia Aggarwal, energy policy expert: I recently found a great deal on a gently used electric car, and I have been loving it for those essential trips when I can’t walk, bike or use public transit. One thing I didn’t expect: this electric car is the most fun to drive! It’s peppy and quiet and it just feels so good to breeze right past the gas station without a second thought. Michael Mann, climatologist: I speak out about the climate crisis, and the importance of taking action, using every medium, vehicle, forum or platform that is available to me. Catherine Flowers, environmental justice leader: Use less plastic or no plastic, recycle, eat less meat, reduce our own carbon footprint, build better – there are lots of things we can do. Don’t buy unsustainable products, choose something else. That’s the quickest way to get people to change is to make another choice, then of course the market will adjust. Aggarwal: Home energy use is responsible for 20% of US greenhouse gas emissions, between the electricity we use and the fuels we burn on site. There are some cool new technologies out there that can support the same or better service at home, while reducing energy use and emissions. Those include super-efficient heat pumps and new induction stoves that are safer than gas and offer the same or better temperature control. Many utilities and states offer rebates for appliances like these. Klaus Jacob, geophysicist: It’s fine to put solar panels on our roofs and take only a three-minute shower instead of a 10-minute shower. But what is really needed is that the individuals participate and communicate in neighborhood actions where you have the best chance to make a difference. I live in a small village on the Hudson river. As sea level rises, so does the Hudson. Over the last two decades, I have made sure that our village is one of the most aware that it is losing a good portion of its housing before the year 2050. We already have flooding on our streets. Flowers: Vote – that’s the most basic thing. Mann: Reducing your carbon footprint via climate-friendlier lifestyle choices is certainly important. It sets a good example for others and can help make a dent in the problem. But the most important thing you can do is demand policy action and systematic change. Individuals can’t provide subsidies for clean energy or put a price on carbon, but governments can. We need politicians who will support climate-friendly policies. And we need to get rid of those who won’t. Voting is one critical way to do that, and if you live in the US, it’s absolutely critical that you vote on climate in the upcoming general election – from president all the way down to dogcatcher. Hollis: We need to be more proactive in conversing with our elected officials about renewable energy and the climate crisis. We also need to recognize the importance of our votes. Really ask yourself, “Who cares about me and the planet?” That doesn’t cost you anything, and it’s worth a little time especially if you don’t have money. You have your voice. Hayhoe: The US needs a national plan to cut carbon across the economy. In my opinion, that plan needs bipartisan support, to ensure it doesn’t just turn into a hot potato as administrations change. And it must address the injustices and inequities inherent to fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts. Aggarwal: I have been heartened to see increased alignment on the essential policies and actions we need to reduce carbon across the economy and support good, family-sustaining jobs in the process. The most important political action we can each take is to get out and support local, state and federal leaders who will prioritize clean energy action – by voting and campaigning for these folks. Another often overlooked political opportunity lies with your Public Utilities Commission (PUC), a body that oversees electricity choices in each state. Each state PUC is led by just three to seven individuals – meaning only about 200 people preside over some of the most important questions facing America’s clean energy transition. Check out a PUC hearing and make your voice heard. Katharine Hayhoe, atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University Adrienne Hollis, senior climate justice and health scientist, the Union of Concerned Scientists Sonia Aggarwal, vice-president, Energy Innovation Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center, Pennsylvania State University Catherine Flowers, founder, the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice Klaus Jacob, special research scientist, Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory"
"Resource-intensive agriculture, despite its productivity, nevertheless has failed to feed the world’s current population, never mind the nine billion people expected by 2050. This system that currently fails both people and planet is ripe for revision. We need to be more ambitious, to go beyond simply producing more. We need to produce more of what’s good – not just cereal staples, but nutrition-dense foods – in ways that can prevent or even reverse land degradation, encourage biodiversity, conserve water, and allow the world’s poor more equal access to land, food, and markets than has historically been the case. There is a significant “triple burden” of malnutrition. Some 850m people don’t have enough to eat. Perversely some 1.4 billion people are overweight, 600m of them obese. Both groups suffer from micronutrient malnutrition, a lack of key vitamins and minerals. These imbalances mean we ought to examine what exactly is being produced, and how it is distributed. The co-existence of highly productive agricultural systems and hunger, of obesity and starvation, powerfully highlight how global agriculture has failed to substantially narrow economic inequalities, and has perpetuated nutritional imbalances on billions. And despite its failures, agriculture’s costs are high. Crop and livestock production is responsible for half the methane and two-thirds of the nitrous oxide released by humans. The use of nitrous fertiliser has disrupted global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. And agriculture is a leading driver of global biodiversity loss, something that greatly affects communities around the world that rely on wild species for food and income. We can’t simply hope to produce more of the same and feed the world. There are alternative models, but they need recognition and support. However the emphasis on production efficiency“ is dominant, even in discussions of sustainable agricultural intensification. Here, thought is only given to how to increase supply of cereals and animal products in ever more efficient ways. The Green Revolution in Latin America and South Asia, for example, resulted in tremendous increases in crop yield. But this was only because new technologies were supported by government subsidies, cheap credit, supportive markets and plentiful irrigation. This increased productivity did not, by itself, result in a better-fed population. It provided an abundance of calorie-rich staple crops such as rice and wheat, but saw the supply of nutrient-rich crops such as pulses and vegetables fall and their cost rise. And this model of intensive irrigation and fertiliser use wasn’t an option everywhere. India’s Green Revolution was concentrated in the favourable lands of the Punjab, ignoring the rain-fed drylands that support most of the country’s farmers.  Even when grown in larger amounts, crops must be accessible and affordable if they are to alleviate hunger. This cannot be left to global markets, whose volatility in recent years has made it substantially harder to alleviate poverty and hunger – a fact recognised by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, which has stated ""unless local agriculture is developed and/or other income-earning opportunities open up, the food insecurity determined by limited local production will persist, even in the middle of potential plenty at the world level”. So production is necessary, but insufficient: ensuring produce is properly distributed to fair markets is vital. In India for example, it has long been the case due to a lack of proper storage facilities, corruption and inequity in the means of distribution, grain surpluses are simply left to rot without ever reaching the hungry.  A recent report on food by Robert Craig, highlights just how dominant this “productivist” approach is. The report examines the status of agriculture in Brazil, Chile, Peru, the US, India, China and New Zealand. Craig shows how – while each country presents very different social-ecological conditions – the dominant rhetoric is the same in each: production, profits, demand, supply and prices of major commodities, traded on world markets. Seen through this lens, there is no room for a nuanced ecological approach, let alone awareness of the political, social and economic factors that influence hunger. Estimates of land and water are pitted against demand projections. “Sustainability” only means using resources efficiently. Complex environments are reduced to either source or sink. The author is told in Peru “if river water reaches the sea it’s seen as a waste”. He is shown how resources could be developed to meet projected demand: the schemes range from trying to control how much farmers can irrigate in India, to spending £62 billion to bring alive Mao’s vision of a canal to transport water from China’s southern region to its arid north. This is a scheme that has displaced over 300,000 people, disrupted the southern river basins, and may fail anyway, if climate change leaves them with less water in the southern rivers to draw from. So are there alternatives? Very much so. There is an emerging global movement that emphasises increased consumer participation in (ostensibly) ecologically sound and socially just food systems. And for increasing production using ecologically sound methods, – so-called sustainable intensification, – there is a great deal of agroecological practice worldwide that is recognised by researchers. In India, farmers are revitalising rice production by applying principles of the System of Rice Intensification. In some states, the technique has been officially endorsed and supported. Across Africa, sustainable production practices, designed with farmer participation, have raised yields, and enhanced the agricultural landscape. Such practices have also contributed to a range of human development goals, such as food security, alleviating poverty, and improving skills and knowledge. These systems and practices are designed to do more than just conserve resources and boost yields. More ambitious, they aim to feed people balanced, nutrient-rich diets, while reversing the substantially damaging effects on land, plant and wildlife biodiversity that industrial agriculture has wrought. They can also boost human potential, by increasing the income, skills and political capital of small farmers and landless agricultural labourers who currently steward most of the world’s agricultural land, yet who are completely marginalised. These are the principles and perspectives at the frontlines of genuine change in the global food system. They are already here, and they are the seeds that have been sown for food’s sustainable future."
"A cost-benefit analysis of options for a seawall at Wamberal beach commissioned by the New South Wales government in 2017 found that none of the six engineering options considered would deliver a net public benefit and that erosion would only increase with rising sea levels. “A seawall will provide benefits to beachfront properties by reducing the impacts of coastal processes,” the report by Marsden Jacobs found. “However, in the longer term, more properties in this area are likely to experience greater damage and loss of property values from the increased flooding of Terrigal lagoon associated with sea level rise.  “Higher sea levels will result in the increasingly frequent inundation of hundreds of properties surrounding the Terrigal lagoon, the loss of the beach, and impacts on council assets such as water, electricity, sewerage and roads,” it found. “The key beneficiaries from construction of a seawall are the approximately 60 owners of beachfront properties at Wamberal.”  As the Central Coast of NSW braces for another lashing today, the state government is still sitting on another report by the NSW coastal council, commissioned by the local government minister, Shelley Hancock, which looks at the vexed problems of seawalls and coastal erosion in the state.  Councils up and down the coast face a dilemma: should they require their entire ratepayer base, which often includes many retirees, to support costly seawall projects that often involve ongoing requirements for beach replenishment? Or should councils be looking at adaption strategies that accept that coasts are dynamic – some areas such as Wamberal, Collaroy, Byron Bay and Port Stephens more so than others – and that the battle to protect inappropriately located development will become even more difficult due to sea level rise? Letting properties slide into the sea is politically unpalatable and the cost of buying up the waterfront properties far more expensive than it was 50 years ago when the first problems emerged. Former coastal council member and engineer Angus Gordon says the answer lies in changing the Local Government Act to allow councils to recoup the costs of the seawall from waterfront property owners over time, though a long-term levy on the affected properties. Other schemes, at Collaroy, have involved subsidies from state and local government, with waterfront home owners still facing $400,000 bills to build the wall. Yet there remains concerns about both the environmental impact of seawalls and how they will perform in the future. The Marsden Jacobs study on Wamberal was informed by a detailed study by the then-NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, which found that the coastal processes acting on the dune that separates Terrigal lagoon from Wamberal beach – and where the most vulnerable houses are located – are complex and will get worse with sea level rise. It found that without a wall, 82 properties in the study area are likely to be affected by coastal processes over a 20-year timeframe, and 92 properties over 50 years. In May this year, Central Coast council commissioned Manly Hydraulic Laboratory to design a concept plan for a seawall solution. The $400,000 study is being funded by both the state government and council. Another company, Royal Haskoning DHV, looked at short-term measures. But as the Marden Jacobs report detailed, the trade-off from protecting about 60 beachfront properties with a seawall would be the potential loss of visits due to the loss of the beach. “This loss of visitors may create some concern in the wider Central Coast local government area, especially as 32% of the beachfront properties that would potentially be protected by a seawall (at the expense of the beach) are only occupied occasionally,” Mardsen Jacobs said. The report considered a range of structural engineering approaches to protect beachfront properties and other infrastructure at Wamberal beach and the surrounding lagoon properties from the effects of coastal processes. It found that none of the engineering options considered provided a net public benefit for the local community. This is because all of the seawall options would result in the loss of beach areas, and without sand replenishment the beach would quickly disappear, with significant costs to the local tourism industry. Marsden Jacobs said it was not clear which seawall option would lead to the fastest loss of the beach but all would result in an unusable beach by 2064, without a major sand replenishment program “The cost of sand replenishment is very high and outweighs the benefits of retaining a beach in front of a seawall,” it said. “Only a Planned Retreat option (Option 8) -retreat by managing the duration, type and intensity of future development within the coastal hazard area – provided greater benefits than a continuation of the current approach.” The beach at Wamberal was vulnerable to erosion long before the first homes were built. Terrigal lagoon sits directly behind Wamberal beach and currently drains into the sea just to the south of the slipping houses, but locals says the lagoon used to drain to the beach at a different spot, suggesting active coastal processes. Two storms in the 1970s – in May 74 and June 78 – saw several houses on the strip claimed by the sea. Boulders rubbish, car bodies and the remains of houses were dumped as a makeshift wall and the sand eventually returned. At that stage the council could have bought back properties. Instead it continued to approve development, requiring new homes to have deep piles into the sand.  Comment has been sought from Central Coast council."

Growth‐​management laws and plans, which strictly regulate what people can and cannot do with their land in the name of controlling urban sprawl, do far more harm than good and should be repealed.



To correct the problems created by growth management, states should restrict the authority of municipal governments, especially counties, to regulate land uses. Some 13 states have growth‐​management laws that require local governments to attempt to contain urban growth. These laws take development rights from rural landowners and effectively create a “new feudalism” in which the government decides who gets to develop their land and how. The strictest laws are in California and Hawaii, followed by Oregon, Washington, New Jersey, and several Northeastern states.



Growth‐​management advocates say that their policies protect farms and open space, save energy and reduce air pollution, and reduce urban service costs. However, farms and open space hardly need saving, as the nation has an abundance of both. There are much better ways of saving energy and reducing pollution that cost less and don’t make housing unaffordable. Finally, the costs of growth management are far greater than the costs of letting people live in densities that they prefer.



As compared to the trivial or nonexistent benefits of growth management, the costs are huge. Median home prices in growth‐​managed regions are typically two to four times more than those in unmanaged areas. Growth restrictions also dramatically increase home price volatility, making homeownership a riskier investment. Growth management slows regional growth, exacerbates income inequality, and particularly harms low‐​income families, especially minorities such as African Americans and Latinos.



The key to keeping housing affordable is exactly the opposite of what growth management prescribes: minimizing the regulation of vacant lands outside of incorporated cities. Allowing developers to build on those lands in response to market demand will also discourage cities from overregulation lest they unnecessarily push development outside the city





  
Under the feudalistic system of medieval Europe the monarch owned all of the land in a country and people were allowed to use that land only at his or her sufferance and by paying an annual royalty to the monarch. Substitute ""government"" for ""monarch"" and this system still prevails in most of the world today, including much of Africa, Asia, and South America.



In the ""more enlightened"" parts of Europe and North America, however, a new kind of feudalism has taken hold. Under this new feudalism people may own private property, but what they can do with that property is strictly controlled by the government. The new feudalism was pioneered by Great Britain in 1947, but has since been adopted by many other European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and by several American states and Canadian provinces, most notably British Columbia, California, Florida, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and several Northeastern states.



The policies that restrict private property under the new feudalism are collectively known to urban planners as _growth management_.1 These include any policies designed to influence either where or how fast growth takes place. The most popular form of growth management today is _smart growth_ , which focuses on limiting the expansion of urban areas and increasing population densities in areas that are already urbanized. Some older forms of growth management, which might be called slow growth, attempted to limit the expansion of urban areas while also limiting the density or growth rates of those areas.



Advocates of growth management say that it produces many benefits, including preservation of farm lands, energy savings, reduced air pollution, and lower infrastructure costs. In fact, these benefits are either imaginary or could more easily be achieved in other ways without restricting property rights.



Farm lands, for example, are extremely abundant and do not need protection from urbanization. More energy can be saved and pollution reduced at a far lower cost by making motor vehicles and buildings more energy efficient than by attempting to influence land-use patterns. The small savings in infrastructure costs from growth management also pale in comparison to the high costs of growth management.



In comparison with the dubious benefits of growth management, the costs are overwhelming. The most quantifiable cost is the effect on housing prices. Housing typically costs two to five times more in states with growth-management laws than in states without such laws. While the data are not as readily available for commercial and industrial real estate, growth management has similar effects on their prices as well.



Growth management also increases the volatility of real estate prices, leading to bubbles. In places with no growth management, real estate bubbles are so rare as to be nearly nonexistent. But most places that pass growth-management laws soon begin to experience volatile prices and bubbles: Britain has had at least three bubbles since passing its 1947 law; California has had three and is entering a fourth; and Oregon has had two and is entering a third. Increased volatility discourages homeownership by increasing the risk of purchasing a home.



By increasing real estate prices, growth management slows the growth of states and regions that have adopted it and, in turn, of the nation as a whole. While many states that have not adopted growth management have grown faster as a result of people and businesses migrating from growth-managed states, the cost of such migrations are a deadweight loss on society. As a result, the nation's overall growth in gross domestic product is close to 10 percent lower than it would be without growth management.



Another major cost is an increase in income and wealth inequality. Indeed, much of the increase in inequality since 1968 (when American inequality was at its lowest) is due to growth management enriching existing homeowners while impoverishing new home buyers and renters.



A final major cost is unemployment. Normally, homeowners have lower unemployment rates than renters. But growth management reverses this because it can make selling a house and moving crushingly expensive. Thus, many homeowners in growth-managed regions remain unemployed rather than search for work in other parts of the country.



These costs fall disproportionately on low-income families, many of whom are minorities. The effect of growth management can be seen by considering African Americans, who remain the least economically mobile minority in America. While urban areas with the most intensive growth management, such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Honolulu, continue to grow, albeit slowly, their Black populations are often declining. African American populations in other growth-managed areas may be growing, but the quality of the housing they live in is declining.



For all these reasons, it is imperative that states repeal laws mandating or authorizing city, county, and regional governments to practice growth management. Local and regional governments that practice growth management should abolish their plans.





  
The first democratic nation to use growth management was the United Kingdom, whose parliament passed the Town & Country Planning Act in 1947. This law established large greenbelts around all major cities and forbade new developments in those belts.2 Later laws restricted development on most other rural lands as well. A small number of people own most rural land in Britain: just 36,000 own half the land in the country.3 Those landowners were compensated with an annual payment that today exceeds $120 per acre, or more than $5 billion per year nationwide.4 Britain's example inspired many European nations, as well as Australia and New Zealand, to pass similar laws, while in Canada, the British Columbia legislature passed the first of several increasingly restrictive laws, beginning with the Town Planning Act in 1949, and most recently, the Growth Strategies Act of 1995.5



In 1961, Hawaii became the first American state to pass a growth-management law. Act 187 divided the state into three types of land: urban, agriculture, and conservation, and restricted development on the latter two types. In 1963, a fourth type was added, rural, probably to keep undeveloped lands from being urbanized even if they had no agricultural or conservation value.6



In 1963, the California legislature passed AB 1662, sometimes called the Knox-Nesbit Act, to regulate city annexations and the formation of new cities and service districts.7 Although not intended to be a growth-management law, AB 1662 placed authority over annexations and new governments in the hands of the cities. The cities soon realized that they could force most new development (and associated tax revenues) to stay within their borders by denying applications for new cities and service districts. Many cities and counties soon drew urban-growth boundaries outside of which development was strictly limited.



The barriers to growth created by this law were compounded by the 1970 passage of the California Environmental Quality Act, which required a detailed analysis prior to any public actions. State courts held that expanding an urban-growth boundary required such an analysis, the cost of which became so prohibitive that boundaries are almost never expanded.



The Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco-Oakland urban areas are all heavily constrained by these laws. For example, only 34 percent of the five counties in which the San Francisco-Oakland urban area is located have been urbanized. About 20 percent is public land, leaving 45 percent available for urbanization. But this land, although it is private, cannot be developed because of growth boundaries and other government restrictions. Similarly, two-thirds of the three-county Los Angeles area (Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties) and more than 80 percent of San Diego County are undeveloped rural land.8



Taken together, California's laws could be considered a slow-growth-management scheme rather than smart growth, as many of the cities and counties that passed urban-growth boundaries also limited population densities within the boundaries. In 2008, the California legislature attempted to convert this to smart growth by passing Senate Bill 375, which requires cities to rezone to higher densities, supposedly in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.9 Yet the densities of major California urban areas had already increased to well above the national average for urbanized areas of about 2,500 people per square mile. Between 1980 and 2010, San Francisco's urban density grew by 32 percent to 5,300 people per square mile; Los Angeles' by 28 percent to 6,620 people per square mile; and San Diego's by 45 percent to 4,040 people per square mile.10



Between 1970 and 2000, 11 more states passed statewide planning laws, most of which ended up requiring urban-growth boundaries around most or all cities in those states: Vermont (1970), Oregon (1973), Connecticut (1974), Florida (1985), New Hampshire (1985), New Jersey (1986), Maine (1988), Rhode Island (1988), Washington (1990), Maryland (1992), and Delaware (1995).11 Georgia passed a state planning law in 1989 but never implemented growth boundaries.12 Tennessee passed a 1998 planning law that requires urban-growth boundaries, but those boundaries are solely used to determine where cities may annex land, not to manage growth. Florida partially repealed its law in 2011.13



Of the states that mandate urban-growth boundaries, Oregon's law is typical and has served as the model for many of the other states. Oregon's Senate Bill 100 created a state land-use commission that wrote rules that cities and counties were required to follow in their planning and zoning. The commission required that every city have a growth boundary. Although the law requires cities to expand boundaries to meet future housing needs, a 1993 amendment allows them to meet those needs by rezoning neighborhoods within the boundaries to higher densities.



A few other states do not have explicit growth-management laws but still have effective limits on growth. Nearly 85 percent of Nevada is owned by the federal government, and this has hampered growth in the Las Vegas and Reno urban areas. Like most New England states, Massachusetts has mostly given up on the county level of government, so cities and townships control land uses and have limited the geographic expansion of Boston and other cities.



A few cities and urban areas outside of these states also practice growth management. Most notable is Boulder, Colorado, which has purchased land or easements to form a greenbelt around the city equal to more than nine times the land area of the city itself. Boulder's plan was a slow-growth plan, as it also limited the number of building permits that could be issued within the city each year. The Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul urban areas also have urban-growth or urban-service boundaries outside of which new development is restricted.



Loudoun County, in northern Virginia, uses large-lot zoning to discourage new development, while Montgomery County, Maryland, has placed most of the undeveloped land in the county in either an agricultural reserve or in easements. Together, these limit the growth of the Washington, D.C., urban area.



Most other cities in America have zoning, but zoning is not growth management. In most cases, zoning exists to protect existing neighborhoods from unwanted intrusions, and many cities and counties readily change zoning at the request of landowners when the changes will not significantly affect neighbors.



Texas does not authorize counties to zone. This allows developers to maintain a large supply of buildable lots that can absorb the rapid population growth of Dallas-Ft. Worth, Houston, San Antonio, and other Texas urban areas. Other states, including Indiana and Nevada, allow counties to zone but do not require it, and several counties in these states don't zone. Even where counties do zone, they tend to be highly flexible, often putting undeveloped land in a ""holding zone"" that they will happily alter if the landowners want to develop the property.



Zoning is far from perfect, but city zoning alone does not make housing unaffordable. What makes housing unaffordable is restrictions on development outside the cities. So long as a significant inventory of land is available for development outside of a city, the region will have room to grow and the city itself will have an incentive to minimize land-use regulation lest it lose new developments — and the resulting tax revenues — to the county or other nearby cities. Growth management, whether slow growth or smart growth, aims to use state and regional governments to restrict rural development in order to force most growth into the cities. The cities, in turn, then impose even more restrictions because they know that developers have nowhere else to go.



In sum, growth management affects housing markets in about a dozen states and several more urban areas. It also affects housing markets in cities adjacent to those states. Since Connecticut and New Jersey both have growth management, New York City is affected. Since Maryland and northern Virginia counties both have growth management, Washington, D.C., is affected. In total, around 40 percent of all American housing is made artificially expensive by growth management.





  
Advocates of growth management argue that it will do everything from curing obesity to reducing teenage angst. Most of these claims are absurd.14 However, at least three arguments deserve detailed consideration as they are most often cited and fervently believed by many public officials. Growth management is necessary, they say, to preserve farms, forests, and open space; to save energy and reduce pollution; and to minimize the costs of infrastructure and urban services.





  
The supposed need to protect farms, forests, and open space from urban sprawl is probably the most cited reason for growth management. Yet America is a big country and urbanization is no threat to the nation's abundance of green spaces. Creating artificial shortages of housing and other urban land uses in order to protect lands that are abundant is poor policy.



The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that, as of 2012, the 48 contiguous states have more than 900 million acres of agricultural land, of which only about 362 million acres (40 percent) is used for growing crops.15 Moreover, the number of acres needed for growing crops has shrunk from 421 million acres in 1982 because per-acre yields of most major crops have grown faster than our population.16 As a result, says the department, urbanization ""is not considered a threat to the Nation's food production.""17



Forests are also abundant. The Forest Service says that the United States had 766 million acres of forests in 2012, up from 721 million acres in 1920.18 The increase is mostly due to the automobile and other motor-powered vehicles that replaced horses and other animal power and allowed farmers to convert tens of millions of acres of pasture land to croplands and forests. Timber inventories have grown from 616 million cubic feet of wood in 1953 to 972 million cubic feet in 2012 because forests have been growing and continue to grow considerably faster than they have been cut.19



Finally, open space is the most abundant land we have, as it includes agricultural lands, forests, and other green spaces. The Census Bureau says that, as of 2010, only 107 million acres of land have been urbanized in the contiguous 48 states, or just 3.6 percent of nearly 3 billion acres. The most heavily developed state, New Jersey, is still 60 percent rural open space.20 Using a somewhat different definition of ""urbanized,"" the Department of Agriculture found 91 million acres were urbanized in 2012.21 Using either figure, more than 96 percent of the United States remains as rural open space.



There is little danger that population growth will render American farms, forests, and open spaces endangered in the future. The population of Britain is eight times denser than that of the United States, yet even that country has a surplus of rural lands. As economists with the London School of Economics observe, ""planning policies seem to considerably overvalue the wider environmental and welfare costs arising from greenfield as compared to brownfield development and especially overvalue the prevention of development on all Greenbelt land regardless of that land's actual environmental or amenity value.""22





  
The claim that denser development will save energy by reducing the distances people need to drive was made in a 1973 book, Compact City, and has been an article of faith among urban planners ever since.23 In fact, as explained in detail in a previous Cato policy analysis, _The Myth of the Compact City_ , the data fail to support this idea.24



As noted in that paper, the Transportation Research Board asked David Brownstone, an economist with the University of California-Irvine, to study this issue. After a detailed literature review, Brownstone found that most of the studies that found a major link between urban form and energy use were guilty of _self-selection bias_ — that is, their finding that people living in dense neighborhoods drove less than those living in less-dense neighborhoods was due to the fact that people who didn't want to drive tended to live in denser neighborhoods. Based on those studies that corrected for self-selection, Brownstone concluded that the link between density and driving was ""too small to be useful"" in saving energy or reducing pollution or greenhouse gas emissions.25



To the extent that there is any link at all between density and environmental issues, there are far better ways to save energy and reduce emissions that cost less and do not require people to make major changes in lifestyles. For example, single-family ""zero-energy"" homes can be built for $125 per square foot, whereas high-rise housing typically costs well over $150 per square foot.26 Similarly, cars can be made more energy efficient than they are today by substituting aluminum for steel, diesel engines for gasoline, and streamlining for boxy styles, all at a far lower cost than trying to shift people out of their cars and onto expensive transit systems.27





  
The third major justification for growth management is that it reduces the costs of infrastructure and urban services. A city that is twice as dense as another doesn't need as many miles of streets, water and sewer pipes, and other infrastructure lines. This seems so obvious that urban planners rarely bother to test it.



As it turns out, it isn't necessarily true that denser cities have lower infrastructure costs, or if it is, that reduction is small. A study by Duke University researcher Helen Ladd compared urban service costs with population densities. As urban planners would predict, Ladd found that urban service costs declined as densities increased up to a density of 200 people per square mile. However, at higher densities, urban service costs increased with increasing densities.28 For reference, the Census Bureau defines densities greater than 1,000 people per square mile as urban and densities below that as rural, meaning that any urban density growth management could actually lead to higher urban service costs.



In 2004, Ladd's work was updated by demographer Wendell Cox and economist Joshua Utt. They found that higher municipal densities were associated with slightly lower municipal costs per capita. Specifically, ""each 1,000 increase in population per square mile is associated with a $43 per capita reduction in municipal expenditures."" In other words, ""a virtually unprecedented increase in population density in an already urbanized area would trigger a decrease in expenditure equal to the price of dinner for two at a moderately priced restaurant.""29



A study by urban planners at Rutgers University compared the costs of urban services for greenfield developments of different densities. The study concluded that higher density developments save about $11,000 per home.30 Much, if not most, of this cost is paid by residents, so it is their choice whether to pay a little higher cost or live in higher densities. As will be shown in the next section, a cost of sprawl equal to $11,000 per home is a pittance compared with the cost of growth management.



The problem with the Rutgers costs-of-sprawl study is that, in most cases, the choice offered by growth-management planners is not to build greenfield developments at lower or higher densities but whether to build greenfield developments or to redevelop existing neighborhoods at higher densities. Portland, Oregon, for example, is attempting to meet nearly all future housing needs by such redevelopment. Yet it may cost much more to install infrastructure capable of supporting higher densities into existing areas than to develop greenfields. As urban researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed, ""the cost of creating an additional unit of sewage or water-carrying capacity may be much higher than the unit cost of existing capacity if the old sewage or water lines must be dug up and replaced with larger ones.""31



Rather than attempt to control urban service costs by managing growth, municipal governments should work to ensure that people pay the costs of the services they use. Then people will be able to choose the densities they prefer to live in with a full understanding of the costs of their choices.





  
Compared with the small and sometimes imaginary costs of sprawl, the costs of growth management are huge and reverberate throughout the entire economy. These costs include increases in land, housing, and other real estate prices; increased real estate volatility; a resulting reduction in economic productivity; growing wealth inequality; and increased unemployment.





  
The most visible effect of growth management is a dramatic increase in housing prices and concurrent decline in housing affordability. Table 1 compares housing costs and affordability in 14 cities with growth management and 14 cities without growth management.



The first column of numbers shows the average price of a 2,200-square foot, four-bedroom, two-bath home in 2015 as calculated by the Coldwell-Banker home listing report.32 The second column shows the median price of a home as calculated by the 2014 American Community Survey (which means it is the median price in 2013).33 The third column is a standard measure of housing affordability: the value-to-income ratio — that is, the median home value divided by median family income in that city in 2013.34 Finally, the last column shows the population growth of the urban area in which the city is located for the years 2000 through 2010.35



The 2,200-square-foot home price and median home price in most of the areas with growth management are both more than $400,000, while a similar 2,200-square-foot home costs between $200,000 and $300,000 and median prices are between $100,000 and $200,000 in most places without growth management. The few growth-managed cities with apparently low housing prices, such as Hartford and Providence, still have value-to-income ratios that are more than 4.0, while most cities without growth management have value-to-income ratios of 3.0 or less.



The more-affordable cities are not affordable because they are less desirable places to live. In fact, the growth column shows that most urban areas without growth management are growing much faster than most urban areas with it. Of course, affordable housing is a major reason why they are growing faster.



The cities listed in Table 1 are not exceptional. Table 2 shows that the states with the least-affordable housing tend to be those with a state growth-management act (shown in bold); states whose major cities are hemmed in by other states with growth management (for example, Washington, D.C., and New York City); or states whose major cities practice growth management without a state law (for example, Colorado, Montana, and Utah). Of states with growth-management laws, Maine is the most affordable, but at a value-to-income ratio of 2.82 it is still less affordable than the national average of 2.75.

Housing is not the only real estate that is made less affordable by growth management. Industrial, commercial, retail, and other real estate also become more expensive. However, the best data we have are for housing, so housing should be read as a proxy for all real estate.



Urban planners often deny that growth management makes housing less affordable.36 They seem to think that the laws of supply and demand don't apply to residential land, so they can constrain the amount of land available for housing without making it expensive. But numerous studies by economists have reached the opposite conclusions. A few of these studies include:



University of Washington economist Theo Eicher compared a database of land-use regulations with housing prices and found that high housing prices are ""associated with cost-increasing land-use regulations (approval delays) and statewide growth management.""37



University of North Carolina real-estate economists Donald Jud and Daniel Winkler found that rapid growth in housing prices is strongly ""correlated with restrictive growth management policies and limitations on land availability.""38



""Government regulation is responsible for high housing costs,"" say Harvard economist Edward Glaeser and Wharton economist Joseph Gyourko.39



Canadian real-estate analysts Tsuriel Somerville and Christopher Mayer found that ""Metropolitan areas with more extensive regulation can have up to 45 percent fewer [housing] starts and price elasticities that are more than 20 percent lower than those in less-regulated markets.""40



Federal Reserve economist Raven Malloy found that ""in places with relatively few barriers to construction, an increase in housing demand leads to a large number of new housing units and only a moderate increase in housing prices,"" while ""places with more regulation experience a 17 percent smaller expansion of the housing stock and almost double the increase in housing prices.""41



Research by economists Henry Pollakowsi and Susan Wachter concluded that ""land-use regulations raise housing and developed land prices.""42



Three economists from the University of California-Berkeley found that ""regulatory stringency is consistently associated with higher costs for construction, longer delays in completing projects, and greater uncertainty about the elapsed time to completion of residential developments.""43





  
Another predictable result of limiting the supply of land for housing is increased volatility. ""Restricting housing supply leads to greater volatility in housing prices,"" warns Glaeser.44 In economic terms, growth management reduces the elasticity of the supply of land and housing. Supply price elasticity measures the response of supply to a change in demand; a low elasticity means the supply doesn't respond as much, so small increases in demand can lead to large increases in price while small decreases in demand can lead to large decreases in price.



This is mentioned by Somerville and Mayer in their work and confirmed by other economists as well. ""More restrictive residential land use regulations and geographic land constraints are linked to larger booms and busts in housing prices,"" say economists Haifang Huang and Yao Tang. Their comparison of land-use regulations and housing prices in more than 300 cities in the United States found that, ""the natural and man-made constraints also amplify price responses to an initial positive mortgage-credit supply shock, leading to greater price increases in the boom and subsequently bigger losses.""45



Table 3 shows the volatility of value-to-income ratios by state for the years 1999 through 2013. Volatility is shown for value-to-income ratios rather than actual prices because prices partly reflect incomes and using value-to-income ratios accounts for changes in incomes over this time period. The first column of numbers shows the lowest value-to-income ratio during these years, the second shows the highest, while the third shows the value-to-income ratio in 2013. The last column shows the standard deviation of value-to-income ratios over this 15-year period as a measure of volatility.



 **Table 3. Volatility of State Value-to-Income Ratios, 1999-2013**  




Source: Calculated from American Community Survey census data, tables P077 and H076 for 2000 through 2004 and tables B19113 and B25077 for 2005 through 2014. Census data present incomes and home values for the year before the survey was taken, so data from the 2014 American Community Survey is for 2013.



Note: The table includes the lowest and highest value-to-income ratios between 1999 and 2013, along with the 2013 value-to-income ratio and volatility, as represented by the standard deviation, over this time period.



Not surprisingly, the states with the strictest land-use laws, such as California and Hawaii, have the highest value-to-income ratios and volatilities. Volatilities are also high in the District of Columbia because of growth-management planning in counties surrounding D.C., just as they are high in New York City because of growth restrictions in the Connecticut and New Jersey counties that border the city. From California to Delaware, most of the 14 states with the most volatile housing prices have either state growth-management laws, strong local growth-management plans, or (in the case of Nevada and, to a lesser degree, Arizona) have urban growth limited by large amounts of state and federal land.



At the bottom end of the volatility scale are 18 states — South Carolina through Mississippi — that have minimal statewide planning laws and minimally restrictive local zoning codes. As noted above, most cities in these states use zoning as a way to protect existing development from unwanted intrusions, but they readily change the zoning of undeveloped lands to meet developer expectations of market demand. Not only does housing in these states have low volatility, but value-to-income ratios never reached 3.0.



In the middle are 18 states, from Idaho to New Mexico, with moderate volatilities and median housing values that sometimes exceeded three times median family incomes. In a few cases, such as Michigan and Wyoming, prices were volatile because of major changes in local industry (autos in Michigan, oil in Wyoming). A few other states, including Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont, have statewide planning laws that may not be quite as restrictive as the first 14 states on the list. But most of these states have one or more major urban areas that use some form of growth-management planning without a state mandate. Denver's urban-growth boundary has already been mentioned; in Minnesota, the Twin Cities has an urban-service boundary; and several cities in Montana, including Kalispell, Missoula, and Bozeman, have worked with counties to restrict growth.



The increased volatility in housing prices that results from land-use restrictions greatly increases the risk in purchasing a home and is harmful in many other ways. Such volatility ""transfers asset values between groups; creates financial instability. . . ; makes monetary policy more difficult . . . [and] create[s] oscillating wealth effects feeding through to consumption spending,"" say economists from the London School of Economics.46



Housing prices in growth-managed areas can undergo huge swings that are often called bubbles. The British housing market has experienced three bubbles since passage of the Town & Country Planning Act, peaking in 1973, 1989, and 2006.47 California's housing prices bubbled and peaked in 1981, 1990, and 2006. Oregon's peaked in 1979 and 2006, while Massachusetts's peaked in 1987 and 2006. Prices in growth-managed states are climbing rapidly today and in some regions, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, they have already exceeded the 2006 peak, suggesting that another crash is inevitable.



Notice that, prior to 2006, bubbles in local housing markets tended to offset one another, minimizing the effect on the nationwide housing market. This misled housing analysts in the early 2000s to believe that the bubbles that were then forming would not have major repercussions on the nation's economy. Notably, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch bond-rating companies gave many mortgage bonds AAA ratings because they did not imagine prices falling in so many markets at once. Banks that purchased such bonds were legally required to have a cash reserve equal to a fraction of the bond value that depended on the bond's rating, with AAA bonds requiring reserves as little as 1.6 percent of a bond's face value.



In 2007, ratings firms realized their mistake and began downgrading the bonds, sometimes reducing AAA mortgage bonds to lower than BBB ratings — that is, junk bonds. This increased the reserve requirements from 1.6 percent of the mortgage bond's value to as much as 8 percent, which in turn forced banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers to come up with hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars in cash overnight to meet the increased reserve requirement. Their inability to do so is what precipitated the 2008 financial crash.48



While more bubbles may be on the horizon, the banks and bond ratings agencies have presumably learned their lesson and such a crash won't happen again in this way. Still, it is fair to say that the 2008 crash can ultimately be traced to the volatility caused by growth-management planning, as without that volatility there would have been no bubbles and no need to downgrade mortgage bonds.





  
High housing and real estate prices depress growth rates for two reasons. First, residents and investors are forced to put a higher share of their incomes into real estate, leaving less money to save or invest in more productive assets. Second, businesses are likely to move their operations to places with more affordable real estate.



The latter effect can be seen by comparing California and Texas. These are the nation's first- and second-most populous states and the third- and second-largest states by land area. Both are located in the Sun Belt, and both are attractive to a wide range of industries, businesses, and people. But California's land-use regulation has made it second only to Hawaii as the nation's least-affordable housing market since the 1970s.



As a result, since 1990, Texas's economic growth, measured in gross state product, has been 35 percent faster than California's.49 Since housing prices are a part of a state's gross state product, California's high housing prices mask some of the problems with the state's economy. This is shown by Texas's annual population growth, which has been 75 percent faster than California's in the same time period.



While Texas benefits from California's loss, the effects of high real estate prices on the national economy are not a zero-sum game. They are a negative-sum game, with real estate prices dragging down the economy in growth-managed regions more than other regions benefit. A paper by University of California-Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti and University of Chicago economist Chang-Tai Hsieh found that relieving land-use restrictions in productive cities such as New York and San Jose would increase the gross domestic product of the United States as a whole by 9.5 percent.50 With a 2015 gross domestic product of $17.9 trillion, this represents an annual economic loss of $1.7 trillion.51





  
High and volatile housing prices can reduce labor mobility and increase unemployment rates by making it costly for people to move. In relatively unregulated housing markets, renters tend to have higher unemployment rates than homeowners. But Britain's land-use regulation has turned this upside down, as homeowners are more likely to have higher unemployment rates.52 With real estate fees equal to a percentage of sale price, the cost of selling homes is a much higher share of people's incomes: for example, if a family whose income is $50,000 sells a $100,000 home, a 5 percent realtor fee is 10 percent of their annual income. But if they sell a $500,000 home, a 5 percent fee is half their income. Add this to the higher down payment required for the more expensive home and the cost of moving can become prohibitive. Moreover, during economic downturns, homeowners in volatile housing markets are much more likely to owe more on a home than the house is currently worth. All of these things make it costly to move between or out of growth-managed areas.





  
Income inequality has become a major issue in the United States and there is some reason for it, as the Gini index — which is used to measure income inequality — has grown since bottoming out in 1968.53 According to Thomas Piketty in his book, _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ , income inequality is growing because returns on capital are greater than the rate of economic growth. But a refinement of Piketty's work by MIT researcher Matthew Rognlie reveals that housing is the main source of growing inequality.



Looking closely at Piketty's and other data, Rognlie found that ""a single component of the capital stock — housing — accounts for nearly 100 percent of the long-term increase in the capital/income ratio, and more than 100 percent of the long-term increase in the net capital share of income.""54 In other words, were it not for housing, inequality would not be growing. Moreover, the reason why housing capital stock is growing is that urban areas in most developed nations, including nearly every country in Europe, Australia, and many states, provinces, and major urban areas in the United States and Canada, have adopted policies intended to limit urban sprawl.



It may be no coincidence that American inequality reached its lowest level in 1968, before urban areas outside of Hawaii adopted growth-management plans.55 American homeownership rates grew rapidly between 1940 and 1970, after which they leveled off. California and Oregon adopted growth-management planning in the early 1970s, leading homeownership rates in those cities to decline after that time. Today, homeownership nationwide stands at 63.5 percent.56 But homeownership rates in some states without growth-management planning are nearly 75 percent.57



The effect of growth management on homeownership is parallel to its effect on inequality. Harvard economists Peter Ganong and Daniel Shoag have shown that income inequality is growing in states where land-use restrictions have increased housing prices, while it continues to shrink (as it did before 1968) in states where there are few such restrictions. They conclude that ""housing prices and building restrictions"" played a ""central role"" in the growth of inequality since 1968.58





  
Low-income families are the hardest hit by growth management. Some urban areas have seen an outward migration of low- and, in a few cases, middle-income families because of high housing prices. As Glaeser writes, high housing prices will make a city ""less diverse and instead evolve into a boutique city catering only to a small, highly educated elite.""59 In other cases, low-income families have suffered a loss in housing quality, with declining homeownership rates and increasing shares living in multifamily housing.



African Americans are a useful bellwether, as their per capita incomes remain at about 60 percent of those of non-Hispanic Whites. Nationally, the number of African Americans grew by 11.0 percent between 2000 and 2010, while the overall population grew by 9.7 percent. But, as shown in Table 4, in many urban areas with growth management, the absolute number of Blacks fell or, at least, grew much more slowly than the overall population.



Among the nation's 100 largest urbanized areas, the one with the greatest disparity between overall population growth and African American population growth was San Francisco-Oakland. Between 2000 and 2010, the overall population of this area grew by 9.5 percent, or 285,000 people, but the African American population shrank by 14.2 percent, or more than 48,000 people. Another region with a huge disparity is Los Angeles, whose urbanized area population grew by 3.1 percent, or more than 360,000 people, while the Black population declined by 11.4 percent, or nearly 106,000 people.



Other urban areas in which the overall population grew while the African American population declined include New York, Chicago, San Diego, San Jose, Tucson, and Honolulu. Two things most of these urban areas have in common are unaffordable housing and urban-growth boundaries or other land-use regulations restricting outward growth. By comparison, fast-growing regions that have minimal land-use restrictions, such as Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, and Houston, saw Black populations growing as fast, or faster, than overall populations.



In some urban areas with growth management, the number of African Americans did not decline, but the quality of housing they lived in did. In the Denver-Aurora urban area, for example, the share of families with White heads of households living in single-family housing declined slightly from 69.1 percent in 2000 to 67.8 percent in 2010. But the share of families with African American heads of households living in single-family housing dropped much more, from 54.0 to 46.4 percent.60 Housing prices also affected tenure in the Denver-Aurora urbanized area: between 2000 and 2010, the share of Whites living in their own homes fell by 3.6 percent, but the share of African Americans (which was already well below the White share) fell by 11.9 percent.61



A 2015 Supreme Court decision held that any government policy that makes housing more expensive may potentially violate the Fair Housing Act. Even if a policy is not intentionally designed to discriminate against African Americans or other low-income minorities, if it has the effect of harming those minorities, then it is equally in violation of the law unless the policy can be ""justified by a legitimate rationale."" This is known as the _disparate impact_ doctrine.62



 **Table 4. Change in Overall and African American Populations for Selected Urban Areas, 2000-2010**  




According to disparate-impact regulations published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in February 2013, conduct forbidden by the Fair Housing Act under this doctrine includes ""enacting or implementing land-use rules, ordinances, policies, or procedures that restrict or deny housing opportunities or otherwise make unavailable or deny dwellings to persons because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.""63 Numerous land-use rules, ordinances, and policies increase housing costs. Since some protected minorities, such as African Americans, are more likely to have lower-than-average incomes, any such rules or policies reduce their housing opportunities and therefore potentially violate the Fair Housing Act.



The HUD rules use two tests to determine whether a policy has a ""legitimate rationale."" First, the legislative body or agency adopting the policy must show that it is ""necessary to achieve one or more of its substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests."" Second is whether that interest ""could be served by a practice that has a less discriminatory effect.""64



For example, requiring that homes in urban areas be hooked up to sewage systems makes the houses a little more expensive but can be justified as a legitimate rationale based on public health concerns. However, saving farm land or open space is probably not a legitimate interest since the United States has an abundance of such land. Saving energy or reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be a legitimate interest, but there are other practices that can achieve these goals better and that do not have a discriminatory effect on low-income minorities. Thus, the disparate impact doctrine provides one more reason why states should repeal growth-management laws and regional and local governments should revoke growth-management plans.





  
Cities with serious housing affordability problems typically respond in one or both of two ways. First, many encourage developers to build denser housing, a policy that is informally known as _build up_ , _not out_ and more formally known as _smart growth_.65 Second, they either subsidize or require that developers subsidize some housing for low-income buyers or renters, a policy known as _affordable_ housing because it lowers the cost of a relatively few housing units, as distinct from _housing affordability_ , which refers to the general level of housing prices relative to incomes.



The smart-growth strategy has been explicitly used in the Portland urban area at least since 1993. The region has focused on building higher-density housing since a law was passed that year that allowed Metro, Portland's regional planning agency, to meet housing demand by directing local governments to rezone existing neighborhoods to higher densities. Partly as a result of this strategy, the population density of urbanized land in and around Portland has grown by 17 percent since 1990.



Until recently, the San Francisco Bay Area did not have a regional government powerful enough to force a smart-growth policy on cities in the region. Some cities actually adopted strict growth policies that, for example, forbade the construction of more than a few homes without a vote of the people. Despite this, the region's population density increased even more than Portland's, gaining 32 percent from 1980 to 2010 and 27 percent from 1990 to 2010.66 Similarly, the density of the Los Angeles urbanized area grew by 28 percent between 1980 and 2010, while the Honolulu urbanized area grew by 9 percent and Seattle-Everett grew by 6 percent in the same time period.67



These density increases, however, did not keep housing affordable. Between 1979 and 2009 the median value of homes relative to median family incomes grew by 37 percent in Portland, 76 percent in the San Francisco-Oakland area, 70 percent in Los Angeles, 19 percent in Honolulu, and 40 percent in Seattle-Everett.68



In 2008, the California legislature passed SB 375, which directed regional governments such as the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) to write plans to increase population densities of cities in the region. The dual purpose of this increase was to reduce greenhouse gases and make housing more affordable. The MTC dutifully responded by writing Plan Bay Area. The plan calls for no expansion of urban-growth boundaries despite a projected 28 percent increase in population by the year 2040 and proposes to house this increase by targeting more than a quarter of the developed land in the region for redevelopment at higher densities. Yet the plan admits that this will fail to make housing more affordable, as the share of incomes that people are projected to spend on housing increases.69



There are at least three reasons why rebuilding existing neighborhoods to higher densities will fail to make housing more affordable. First, construction of multifamily housing costs more per square foot than single-family housing. A study in Portland found that a multifamily dwelling typically costs 23 percent more per square foot than a single-family one. The study also found that high-rise housing costs per square foot were more than double the cost of two-story single-family construction.70



Second, land costs in areas designated for high-density housing are often very high. While an acre of land suitable for single-family homes at the urban fringe might cost around $20,000, or $2,500 to $5,000 per developable lot, an acre of urban land designated for redevelopment to higher densities may cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Even if 50 units of housing are built on a single acre, the land cost per housing unit can be much more than for low-density greenfield developments.



Third, the cost of installing infrastructure in areas of existing development to support higher-density development is likely to be much higher than the cost of infrastructure in greenfield development. As noted above, so-called ""cost of sprawl"" studies compared the infrastructure costs of low-density greenfield development with high-density greenfield development, but not with high-density brownfield development. For all these reasons, high-density housing ends up being more affordable than low-density housing only if residents are willing to accept much smaller quarters in the high-density housing.



Census data confirm that higher densities are associated with less affordable housing. The 2010 Census reported population densities, median home values, and median family incomes for 382 urban areas and 558 cities. For urban areas, the correlation between affordability (measured by value-to-income ratios) and density is strong (correlation coefficient is 0.53), with a 1,000-person-per-square-mile increase in density being associated with an increase in value-to-income ratios of 0.64 (see Figure 1). For cities, the correlation is even stronger (correlation coefficient is 0.61), with the same population density increase being associated with an increase in value-to-income ratios of 0.27.71



 **Figure 1. Density and Housing Affordability**  




Though density itself is not the sole direct cause of reduced housing affordability, the data show that factors associated with higher densities also tend to reduce affordability. Thus, the smart-growth strategy of building up, not out, will inevitably fail to maintain housing affordability.



The second local response to housing affordability problems is to subsidize the construction of selected units of housing and offer them to low-income buyers or renters at less-than-market prices — that is, the ""affordable housing"" policies mentioned above. Usually, sales of below-cost housing come with restrictions that buyers can only resell to other low-income people and only at the price they paid for it plus inflation. In effect, it turns owners of affordable homes into feudal peasants, allowed to sell their home only to people approved by the government at prices set by the government.



The bigger problem with affordable housing is that it confuses the problem of housing low-income people with the more general problem of housing affordability for everyone. Affordable housing programs such as subsidized housing and inclusionary zoning are aimed at providing a few units of housing for low-income people who might otherwise be homeless or be forced to live in housing that doesn't meet some basic standards. These measures are completely ineffective against general housing affordability problems.



For example, median homes in Houston cost a little more than twice median family incomes, making it a fairly affordable region. Yet there still may be some people in Houston whose incomes are so low that they cannot afford decent housing. Affordable housing programs are aimed to help those people, and whether those programs work or are worthwhile is beyond the scope of this study.



In contrast, median homes in San Francisco cost more than _eight_ times median family incomes, making it unaffordable to all but the wealthiest — and even they have to accept smaller or lower-quality homes than they might live in elsewhere. Affordable housing programs may help house a relative handful of people, but will not improve the overall level of affordability. While the government could theoretically swamp the market with affordable homes and thereby bring down the general price level, in reality the government doesn't have the resources to build more than a tiny percentage of the homes being built in a region, so the effect of those affordable homes on the general price level is negligible.



Worse, some affordable housing policies actually make the remaining housing even less affordable. Some cities require homebuilders to sell or rent 15 to 25 percent of the homes they build to low-income families at below-market prices, a policy known as inclusionary zoning. Homebuilders respond by building fewer units of housing and by selling or renting the market-rate homes for higher prices to make up for their losses on the affordable homes. The result is that most renters and homebuyers end up paying more so that a relative handful can have affordable homes.72



Other cities charge homebuilders a fee for every home they build and dedicate the revenues to the construction of affordable housing. For example, Portland recently imposed a 1 percent tax on the value of new homes. The funds raised by this tax over the next 30 years will be used to repay bonds needed to build 1,300 affordable homes.73 Of course, the tax will raise the price of all housing in the city by 1 percent, while 1,300 new homes in a city that has more than 270,000 homes is not going to have a measurable impact on overall affordability.74 Since anything that makes new homes more expensive also leads existing homeowners to increase the price of their homes when they sell them, overall housing affordability will decline.



Policies aimed at providing affordable housing for low-income people are not designed to deal with overall housing affordability. Affordable housing is a Band-Aid solution when the real solution is to end the policies that made housing unaffordable in the first place.





  
Many fair-housing advocates blame housing affordability problems on _exclusionary zoning_ , a form of zoning that, they say, is intended to make housing expensive so as to keep lower classes out of zoned neighborhoods, particularly in the suburbs. Without exclusionary zoning, they say, developers would respond to high-priced housing markets such as that in San Francisco by rebuilding existing neighborhoods to higher densities. These advocates usually ignore the role of urban-growth boundaries and other containment measures in local and regional housing markets. For example, a 30-page review of exclusionary zoning literature by legal scholar John Mangin never once mentions urban-growth boundaries.75



When zoning was first developed in the early 20th century, some southern cities explicitly included racial requirements in their zoning codes. For example, Louisville's first zoning code prohibited the sale of homes in some neighborhoods to African Americans. The Supreme Court ruled this unconstitutional in 1917.76 Suburban communities then supposedly responded by writing their zoning codes to effectively require that homes be expensive, thus making housing unaffordable to low-income families.



The problem with this analysis is that zoning by itself does not make housing expensive or unaffordable. As Mangin notes, the basic cost of a home is ""the cost of land plus construction costs and normal profit.""77 As the Supreme Court noted in a 1926 decision, the purpose of zoning is to ensure that unwanted nuisances are not allowed to intrude into a neighborhood that would bring housing prices below this basic cost.78 So long as there is competition for new home construction, zoning alone cannot raise the price of housing much above this basic cost. Amenities such as parks, good schools, and low crime rates may make particular neighborhoods more desirable, but these aren't particularly influenced by zoning, and even if they were, better schools and less crime would have to be considered legitimate rationales for such policies.



It is only when competition for new home construction is limited — almost always by government regulation — that housing becomes more expensive than the basic cost of land plus construction. The smallest states have plenty of vacant land that can be used for home construction to maintain housing affordability. For example, New Jersey is the nation's most heavily developed state, yet — as previously noted — 60 percent of the state remained undeveloped rural land as of 2012. Even the island of Oahu, Hawaii's most crowded island, is 64 percent rural.79 Without government restrictions on the use of such land, zoning cannot make housing much more expensive than its basic cost.



Zoning restrictions in some cities and suburbs may lead to income stratification in those communities. For example, some neighborhoods might be zoned for minimum lot sizes of one acre; other neighborhoods for one-half acre, one-quarter acre, or one-eighth of an acre. Some smaller incorporated suburbs may even zone all residential land in that suburb for larger lots, thus keeping out people who cannot afford that minimum lot size. In this sense, exclusionary zoning is real. Based on the disparate impact doctrine, it is potentially a violation of the Fair Housing Act if the city cannot find adequate justification for such zoning.



Some housing experts have recommended the use of regional governments to prevent this type of exclusionary zoning from taking place. For example, Glaeser suggests that ""a more regional approach to housing supply might reduce the tendency of many localities to block new construction.""80 However, an actual review of regional efforts to influence housing supply, such as those in Portland, Denver, and other urban areas that practice growth management, reveals that they do not produce this outcome; instead the political forces to limit housing supply overwhelm those aimed at promoting housing affordability.



For example, Oregon's land-use planning system has set a goal of having ""adequate numbers of needed housing units at price ranges and rent levels which are commensurate with the financial capabilities of Oregon households."" To meet this goal, all incorporated cities of 2,500 people or more have a full range of housing, including single-family and multifamily housing.81 Metro, the regional planning agency for Portland and 23 of its suburbs, interpreted this to mean that half of all new home construction in every city in the region must be multifamily housing, even though two-thirds of the region's existing homes, and nearly all homes in some suburbs, are single-family housing.82



This has put pressure on suburbs that are currently mostly single-family homes. When a multifamily subdivision in the suburb of Happy Valley failed, the landowners asked for a zoning change to allow single-family construction. Fair housing advocates charged that this violates Metro's policy of requiring more compact development.83



Yet there is no evidence that more multifamily housing would make the Portland area more affordable. As previously noted, multifamily housing costs more, per square foot, than single-family housing, so it is only more affordable if residents are willing to accept smaller homes.



Similarly, HUD has adopted regulations called ""affirmatively furthering fair housing."" These rules require all governments that accept federal housing funds to assess whether they have a balance of incomes and races in their communities and, if not, to take steps to improve that balance.84 In what many people see as a pioneering implementation of this rule, HUD ordered Westchester County, New York, to provide more low-income housing, mostly in the form of multifamily housing.85



At heart, concerns over exclusionary zoning, and HUD's response in the form of affirmatively furthering fair housing, have to do with racial segregation, not housing affordability. While stratification of neighborhoods by income may be a factor in racial segregation, forcing individual suburbs to build higher density housing is not likely to solve this problem. First, as noted, multifamily housing actually costs more per square foot than single-family. Second, without violating the Fair Housing Act, there is no way to ensure that people occupying supposedly affordable homes are racial minorities. Finally, HUD has a peculiar definition of ""fair"" if it thinks that minorities living in cramped apartments with little privacy is fair so long as those apartments are in the same suburbs as Whites who live in spacious single-family homes.



According to census data, residential segregation is declining throughout the nation.86 As demographer William Frey says, as of the 2010 census, ""minorities represent 35 percent of suburban residents, similar to their share of the overall U.S. population"" and ""more than half of all minority groups in large metro areas, including African Americans, now reside in the suburbs.""87



However, segregation is declining in different communities for different reasons. In San Francisco, it is declining because housing prices have risen so high that many African Americans have been forced to leave the region entirely, leaving the region less segregated as Whites have replaced African Americans in neighborhoods that were formerly mostly Black. In Portland, it is declining because Whites are gentrifying traditional Black neighborhoods of rented single-family homes, forcing African Americans to move into multifamily housing in other parts of the region and making them more vulnerable to crime.88 In Houston, segregation is declining because the region is rapidly growing, African American numbers are growing faster than Whites, and these African Americans are moving into neighborhoods throughout the region.



Evidence indicates that rapid population growth helps reduce segregation.89 Policies that hinder that growth can severely harm minorities, as in the cases of San Francisco, where Black populations are shrinking, and Portland and Denver, where African Americans are forced into lower-quality housing.



The boundaries of incorporated suburbs tend to be based on historic factors that have far more to do with tax policies than racial politics. Many, if not most, suburbs incorporated to avoid being annexed and taxed by some nearby city. Because most suburbs represent only a small fraction of their urban area, they cannot be expected to all have a perfect balance of incomes and races. Rather than focus on the impossible goal of achieving such a perfect balance in each suburb, fair housing advocates should oppose the growth-management policies that make housing unaffordable in the first place.





  
The key to housing affordability is an unlimited supply of vacant land available for development at the urban fringe. ""Unlimited"" doesn't mean ""infinite"": it simply means that land isn't limited by physical or legal limits on land development. A city on an island may have a physical limit to land development, but few American cities are on an island and those that are, such as Honolulu, still have plenty of undeveloped land available.



To restore housing affordability, reduce home price volatility, and remove barriers to local economic growth, states must repeal growth-management laws and take steps to forbid city and regional governments from practicing growth management or other regulations that limit the amount of vacant land available for development. This should be one of the highest legislative priorities in California, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington, as well as in several New England states.



Florida partly repealed its growth-management law in 2011, but this appears to have failed to make housing more affordable because local governments kept their own stringent growth-control measures. The Florida story illustrates the need for serious, broad-reaching repeal of government growth management powers.



The state's 1985 law required local governments to develop comprehensive plans aimed at preventing urban sprawl. Each plan had to be submitted to a state Department of Community Affairs for approval, and rejected plans had to be rewritten.



As early as 2001, Florida researchers found that ""adoption of growth management regulations significantly raised home prices"" and that growth management in general ""reduces housing affordability for middle-class households.""90 A more rapid decline in Florida housing affordability came after 1999: between 1999 and 2005, nominal median family incomes grew by 20 percent but median home values grew by 146 percent. This meant that housing costs, relative to family incomes, more than doubled.91



Alarmed about the effect of the law on housing prices, in 2011 the Florida legislature repealed the requirement that plans be approved by the Department of Community Affairs. However, local municipalities were still allowed to restrict development, and most continued to do so. Housing became far more affordable after the economic downturn, but after bottoming out in 2012, inflation-adjusted prices rose by more than 30 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014. This is in line with other growth-managed states — California prices rose 36 percent; Oregon's 28 percent — which reduced housing affordability since 2011 as incomes did not keep pace with housing prices.92



It is too early to tell for certain how the partial repeal of Florida's growth-management law will affect housing affordability, but it appears that the effect will be minimal because cities and counties are maintaining their restrictions on greenfield development. Thus, more comprehensive reforms are needed to truly make housing affordable in growth-managed states and urban areas.



A more thorough reform would be for states to emulate Texas by restricting counties' ability to zone or regulate land. Cities would still be free to zone to protect neighborhoods from nuisances, but the Dallas-Ft. Worth urban area shows that zoning alone isn't a barrier to housing affordability. Cities in the Dallas-Ft. Worth urban area are zoned, yet the region's population is growing nearly as fast as Houston's, even though Houston and its largest suburb have no zoning. Dallas-Ft. Worth grew by 60 percent between 1990 and 2010, compared with Houston's 70 percent, and the former remains just about as affordable, with a 2014 value-to-income ratio of 2.3, versus 2.2 in Houston.



An even more thorough reform, and one that could satisfy opponents of exclusionary zoning, would be for states to eliminate zoning altogether. If the purpose of zoning is to protect residential neighborhoods from the traffic, noise, pollution, and other problems that would result from intrusions of commercial, industrial, and higher-density residential uses, then that purpose is met in Houston (as well as on unincorporated lands in Texas) through the use of protective covenants.



About half of the neighborhoods in the city of Houston, and most in its suburbs, have such covenants. In most cases, covenants can be changed by a vote of 75 percent of a neighborhood's residents. Neighborhoods that don't have covenants can write them with the support of 75 percent of the residents. This system is flexible, affordable, and gives prospective residents a choice of neighborhoods that have a wide diversity of rules ranging from very strict to none at all.





  
Growth management takes away people's property rights in the name of controlling urban sprawl, which is in fact a non-problem. Growth management results in huge transfers of wealth from renters and future homebuyers to people who owned homes at the time the growth-management rules were put into effect. It unnecessarily adds trillions of dollars to housing and other real estate costs even as it slows the economy by trillions of dollars a year.



The effects of growth management are greatest on low-income families, including many African Americans and Latinos. Regions with the most stringent growth-management rules have seen Black populations decline or be forced into lower-quality housing. Intentionally or not, growth-management plans effectively discriminate against working-class and poor families, large numbers of whom are racial minorities.



For all these reasons, the 13 states with state growth-management laws must repeal those laws and replace them with laws preventing counties from restricting development. Other states whose urban areas have written growth-management plans without a state mandate should also reduce the authority of counties to regulate land uses. These actions are the key to restoring housing affordability, reducing real estate volatility, and improving indicators of income inequality.

(Barbara McCann and Reid Ewing, Measuring the Health Effects of Urban Sprawl (Washington: Smart Growth America, 2003), p. 1.) However, analyses by more objective researchers have found that, to the extent that there is a relationship between suburbs and obesity, it is because overweight people prefer to live in the suburbs, not that the suburbs made them overweight.

"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration defended on Sunday a reorganization of the National Security Council that elevates the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  —   a political adviser with no direct national security role  —   to full membership and downgrades the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The alteration was contained in a memorandum issued late Saturday defining the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, the top   bodies inside the White House on everything from diplomacy to counterterrorism to crisis management to nuclear and cyberpolicy. Mr. Trump’s document drew from organizational precedents in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. But the ascension of Mr. Bannon, who until last year was the head of Breitbart News, and the diminishment of the president’s top intelligence and military advisers took Democrats and Republicans by surprise. The new memo said that the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman would attend the “principals meetings”  —   the meeting of   officials  —   only when “issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. ” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Sunday that Mr. Bannon’s past service as a Navy officer merited his attendance at all meetings, as part of a “streamlining” of  . He did not explain the downgrading of the   general who heads the Joint Chiefs, Joseph F. Dunford Jr. who rose through the Marine Corps and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Well, he is a former naval officer,” Mr. Spicer said of Mr. Bannon on ABC’s “This Week. ” “He’s got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now. ” He added, “Having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings, who has a significant military background, to help make, guide what the president’s final analysis is going to be, is crucial. ” When pressed on General Dunford’s role, Mr. Spicer said, “The president gets plenty of information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ” Current and former military officials said they suspected that the decision, in part, was prompted by the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who retired as a   general after he was dismissed during the Obama administration as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was the previous director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who delivered the news to Mr. Flynn that he was being removed from his post. Throughout the transition, Mr. Flynn was reportedly hesitant to place many people around the National Security Council table who had outranked him in the military. Nonetheless, there are two in the cabinet: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who retired as a   general, and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, a retired   Marine Corps general who served for 45 years, ending his military career as the commander of United States Southern Command. Both men remain principals on the council. The C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, is not mentioned at all in the reorganization order. A week ago, Mr. Trump went to C. I. A. headquarters to assure officers there that he had their backs and valued their contributions. But Mr. Pompeo’s predecessor, John O. Brennan, was also not a formal member of the council, though he often attended meetings to provide intelligence assessments. Susan E. Rice, Mr. Flynn’s predecessor as national security adviser, denounced the downgrading of the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman. “This is stone cold crazy,” she wrote on Twitter. “Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK,” she said, using abbreviations for the Islamic State and North Korea. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, also appearing on ABC, questioned the wisdom of the move. John Bellinger, who was the counsel to the National Security Council during Mr. Bush’s administration, noted in a commentary on the Lawfare blog that Mr. Bannon’s role was highly unusual, because “the N. S. C. function usually does not include participants from the political side of the White House. ” He noted that Karl Rove, Mr. Bush’s top political strategist, did not attend council meetings. But in the early days of the Obama administration, David Axelrod, also a top political strategist, did attend many meetings resetting policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan  —   as a guest and an observer, but not as a full member of the council."
"The rich biodiversity of the UK’s far-flung overseas territories was highlighted recently by a Parliamentary report. Scattered throughout five oceans, these 14 islands account for much of the species biodiversity for which the UK is responsible: more than 500 threatened species, many of them unique to the islands, and undisturbed habitats of global importance. While the report revealed the mother country’s lack of support needed to safeguard their natural treasures, it also highlighted examples of conservation successes. One of these is on Ascension Island, whose Conservation Department have had great success restoring breeding seabirds to the island after it was overrun with cats. A small, remote, volcanic island in the South Atlantic, Ascension Island is rich in unique flora and fauna. At the time of its discovery in the 16th century, it hosted huge seabird colonies, among them the unique Ascension frigate (Fregata aquila). But when cats were deliberately introduced to the island in the early 19th century to control the accidentally introduced rats and mice, they also decimated the birds. For over a century seabirds, in particular the frigatebird, have been largely confined to breeding on Ascension’s tiny outlying islet, Boatswainbird Island, taking refuge there from the feral cat population roaming the mainland.  In 2002, the RSPB began a project to trap and kill feral cats from the island, while domestic cats were neutered to prevent the problem returning. By 2006, Ascension was declared feral cat-free. Starting with the masked boobies, seabirds began nesting on the mainland immediately, followed by brown boobies, brown noddies and both red-billed and yellow-billed tropicbirds. But it wasn’t until 2012 that the island’s most iconic seabird, the Ascension frigatebird  returned to the mainland, after 180 years away. The Ascension frigatebird, found nowhere else in the world, is considered Vulnerable on the IUCN’s threatened species’ Redlist. In fact it is one of 32 globally threatened birds found in the UK’s Overseas Territories. The large black seabirds, known as frigatebirds or pirate birds from their habit of stealing other bird’s food in flight, are also known for the males’ impressive red neck pouches, which during courtship are inflated to form a heart-shaped balloon. The discovery of the first two frigatebirds nesting on the mainland caused a lot of excitement. This season, the Ascension Island Government Conservation Department has carried out routine searches of Letterbox Peninsula, where the first nest was found, and a further 12 new nests have been discovered. Frigatebirds have truly made a return to Ascension. The islands’ seabird conservation scientist, Dr Eliza Leat, and fieldworker Kenickie Andrews led the surveys and made the first discovery close to the site of the nest in 2012. To minimise disturbing the birds, the nests are monitored by movement-triggered camera traps, which can provide valuable data on such aspects as how frequently each chick is fed, and how often they are left alone. These data will also help inform our current project to devise and implement the first national Biodiversity Action Plan for Ascension Island (BAP). This will identify current threats to species that are a conservation priority, and also important habitats such as the Green Mountain and shallow marine waters. This project is run by the island’s Conservation Department, but brings together independent scientists and specialists from the University of Exeter, Queen Mary University London, RSPB, Kew Gardens, and the Centre for Ecology to produce a strong plan that will protect the Island’s biodiversity. It’s marvellous that our frigatebirds appear to be recolonising the mainland, and 12 nests are more than we dared hope for. Funded by the British Foreign Office, Defra’s Darwin Initiative, the European Union and the RSPB, with help from New Zealand ecologists Wildlife Management International and the Army Ornithological Society, successes like this and others, such as a similar project to exterminate rats from South Georgia, demonstrate what is possible with sufficient resources and expertise. Hopefully this will raise the profile of the rare and wonderful species found within the overseas territories, the plight of some of their most fascinating species, and highlight the need for the money and manpower that will ensure they’re still there into the future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate alarmism and activism website Klimaretter here reports that beginning in January 2016 German power grid prices will go up 4%. The increase was calculated by taking the average of 29 large regional grid operators, the site writes.
In some German regions these costs will rise well into the double-digit range.
For a family of four with a modest annual consumption of 4000 kw-hr, that will mean extra costs of over 13 euros each year. Though that may not sound like much, these costs only represent the grid operating portion of the electricity costs and does not include the other costs such the increasing costs from renewable energy feed-in, conventional power production costs and so on, which are slated to jump once again – in large part due to the inefficient and volatile production of wind and solar power.
Green energy proponents often like to tell the public to stop complaining and to just accept the modest prices increases, mentioning that the costs of power have barely kept up with inflation over the past 20 years, and that power from the 1970s was just as expensive in real terms. But what the greens fail to mention is that the huge costs savings stemming from the massive gains in efficiencies from improved generation technology have not been allowed to be passed on to the consumers.
Many modern products have prices that do not follow inflation at all. One example is computing power. The costs of computing large quantities of data today are a tiny fraction of what they used to cost – thanks to technology leaps. Data crunching that once required room-sized supercomputers 30 years ago costing millions today can be done with a handheld device costing only a few hundred dollars. See the following chart:

“The progress of computing measured in cost per million standardized operations per second (MSOPS) deflated by the consumer price index.” (From  Nordhaus, 2001, p. 38). From: http://aiimpacts.org/trends-in-the-cost-of-computing/  
Though by no means that extreme, the cost of electricity generation also could have had a similar price development, thanks to technology, had it been allowed. Without all the taxes, surcharges and feed-in act tariffs, electric power today should in fact be only a fraction of the cost that it was 30 years ago, and poor families today would be much better off, and would not see their power being switched off because for them it has become an unaffordable luxury. Read here and here.
The reality today is that poor households are being massively and needlessly burdened.

Labour governments just love to ban things. Remember Helen Clark’s showerheads and lightbulbs? Some say it cost her the 2008 election, but she was on her way out anyway. Once Labour got back into power, however, it was back to the future. They just cannot help themselves in their determination to control everything we do, say, buy or eat.



So as you all know, in order to save the planet and the turtles, the government has already banned [‘single use’ plastic bags](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/the-insanity-of-the-plastic-bag-ban/). And now, we have a new raft of bans to come. Wait for it…



… plastic cutlery, fruit stickers and cotton buds.



Well, that will save the planet, won’t it?



The Government will move to ban non-compostible fruit stickers today in response to a huge new report about single-use plastic, _Stuff_ understands.



It’s understood the Government will also move to ban plastic cotton buds and single-use plastic cutlery, items which both have biodegradable alternatives made out of bamboo.



Compostible apple stickers do exist but are not in wide-use. 



Apple stickers are annoying, I grant you, but only because they are fiddly little devils that stick to anything and can often end up being eaten inadvertently, but amongst all the terrible evils that are rapidly destroying our planet and our way of life, apple stickers do not immediately spring to mind. As for plastic cutlery… well, I absolutely hate the things, but what are airlines going to do now? Oh yes, that’s right. They are going to use bamboo, which is another substance in [short supply ](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-11-11/chinas-giant-pandas-are-running-out-bamboo)nowadays. 



Do have a read of this [article,](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-11-11/chinas-giant-pandas-are-running-out-bamboo) from 2012 if you are unsure about that. You just know that the next poster boy for climate change, (now that [polar bears](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/susan-crockford-no-climate-emergency-for-polar-bears/) have reached unprecedented numbers), will be the giant panda.



The problem with fruit stickers is a simple one. They are not stuck onto apples for our benefit. They are put onto fruit for export. Rather than having the extra cost of running 2 lines of produce (one for local consumption and one for export), producers simply put the stickers on everything, but even if you are a fruitarian (?), your rubbish bin at the end of the week is not exactly full of the little stickers. They have usually, conveniently, stuck themselves to something else in the rubbish and are essentially invisible.



I do have a problem with plastic waste, but it is nothing to do with fruit stickers. It is this.



Now that we no longer send our plastic waste overseas, we have a delightful situation where many councils will no longer collect plastics, so they have to be thrown away.



New Zealanders are very innovative. We already have one entrepreneur using [recycled plastics to make fence posts ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/108474737/new-zealands-old-plastic-bags-will-be-made-in-to-fence-posts-for-farms)and various similar fledgeling industries are trying to get established. I would like to see the government encourage initiatives to recycle plastics, rather than simply ban things, or in the case of tip fees, simply increase taxes with the idea that it will force people to recycle.



The point is that I CAN’T RECYCLE THOSE PLASTICS. I have no choice but to throw them away, thanks to the blind ideology of this government.



So, instead of encouraging innovation, this government simply uses the big stick approach and either bans things, or charges excessively for the privilege of throwing stuff away when there really is no viable alternative.



But hey. Fruit stickers. How brilliant. We are about to save the world, one fruit sticker at a time. Magic.



And if the phrase ‘fiddling while Rome burns’ is floating around in your head, you are not alone.

"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • American divisions are rapidly widening over President Trump’s order to close the U. S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Implemented with little regard for basic governance, the measure drew support from Mr. Trump’s supporters but criticism from   protesters, Silicon Valley, some members of his own party, State Department diplomats and even former President Obama. Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the order. World leaders have objected to the order, but the leaders of U. S. allies are faced with either openly criticizing Mr. Trump or facing protests at home, like the one above in Scotland. _____ • Mr. Trump’s team was also on the defense over his startling reorganization of the National Security Council, a crucial adviser on major decisions. Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of the provocative website Breitbart, now has a full seat on the principals committee, while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were downgraded. Mr. Trump sought to shift the focus to his coming Supreme Court choice. _____ • Messages of solidarity poured into Canada after a mass shooting at a Quebec mosque that left six dead. The suspect in custody was identified as a      university student who, according to local press reports, had a history of provocative views and antisocial behavior. _____ • The top police official in the Philippines said the police would suspend participating in the nation’s bloody drug war while he purged rogue officers like those who strangled a South Korean businessman at Police Headquarters last year. “Ready yourselves, you bad cops,” the official, Ronald dela Rosa, said. “We no longer have a war on drugs, but we now have a war on scalawags. ” The order came hours after President Rodrigo Duterte rejected calls to fire Mr. dela Rosa, above right. Rights groups dismissed the move as a bid to deflect attention from police impunity. _____ • And Australian police are reviewing the deaths of 88 men between 1976 and 2000 to determine whether they should be classified as   hate crimes. The authorities now say gangs of teenagers hunted gay men for sport, sometimes forcing their victims off the cliffs that line Sydney Harbor. Above, a man whose brother fell to his death there in 1988. “We can now see that predators were attacking gay men,” said a former police minister. “And they were doing it with the   knowledge that the police would not have gone after them. That was the police culture of the day. ” • Nearly 400   stacks of Tesla batteries are helping California handle a projected energy shortage, demonstrating both the promise of the batteries as a substitute for conventional power plants and Tesla’s evolution into a multifaceted clean energy company. • Volkswagen overtook Toyota to become the world’s largest automaker. • Sony took a nearly $1 billion loss on its movie business, but said it remained committed to Sony Pictures Division. • The Bank of Japan will update its economic forecasts after President Trump’s election sent the yen into   and rewrote the outlook for Asia in 2017. • A competitor to the bike repair shop has emerged in the U. S.: mobile shops that make house calls. • Wall Street had its worst day of 2017, and the dollar slipped against the yen. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Tens of thousands of mourners gathered in Yangon for the funeral of Myanmar’s most prominent Muslim lawyer, U Ko Ni, who was assassinated on Sunday. [The New York Times] • Brazil watched on TV as a fugitive    tycoon, once the country’s richest man, surrendered to police over corruption accusations. [The New York Times] • The operator of the Fukushima nuclear complex said fuel debris may have been located under one of its reactors, a possible breakthrough in cleanup efforts.

"Despite the arguments that once raged and the considerable volumes written to advocate certain viewpoints and disparage others, interest in peak oil is at an all time low. Indeed some commentators have confidently declared that peak oil is dead and that the theory has turned out to be nonsense. But this attitude stems largely from the explosion of tight or shale oil production in the US. This oil, trapped in shale rock formations in the same way as shale gas, and similarly extracted by fracking, was almost unheard of just over five years ago. Yet recent projections suggest production of it could exceed 7m barrels per day by 2035. Despite this, some analysts maintain that tight oil has no bearing on peak oil, and others claim that it is a point we have already passed. So we are in the strange position where both sides of this debate claim victory. It’s worth noting that there is not a true dichotomy of opinions on peak oil. While many analysts’ positions lie somewhere in the centre of the spectrum spanning the extremes of the debate, the more nuanced opinions tend to get clouded or ignored in the ensuing shouting match (so often the case with energy policy). Why both sides feel they have been proven correct is down to their different interpretations of peak oil. The original interpretation, which dates back to the 1950s, was that global production of oil, a finite resource, would at some point rise to a maximum and subsequently decline. Analysts therefore focused on future projections and estimating the date by which the peak level would be reached. But future projections by both advocates of peak oil (so-called “pessimists”) and by those who dismiss the idea (“optimists”) have tended to be somewhat off the mark. There are various reasons for this, not least the uncertainties that significantly frustrate any effort at predicting the future. For example, assumptions on the effects of future CO2 mitigation policies, the growth in global population and GDP, how much oil can be economically recovered, and future oil field discoveries all have massive implications. So it’s very hard to have any confidence in a single estimate of future production levels. When, or if, there will be a peak level is very unclear and infinitely debatable, and so the discussion reaches an impasse. There are other definitions with which to continue the debate, however. One is that in the future there will be a gap between shrinking supply and growing demand. Another is that the world is simply “running out of oil”, or more specifically, “running out of oil that can be produced easily and cheaply”. The first definition is most commonly found in the popular literature,  since if it occurred the resulting oil price hikes would cripple the world’s economies, and so it is usually accompanied with varying degrees of dystopic doomsaying. But this is and always has been nonsense: it is not possible to have a “gap” between supply and demand. Similarly, the idea that we are “running out of oil” doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny. The evidence suggests that we actually have far too much oil. For example, if we are to have a chance of staying below the 2°C average global temperature rise agreed on by politicians, we need to use by 2035 less than two-thirds of our current reserves. And this is not to mention all the additional oil in fields yet to be discovered, for example in the Arctic and Antarctic, and huge volumes of “unconventional” oil, such as the extra-heavy crude and tar sand bitumen in Venezuela and Canada. However, the idea that we are running out of economically viable oil is more interesting, and it is this interpretation that has been most affected by the emergence of tight oil. “Cheap oil” is usually taken to be oil that can be bought at the prices seen from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s, around US$30 a barrel (in 2010 prices). If, as bullish commentators suggest, the arrival of tight oil had killed this interpretation, one would expect the oil price to gradually return to this level. The most respected authority on such matters, the International Energy Agency (IEA), suggested in its 2009 world energy outlook – before tight oil and shale gas – that oil prices would rise to above US$115 a barrel by 2030. It’s most recent 2013 outlook, which reflects the results of a major ramp-up in tight oil production and huge fields such as the Bakken formation, projects an oil price in 2030 that is again just over US$115 a barrel. All that hype, all that oil, but no difference to the oil price. So, were the dystopian predictions of what would occur after peak oil nonsense? Of course they were. But does that mean that peak oil itself is nonsense? Certainly not – we find ourselves in an era of high oil prices for many of the reasons that the peak oil proponents always advocated."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s been a lot of talk in the Internet about this year’s coming winter with some sites warning it could be the coldest in 50 years, or extremely too warm. Predictions, predictably, have been all across the board.
Last week German weather site donnerwetter.de here jumped into the fray and presented its 2015/16 winter outlook for Germany: likely colder than normal. The site writes. 

At first glance the El Niño weather phenomenon has no influence on winter weather in Germany. The weather data on this are just too ambiguous.
With one up-close study of the various climate conditions during an El Niño, two patterns appear, which however are indeed connected to the conditions in Europe.
According to Professor Jin-Yi Yu of the Department of Earth System Science of the University of California at Irvine, under a central El Niño we have to expect colder weather conditions due to blocking highs in Europe during the winter. The probability of westerly-wind-dominated winters tends to be minimal. There is a 78% probability of a normal or colder than normal winter. This was the case in the years 1995/1996 and 2009/2010.”
Here Professor Jin-Yi Yu is referring to one of two types of El Ninos, which he describes here.
It has to be pointed out that conditions this year are different than during past El Niños. Foremost the Northeast Pacific now has uncharacteristically high sea surface temperatures and no one here is sure what impact this will have. Joe Bastardi often points out that such warm regions of water lead to the formation of troughs and ridges in other areas which play a powerful role in setting up seasonal weather patterns. Also ther North Atlantic is very cold.
Donnerwetter also presents its forecast for the winter for each 10-day period in the form of a chart. Here I have very serious doubts that temperature and precipitation can be predicted down to such an accuracy. For example in the middle third of February, Donnerwetter forecasts temperatures to be 2°C colder than normal. Though the site provides good 7-day forecasts, I certainly wouldn’t use their winter forecast chart as any guidance for anything.

Satire



 _Not many people know that James Shaw actually prepared two press releases before he left for Madrid – a positive if things went well and a negative one if not much happened._



 _Unfortunately, his staff got them mixed and released the positive one instead of the one ready if Madrid was a non-event. The one released today is further down the article._



 _Here is the right one that was supposed to have been released.._.



 **New Zealand fails to showcase ambitious climate action**



Hon James Shaw



 _Climate Change._



With the global climate change talks closing overnight, the Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, said New Zealand failed to show the world what meaningful, ambitious and lasting climate action looks like.



As the head of the New Zealand delegation at the global climate talks, Minister Shaw tried sharing the progress this Government is making to build a cleaner, safer planet for future generations but no one listened. The hall was empty. We were upstaged by some whining teenager so no media arrived when I rose to speak.



“I talked to people from many countries who are thinking about putting in place their own climate change legislation but when they saw our Zero Carbon Act, thinking it may have been a benchmark for what meaningful, ambitious and lasting climate action looks like, they ran a mile. This Government will find another way to show global leadership on what needs to be done to leave a safer planet for future generations”, James Shaw said.



Talks closed with countries in total disarray unable to agree at all on a provision of the 2015 Paris Agreement known as Article 6. This concerns the role of carbon markets and carbon trading in helping countries to fulfil their emission cutting pledges. Some of the biggest emitters didn’t even show up.



“We should acknowledge that no meaningful progress was made, which is positive because it means more trips to exotic places for more talks. Unfortunately, we will have to wait another year or two, or three, to get it all sorted. I have been frustrated that there are some countries which are slowing overall global progress. This is especially frustrating at a time when everything we see happening around the world points to an urgent need to move further and faster. We got out of Madrid just before a record snowfall and some delegates had to stop over in Nice and Monaco because of frozen runways at home. However I am reassured by the fact that the vast majority of countries like Benin and Cote de Voire are increasing their ambition”, James Shaw said. They each had 300 delegates attending and unfortunately had block booked all the main suites in the local hotels.



“Let’s be clear: We are no longer on track towards a future where we are all playing our part to solve the challenge of climate change, and we are not going to get there unless countries are working more closely together. Carbon markets must have fair rules and ensure genuine emissions reductions, which is why getting an agreement on the rules countries should stick to has been a priority for New Zealand since the world committed to climate action in Paris in 2015”, said James Shaw. 



Mr Shaw is hoping the next conference will be in Sun City as he has never been to South Africa.



Ends.

With the global climate change talks closing overnight, the Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw said New Zealand will continue to show the world what meaningful, ambitious and lasting climate action looks like.



“Lasting action on climate change demands that we keep working every single day. This is the only way we can keep our promise to future generations that we will leave behind a world that is better off for what we did,” James Shaw said.



As the head of the New Zealand delegation at the global climate talks, Minister Shaw shared the progress this Government is making to build a cleaner, safer planet for future generations. 



“I talked to people from many countries who are thinking about putting in place their own climate change legislation and they are using our Zero Carbon Act as a benchmark for what meaningful, ambitious and lasting climate action looks like. This Government will continue to show global leadership on what needs to be done to leave a safer planet for future generations,” James Shaw said.



Talks closed with countries not able to agree fully on a provision of the 2015 Paris Agreement known as Article 6. This concerns the role of carbon markets and carbon trading in helping countries to fulfil their emission cutting pledges. 



“We should acknowledge that some important progress was made, which is positive. But unfortunately we will have to wait another year to get it all sorted. I have been frustrated that there are some countries who are slowing overall global progress. This is especially frustrating at a time when everything we see happening around the world points to an urgent need to move further and faster. However I am reassured by the fact that the vast majority of countries are increasing their ambition,” James Shaw said.



This year’s talks were not expected to produce a major breakthrough on countries’ emissions targets, but it was hoped Article 6 could be finalised, clearing the decks for countries to focus on more ambitious goals for cuts to emissions next year.



“Let’s be clear: We are still on track towards a future where we are all playing our part to solve the challenge of climate change, but we are not going to get there unless countries are working more closely together. Carbon markets must have fair rules and ensure genuine emissions reductions, which is why getting an agreement on the rules countries should stick to has been a priority for New Zealand since the world committed to climate action in Paris in 2015,” said James Shaw.

Threat identification and threat inflation are clearly important elements in international affairs. However, determining which threats and fears people and policymakers will embrace as notable and important is difficult. Thus, the American public and its leaders have remained remarkably calm about the dangers of genetically modified food while becoming very wary of nuclear power. The French see it very differently. In the United States, illegal immigration from Mexico is seen to be a threat in some years, but not in others. The country was “held hostage” when Americans were kidnapped in Iran in 1979 or in Lebanon in the 1980s but not when this repeatedly happened during the Iraq War or in Colombia. Milošević in Serbia became a monster worthy of attention and alarm, but not Mugabe in Zimbabwe or SLORC in Burma or Pol Pot in Cambodia or, until 9/11, the Taliban in Afghanistan.



However, it does seem that every foreign policy threat in the last several decades that has come to be accepted as significant has, in the process, been unwisely exaggerated. As a result, over the last several decades, alarmism has been prominent in thinking about international security. When successfully generated, alarmism very frequently leads to two responses that are serially connected and often prove to be unwise, even dangerous. First, a threatening event is treated not as an aberration, but rather as a harbinger indicating that things have suddenly become much more dangerous, will remain so, and will become worse — an exercise that might be called “massive extrapolation.” And second, there is a tendency to lash out at the threat and to overspend to deal with it without much thought about alternative policies including ones that might advocate simply letting it be. There is, as Noël Coward once put it in different context, a “dread of repose.” I would like to examine alarmism during the Cold War about the nature of the Soviet threat and alarmism after 9/11 about the threat presented terrorism. I conclude with a discussion about the relevance of deterrence to the process.



With this I do not wish to suggest that all fears are unjustified or that international threats are never underestimated. In fact, I suspect that some of the tendency to inflate threats in the period after World War II derives from the fact that the threat presented by Adolf Hitler’s Germany had been underappreciated in the period before it (and Hitler was keen to help: in virtually all of his foreign policy speeches of the 1930s, he spoke of his ardent desire for peace). The post‐​war proclivity toward exaggeration and overreaction may also stem in part from the traumatic prewar experience with Japan when there had been something of a tendency to underestimate its capacity and, in particular, its willingness to take risks. Robert Jervis has suggested that “those who remember the past are condemned to making the opposite mistakes.” The pre‐​war experience with Hitler and with Japan may have been too well remembered.



 **Alarmism and the Cold War**



During the Cold War, it came to be commonly accepted that the USSR posed a direct military threat to the West. In addition, particularly in the United States, a long‐​lasting alarm about the dangers presented by domestic Communists was generated. Both of these inspired massive countering efforts and expenditures that, it certainly appears in hindsight, were excessive. Alarm that the Soviet United presented a direct military threat was substantially established when Communist North Korea invaded the South in June 1950. A comparison with the 1930s was readily, if glibly, applied, and all of President Harry Truman’s advisers agreed that to fail to meet the challenge in Korea would be appeasement, which would lead ultimately to wider war. “I felt certain,” Truman recalled, “that if South Korea was allowed to fall Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores….If this was allowed to go unchallenged it would mean a third world war, just as similar incidents had brought on the second world war.” How, one might ask, could he, or anyone, be so certain?



Most Western decision makers felt that the invasion was part of a “Soviet strategic master plan,” and they became concerned that it might be merely a diversionary tactic: as defense analyst Bernard Brodie recalls, many, particularly the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “were utterly convinced that the Russians were using Korea as a feint to cause us to deploy our forces there while they prepared to a launch a ‘general’ (total) war against the United States through a major attack on Europe.” Indeed, observes historian John Lewis Gaddis, by 1950 no one at the summit of foreign policy could imagine that most of the major international developments that were to take place in the next half‐​century would do so. Among these: “that there would be no World War” and that the United States and the Soviet Union, “soon to have tens of thousands of thermonuclear weapons pointed at one another, would agree tacitly never to use any of them.” Given the conditions of the times, concern was obviously justified. However, milder explanations — ones which proved to be the correct ones — were simply not embraced, or even, it seems, considered. After all, those running world affairs after World War II were the same people or the intellectual heirs of the people who had tried desperately to prevent that cataclysm. It was entirely plausible that such people, despite their huge differences on many issues, might well manage to keep themselves from plunging into a self‐​destructive repeat performance. Although this perspective was not, of course, the only possible one, there was no definitive way to dismiss it, and it should accordingly have been on the table. But it seems not to have been. In fact, there was nothing in Soviet doctrine to remotely justify an assumption that they would want to risk a major war. According to the ideology on which the regime had been founded in 1917, world history is a vast, continuing process of progressive revolution. Steadily, in country after country, the oppressed working classes will violently revolt, destroying the oppressing capitalist classes and aligning their new regimes with other like‐​minded countries. However dynamic and threatening their ideology, the Soviets never subscribed to a Hitler‐​style theory of direct, Armageddon‐​risking conquest. After it was all over, a great amount of documentary evidence became available, and as Jervis notes, “the Soviet archives have yet to reveal any serious plans for unprovoked aggression against Western Europe, not to mention a first strike against the United States.” Vojtech Mastny, after an extended analysis, agrees: “The strategy of nuclear deterrence [was] irrelevant to deterring a major war that the enemy did not wish to launch in the first place.”





The threat of terrorism in the United States and the West has obviously proved to be far more limited than has persistently been feared.



The Communist venture in Korea, then, seems to have been a limited military probe at a point of perceived vulnerability in a peripheral area. Despite Western knee‐​jerk expressions of certainty and utter conviction, there was no evidence at the time that Stalin actually had anything broader in mind, nor has any come to light since. It was an opportunistic, one‐​off, event, not an element in a master plan as alarmists of the time simply assumed. However, alarm in the West certainly had very substantial consequences. In massive extrapolation, the American defense budget quadrupled — something that previously had been thought to be politically and economically infeasible. And to confront the supposed danger of a military invasion of Western Europe by the Soviets, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was rapidly transformed from a paper organization (big on symbolism, small on actual military capability) into a viable, well‐​equipped, centrally‐​led multinational armed force. In all, the United States spent somewhere between 5.5 and 10 trillion dollars on nuclear weapons and delivery systems — enough to purchase everything (or about half of everything) in the country except for the land. All this, primarily to confront, to deter, and to make glowering and menacing faces at, a perceived threat of direct military aggression that, essentially, didn’t exist. It also came to be accepted that military means might be needed to stop the spread of Communist revolution, and Vietnam became a disastrous “test case” in that process. In fact, the policy to seek to contain and confront Communism was logically flawed. If the Soviet system really was as rotten and as destined to self‐​destruct as the policy’s chief architect, George Kennan, more or less accurately surmised, the best policy would have been to let it expand until it reached the point of terminal overstretch. And it turned out that what ultimately helped bring about the mellowing of Soviet expansionism was not containment’s success, but its failure. Partly out of fear of repeating the Vietnam experience, the United States went into a sort of containment funk in the late 1970s and watched from a distance as the Soviet Union, in what seems in retrospect to have been remarkably like a fit of absentmindedness, opportunistically gathered that collection of Third World countries into its imperial embrace. Almost all of these soon became economic and political basket cases, fraught with dissension, financial mismanage‐​ment, and civil warfare. Eventually, the Soviets came to realize that they would have been better off contained.



Also generated at the time, particularly in the United States, was extravagant alarmism about the degree to which domestic Communists — “masters of deceit” and “enemies from within” — presented a threat to the republic. Thus, J. Edgar Hoover, the highly respected, even revered, director of the FBI, insisted in a 1958 book that the American Communist Party was working “day and night to further the Communist plot in America” with “deadly seriousness”; that a “Bolshevik transmission” was in progress that was “virtually invisible to the non‐​Communist eye, unhampered by time, distance, and legality”; that it was “creating Communist puppets throughout the country”; and that it had for “its objective the ultimate seizure of power in America.” Those in quest of the enemy within, like Hoover, spent a prodigious amount of time and public money in pursuit. For example, in 1972, the FBI in full perpetual motion mode opened 65,000 new files as part of its costly quest to ferret out Communists in the United States. Hugh Trevor-Roper’s observation about the European witch craze — “The more fiercely they were prosecuted, the more numerous they seemed to become” — appears to resonate. In a fascinating book, German literature specialist Alexander Stephan describes the U.S. government’s surveillance of a group of German émigré writers during and after World War II. None was found to pose much of a subversive threat, and the surveillance never led to real persecution — indeed, few of the writers noticed they were being watched. Instead, what impresses Stephan is the essential absurdity of the situation — the “high efficiency and gross overkill” as hundreds of agents were paid to intercept and catalog communications, to endlessly record goings and comings, and to sift enterprisingly through trash bins in a quest for incriminating information.



For example, there is something profoundly ludicrous about the fact that dozens of government employees spent their time in the middle of a world war monitoring pillow talk between Bertolt Brecht and his Danish co‐​worker, Ruth Berlau — all this, notes the amazed Stephan, “at taxpayers’ expense. It appears that no one during the Cold War attacked the alarmist premise of the system: that domestic Communists posed a threat severe enough to require an elaborate and expensive policing effort. Substantially, it seems, Hoover’s dire exaggerations were substantially accepted, and it appears that no one in the United State ever said in public: “Many domestic Communists adhere to a foreign ideology that ultimately has as its goal the destruction of capitalism and democracy and by violence if necessary; however, they do not present much of a danger, are actually quite a pathetic bunch, and couldn’t subvert their way out of a wet paper bag. Why are we expending so much time, effort, and treasure on this issue?” It is astounding that this plausible, if arguable, point of view seems never to have been publicly expressed by anyone during the lengthy Cold War, whether politician, pundit, professor, or editorialist. Instead, the essential premise of the system was generally accepted: there are a lot of dangerous and capable Communists running around in the country.



The fear of domestic Communism, and the consequent costly anti‐​Communist surveillance system it spawned, flourished for decades. After the 1950s, press attention to the domestic Communism dwindled to almost nothing — because there was nothing to report. However, public opinion surveys demonstrate that the percentage of Americans who considered domestic Communists to present a great or very great danger to the country declined not at all in the ten years after 1954 — the height of the McCarthy era — and even 20 years later it had gone down by only one‐​quarter. The Communist‐​craze died out only when international Communism obligingly collapsed at the end of the Cold War. At that point, any machinations by domestic Communists no longer had a threatening foreign referent: although espionage continued to be of concern, there no longer existed a hostile foreign power to whom domestic Communists could relay secrets, nor was there a prominent, threatening ideology stressing subversion and violent revolution for them to serve.



 **Alarmism about Terrorism after 9/11**



Recalls Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City at the time, “anybody, any one of these security experts, including myself, would have told you on September 11, 2001, we’re looking at dozens and dozens and multiyears of attacks like this.” The concern is certainly understandable. However, that every “security expert” should fervently embrace such alarmist — and, it turned out, erroneous — views is fundamentally absurd. It was also an entirely plausible extrapolation from facts then at hand that 9/11 could prove to be an aberration rather than a harbinger. Yet it appears that no one in authority could even imagine that proposition to be true — effectively, they dismissed it out of hand — even though it could have been taken to fit the available information fully as well as the passionately embraced alarmist perspective. In his memoir of his time as president of the United States, George W. Bush recalls a briefing he received from the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation a few weeks after the terrorist tragedy of September 11, 2001. The director informed him “that there were 331 potential al‐​Qaeda operatives inside the United States.” Bush says his routine at the time was to pepper such reports with questions: “How credible was each threat? What had we done to follow up on a lead?” However, when writing his book nearly a decade later, he apparently did not feel it useful to reflect critically (or ironically) on the director’s impressive and remarkably precise number. If he had, he would likely have concluded that virtually all of the 331 envisioned terrorists did not exist. Michael Morell, the CIA agent in charge of briefing Bush at the time, recalls the atmosphere vividly in a book published in 2015: “We were certain we were going to be attacked again.” There was “an avalanche — literally thousands — of intelligence reports in the months following 9/11 that strongly indicated that al Qa’ida would hit us again,” and some of these indicated that the terrorists might use chemical or biological weapons or “even crude nuclear devices” — a suggestion Morell says he found to be “believable.” Even fourteen years later, Morell does not pause to reflect on why or how those “thousands” of alarming intelligence reports could have been so hopelessly and so spectacularly wrong. Intelligence sources were soon seeing terrorists everywhere. By 2002 they were telling rapt and uncritical reporters — and presumably the president of the United States — that the number of trained al‐​Qaeda operatives in the United States was between 2,000 and 5,000.As it happens, however, scarcely any al‐​Qaeda operatives have ever been unearthed in the United States. The government has been far better at counting al‐​Qaeda operatives in the country than at finding them. In the process, a massive counterterrorism enterprise has been constructed, far larger than the one that had chased domestic Communists during the Cold War. Agencies like the FBI, redirecting much of their effort from organized crime and white‐​collar embezzlement, have kept their primary focus on the terrorist threat. The government reportedly each day follows up on more than 5,000 tips or leads — or “threats,” as they are (rather preposterously) called internally. If each of these takes an average of two days to investigate, the United States has followed up on 915,000 “threats” per year, or well over 10 million since 2001. Even under very generous assumptions about how many of these contain true grist, only one alarm in 10,000 fails to be false. And the vast majority of the leads deemed worthy of pursuit seem to have led to terrorist enterprises that were either trivial or at most aspirational. But the chase will continue, of course, because no one wants to be the one whose neglect somehow leads to another catastrophe — or in the hyperbole of an official at the FBI’s National Threat Center, “it’s the one you don’t take seriously that becomes the 9/11.”



It is an expensive, exhausting, bewildering, chaotic, and paranoia‐​inducing process. At times, in fact, it seems to be an exercise in dueling delusions: a Muslim hothead has delusions about changing the world by blowing something up, and the authorities have delusions that he might actually be able to overcome his patent inadequacies to do so. As Dana Priest and William Arkin have documented in their remarkable book, Top Secret America, by 2009 there were something like 1,074 federal government organizations and almost 2,000 private companies devoted to counter‐​terrorism, homeland security, and intelligence spread over more than 17,000 locations within the country. A simple listing of the government’s “Special Operations Programs” runs to 300 pages. Collectively this apparatus has launched far more covert operations in the aftermath of 9/11 than it had during the entire forty‐​five years of the cold war. A particular comparison might be useful. At least 263 of the agencies devoted to counterterrorism were created or reorganized after 9/11.Since 9/11, some 62 cases have come to light of Islamist extremist terrorism, whether based in the United States or abroad, in which the United States itself has been, or apparently has been, targeted. The total number of real terrorists, would‐​be terrorists, and putative terrorists populating this set of cases, excluding FBI and police undercover operatives, is around 100. Thus, since 9/11, the United States has created or reorganized more than two entire counterterrorism organizations for every terrorist arrest or apprehension it has made of people plotting to do damage within the country.



The alarmist perspective seems to have been internalized and institutionalized over the years in a great many ways, and it has proved to be notably resistant to counter‐​information. Important in the process is the “Threat Matrix,” an itemized catalog of all the “threats” needing to be followed up.The Threat Matrix, or selected excerpts from it, forms the centerpiece of the briefings on terrorism the FBI director undergoes each day, and it also undergoes scrutiny at the daily late afternoon briefing presided over by the director of the CIA.And every morning, it would be used to brief the President. According to journalist Garrett Graff, the Threat Matrix “tracks all the unfolding terrorist plots and intelligence rumors” and is “filled to the brim with whispers, rumors, and vacuous, unconfirmed information.” Impelled by what some have called “The 9/11 Commission Syndrome” — an obsession with the career dangers in failing to “connect the dots” — it is in no one’s interest to reduce the length of the list “because it was possible you’d cull the wrong threat and end up, after the next attack, at the green felt witness table before the next congressional inquiry.“As a result, “claims that ordinarily wouldn’t have made it past the intake agent, claims that wouldn’t even be written down weeks earlier, suddenly became the subject of briefs to the President in the Oval Office.” He supplies an example. One entry in the Threat Matrix is crisply cited as “a threat from the Philippines to attack the United States unless blackmail money was paid.” It turns out that this entry was based on an email that said, “Dear America. I will attack you if you don’t pay me 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 dollars. MUHAHAHA.” Graff reports that the FBI dutifully traced the email’s author and sent information to police in the Philippines, who then paid a visit to the would‐​be extortionist’s parents. As Graff vividly describes the process, the Threat Matrix could become “all‐​consuming and paralyzing” and comes off as “a catalogue of horrors,” as the “daily looming prognoses of Armageddon,” and as “a seeming tidal wave of Islamic extremist anger that threatened to unhinge American society.” Jack Goldsmith, an avid consumer of the Threat Matrix when he was in the Bush administration, stresses that “It is hard to overstate the impact that the incessant waves of threat reports have on the judgment of people inside the executive branch who are responsible for protecting American lives.” He quotes CIA Director George Tenet, “You simply could not sit where I did and read what passed across my desk on a daily basis and be anything other than scared to death about what it portended.” This, writes Goldsmith, captures “the attitude of every person I knew who regularly read the threat matrix.” Every person. One insider notes that threat “shadowed us every day,” and that “voluminous and dominating” threat information “contributed to a pervasive sense that every day might bring a new attack.” As another reader puts it, “Your mind comes to be dominated by the horrific consequences of low‐​probability events.” Another has arrestingly offered a vivid comparison: “Reading the Threat Matrix every day is like being stuck in a room listening to loud Led Zeppelin music,” and after a while, you begin to suffer from “sensory overload” and become “paranoid” about the threat.” And another says, “Think of the goalie at a soccer game who must stop every shot, for the enemy wins if it scores a single goal. The problem is that the goalie cannot see the ball — it is invisible. So are the players — he doesn’t know how many there are, or where they are, or what they look like.”



However, the avalanche of “threats,” combined with the fact that these scarcely ever led to anything, never inspired analysts and policymakers to consider the rather plausible, if arguable, conclusion that there was little or nothing out there to fear — that just maybe the problem is not that the ball and the opposing players are “invisible,” but rather that they actually don’t exist. Instead, the experience caused them — exclusively, it seems — to embrace the dead opposite. “The want of actionable intelligence combined with a knowledge of what might happen,” Goldsmith observes, “produced an aggressive, panicked attitude that assumed the worst about threats.” If you believe in ghosts (like 49 percent of the American public) but have never seen one (like half of these), two plausible explanations are likely to spring to mind. One, you’re not looking hard enough. Or, two, the ghosts are diabolically clever. Counter‐​terrorists have routinely applied both explanations in their frantic quest to make us safe at taxpayers’ expense. No one, it appears, was given to question the enterprise or its essential premise. In addition, as the CIA’s Richards Heuer notes, one of the factors that influences the “imaginability of scenarios” is “the act of analysis itself,” because “constructing a detailed scenario for a possible future event makes that event more readily imaginable and, therefore, increases its perceived probability.” Thus, it is exemplified nicely by the assertions in congressional testimony by FBI Director Robert Mueller, an avid consumer of the Threat Matrix: “the greatest threat is from al‐​Qaeda cells in the U.S. that we have not yet identified” and “I remain very concerned about what we are not seeing.” He did not seek to flesh out the picture by acknowledging, at least for purposes of discussion, that there might be a plausible alternative — that the massive homeland security apparatus in the United States has persecuted some, spied on many, inconvenienced most, and taxed all to defend against a domestic enemy that scarcely exists. Throughout the costly post‐​9/​11 counterterrorism saga, that continues to be the hypothesis that dare not speak its name.



The threat of terrorism in the United States and the West has obviously proved to be far more limited than has persistently been feared. The number of al‐​Qaeda operatives actually in the country has held at zero or nearly so, and the FBI’s inability to find sleeper cells has persisted to the present day. And Brian Jenkins’ characterization of those terrorists or would‐​be terrorists the system has picked up seems apt: “their numbers remain small, their determination limp, and their competence poor.” Accordingly, there might have been some judicious re‐​evaluations, and perhaps even some cutbacks to the funds devoted to dealing with the exaggerated threat. Although the Obama administration that assumed office in 2009 has taken some pains to downplay the rhetoric, one of his advisers, Bruce Riedel, was soon publicly maintaining that the al‐​Qaeda threat to the country continued to be “existential.” And at a 2011 press conference, Obama’s Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano opaquely, if creatively, announced that, although the likelihood of a large‐​scale organized attack had diminished, the continued danger of a small‐​scale disorganized attack meant that there was a “sense” in which it could be said that the terrorist threat was higher than at any time since 9/11. This extraordinary contention failed to prompt a skeptical query from her rapt auditors. The ultimate extension of alarmist thinking about terrorism is to characterize the terrorist threat, as Reidel does, as “existential,” routinely asserting that terrorists somehow threaten to expunge the United States, the modern state, or even civilization itself. Rather amazingly, this extreme expression, which, if accepted as valid, can close off all judicious evaluation of the problem, has only rarely been called into question.When he was Homeland Security Secretary, Michael Chertoff went one step further, proclaiming the “struggle” against terrorism to be a “significant existential” one — carefully differentiating it, apparently, from all those insignificant existential struggles Americans have waged in the past.



However, is just possible that things began to change in 2014. In a speech at Harvard University in October, Vice President Joseph Biden offered the thought that “we face no existential threat — none — to our way of life or our ultimate security.“Then, after a decent interval of three months, President Barack Obama reiterated this point at a press conference, and then expanded in an interview a few weeks later, adding that the United States should not “provide a victory to these terrorist networks by over‐​inflating their importance and suggesting in some fashion that they are an existential threat to the United States or the world order.” It is impressive that these utterances — “blindingly obvious” as security specialist Bruce Schneier puts it — appear to mark the first time any officials in the United States have had the notion and the courage to say so in public. Whether that development, at once remarkable and absurdly belated, will have some consequence, or even continue, remains to be seen. Thus, General Michael Flynn, who had recently retired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is given to insisting that the terrorist enemy is “committed to the destruction of freedom and the American way of life” while seeking “world domination, achieved through violence and bloodshed.” It is reported that his remarks, to an audience of “special operators and intelligence officers,” evoked “many nods of approval,” “occasional cheers,” and “ultimately a standing ovation.” Thus even the most modest imaginable effort to rein in the War on Terror hyperbole may fail to gel.



 **Alarmism about the Atomic Terrorist**



An important part of the alarmism has been directed at, and impelled by the prospect of, nuclear terrorism, the most commonly embraced method by which it has been suggested that terrorists would be able to repeat, or even top, the destruction of 9/11. It was in 2004, in his influential book, Nuclear Terrorism — a work Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times found to be “terrifying” — that Harvard’s Graham Allison relayed his “considered judgment” that “on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not.” Allison has had a great deal of company in his alarming pronouncements. For example, in 2007, the distinguished physicist Richard Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an American or European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per year, which would work out to 89 percent over a ten‐​year period. Allison’s time is up, and so, pretty much, is Garwin’s. And it is important to the point out that not only have terrorists failed to go nuclear, but in the words of William Langewiesche who has assessed the process in detail, “The best information is that no one has gotten anywhere near this. I mean, if you look carefully and practically at this process, you see that it is an enormous undertaking full of risks for the would‐​be terrorists.” In fact, terrorist groups seem thus far to have exhibited only limited desire and even less progress in going atomic. This may be because, after brief exploration of the possible routes, they, unlike generations of alarmists on the issue, have discovered that the tremendous effort required is scarcely likely to be successful. It is highly improbable that a would‐​be atomic terrorist would be given or sold a bomb by a generous like‐​minded nuclear state because the donor could not control its use and because the ultimate source of the weapon might be discovered. Although there has been great worry about terrorists illicitly stealing or purchasing a nuclear weapon, it seems likely that neither “loose nukes” nor a market in illicit nuclear materials exists. Moreover, finished bombs have been outfitted with an array of locks and safety devices. There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge if a nuclear state were utterly to fail, collapsing in full disarray. However, even under those conditions, nuclear weapons would likely remain under heavy guard by people who know that a purloined bomb would most likely end up going off in their own territory, would still have locks, and could probably be followed and hunted down by an alarmed international community. The most plausible route for terrorists would be to manufacture the device themselves from purloined materials. This task requires that a considerable series of difficult hurdles be conquered in sequence. These include the effective recruitment of people who at once have great technical skills and will remain completely devoted to the cause. In addition, a host of corrupted co‐​conspirators, many of them foreign, must remain utterly reliable, international and local security services must be kept perpetually in the dark, and no curious outsider must get consequential wind of the project over the months or even years it takes to pull off. In addition, the financial costs of the operation could easily become monumental.



Alarmism about the atomic terrorist has had its most damaging results when it has been linked with an alarmist perspective about nuclear proliferation. For decades during and after the Cold War, there has been almost wall‐​to‐​wall alarm about the dangers supposedly inherent in nuclear proliferation. This perspective has almost never undergone careful examination. In fact, the proliferation of nuclear weapons has been far slower than has been commonly predicted over the decades primarily because the weapons do not generally convey much advantage to their possessor. And, more importantly, the effect of the proliferation that has taken place has been substantially benign: those who have acquired the weapons have “used” them simply to stoke their egos or to deter real or imagined threats. This holds even for the proliferation of the weapons to large, important countries run by unchallenged monsters who at the time they acquired the bombs were certifiably deranged: Josef Stalin who in 1949 was planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, and Mao Zedong who in 1964 had just carried out a bizarre social experiment that had resulted in artificial famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished. Despite this experience, an aversion to nuclear proliferation continues to impel alarmed concern, and it was a chief motivator of the Iraq War which essentially was a militarized antiproliferation effort in which fears that Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, unlike all other nuclear states since 1945, might actually set off such weapons if he got them and/​or that Saddam would give them to terrorists. The war that ensued proved to be a necessary cause of the deaths of more people than perished at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.



 **Public Opinion**



As noted earlier, public alarm about domestic Communism declined only very slowly during the Cold War. The same pattern can be found for public opinion about terrorism in the post‐​9/​11 period. It is probably best to see public opinion as the primary driver in the excessive and somewhat bizarre counterterrorism process that has taken place in the United States since 9/11. Assessing the public reaction to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, anthropologist Scott Atran muses, “Perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many.” Poll data suggest that much of that fright continues to linger, at least in the United States, more than a decade after the impelling event. This, even though there has been nothing remotely like 9/11 anywhere in the world and no major attacks (ones inflicting at least 25 deaths) in the United States at all, even though Osama bin Laden has been dispatched, even though official and media alarmism has generally dampened some, and even though an American’s chance of being killed by a terrorist under current conditions stands at one in 4 million per year — or one in 110 million per year if only the post‐​9/​11 period is included in the calculation. The American public has come to pay less attention to terrorism as other concerns — the wars in the Middle East and, more lately, the economy — have dominated its responses to questions about the most important problem facing the country. However, poll questions specifically focused on terrorism generally find little decline in the degree to which Americans voice concern about that hazard, although there have been various temporary ups and downs in these trends in response to specific events. There are two patterns. On some questions, concerns soared at the time of the 9/11 attacks, dropped to lower levels in the subsequent few months, but then afterward failed to decline much further. On other questions, levels of concern reached at the time of the attacks continued to remain at much same level in subsequent years.



 **Alarmism and Deterrence**



Alarmists have one great advantage. If their alarm proves to be justified, they will look like prophets. If nothing happens, they can claim that this desirable condition has been the result of efforts their alarmism has inspired. Thus, when New York Police Department Commissioner David Cohen is asked how he knows whether his extensive counterterrorism programs (which have had an almost perfect record of not finding any terrorists) have been successful, he curtly responds, “They haven’t attacked us.” Reporting this comment, reporters Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman note that “the absence of a terrorist attack has been the silver‐​bullet argument for national security pro‐​fessionals.” Although it is a “flawed argument” logically, they continue, it has been “nearly irrefutable” politically. The dodge, then, is, (1) we are trying to keep them from attacking; (2) they haven’t attacked; therefore (3) it must be our efforts that have kept them from doing so.



But there at least four objections to this. First, it is not to be expected that there would normally be very many attacks, especially large ones. Although counterterrorism measures vary considerably in their scope and adequacy around the world, terrorism is, and always has been, a rare phenomenon. Even as 9/11 has proved to be an aberration, “terrorism” of late has overwhelmingly taken place in civil war situations, particularly in the Middle East, where one or more sides apply terrorist tactics as an instrument of warfare. However, this has long been a feature of civil warfare. What has changed is not the destructiveness or the effectiveness of such tactics, but that after 9/11 they are have commonly been labeled “terrorism.” Overall, al-Qaeda’s record for violence is scarcely less impressive since 9/11 than it was before that tragedy. The costly maintenance of a no‐​fly list has doubtless made it more difficult for terrorists to move about internationally, but getting operatives into the United States was already a primary problem for them before 9/11. Moreover, there has not been a great amount of terrorism in Europe even though its Muslim population is large and even though entry and exit are much easier.



Indeed, extremist Islamist terrorism — whether associated with al‐​Qaeda or not — has claimed some 200 to 300 lives yearly worldwide since 2001 outside of war zones, and that number seems, if anything, to be declining. That’s 200 to 300 too many, of course, but it is about the same number as deaths from bathtub drownings in the United States. Second, the deterrence argument suffers from a special defect as it applies to terrorism. It may well be that certain sets of targets, like airplanes and rural military bases, are so well protected that terrorists have been successfully deterred from attacking them. However, of necessity the world remains full of lucrative terrorist targets that are substantially unprotected. It simply cannot be that competent and dedicated terrorists have been deterred from attacking all such targets by protective or policing measures. Third, the actual terrorist “adversaries” faced in the West scarcely deserve accolades for either dedication or prowess. The alarmist dodge, at once “flawed” and “nearly irrefutable,” beneficially derives from an often‐​stupendous exaggeration of the determination and capacities of the terrorists. It is posited that our terrorist “adversaries” are at once very capable and hugely dedicated. Since they haven’t yet done much of anything outside of war zones, it is held, it must be that their schemes have been disrupted or deterred by our costly and extensive counterterrorism measures. For the most part, however, Islamist terrorists in the West are a confused, inadequate, incompetent, blundering, and gullible bunch, rarely able to get their act together. To a considerable degree, that conclusion holds even for those international terrorist operators who are routinely labeled “masterminds.” All seem to be far better at frenetic and often self‐​deluded scheming than at actual execution. It is true, of course, that sometimes even incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are rare. Moreover, for the most part, the consequences of individual successful attacks have been quite limited — scarcely any really do enough damage to be considered “major” and, except perhaps in occasional fantasies, there has been nothing again like 9/11.



Indeed, scarcely any terrorist act before or after 9/11 has visited even one‐​tenth as much death and destruction, even ones launched in the unpoliced context of civil wars where the conspirators have space, munitions, and time to prepare. And fourth, as Mark Stewart and I have repeatedly shown in our books, Terror, Security, and Money: The Risks, Benefits, and Costs of Homeland Security and the forthcoming Chasing Ghosts: The Policing of Terrorism, counter‐​terrorism security measures generally do not survive a standard cost‐​effectiveness analysis in which the question is: How many terrorist attacks would have had to occur without the measure in place to justify its cost? Even assuming the counterterrorism measures greatly reduce the risk (the consequences and/​or the likelihood) of terrorist attack, and even assuming any terrorist acts successfully consummated would be highly destructive, the cost of most (though certainly not all) security measures has proven to be excessive. For example, it appears that the increase in spending on domestic security measures in the United States would only begin to be cost‐​effective if the measure deterred, foiled, or protected against three Boston Marathon bombings every week, or more than one attack like the one on the London Underground every month.



 **Deterrence and the Cold War**



In its deterrence form, the counter‐​terrorism thinking process has a long pedigree. It reached perhaps its greatest height during the Cold War, when the American nuclear force (a.k.a. its “deterrent”) was deemed to be successful because the horror it was designed to deter, a major Soviet military attack, never took place. Left unconsidered was the obvious alternative explanation suggested by George Kennan: “I have never believed that they have seen it as in their interests to overrun Western Europe militarily, or that they would have launched an attack on that region generally even if the so‐​called nuclear deterrent had not existed.” The absurdity of the situation is poignantly captured in an exasperated comment by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956: “We are piling up armaments because we do not know what else to do to provide for our security.” One thing they might have done would have been to reassess the threat of direct military aggression that the Soviet Union supposedly presented. And, indeed, Eisenhower does seem to have grasped the fundamental reality that the Soviets had no interest whatever in a direct military conflagration. Although he was concerned about what he called “a sort of peaceful infiltration,” he felt, “after many long, long, years of study of this problem,” that “everything is pointing to the fact that Russia in not seeking a general war and will not for a long, long time, if ever.” And it followed that an ever‐​enlarged military was scarcely required to deter them.



However, Eisenhower never really summoned the political courage to draw this lesson openly and forcefully. Presumably this was because, like officials today who worry about appearing to downplay the threat terrorism is deemed to present, he feared a public opinion backlash. Thus even after leaving office, he chose to flail at the “military‐​industrial complex” rather than at the faulty and underexamined premise that gave that complex its political potency.



 **The Fading of Alarm**



The grand mistake of the Cold War was to infer desperate intent from apparent capacity. For the war on terrorism, it is to infer desperate capacity from apparent intent. It might be instructive to note as well that, although fears about the danger presented by domestic Communists could be alleviated by the collapse of the perceived grand international Communism conspiracy, the war on terror cannot be so logically ended. Terrorism, like murder, has always existed in some form or another and always will. And, because of the special formlessness, even spookiness, of terrorism’s hostile foreign referent in this case, it may be exceptionally difficult to get people to believe that the threat has really been extinguished — or at least that it no longer is particularly significant. Thus, public fear about terrorism was stoked anew in 2014 with some beheadings of Westerners by ISIS, a vicious and apparently threatening foreign group that had scarcely even been known to exist a year earlier. To the degree that the public remains terrorized, it seems likely to continue demanding that its leaders pay due deference to its insecurities. In the process it will likely uncritically approve extravagant counterterrorism expenditures, including incessant security checks, civil liberties intrusions, and expanded police powers, as well as militarized forays overseas — if not necessarily full‐​scale ground assaults — if they can convincingly be associated with the quest to stamp out terrorists who might have the West in their sights. Politicians, officials, and the media have routinely (and irresponsibly) played to and exacerbated these popular anxieties out of a sense of both duty and self‐​interest. But, as was suggested earlier, the essential impetus is more nearly bottom up than top down.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have attacked their neighbor, Qatar, for supposedly supporting terrorism. They pretend to be firefighters, but spent years as arsonists. Over the years the Saudis, in particular, financed and staffed terrorist groups, including al‐​Qaeda, which staged the 9/11 attacks. Riyadh’s record has since improved, but only under strong U.S. pressure.



Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been consolidating power, essentially turning a consensual, familial autocracy into a more traditional personal dictatorship. Most recently he has been detaining and shaking down wealthy family members, an act akin to a criminal gang adjusting members’ shares after a big heist.



Worse, he is thought to have decided on the bloody intervention in Yemen, which has turned a longstanding civil war into a sectarian conflict and killed thousands of civilians. The only positive so far of his de facto reign is his recent decision to liberalize Saudi social life. Women now can breathe and even drive.



However, he has not relaxed political or religious controls. Most important, while limiting the influence of fundamentalist clerics at home, he has not yet dropped the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s longstanding support for radical Islamism abroad. Indeed, he might seek to pacify discontented Imams by further channeling their intolerance toward the West.





Saudi Arabia continues to promote radical Wahhabism and create a breeding ground for terrorists.



The KSA spends as much as $4 billion annually promoting its uniquely intolerant brand of Salafist Islamic thought, aimed at the “purification” of the faith known as Wahhabism. By enforcing this rigidly intolerant theology the KSA has acted like a housebroken version of the Islamic State. People have been similarly oppressed and brutalized, but with a veneer of legality. In contrast, ISIS reflects, argued Princeton’s Bernard Haykel, “a kind of untamed Wahhabism.”



Indeed, the two powers used the same school textbooks. Reported the _New York Times_ : “The group circulates images of Wahhabi religious textbooks from Saudi Arabia in the schools it controls. Videos from the group’s territory have shown Wahhabi texts plastered on the sides of an official missionary van.” What has been the impact? Even some Saudi commentators noted that upwards of 4,000 Saudi youth may have joined ISIS in Syria, second only to the number of Tunisians. KSA sent more suicide bombers to Iraq than did any other nation and thousands of other ISIS sympathizers were arrested in Saudi Arabia. Fifteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers were Saudis and Osama bin Laden was educated in the KSA. Turkish cleric Mehmet Gormez asked a group of Saudi clerics about 45 Saudis executed for terrorist offenses: “These people studied Islam for 10 or 15 years in your country. Is there a problem with the educational system”?



If MbS, as the crown prince is known, is serious about reform, he and his people should look inward. Of course, the Saudi royals prefer to sell oil to Westerners rather than kill them. But until now sectarian intolerance and religious hatred formed the Kingdom’s foundation. Complained former Sen. Bob Graham, who served on the 9/11 commission: “They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for the most extreme form of Islam.” Which, unfortunately, has created breeding grounds for terrorists.



Wahhabism originated in the 18th century. Muhammad ibn Abd al‐​Wahhab preached renewal, simplification, and purification of Islam. In the Arabian Peninsula he allied with Muhammad bin Saud, who employed the sword to transform the recalcitrant. Al‐​Wahhab apparently declared jihad against tribes which resisted his teachings, though it primarily was bin Saud’s son, Abdul‐​Aziz bin Muhammad, who turned Wahhabism into “an instrument of state terror,” argued Karen Armstrong in the _New Statesman_.



The political and religious formed a brutal partnership. Reported the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy: “The political vision of Muhammad ibn Saud sought to unite all of the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula under his authority, while the religious vision of Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab was to purge the land of beliefs and practices that, according to his strict interpretation of theology, contaminated its Islamic identify.” Wahhabism remained the driving theological force of what became the bin Saud dynasty, though the movement’s impact varied over time.



Creation of the Kingdom in 1932 led to a fateful deal: Wahhabists would channel political Islam to buttress rule by the ibn Saud family, who in turn would enforce Wahhabist doctrines. As ICRD put it: “Political obedience, then, was made an Islamic duty, and Salafist obedience was made a royal obligation.” (The later Muslim Brotherhood emphasized piety but not obedience to political authorities.)



The rise of oil prices in the 1970s allowed the royals to live luxuriously while funding Islamic radicalism. In 1979 the Iranian Revolution and attack on Mecca’s Grand Mosque by Islamists calling for the monarchy’s overthrow caused the royals to double down. They imposed greater social restrictions, especially on women, empowered the religious police, and offered increased financial support for Salafists who backed the regime’s legitimacy. In this way the political and religious authorities long reinforced each other’s authority.



In recent years the Saudi royals have spent $3 to $4 billion a year, roughly $100 billion cumulatively, on educational fellowships and scholarships, Islamic clergy and scholars, academics and journalists, construction projects — madrassahs, mosques, universities, and Islamic centers — operating funds, and school materials. Thus, while Wahhabism is a minority view even within Sunni Islam, it accounts for the vast majority of outside funding. Abdurrahman Wahid, a moderate Muslim who once served as Indonesia’s president and headed the Islamic organization Nahdlatal Ulama, said that “Wahhabi/​Salafi ideology has made substantial inroads throughout the Muslim world” because of the Saudis’ wealth.



Wahhabism falls within the larger Salafist movement, which extends well beyond the Arabian Peninsula. Scholars disagree over the exact relationship. Some view Wahhabism as a subset of Salafism, while others contend that the two strains of thought essentially have melded into one. In either case, Wahhabism is hostile to America and Americans’ values.



Of particular concern is the Kingdom’s educational efforts, which are directed at radicalizing all who use them. Textbooks and other materials tend to show anyone who does not profess Wahhabist precepts in, shall we say, a bad light. A number of studies have been conducted over the years, sometimes with difficulty, since Riyadh is not always willing to share its publications. Noted the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy, “The consensus findings of these reports demonstrate a consistent pattern of using the educational curriculum to generate a climate of broad‐​based intolerance for non‐​Salafist identity groups.”



In its latest report on Saudi Arabia the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom demonstrated its continuing concern over the issue. The Commission acknowledged “additional revisions to remove intolerant passages from textbooks and curricula.” However, USCIRF recommended that more be done to “halt the dissemination of intolerant literature and extremist ideology within Saudi Arabia and around the world” and “revise and update textbooks to remove remaining intolerant references that disparage Muslims or non‐​Muslims or that promote hatred toward other religions or religious groups, a process the Saudi government expected to complete by July 2008.” The Commission worried not only about new textbooks, but the continuing use worldwide of older, more negative books.



For instance, in 2002 the Congressional Research Service reported that the Saudis conceded an internal study had concluded that five percent of the textbook content was “horrible.” A 2003 study by Bader Mousa al‐​Saif of monotheism texts found degrading attacks on Christians and Jews.



Also in 2003, Eleanor Adbdella Dournato assessed Saudi books. In her judgment, explained ICRD, the texts promoted extremism because of “an aversion to encourage critical thinking and independent reasoning,” leaving students few tools with which to reject charismatic extremist propaganda. The same year a report by Arnon Gross warned that the Saudi materials created an “other” promoted by “a malicious Crusader‐​Jewish alliance striving to eliminate Islam from all the continents.”



Another 2003 study, by Saudi journalist Ibrahim al‐​Sakran and former Saudi judge Sheikh Abd al‐​Aziz al‐​Qassem, reviewed middle and high school texts. The astonishing conclusion: the program “encourages violence toward others, and misguides the pupils into believing that in order to safeguard their own religion, they must violently repress and even physically eliminate the ‘other.’”



Other studies have consistently criticized Saudi (mis)educational materials. A decade ago Freedom House reported that “The material found in these books reveals that the Saudi government continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward the ‘unbeliever,’ which includes Christians, Jews, Shiites, Sufis, Sunni Muslims who do not follow Wahhabi doctrine, Hindus, atheists and others.”



Author Nina Shea updated the study in 2008 and 2011, and found that extremism and intolerance remained even after Riyadh claimed to have cleansed the texts. In 2011 USCIRF warned about Saudi textbooks reflecting intolerance. Four years ago the State Department spent a half million dollars to study Saudi texts but refused to release the results, which embarrassed the Saudis. The _New York Times_ gained access to the study, conducted by the International Center for Religion and Democracy.



The assessment was not entirely negative, but overall, explained, the ICRD: “The Saudi education system is found to promote intolerance over the course of a student’s career in two primary ways: it creates a climate of general prejudice against non‐​Salafist and non‐​Muslim groups, and it contains direct discriminatory calls to action — both violence and non‐​violent. This intolerance is supported through a web of misrepresentation, complicated and contrived identity associations, and the misapplication of selective interpretations of scripture. Such prejudice is not conducive to stability, cooperation and prosperity in a society that includes a large number of foreign residents and workers.” The group listed specific passages to back its judgment.



Noted ICRD: “All the while students are inculcated with fear and hostility toward what conservative Salafist clerics deem to be threats to Islam. Discriminatory and occasionally violent calls to action are scattered throughout the curriculum, and are supported by a litany of charges against the targets. Everything from avoidance to hatred and murder is advocated.”



Earlier this year David Andrew Weinberg of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies assessed Saudi textbooks for the 2016–17 school year. He found that they were more likely to recommend execution for lifestyle choices than the actual practice of the Saudi state. Noted Weinberg: “The language in 2016–2017 Saudi textbooks that calls for killing people who engage in adultery, anal sex, apostasy, or certain supposed acts of sorcery are not the only passages that encourage violence against those who act in a manner inconsistent with the state’s vision of Islam.”



Unsurprisingly, Saudi materials are used around the world in madrassas/​schools operated by Riyadh. The textbooks also end up in facilities run by others. Particularly striking is the fact, noted earlier, that the Islamic State used Saudi textbooks. In July Weinberg testified before Congress: “Much like those books recommended, the Islamic State executed numerous individuals on suspicion of homosexuality, insulting Allah or the Prophet Muhammad, adultery, or purported sorcery.” Even many mosques _in the U.S._ use Saudi materials.



Saudi authorities respond to Western criticism contending that they have cleaned up the textbooks. There have been changes, but with only limited substantive effect. Weinberg reported that “as the author of the most recent published study on incitement remaining in Saudi textbooks today, I can vouch that over a decade later Riyadh _still_ has not persuasively shown that this problem has been resolved.” As the Washington Institute summarized the issue: “Saudi high school‐​level textbooks continue to feature much inciteful language, promote intolerance, vilify non‐​Sunni Muslims (including forbidding friendship with ‘infidels’), and spout vile anti‐​Semitism.”



Riyadh’s lavish support for the otherwise marginal Islamic thought has radicalized Muslims globally. Argued Thomas Hegghammer, a Norwegian terrorism specialist, the Saudis have hindered the sort of moderating evolution seen in Christianity, most notably the Reformation and Second Vatican Council: “If there ever was going to be an Islamic reformation in the 20th Century, the Saudis probably prevented it by pumping out literalism.”



Max Singer of the Hudson Institute argued that Riyadh “drastically increased the size of the radical Muslim population.” Farah Pandith, who visited 80 nations while serving as the State Department’s special representative to Muslims, said, “In each place I visited, the Wahhabi influence was an insidious presence.” The impact varies by country and region. Scott Shane of the _New York Times_ reported that the KSA’s influence was most harmful “in divided countries like Pakistan and Nigeria,” where “the flood of Saudi money, and the ideology it promotes, have exacerbated divisions over religion that regularly prove lethal.”



Admittedly, Wahhabism’s relationship with terrorism remains indirect. It essentially is a theology of hate and intolerance, or what the group Freedom House called an “ideology of religious hatred.” Unfortunately, if you don’t believe other people should be treated with dignity and respect, you are more likely to eventually view them as deserving death.



The American Enterprise Institute’s Katherine Zimmerman classified Wahhabi‐​Salafist toward the violent jihadist end of the Sunni Islamic spectrum. She explained:



The Salafi‐​jihadi movement — not simply distinct groups or individuals — threatens the United States, the West, and Muslim communities. The movement draws strength from its ideology, which helps to unify and band together a network of individuals, groups, and organizations seeking a shared global outcome: destruction of current Muslim societies through the use of force and creation of what they regard as a true Islamic society. This network is the Salafi‐​jihadi base and constitutes the primary source of strength for al Qaeda and ISIS. New groups would form from the movement if the existing ones are ever destroyed.



The consequences have been grave. The ICRD warned: “A number of violent extremists around the world have reported that their radicalization first began when they were exposed to Salafist literature or websites.” Manas Sen Gupta of the website TopYaps contended that “al Nusra, Boko Haram and nearly every single barbaric Islamic terrorist group” adhere to Wahhabism.



Unfortunately, many Wahhabist extremists feel impelled to act. Saudi‐​born Madawi al‐​Rashid, then a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, noted that Wahhabism “can be a revolutionary language that would inspire someone to commit atrocities in the name of Islam.” Complained Sen Gupta: “The Wahhabi doctrine will keep on creating terrorists who will keep on killing innocents. It is that doctrine which the fundamentalists use to kill Shias, Christians, Hindus” and others.



More than individuals are at risk. The Islamic Supreme Council of America pointed to the rise of Wahhabism in Central Asia: “Should this radicalized understanding of Islam continue to spread unchecked, radical interpretations could threaten social stability at the local, national, and regional levels and create serious geopolitical dangers to which neighboring powers, as well as the U.S. and Europe, would have to react.” The same applies elsewhere in the world.



Washington long pressed the KSA to cut its support for radical Islamism, but the royals have rarely yielded to Washington on matters involving religion. President Trump claims to be tougher than his predecessors. If so, he should challenge Riyadh’s backing for Wahhabism, which threatens his administration’s agenda. Warned the ICRD: “A failure by Saudi Arabia to thoroughly reform its educational system will directly undermine U.S. foreign policy goals of encouraging moderation and democratic progress within the Islamic world.”



Weinberg makes a similar argument: “addressing incitement in Saudi Arabia, including in textbooks, is a serious national security issue. Saudi society has been a top source of foreign terrorist fighters — and at times, terrorist leaders.” As long as the KSA creates fertile ground for Islamic extremism, America is likely to find terrorists being created faster than they are being killed.



Other nations also have promoted Islamist fundamentalism and intolerance, but Riyadh’s role stands out. Of course, there are other sources of intolerance, which does not inexorably lead to murder or terrorism. Nevertheless, the flood of KSA money promoting Wahhabism has acted as an accelerant, encouraging new violent outbursts and spreading old conflicts around the globe.



Indeed, Riyadh’s malign campaign may help explain why the more effort the U.S. puts into fighting extremist forces abroad, the more violent radicals Washington appears to face. It is essential that America make fewer enemies abroad. Part of that is convincing Washington’s supposed allies to stop spreading hate around the globe. A good place to start would be to insist that the KSA keep its Wahhabist evangelists at home.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
A recent post by Anthony Watts highlighted a curious fact. This is that records of some two and a half million oceanic pH samples existed, but weren’t used in testimony before Congress about ocean pH. The post was accompanied by a graph which purported to show a historical variation in ocean pH.
I was unimpressed by the graph in that post, which seemed simplistic and, well, in a word, wrong. But on the other hand, I certainly found it bizarre and most interesting that someone would throw out that huge amount of scientific data. That was the reason I forwarded it to Anthony, in the hope of unraveling the actual truth of the matter.
So … as is my wont, I’ve now taken a look at the data myself, albeit at the moment a very preliminary look. The data was conveniently provided by a WUWT commenter in .csv format here, my compliments to him for the collation. He also has a good explanation of the process, along with R code. Note that there has been no quality control on the data. About 2% of the surface pH values are well outside the range of oceanic pH, and I removed them before looking further at the data.
Now, the first question I asked was, where were the samples taken? The problem with the graph in the recent post linked to above is that it lumps together samples taken in various parts of the planet. And unless the sampling is uniform in time and space, this is a Very Bad Idea™.
So I made a map that shows where each surface sample was taken. For simplicity, and because this was my first cut, I restricted myself to those samples with a depth of 0 (right at the surface), which are a bit less than a tenth of the total samples. Here are two different views of the same location data.
 
Figures 1a and 1b. Two views of the location of the surface samples of the global pH dataset, centered on the Pacific and the Atlantic. In some regions you can see the tracks of the oceanographic expedition  vessels quite clearly.
Now, I must confess that this was a surprise to me. I hadn’t expected the concentration of samples around Japan, it appears the Japanese oceanographers mush have been quite busy. And I also hadn’t expected the high sample density in the Baltic Sea and the other enclosed seas (the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia, and the Caspian Sea to its right).
Finally, here are the average pH values by gridcell, for the entire period of record
Figure 2. Average values of pH by gridcell in the record.
Now, you can see from these maps that we cannot simply put all of that data into a single box and extract a timeline from it.
So … was there “pHraud” in not utilizing this data? I say no, there was no fraud. I say this in part because it’s so difficult to infer intent. Because I have been falsely accused of having bad intent a number of times, I’m sensitive on the subject. I dislike accusations without evidence, and I see no evidence of fraud in this case.
However, it is a huge scientific resource, two million plus pH samples taken by oceanographers over decades, and not using it without some solid scientific reason for ignoring it just doesn’t work for me. What I suspect has happened is that the mass and complexity of the data was too overwhelming, and so the investigators simply put it into the “Too Hard” pile. But that’s just speculation, the real reason may be entirely different. Regardless of the reason, I do think that the authors should have explained their omission.
In any case, that’s the story so far. It certainly appears to me that there is plenty of data there for meaningful time series extractions in some areas. There are, for example, about 400 1°x1° gridcells that have more than a hundred observations per gridcell, and groups of nearby gridcell cells combined have much more data. The North Atlantic and the oceanic area off of Japan seem like they would have more than adequate data for time series extraction.
I may or may not do any followup on this dataset, but I invite readers to use the data for their own analyses.

"MA’ALE ADUMIM, West Bank  —   The first babies of Ma’ale Adumim, a hilly city on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem, are now  . A cemetery finally opened last year, and 40 residents are buried there, most dead of natural causes after long and peaceful lives. That is to say, there is nothing temporary about this place, one of the closest settlements to Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan 50 years ago. “It’s part of Jerusalem,” said Sima Weiss, 58, who has lived here 30 years, raised three children and works a cleaning job just 20 minutes away by bus in the holy city proper. “I don’t feel like a settler. ” The world has focused more critically recently on Israel’s settlements in occupied territory, after last month’s United Nations declaration  —   which the United States tacitly supported  —   that they are killing the dream of one state for Jews, one for Palestinians. Many Israelis argue that Ma’ale Adumim  —   a city of 41, 000 with filled schools, a largely secular civic pride and skittish stray cats  —   is a special case: Its closeness to Jerusalem has put it near the top of the list of settlements Israelis say they could swap for other land in a peace deal. Yet Ma’ale Adumim has become a flash point of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.   politicians, emboldened by a more sympathetic Trump administration, want to annex it to Israel proper  —   the first formal annexation of a settlement. Supporters of the move argue that in the long absence of negotiations, Israel cannot stand still, and Ma’ale Adumim would likely be a part of Israel in any case. “Clearly it’s time for a quantum change,” Naftali Bennett, the education minister, who plans to introduce the annexation bill, said in an interview. “The incremental approach has not worked. We have to understand it’s a new reality. We have to go big, bold and fast. ” The Parliament seems poised to approve a law that few thought had any chance of passage just a few months ago: It would ultimately legalize settlement homes built illegally on private Palestinian land. Critics call this yet another form of creeping annexation. Many Palestinians agree this is a critical moment. They fear Ma’ale Adumim will be just the beginning of the annexation of settlements in the West Bank, now home to roughly 400, 000 Jews, and the end of the   dream. “We believe in two states for two nations, but if they took that”  —   Ma’ale Adumim  —   “there will be no longer two states,” said Yousef Mostafa Mkhemer, chairman of the Organization of Jerusalem Steadfastness, which focuses on issues like Muslim holy sites, refugee camps and Israeli settlements. “There will be one state called Israel. ” Many Palestinians and peace activists argue that the line has already been crossed  —   that any annexation of Ma’ale Adumim, after so many years, would be a technicality. “We are living in one state now,” said Ziad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian lawyer and writer. Mr. Zayyad, a former Palestinian minister, said that unlike most Palestinians he supported Donald J. Trump for president, in part because he felt his apparently greater sympathy for Israel would begin to provide a clarity to a   conflict. “I want to see a change,” he said. “I’m fed up. ” “He could be a big devil. He could be something good. My point is he will make a change, for the good or for the bad. ” There are signs, in fact, that the conflict here is already shifting, with Ma’ale Adumim near the center, no matter how quiet and workaday its residents think themselves (70 percent of residents commute to Jerusalem proper for their jobs). After eight years of little building, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just allotted 100 new building units to Ma’ale Adumim, part of 2, 500 new proposed housing units around the West Bank settlements, and another 560 in East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyanu has proclaimed this as just the beginning of a new wave of building. Less than a month after the United Nations resolution, the city’s mayor, Benny Kashriel, and another settlement leader proudly attended Mr. Trump’s inauguration. That would have been unthinkable for past incoming American presidents, out of fear it could be interpreted as an endorsement of settlements, which most of the world considers illegal. “It’s a different policy,” Mr. Kashriel, mayor for 25 years, said just a day back from Washington. He believes that the new administration sees places like Ma’ale Adumim more benignly than did former President Barack Obama, whose administration blocked much building here and in the nearby E1, an especially contentious area closer to Jerusalem. “We didn’t steal the land from anybody,” he said. “It was built on empty hills. You can see there  —   the desert, rocks and sand. Now you have a living city. ” Much of the outside world’s attention has focused on more religious settlements deeper into the West Bank or on land with Palestinian titles in more direct conflict with Palestinians. But here, scrutiny has been intense on Ma’ale Adumim. It is partly symbolic: Israel has not annexed 1967 land beyond East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Opponents of the move fear it would be the start of a process that would not end until politicians like Mr. Bennett achieved their dreams of annexing large swaths of the West Bank and leaving the Palestinians with what Mr. Netanyahu recently called “a  . ” It is partly strategic: The settlement is at the heart of entrenched plans to expand Jerusalem, linking it to the city proper, along with other nearby settlements that also function in practice as Jerusalem suburbs. One issue with Ma’ale Adumim, critics argue, is its place in the West Bank, between north and south, that combined with other building plans could both hamper transit of Palestinians and threaten the contiguous borders of any future Palestinian state. The area is also not as empty as Ma’ale Adumim’s supporters say. Eid Abu Khamis, the leader of some 8, 000 Bedouins in the area, says harassment by Israel has increased recently. More of their makeshift housing has been torn down and land for their goats and sheep  —   they sell meat, yogurt and cheese to survive  —   declared  . Most of the Bedouins live in the E1 area, which is technically a part of Ma’ale Adumim and is slated for some 3, 700 new housing units. The Obama administration staunchly opposed any development in E1 as a possible point of no return for a viable Palestinian state. “If the Bedouin are kicked out of this land where we have lived for 30 years, it will be the end of negotiations with the State of Israel,” Mr. Khamis said. Many Palestinians argue that the annexation could ignite another round of violent revolt. A Palestinian flag was recently planted in a park in Ma’ale Adumim here, a worrying sign for residents that the less expensive, less harried life in their suburb may change. “I didn’t come because I believe we should take all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River,” said a    resident, a driver who would give his name only as Max S. “It was cheap. That’s why I came. If I could change my apartment to an apartment in Tel Aviv, in a minute I would do it. “ People here are proud of what they have built since it was founded in 1975, with 15 religious Jews. There is a library, a theater, 15 schools and 78 kindergartens. It is mostly secular, but gets along with its more religious residents, about a quarter of the population. An industrial park, while the occasional target of the worldwide campaign to boycott goods made in settlements, is thriving and employs some 4, 000 Palestinians  —   at much higher wages, the mayor notes, than they could earn in Palestinian areas. Ronit Jackov, 55, who works in the local mall (which is getting a new floor with five cinemas) said she favored annexation, largely so the city can begin to grow again after years of a building freeze. She said she would never move back to Jerusalem, in part because the city has become too religious and rigid. “I’m not comfortable in a place where people tell you how to live,” she said. “People want to live their lives. ” And she places much hope in Mr. Trump, that he will side more forcefully with Israelis. “I’m not a very political person,” she said. “But I’m waiting for him to carry out what he said, and I’ll say, ‘You are great.’ Because the whole world is against us. We need someone on our side. ”"
"There are already many countries where the scarcity of water affects people’s lives. While water for drinking may be first to come to mind, as agriculture is the largest use of water worldwide water scarcity first and foremost is a threat to food supply. And as many industrial processes rely on water availability, it also hampers economic development.  In the simplest sense, water scarcity is supply falling short of demand. Demand for freshwater will increase in most regions of the world due to population growth. Between eight and ten billion people are expected to live on Earth in 2050, as opposed to six billion today. But as for supply, water resources will be affected by projected climate changes due to unabated greenhouse gas emissions, for instance through changes in the amount, pattern and timing of rainfall and evaporation. While rising demand is hard to end, climate change could still be contained. This is why our study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, tried to identify the relative impact of climate change on water scarcity. The effect turned out to be substantial. Assembled by an international team of researchers, simulations using a large range of hydrological models suggest climate change is likely to put about 40% more people at risk of absolute water scarcity than would be the case without climate change. This is not a far-off future. The steepest increase of global water scarcity might happen before global warming reaches 3°C above pre-industrial levels. Which means the internationally adopted target of limiting warming to 2°C is very relevant to global water resources. But as the world seems largely set on “business as usual”, we are set to burst through that 2°C limit within a few decades. Today, between one and two people out of a hundred live in countries with absolute water scarcity. Allowing for a 3°C rise in temperature and rising population, this could increase to ten in a hundred. Absolute water scarcity is defined as less than 500m3 per person, per year. Some industrialised countries can cope with such a small amount through advanced water management and processing techniques. But in many others, the necessary infrastructure simply isn’t there, and absolute water scarcity puts lives and livelihoods at risk. The impact of climate change is not uniform across the world, and there will be large differences from region to region. For example, the Mediterranean, Middle East, the southern states of North America, and southern China will very probably experience a pronounced drop in available water. In contrast, Southern India, western China and parts of Eastern Africa may see substantial increases in average water resources from increasingly tropical, wet weather. This could be beneficial if the extra water comes at the right time and if the means to use and manage it is in place. If not, it may just add to problems from water-logging, flooding, and causing sewage and drain systems to fail – something that happens regularly in Europe even now. The overall risks are thus growing along with the rapid changes in the global water cycle.  And these changes are still far from completely understood. Our study is part of an unprecedented worldwide scientific effort to more systematically assess the impact of climate change. We used a suite of hydrological models, fed with different future climate scenarios. But all these models show a similar trend; while the numbers differ, reflecting the underlying assumptions, water is increasingly scarce. Evaluating the differences between the model simulations will help us better understand what lies ahead. "
"We are losing our large carnivores. In ecosystems around the world, the decline of large predators such as lions, bears, dingoes, wolves, and otters is changing landscapes, from the tropics to the Arctic. Habitat loss, persecution by humans and loss of prey have combined to inflict great losses on these populations. In fact more than 75% of the 31 largest carnivore species are declining, and 17 species now occupy less than half their former ranges. Southeast Asia, southern and East Africa, and the Amazon are among areas in which multiple large carnivore species are declining. And with only a few exceptions, large carnivores have already been exterminated from much of the developed world, including areas of Western Europe, and the eastern United States. Many of these large carnivore species are endangered and some are at risk of extinction, either in specific regions or entirely. Ironically, they are vanishing just as we are learning about their important ecological effects, which is what led us to write a new paper in the journal Science to document their role.  From a review of published reports, we singled out seven species that have been studied for their important ecological role and widespread effects, known as trophic cascades. These are the African lion, leopard, Eurasian lynx, cougar, gray wolf, sea otter and dingo. Based on field research, my Oregon State University co-author Robert Beschta and I documented the impact of cougars and wolves on the regeneration of forest tree stands and riverside vegetation in Yellowstone and other national parks in western North America. Fewer predators, we found, lead to an increase in browsing animals such as deer and elk. More browsing disrupts vegetation, reduces birds and some mammals and changes other parts of the ecosystem. From the actions of the top predator, widespread impacts cascade down the food chain. Similar effects were found in studies of Eurasian lynx, dingoes, lions and sea otters. For example in Europe, absence of lynx has been closely tied to the abundance of roe deer, red fox and hare. In Australia, the construction of a 3,400-mile dingo-proof fence has enabled scientists to study ecosystems with and without dingoes which are closely related to gray wolves. They found that dingoes control populations of herbivores and exotic red foxes. The suppression of these species by dingoes reduces predation pressure, benefiting plants and smaller native prey.  In some parts of Africa, the decrease of lions and leopards has coincided with a dramatic increase in olive baboons, which threaten crops and livestock. In the waters off southeast Alaska, a decline in sea otters through killer whale predation has led to a rise in sea urchins and loss of kelp beds.  We are now obtaining a deeper appreciation of the impact of large carnivores on ecosystems, a view that can be traced back to the work of landmark ecologist Aldo Leopold. The perception that predators are harmful and deplete fish and wildlife is outdated. Many scientists and wildlife managers now recognise the growing evidence of carnivores’ complex role in ecosystems, and their social and economic benefits. Leopold recognised these relationships, but his observations were ignored for decades after his death in 1948. Human tolerance of these species is the major issue. Most would agree these animals have an intrinsic right to exist, but additionally they provide economic and ecological services that people value. Among the services documented in other studies are carbon sequestration, restoration of riverside ecosystems, biodiversity and disease control. For example, wolves may limit large herbivore populations, thus decreasing browsing on young trees that sequester carbon when they escape browsing and grow taller. Where large carnivore populations have been restored – such as wolves in Yellowstone or Eurasian lynx in Finland – ecosystems appear to be bouncing back. I am impressed with how resilient the Yellowstone ecosystem is, and while ecosystem restoration isn’t happening quickly everywhere in this park, it has started. In some cases where vegetation loss has led to soil erosion, for example, full restoration may not be possible in the near term. What is certain is that ecosystems and the elements of them are highly interconnected. The work at Yellowstone and other places shows how species affect each another through different pathways. It’s humbling as a scientist to witness this interconnectedness of nature. My co-authors and I have called for an international initiative to conserve large carnivores in co-existence with people. This effort could be modelled after a couple of other successful efforts including  the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe, a non-profit scientific group affiliated with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and the Global Tiger Initiative which involves all 13 of the tiger-range countries. With more tolerance by humans, we might be able to avoid extinctions. The world would be a scary place without these predators."
"Northern Ireland is to be left out of the UK’s green car emission restrictions from 1 January, resulting in “Great Britain-only” regulations for carmakers. A quirk in the regulations means that cars sold in Northern Ireland will count as EU sales for strict new carbon dioxide emission limits. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK and the EU have agreed a special status in an effort to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Indications that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from England, Scotland and Wales are politically sensitive because of the support of many prominent unionist politicians for Brexit. However, the protocol means that many EU regulations will remain in place in Northern Ireland after 1 January, regardless of the outcome of trade negotiations between the UK and the EU. Those regulations include those limiting CO2 emissions from cars. All major carmakers who sell cars in the EU must reduce their average carbon emissions to below 95g per kilometre over the course of 2020 and 2021, and the UK has pledged rules that are at least as stringent. Carmakers who do not meet individual targets face fines worth potentially hundreds of millions of euros, with equivalent penalties in sterling in the UK. A government consultation published this month revealed that Northern Ireland will count as a member of the EU for the purposes of working out average emissions, to avoid the possibility of a car being double-counted. The consultation paper said: “Newly registered vehicles in Northern Ireland from 1 January 2021 will continue to be the subject of the EU regulation. The retained version of the regulation, and the subject of this consultation, will apply in Great Britain only.” The effect of the new regulations on businesses and consumers is highly uncertain, given potential variation in consumer demand for different models and individual carmakers’ different circumstances, but the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK car lobby group, has previously warned that carmakers may pull larger cars from UK sale to avoid fines. The Department for Transport declined to comment."
"It’s been nearly 30 years since the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica, and the realisation that chlorine, in the form of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, was the chemical culprit behind the depletion of the ozone layer. While the Montreal Protocol and its amendments severely restricted production of CFCs from 1996, they have very long atmospheric lifetimes, and are still abundant high in the stratosphere even though they have been regulated in developed countries for almost 20 years. Our recent studies have examined the latest satellite observations and meteorological data to look for signs of improvement in ozone levels, to see how factors such as wind and temperatures affect the hole, and judge what impact the Montreal Protocol has had on Antarctic ozone. The hole is a seasonal depletion of most of the stratospheric ozone over Antarctica. The drop to low levels begins in August and reaches a maximum between September and October – the southern hemisphere’s spring. This occurs because the extremely low temperatures during the Antarctic winter between June and August allow ice clouds to form in the stratosphere. The chemical reactions that occur on the ice particles process the chlorine into a reactive form that destroys ozone. Those reactions only end when all the ozone is destroyed, or when the air warms with the changing seasons and mixes with air from lower latitudes. The hole is gone by late spring or early summer, and ozone levels return to near normal, as can be seen from the Ozone Hole Watch website. Space-based ozone measurements have been made nearly every day since 1979. Scientists use column measurements to assess the depth and area of the ozone hole. An ozone column, measured in Dobson Units, is the total amount of ozone in the atmosphere above a point on the earth’s surface. The “hole” is defined as the area where ozone measures less than 220 Dobson Units. In the 1980s, the fast growth of CFC emissions saw the ozone hole increase in size rapidly. Although stratospheric chlorine levels kept increasing until 2000, by the early 1990s they had already reached the levels necessary to destroy virtually 100% of the ozone over the Antarctic, and the hole’s growth levelled off. Since reaching this saturation point, the hole’s size has been controlled by temperature. Warmer winters have fewer stratospheric ice clouds and deplete less ozone, colder winters have more clouds and deplete more. But simply measuring the total ozone in a column over one area has limitations – it doesn’t reveal the complexity of how ozone levels are affected by chemistry or weather at different altitudes. New measuring instruments like the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Suomi Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) allow us to look inside the ozone hole and measure the distribution of ozone and other important gases, which gives a more accurate indication of how severe the loss of ozone is.  How high ozone levels are in early winter, before depletion occurs, affects how low the ozone column will be in October. If Antarctic ozone levels are lower than usual at the start of winter, for example due to the variability of stratospheric winds, then it can end lower than usual. For example, in 2011 the ozone hole was nearly as deep and large as 2006, the largest recorded hole on record. But there was less overall ozone depletion in 2011 because there was less ozone to start with. So despite there being quite a lot less chlorine in the atmosphere that year, it was still enough to destroy nearly all the ozone. A smaller hole doesn’t mean recovery. In 2012, the Antarctic ozone hole was the second smallest since the early 1990s. The ozone vertical profiles measured by OMPS in the centre of the hole showed severe depletion in the lower stratosphere (below 22km) starting from mid-September. What does this tell us? It means that the area is still sufficiently saturated in chlorine to destroy nearly all the ozone. OMPS readings also show that ozone above 22km increased in October 2012, due to winds. Viewed as a column, the higher ozone levels above 22km masks the lack of ozone below, which gives the false impression that the overall ozone depletion is less severe than it actually is. Observations from the MLS of trace gases such as nitrous oxide inside the ozone hole indicate that chlorine levels vary more than we expected from the Montreal Protocol. These are caused by year-to-year variations in stratospheric winds, and can be 5-10 times larger than the expected annual decline. So it seems the road to recovery will be bumpy. As chlorine levels gradually drop, wind variations in some years will produce a big enough downward slump in chlorine to reduce the size and severity of the ozone hole. But in other years, wind variations may produce an upward bump in chlorine, and if it’s cold as well, the ozone hole will be large and deep. While this could last until the 2030s, beyond then ozone levels should consistently increase and the hole should be consistently smaller than it is today, setting us on a path to recovery by about 2070, give or take a decade."

Guest essay by William M. Briggs, statistician. Reposted from his blog wmbriggs.com



A very odd thing happened in Science. Turns out a famous weatherman has been forecasting highs in the 60s then 70s for New York City all winter long. But the temperature never rose above the single digits, teens, twenties, and thirties.
One day a writer at the New York Post wrote an article telling people not to trust the weatherman, who, it turned out, had issued a prediction for the following day for a “High of 80!”
Climatologists stationed at NASA on the Upper West Side were incensed that a non-scientist would interfere with Science. So the climatologists spoke with the weatherman, who said he was basing his predictions on a sophisticated computer model. The weatherman admitted his difficulties, but said his model would have performed great if only he had better measures of surface snow cover.
This reasoning wholly convinced the climatologists who held a press conference at which they insisted, “Whoever disagrees with this weatherman is a science denier. The weatherman is using a sophisticated computer model, which can only get better since we have provided the weatherman with New & Improved! measures of surface snow cover.”
Cowed, the press skittered away, went home and put on their shorts to await the promised warmth. But the next day the high was only 16oF. And for the next week it was bitterly cold, yet the weatherman went on predicting a heatwave. This raised eyebrows, but since nobody wanted to be called a denier, they didn’t insist the weatherman was wrong.
The climatologists suspected, however, that something wasn’t quite right. So they called another meeting with the weatherman. He admitted he had incorporated the New & Improved! surface snow cover measurements, but that hadn’t helped much. And besides, there wasn’t anything wrong after all. The model was still great—better than great—but it was natural variability that was to blame for the wayward observations. “Nobody,” he said, “Can anticipate natural variability.”
Again, the climatologists were convinced by this argument and they called another press conference. “The model this weatherman is using is correct,” they said. “It is really a quite excellent model. But natural variability interfered with observations.”
A man in the audience, a non-tenured engineering professor, was perplexed. He was bold enough to ask, “But that doesn’t make any sense. Natural variability is what the weather is. What you’re really saying is that the model does a poor job of representing the weather.”
“That is false,” the climatologists said. “The model is terrific. From whom do you receive your funding?”
The engineering professor said, “Well, partly from a company that manufactures a specialized product. But what does that matter? Your model said the temperature would be high and instead it was low. That can only mean the model is wrong.”
Now the engineering professor didn’t know it, but his Dean was watching the press conference. The Dean was embarrassed that he had a science denier in his department and the next day he moved to have the young professor terminated. A reporter (shivering like mad and dressed in a t-shirt) heard about the firing and asked the climatologists for their opinion.
“That this man was fired is proof of his incompetence. He wasn’t even a meteorologist. He obviously had a conflict of interest by receiving money from companies that might benefit from his work. This proves the model the weatherman is using is a good one.” And the reporter believed.
Meanwhile, a team of scientists argued that the model didn’t work and they offered a suggestion why it might be busted. They published their thoughts in a science journal, which caught the attention of the small fraction of the public who were tired of having to wear skimpy clothes in frigid temperatures merely to prove they were not science deniers.
The climatologists quickly called another conference to assure the public that all was well in hand. “The team’s suggestion of why the weatherman’s model is broken can’t possibly be right. Therefore the weatherman’s model must be a good one. Only science deniers can deny this.”
The weatherman continued predicting hot air, but only cold air was to be seen. Some in the public grumbled louder. So the climatologists contacted the state authorities. The governor and state legislature were brought in, as were educational, union, and business leaders. All begin promoting the climatologists’ message that the weatherman was right and the weather wrong. The president of the United States eventually came to the rescue with an official list of Science Deniers. He said that those who love Science should “go after” the deniers.
Which they did. And then everybody died of pneumonia.

The debate over tariffs has mostly emphasized their impact on economic growth and jobs, which overlooks specific stories of suffering caused by President Donald Trump’s trade war.





These companies have been forced to take cost‐​cutting measures such as laying off employees or forgoing expansion.



Below are more than 200 examples of the damage done by Trump’s tariffs, aggregated with Republicans Fighting Tariffs. The victims and their stories differ, but the catalyst is the same.



Businesses of all sizes have seen their input costs rise because of tariffs. To maintain already slim profit margins, many of these businesses have no choice but to raise prices. Call this the “Trump tax.”



But not all businesses can offset tariff costs through price increases, because their customers are price sensitive and will simply take their business to a foreign competitor. These companies have been forced to take cost‐​cutting measures such as laying off employees or forgoing expansion.



Then there are the countless farmers and exporters who have seen their markets dry up as trading partners impose retaliatory tariffs.



As Bob Woodward’s new book reveals, Trump believes that “trade is bad.” The president has tweeted that “trade wars are good and easy to win.” These businesses, whose numbers will grow exponentially if Trump follows through on new tariff threats, would beg to differ.

Note the step change. At about 1960, the uncertainty levels plummet, meaning BEST is claiming we became more than twice as certain of our temperature estimates practically overnight.
Brandon Shollenberger writes in with this little gem:
I thought you might be interested in a couple posts I wrote discussing some odd problems with the BEST temperature record.  You can find them here:
http://www.hi-izuru.org/wp_blog/2015/01/how-best-overestimates-its-certainty-part-2/
http://www.hi-izuru.org/wp_blog/2015/01/how-best-overestimates-its-certainty-part-1/
But I’ll give an overview.  BEST calculated its uncertainty levels by removing 1/8th of its data and rerunning its averaging calculations (then examining the variance in the results).  I’ve highlighted two problems I haven’t seen people discuss before.  If you’re familiar with the  Marcott et al reconstruction’s inappropriate confidence intervals, some of this may sound familiar.
First, BEST only reruns its averaging calculations to determine its uncertainty.  It does not rerun its breakpoint calculations.  As you may know, BEST breaks data from temperature stations into segments when it finds what it believes to be a “breakpoint.”  The primary way it looks for these breakpoints is by comparing stations to other stations located nearby.  If a station seems too different from its neighbors, it will be broken into segments which can then be realigned.  This is a form of homogenization, a process whereby stations in the dataset are made to be more similar to one another.
This process is not repeated when BEST does its uncertainty calculations.  The full data set is homogenized, and subsets of that homogenized data set are compared to determine how much variance there is.  This is inappropriate.  The amount of variance BEST finds within a homogenized data set does not tell us how much variance there is in BEST’s data.  It only tells us how much variance there is once BEST is finished homogenizing the data.
Second, to determine how much variance there is in its (homogenized) data set, BEST reruns its calculations with 1/8th the data removed, eight times.  This produces eight different series.  When comparing these different series, BEST realigns them so they all share the same baseline.  The baseline period BEST uses for its alignment is 1960-2010.
This is a problem.  By aligning the eight series on the 1960-2010 period, BEST artificially deflates the variance between those series in the 1960-2010 period (and artificially inflates the variance elsewhere).  That makes it appear there is more certainty in the recent portion of the BEST record than there actually is.  The result is there is an artificial step change in BEST uncertainty levels at ~1960.  This is the same problem demonstrated for the Marcott et al temperature record (see here).
All told, BEST’s uncertainty levels are a complete mess.  They are impossible to interpret in any meaningful way, and they certainly cannot be used to try to determine which years may or may not have been the hottest.

"**Facebook's Oversight Board has chosen its first batch of cases to review.**
All involve decisions originally made by the platform to remove user content.
They include images of female breasts in a post about breast cancer, and an image of a dead child alongside text about whether retaliation was justified against China for its treatment of Uighur Muslims.
The board said Facebook users had submitted 20,000 suggested incidents for review since October 2020.
The arbitration body is inviting the public to comment on the cases - which have all been anonymised - over the next seven days.
If it opts to overrule or alter Facebook's original actions, the firm must both publicly respond and comply.
""Facebook has to follow our decision. And that means if they have taken content down, they have to put it back up. But they also have to use this as a guideline for other similar cases,"" said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, former Prime Minister of Denmark and an Oversight Board member.
She told the BBC the cases had come from around the world and were chosen to ""raise questions"" about Facebook's policies on hate speech, nudity, dangerous organisations and violence.
The board has not given a date to share its conclusions, but Facebook has previously said it expects cases to be resolved within 90 days, including any action it is told to take.
The six cases are:"
"**If you follow US tech, you're probably getting a sense of deja vu.**
Senators are about to grill Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.
It's only three weeks since both chief executives testified. But since then the political landscape has wildly altered.
It is Democrat voices now, not Republicans, that arguably pose the greatest threat and will be listened to more closely.
In particular that of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee - though it's not confirmed whether she'll participate.
After the election, there were fears that social media might fan the flames of chaos, and lead to riots on the streets.
Although there were scuffles in Washington on Saturday night, mass unrest has not materialised. Collective sighs of relief have been heard around Silicon Valley. The world - so far - hasn't imploded.
But fake news and misinformation around the vote have been rife on both platforms.
Twitter and Facebook have labelled misleading content with varying degrees of success.
That has put them once again on a collision course with President Trump.
Howls of discontent from Republican voices greeted Twitter's repeated labelling of his tweets.
Many Republicans are now pushing for people to dump Twitter in exchange for Parler - a ""free speech"" version of the app.
But there's only so much you can do if Twitter decides to suppress, take down and/or label a tweet.
You can complain to Twitter or leave the platform, but ultimately Twitter decides what action to take. Twitter owns the platform. If you don't like the rules, too bad.
The same goes for Facebook.
That's why Republican senators see this as an opportunity to grill Zuckerberg and Dorsey - their first chance since the election - and to blow off some steam.
But the two CEOs will be aware it's Joe Biden they must now please.
Facebook, in particular, has already been the focus of anger from the President-elect's aides.
Last week, one of Mr Biden's senior advisers attacked Facebook over its handling of conspiracy theories and calls to violence in the days following the US election.
""Our democracy is on the line. We need answers,"" tweeted Bill Russo, who is deputy press secretary to the US president-elect.
Joe Biden has said previously that he would repeal Section 230 - the law that protects social media companies from being sued for the things people post.
In October, Democratic legislators penned a highly critical report into Big Tech. They called companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook ""monopolies"", and suggested they could be broken up.
So, this will be the first chance to gauge how the Democrats feel post-victory.
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has a long history with Big Tech.
As state Attorney General in California, she was seen in Silicon Valley as a straight shooter.
It will be interesting to see whether she decides to take this opportunity to put Zuckerberg under pressure.
Other Democratic senators may also see this as a chance to wave their credentials, and audition for cabinet.
For example, Senator Amy Klobuchar has been tipped by some as Biden's pick for attorney general. She's already suggested that Google should be split up.
And Senator Chris Coons - also in the running for a top job - is one of several senators to put their name to a letter on Monday criticising the social network for its response to anti-Muslim content on the platform.
Get ready to hear a lot about how these two companies aren't doing enough to take down hate speech or fake news - with a special focus on Facebook.
It's likely too that Republican Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz will ask fiery questions.
But with two months left of a Republican administration, their words carry less of a threat than they did last month.
As power has shifted, so will Zuckerberg's and Dorsey's attention - this is their chance to convince the new rulers that light-touch regulation is best."

 _The_ Spin Cycle _is a reoccurring feature based upon just how much the latest weather or climate story, policy pronouncement, or simply poo-bah blather spins the truth. Statements are given a rating between 1-5 spin cycles, with less cycles meaning less spin. For a more in-depth description,_ _visit the inaugural edition_ _._   
  
**\---**   
  
The Obama Administration is involved in an all-out effort to soften the severity of blow that the U.S Supreme Court dealt the EPA’s Clean Power Plan (CPP) last week.*   
  
In the day following the Court’s ruling, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz referred to the Supreme Court’s stay as a “temporary procedural determination” and then added that “[i]t is our estimation that the inclusion of [the extensions of the renewable energy tax credits] is going to have more impact over the short term [on greenhouse gas emissions]than the Clean Power Plan.”   
  
We covered Schultz’s first statement in our _Spin Cycle_ from last week, giving it our top award of five Spinnies.   
  
Here we examine the second part of his statement, that the extension of the investment tax credit (ITC) and the production tax credit (PTC) on solar and wind power, approved by Congress last December “is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan.”   
  
On its face, we must admit this is true. Primarily because, under the CPP, the states aren’t required to begin cutting power plant emissions until 2022—far outside what we would consider “over the short term.” So, by the letter of the (now stayed) law, the CPP wouldn’t have to result in _any_ greenhouse gas reductions prior to 2022. Schultz statement lacks the proper context. Walking (instead of driving) to lunch one time next week would also produce “more impact over the short term [on greenhouse gas emissions]than the Clean Power Plan” (stayed or not).



Granted, the CPP encourages (but doesn’t require) states to begin early. Based on the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the CPP, the EPA estimates that since some states would begin early, the CPP would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about the equivalent of 75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (mmtCO2eq) by 2020. Once all states were taking part in the CPP, the annual emissions reduction estimated by the EPA grows to 240 mmtCO2 by 2025—the year that President Obama promised that the country would achieve a 26-28 percent economy-wide greenhouse gas reduction beneath 2005 emissions levels (the projected emissions reduction under the CPP grows to 376 mmtCO2eq by 2030).   
  
So how large is the expected impact of the ITC and PTC extensions (which includes a phase-out over the next five years)? The White House earlier reported:   




This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 200 million metric tons in 2020 alone, helping to ensure that the United States achieves our 2020 target to reduce emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels, and providing momentum towards our 2025 target.



In essence, the extension of the renewable tax credits acts as a jump start for the CPP. Then when the CPP fully kicks in, it will subsume the emissions reductions achieved through the tax credit extension.   
  
But if the CPP is never put into place, the impact of the renewable tax credits alone would still be identifiable—and would stand at about the same level of emission reduction as the CPP has been projected to achieve in 2025.   
  
So, when it comes down to it, it appears that through the year 2025 the ITC/PTC extension is projected by the Obama Administration to generate roughly the same greenhouse gas emission reduction as the CPP. [Note: this is not the case in the period 2025-2030 when CPP achieves ever greater emissions reductions.]   
  
If the story ended here, we’d probably be compelled to only award the Administration only perhaps 1 or 2 Spinnies (for espousing “short term” gains over zero).   
  
But this isn’t where it ends. Schultz went on to assure the gathered press that:   




“There are driving forces that will allow the United States to meet its [Paris] commitment outside of the Clean Power Plan rule,” Schultz said. “One of those main forces is the inclusion of the tax credits at the end of the 2015 budget agreement.”



This is just wrong _._ There is no way that the US will meet its Paris target “outside of the Clean Power Plan.” In fact, even with the CPP, there was little chance of meeting the president’s promised target without a whole lot of other actions that have not yet been proposed.   
  
The Administration knows well that this is the case, as it is the conclusion of a large number of independent analyses.   
  
Here is a sampling of a few of them:   




Climate Action Tracker: “The US will have to implement additional policies on top of the currently planned policies to reach its 2025 pledge, which requires a faster reduction rate than the rate before 2020.”   
  
Rhodium Group: “Reducing emissions 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 will not be possible through current and planned policies alone.”   
  
Climate Advisors: “To achieve the U.S. pledge, the next President would need to vigorously implement the Obama administration policies and propose new emission reduction measures”   
  
Niskanen Center: “’Current measures’ [which include CPP] will not get us to the 2025 target.”



If you add in the latest news about a potential (un-reported by the EPA) large positive trend in methane emissions (a powerful greenhouse gas) from the United States, the U.S. Paris target is impossible without the Clean Power Plan (lacking a major economic collapse).   
  
For making believe otherwise, and wanting all us all to buy into the charade, we award 4 Spinnies, or **Heavy Duty Spin Cycle** to the White House and its communications team.   






**Heavy Duty**   
  
  
  
*The sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia, along with the likelihood that there will be no confirmed replacement until after the inauguration of a new president in 2017 means that the fate of the CPP will be determined at the ballot box on November 8, 2016.

"LONDON  —   Without fanfare or flourish, the   Cherry Jones has calmly established her place as one of the major stage actresses in the United States. She has won two Tony Awards, received an Emmy for her role as President Allison Taylor in “24,” and earned rave reviews both on and off Broadway. But she had appeared in just one production in Britain  —   at last year’s Edinburgh International Festival, in John Tiffany’s production of Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie. ” As Amanda Wingfield  —   a desperate single mother trying to hold on to her alienated son, Tom, and find a viable life for her disabled and shy daughter, Laura  —   Ms. Jones triumphed both in the production’s original run on Broadway in 2013 and in Edinburgh. She was “an Amanda that may someday be spoken of with the awe that surrounds Laurette Taylor’s creation of the part nearly 70 years ago,” the critic Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times after the Broadway opening. Now Mr. Tiffany (who directed the hugely successful “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” in London last year) has brought that production to the Duke of York’s Theater in London’s West End, where it opened this week. (Michael Esper and Kate O’Flynn will play Tom and Laura, with Brian J. Smith as the Gentleman Caller.) There, Ms. Jones, 60, has finally made her London debut, some 40 years after she created a folder and named it “My Career on the British Stage. ” In a Skype call from Paris, Tenn. where she grew up, Ms. Jones talked about her early desire to act, her initial resistance to the role of Amanda and her growing love for the character. Here is an edited and condensed version of the conversation: Is there any reason that you’ve never performed in the West End? No, not really. It’s strange, because I have always wanted to work in England, I didn’t care where. My mother was a teacher of English and American literature, and she lived and breathed all things British. I first went there when I was 14. My parents had saved up and we went for the most wonderful two weeks, traveling all over. Afterward, I made a folder titled “My Career on the British stage. ” So you knew very early that you wanted to act? I never wanted to do anything else. I was always creating wonderful adventures with my neighborhood friends, assigning roles to people. My family was very supportive. And it all went pretty smoothly. I never had tremendous ambition, I was just thrilled to be in a repertory company, and when I came to New York and could work Off Broadway, or get little movie roles, I would feel so fortunate. Given your Southern background, Amanda Wingfield seems like a natural role for you. But you have said in interviews that you never wanted to play her. Why? I think I had a Southern chip on my shoulder. I felt she didn’t speak to me, I didn’t know who this woman was. I auditioned for the role of Laura several times, but I was too large. Then John Tiffany and I met through a mutual friend, at the time that my sister and I were clearing our family home here in Paris, Tennessee. I was telling John about the letters from my mother that I had found, and he said: “We’re going to work together and you are going to be my Amanda. ” Once you began to study the part, how did you feel? The moment I spoke her words in a reading, I knew who she was. I had grown up with her not quite with women in her situation, but women in dire straits. I am the last generation who really remembers those Southern women they had an elegance and nobility, and a real charm and style. When I was about 10, they were in their 70s and 80s, and I was mesmerized by the way they moved and spoke. For a long time I thought “war” was spelled “wawa” because of the way they said it. And the way they smelled, a lovely light powdered smell and the slight mustiness of mothballs, and hot chocolate and cheese biscuits. It was heaven. The language too, is so spot on. Every idiom, the musicality of it, is perfect. So perhaps your resistance to playing Amanda came from that closeness? Yes, perhaps I felt protective of those women, that the play was too exposing. When I did the first reading  —   with Michael Esper, who then came to the show for Edinburgh and now again in the West End  —   he made me understand the play and the family in a way I hadn’t before. I saw the possibilities in what he did with his role the love and gentleness he had. This isn’t a family that hate each other. They love each other, and we wouldn’t care, otherwise. Then John Tiffany seemed to understand the tone of each scene so beautifully. I didn’t realize what a loving, fearless woman Amanda is. She has to push her children, cajole, charm. I have never felt a woman more determined. Perhaps Tennessee Williams was creating the fighter that he would have liked his mother to be. This will be your third run in this production. Has your interpretation changed since the first Broadway season? I think it’s just the longer you do the part, the richer the memories get. What I mean is that I have her memories I can see those carriage rides in the country, those afternoons with the gentlemen callers. And I do believe there were 17 of them, and half of them were gay! No one had any money, they had a bit of  ’s silver and bought her some cotillion dresses, and the gay boys and straight boys would come over and they would drink sherry and have a rollicking good time. Philip Roth, the novelist, said that when writing, he can get to a point when he is not creating, he is just remembering his character’s memories. It’s like that."
"**Facebook is being sued for failing to protect users' personal data in the Cambridge Analytica breach.**
The scandal involved harvested Facebook data of 87 million people being used for advertising during elections.
Mass legal action is being launched against Facebook for misuse of information from almost one million users in England and Wales.
Facebook said it has not received any documents regarding this claim.
The group taking action - Facebook You Owe Us - follows a similar mass action law suit against Google.
Google You Owe Us, led by former Which? director Richard Lloyd, is also active for another alleged mass data breach.
Both represented by law firm Millberg London, the Google case is being heard in the Supreme Court in April next year.
The Facebook case will argue that by taking data without consent, the firm failed to meet their legal obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998.
""We have not received any documents regarding this claim. The Information Commissioner's Office investigation into these issues, which included seizing and interrogating Cambridge Analytica's servers, found no evidence that any UK or EU users' data was transferred by Dr Kogan to Cambridge Analytica,"" a Facebook company spokesperson said.
In October 2018, the UK's data protection watchdog fined Facebook Â£500,000 for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said Facebook had allowed a ""serious breach"" of the law.
Facebook apologised and allowed users to check which ""banned apps"" had accessed their data.
Although there is no precedent for such a mass legal action in the UK, there is in the US.
Google agreed to pay a record $22.5m (Â£16.8m) in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on the same issue in 2012.
The company also settled out of court with a small number of British consumers.
Representative claimant in the case Alvin Carpio said: ""When we use Facebook, we expect that our personal data is being used responsibly, transparently, and legally.
""By failing to protect our personal information from abuse, we believe that Facebook broke the law.
""Paying less than 0.01% of your annual revenue in fines - pocket change to Facebook - is clearly a punishment that does not fit the crime.
""Apologising for breaking the law is simply not enough.
""Facebook, you owe us honesty, responsibility and redress.
""We will fight to hold Facebook to account."""

Only the repeatedly and retroactively falsified datasets of the NOAA/NCDC, NASA/GISS and MetOffice/Hadley/CRU tell us that the global warming continues on. The global warming “pause”has been simply calculated away….
The unaltered (unfalsified) satellite measurements of the lower global troposphere (LT) by RSS and UAH through September 2015 on the other hand show no signs of a new record year since the record year of 1998 and the El Niño year of 2010.

“Figure 1. The least-squares linear-regression trend on the RSS satellite monthly global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset shows no global warming for 18 years 8 months since February 1997, though one-third of all anthropogenic forcings have occurred during the period of the Pause.” Source: There’s life in the old Pause yet.

There is nothing concerning either a new record since 1998, nor 2010 nor 2014. This is obvious for anyone who has a healthy meteorological understanding, or…? Also see DMG: the warming trend is uninterrupted! Does nonsense have a new name…?
Even the warming number crunchers at the US NOAA show this at their monthly website, though somewhat hidden away, at www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/upper-air/201509 with a conversion calculation of the UAH und RSS datasets to the international usual 1981-2010 WMO climate mean: Here the NOAA still continues to use the warmer values of the older UAH data version www.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/uahncdc_lt_5.6.txt, even though in April 2015 a new cooler version vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0beta/tlt/uahncdc_lt_6.0beta3 has been made public…
NOAA table of satellite temperature deviations by UAH und RSS compared to the international usual WMO 1981-2010 climate mean for January to September 2015. At no. 3 and no. 5 there is no global warm record in the lower troposphere (LT) in 2015. Source: here.
Compared to the 1998 record year, 2015, so far through September, the deviation is -0.2°K. and -0.3°K at RSS, i.e. colder. The record 1998 year finished at UAH with a deviation of +0.42°K and at RSS +0.45 K. Compared to the current level of +0,30°K at UAH and +0.22°K at RSS, the last three months of this year would have to be higher every month to offset the -0.12°K at UAH and -0.23°K at RSS in order to break the record 1998 year.
Could it be that the “IPCC” does not stand for “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” but rather stands for “International Political Climate Clowns”?
It’s only a question concerning the climate circus, whose show travels the globe every year in a climate friendly and low cost manner.

In a 5–4 decision today, the Supreme Court struck down the Obama Administration EPA’s signature “Mercury and Air Toxic Rule,” which regulates emissions by fossil‐​fuel‐​fired power plants. Before regulating, EPA was obligated to decide whether regulation under one the Act’s most burdensome programs was “appropriate and necessary.” EPA interpreted that language to preclude it from considering the costs of regulation—some $10 billion per year, in exchange for $4 million or so in direct benefits. That interpretation, the Court decided, was ludicrous.   
  
  
The decision may well leave the Obama climate agenda in tatters. Why that is requires a bit of explanation. In the usual case when the Court finds a rule to be unlawful, it vacates the offending action—in other words, deprives it of legal force. But that’s not what the Court did here. Instead, it sent the case back down to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings, knowing full well that that court will follow its usual practice of “remand without vacatur”—in other words, let the agency fix any flaws in its rule while leaving the rule in place.   
  
  
This is a very big deal. The centerpiece of the Obama Administration’s climate agenda is EPA’s so‐​called “Clean Power Plan,” which aims to cut power plants’ carbon‐​dioxide emissions by around 30 percent and force the phase‐​out of coal‐​fired generation. But the statutory authority that EPA claims supports this effort explicitly carves out any regulation of facilities that are already subject to regulations like the Mercury Rule. So if the rule remains in place—as seems likely—then the Clean Power Plan should be dead in the water.   
  
  
But there’s a more subtle, and perhaps more important, reason to expect trouble ahead for the Clean Power Plan. The Supreme Court’s failure to vacate the Mercury Rule reflects its recognition that the bulk of the rule’s costs—and it was one of the most expensive government regulations ever—has already been borne by industry. So there’s no urgency, at this point, to putting the rule on hold; to the contrary, doing so would be disruptive. But the flip side is that this means utilities and their customers spent tens of billions of dollars complying with a regulation that was always unlawful. One can imagine that the Court won’t be eager for that to happen again. And one can also imagine that the Court’s decision today is a shot across the bow of the D.C. Circuit: when the next billion‐​dollar rule comes up, and there’s any legal question about EPA’s authority, **put the rule on hold so the courts have a chance to do their business**. More reading‐​between‐​the‐​lines: if you don’t, we will.   
  
  
The Clean Power Plan is expected to be finalized in late August, and challengers will ask the D.C. Circuit for a stay just as soon as they can. If that happens, the rule most likely won’t go into effect during the Obama Administration and, depending on the results of the next election, may never go forward.   
  
  
And that’s why today may be the beginning of the end of the Obama Administration’s climate agenda.
