"Ebay announced on Thursday it’s severing ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) because of the lobbying group’s views on climate change. The online marketplace is the latest technology firm to part ways with the rightwing organization over environmental concerns.  “After our annual review of eBay’s memberships in trade associations and third-party organizations, we’ve decided not to renew our membership with Alec,” an eBay spokesperson said. In September, Eric Schmidt announced Google would be leaving Alec because “they’re just literally lying” about climate change. This prompted a wave of departures from other tech companies, including Facebook and Yelp, over similar concerns. Microsoft had previously left Alec in July.  The current exodus from Alec marks a change from a previous round of departures, in which companies left Alec over concerns about its stance on “stand your ground” legislation. Environmental activists welcomed eBay’s move. “This is a major victory for those of us who have continued to pressure eBay executives to drop Alec,” said Ryan Canney, senior campaigner from the NGO Forecast the Facts. Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy, said: “[Nearly] Alec’s entire tech membership has abandoned them over climate denial.”  Remaining Alec members include tobacco, telecommunications and fossil fuel companies, prompting the question of whether Alec will move away from tech issues and focus on the interests of its remaining members.  “You have to question whether Alec will continue to even work on tech issues,” Surgey said.  Jonah Sachs, co-founder and CEO of Free Range, said that beneath the surface of the decision to leave the conservative group might be a concern over the economics of tackling climate change. “Some of these companies are having to deal with the issue of whether completely free, unregulated markets can deal with the problem of climate change,” Sachs said. Canney added: “With eBay out, we’re looking to AT&T, Verizon, FedEx and UPS to follow suit and distance themselves from Alec’s extreme climate denial agenda. If they choose to stay with Alec, we’ll be taking the issue to their customers, shareholders and employees.” Alec wasn’t immediately available to respond to requests for comment as its communications team is “home for the holidays”, according to multiple automated email replies.

"“The surreal thing was watching the swan swim up to my window,” says June King. In early February, her home was flooded. It turned the life of the self-confessed home-bird upside down, ruining her possessions and forcing nine months away in temporary accommodation. “People can’t imagine what it means.” King lives in Willow Way, a pretty cul-de-sac of bungalows, just off Thames Street, in Lower Sunbury. The river, with its high banks, flows slowly eastwards at the end of the close, where boats tie up. King was one of the thousands across the country who were flooded in last winter’s deluge. But almost a year later many of their homes remain barely habitable and stress levels remain high. Residents remain fearful that another stormy winter will bring further flooding.  Opposite King’s home, Jacqui Bryce is sitting in the only room in her bungalow that has been renovated so far. The rest of the house remains a building site. “The flood was mentally traumatic,” she says. “Everything I have worked for since I was 15 I lost. I was in tears.” Bryce’s floors are now being raised by 25cm. “It is lucky we had high ceilings,” she says. Another neighbour, Tina Kirby, remembers the evacuation. “We did 12 hours of putting stuff in bags and putting it on boats,” she says. As well as her three children, Kirby had pets to rescue, a dog, two cats, a rabbit, four chickens and a tank of fish. “Putting those on the boat was fun,” she says ruefully. But the impact of the flood lingered long after the skies had cleared and the flood water had subsided. “My daughters were doing their GCSEs and A levels, and they lost all their course work,” Kirby says. One daughter then spent months getting up at 5am in order to get the school in time from the house they had to rent. Even when they finally got back into their house and turned the heating on, the plaster on the walls started cracking. “It is not just losing your home, you lose the community around you too,” says Bryce, who has lived there for 17 years. She was forced out on the weekend of the flood. “We had to phone a friend, like refugees.” The community was subsequently scattered into rented homes and hotels across the region. Bryce was only able to return in early November. It takes months for homes to dry out, before renovation can even begin. During that time Bryce had to install CCTV to deter burglars who were seen casing empty properties in the area. But, in a small silver lining to the storm clouds that brought the floods, the Willow Way residents feel generally well served by their insurance companies. “We’ve had no complaint so far, though they were a bit overwhelmed at the beginning,” says Bryce, whose premium has not been hiked, to her relief. She is concerned, however, about whether her home’s value will have been blighted: “The house was going to be our pension.” Bryce is scornful of the promise David Cameron made at the height of the floods. “He said ‘money was no object’, but of the £5,000 ‘renew and repair’ grant, £3,500 alone will go on moving the energy meters higher. The government are not taking it seriously. They are looking at it piecemeal.” “People say you should not have bought a house near the river, but in this country you are always near a river or stream,” Bryce says, adding that the homes were already raised and had water storage space underneath. “We can only do so much ourselves.” Groundwater started rising in Willow Way in January, like a slow torture. “It had been holding us hostage for weeks: will it, won’t it?” says Kirby. But there was no warning of the final flood from the Environment Agency, the residents say, and they believe the local weirs and sluice gates hadn’t been maintained properly. They also criticise the local council. “They arrived with sandbags the day after the flood, and then the guy had no boots,” says King. The memory of the flood is not fading, says Kirby: “You spend every day it rains worrying, is the river rising?” All the residents are now improving the flood protection on their homes, including barriers and pumps, some funded by the EA. None wants to leave their homes and the lives they have built for their families in Willow Way. If there is one positive to have come out of the flood, says Bryce, it is that “we are an even stronger community than before”."
"A new global climate deal expected to be agreed in Paris at the end of this year will not be ambitious enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises, energy secretary Ed Davey has warned. Mr Davey, who admitted it was “quite likely” he would no longer be energy and climate change secretary by the UN climate talks in December, said a legally-binding treaty can be agreed at the negotiations - and would be the best way to curb global warming.  But he said he feared the talks in Paris would not secure commitments to cut emissions that would keep temperatures from rising by more than 2C, a limit which countries have agreed in a bid to prevent “dangerous” climate change. He told MPs on the parliamentary Energy and Climate Change Committee that the UK government would be seeking a legally-binding agreement from the talks. Davey added: “I think that would give the greatest boost both to confidence that we can tackle climate change and also to investors and industry and entrepreneurs to develop the technology that will be needed as we tackle this challenge. “I want a comprehensive legally-binding treaty where it wouldn’t just be the rules of the game, the accounting, monitoring, verification, all that, which are absolutely essential to be legally binding, I would like to see the commitments to be legally binding.” Davey admitted that would be difficult for countries such as the US, which would have to get legislation through both houses of Congress, and for China, which could see it as a challenge to its sovereignty. But he said: “I think we need to argue for it because it would be best.” He added that a legal deal would provide the most cost-effective way to tackle the problem. Countries are expected to put forward their proposed commitments in the first part of the year for the measures they are going to take to tackle climate change. Davey said analysis of all the commitments would show they would cumulatively “fall well short” of the action needed to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. He told the committee: “The objective of Paris is to keep the 2C limit within reach. “I’m not expecting, I regret, the commitments we will see in the Paris agreement will get us to 2C, unfortunately.  “I want to be as close as possible, because increasingly my view is we will get an agreement in Paris, but my fear is it will not be ambitious enough and raising ambition levels is really what the climate diplomacy and climate politics of 2015 is all about.” Countries have previously agreed the target to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels in a bid to prevent the worst impacts of droughts, heatwaves, floods, rising sea levels and threats to food production, health and security."

"23 months and counting This year’s almost mythic, defining task is to roll the boulder of a new climate agreement uphill to Paris. There’s a whole sack of new sustainable development goals to sign-off as well. Intended to allow the whole human population to thrive within planetary boundaries, these 17 principal goals were meant to be concise, global, limited in number, action-oriented and easy to communicate. The big ones like ‘end poverty in all its forms everywhere’ are wonderful. But they are also hilariously out of alignment with the current direction of the economies that created the problems in the first place. Finance is still in the driving seat, with Goldman Sachs giving 121 of its UK traders and chief bankers an average pay packet of £3m. The latest data showed inequality rising in the UK, median incomes down and the net wealth of financial corporations up by 373%.  Crucially, if just the climate boulder doesn’t get up the hill of 2015, the impacts of irreversible global warming will kiss goodbye all the other sustainable development goals regardless, however great they sound. Memories of the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks create fears that the challenge is a doomed, repetitive, Sisyphean labour. Worse still, in real life rather than mythology, King Sisyphus himself gets to skip the original rock-rolling punishment for being crafty, cruel, and hubristic, very like the heedless financial markets. The endless heave is left to other, lowlier subjects. Pretty bleak, or is it? Smart policy makers could grab some unexpected opportunities to win two of the greatest prizes in green economics: to tackle the price of carbon and find the scale of resources needed to invest in transition. Both might set the scene positively to prevent the forthcoming drama of Paris from becoming a tragedy. Things keep happening which suggest that there is more room for manoeuvre than previously thought. Few, for example, foresaw the recent fall in the price of oil. When it was comfortably above $100 (£65) per barrel, making the case for a carbon floor price – designed to raise the cost of pollution and make clean investment more attractive – was vulnerable to the argument that while the economy was still ticking over, the extra cost may be critically damaging. That’s a much harder case to make with the oil price now below $60 per barrel. It’s an ideal political moment now to set the tone for the year and implement a floor price. Industry has become accustomed to the higher price and should be able to adapt without missing a beat. The other opportunity emerges from the logical gap in the UK, and in varying degrees across Europe, between official commitment to austerity in the name of deficit reduction, and the return to political favour of public investment in infrastructure. This matters for several reasons. In the UK, austerity measures have failed to meet deficit reduction targets, while promoting labour policies that undermine the tax base, making meeting the targets even harder. Now, if there is to be spending on infrastructure, to support a modern economy it would have to be green and low carbon. This would solve several problems at once like creating good jobs, generating tax receipts, lowering energy bills, insulating the economy from the geopolitics and price volatility of fossil fuels, and boldly striding toward Paris by tackling climate change. Massively expanding the Green Collar sector, starting with the renovation of homes, could be funded by new, targeted quantitative easing – an innovative spending tool that avoids conventional government borrowing and holds no technical barriers to implementation according to Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Wim Boonstra, chief economist of the huge Dutch Rabobank and professor of economic policy at VU University, Amsterdam, recently argued for a huge €1tn programme of public investment funded by ‘monetary expansion’ from the European Central Bank (ECB), in other words Europe-wide quantitative easing, to avoid deflation across Europe. Investment at this scale in the low carbon transition of Europe’s infrastructure might finally send a global message that rich countries are serious about climate targets.  Of course, any such programme needs to be well-targeted – think of it being about ‘lifeboat’ rather than ‘helicopter money’, intended for making a more comfortable, well-employed and climate-proof economic boat, rather than just loading more random consumption onto the leaky, low-in-the-water one we already have. And it would need watching hawkishly to avoid unintended consequences, but the need is there and the potential is enormous.  Elsewhere, good news comes from recent research at the University of California-Berkeley. It gives welcome academic support to the season’s enduring celebration of the possibility of new beginnings, and a really good excuse to stay in bed. Things that make us happy, it seems, also help us get off the treadmill of rising energy consumption.  Echoing other studies, it found a strong link between behaviour shifts that add to our life satisfaction and lower our consumption of energy. Activities like volunteering, sleeping more, spending more time with friends and exercising, have little to do with the classic vision of consumers buying more stuff to fuel an economic recovery, but they have a lot to do with the human recovery needed if we are to find a better way to be in the world. And it might just stop that big rock rolling down the hill again."

"In a paper I just published with colleague Dr Ted Scambos from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, we highlight the impact of southern ice sheet loss, particularly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, on sea-level rise around the world.  We know that human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing the Earth’s temperature to rise and are creating other changes across the Earth’s climate system. One change that gets a great deal of attention is the current and future rates of sea-level rise. A rising sea level affects coastal communities around the world; approximately 150 million people live within 1 meter of current sea level. The waters are rising because of a number of factors. First, water expands as it warms. In the past, this “thermal expansion” was the largest source of sea-level rise. But as the Earth’s temperatures continued to increase, another factor (melting ice, particularly from large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica) has played an ever increasing role.  In the Southern Hemisphere, the largest player is the Western Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). It is less stable than Eastern Antarctica and is particularly vulnerable to melting from below by warmed ocean waters. Scientists are closely watching the ice near the edges of the WAIS because they buttress large volumes of ice that are more inland. When these buttressing ice shelves melt, the ice upstream will slide more rapidly toward the ocean waters.  As reported in our paper, according to some studies, “no further acceleration of climate change and only modest extrapolations of the current increasing mass loss rate are necessary for the system to eventually collapse ... resulting in 1-3 metres of sea-level rise.” And this is from just one component of the great southern sheets. What we also discuss is that sea-level rise will not be uniform. Antarctica (and Greenland) are currently losing gigatons of ice each year. That ice is heavy, and we know from first-year physics courses that mass (particularly heavy items) expresses a gravitational attraction. So, all that ice sitting atop Antarctica is pulling ocean waters toward it.  As the ice melts, the gravitational force will lessen, and the waters will “slosh” away from Antarctica. In our paper, we report that sea level rise in the Northern Hemisphere will be greater than the world-wide average whereas sea levels in the region next to Antarctica may actually fall. This means that infrastructure planning on the east and west coasts of North America as well as in Europe must be prepared for a greater than average sea-level rise. This is an exciting and rapidly evolving field of study that has tremendous implications on coastal communities and infrastructure. My colleague, Dr Ted Scambos summarized the current knowledge by saying,  Antarctica’s ice sheet has been called the ‘sleeping giant’ of sea level, but it’s beginning to stir. Everything we’ve seen about this change points to human influences on climate – and now we’re at the point where human actions will be needed to stop it.  We will be eagerly awaiting more results on this subject over the next few months and years."
"Last week, over 20,000 Earth scientists gathered at the annual American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall conference. They shared their scientific research, ranging from identifying the causes of past climate changes, to estimating the risks of the changes we’re causing now, to how we can successfully communicate the need to mitigate those risks. Richard Alley (the host of Earth: the Operator’s Manual) summarized the scientific community’s consensus about the threats of abrupt climate change from various potential “tipping points.” Scientists aren’t too worried about a huge methane burp from the ocean or shutdown of the thermohaline circulation (which would cause dramatic cooling in Europe) happening anytime soon. On the other hand, a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet and large associated sea level rise are becoming increasingly worrying.   This tied into paleoclimate research presented by Aaron Goldner. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were at similar levels to today’s (400 parts per million) 15 million years ago during the mid-Miocene period. However, the Earth’s climate was very different. Geologic records give us estimations that sea levels were 25–40 meters higher than today, global mean temperatures 3­–6°C hotter, and there was very little sea ice relative to today. As Goldner and colleagues showed in a 2013 paper, climate models couldn’t reproduce that hotter climate very well; especially the extreme heat at the poles. However, the Community Atmosphere Model his team used was recently improved, in particular to better simulate cloud properties. Goldner showed that this newer version, which is more sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, more accurately reproduces the high global and polar temperatures during the mid-Miocene. The difference is that in the newer simulation, more clouds form at the poles, trapping heat, causing the sea ice to melt. Today, we’re already seeing Arctic sea ice vanish at an alarming rate. The worry is that we may be approaching a tipping point that kicks us into a climate regime with significantly less ice, higher sea levels, and hotter temperatures, like the mid-Miocene or mid-Pliocene when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were similar to today’s, but for an extended period of time. We’re on the verge of entering a hot climate state not seen in tens of millions of years. There were many AGU talks about the climate impacts we’re already seeing. For example, human-caused global warming is amplifying many types of extreme weather like drought, heatwaves, and storms. There’s uncertainty about just how bad these impacts will get, and how fast. Stephan Lewandowsky gave a talk discussing the problem that although more uncertainty translates to greater risk and urgency, people perceive the opposite. People often think we don’t need to act until uncertainty is gone, but that means letting the problem get worse in the meantime. As Andrew Dessler said in one of his AGU talks,  Uncertainty is the hammer policy advocates use to smash scientists over the head. Climate and social scientists have struggled to communicate this urgency to the public. While most people accept that humans are changing the climate, few understand the urgency of mitigating these risks. This is particularly a problem for ideological conservatives. Among social scientists, a consensus is forming that more climate-specific knowledge translates into greater acceptance of the science and support for mitigation. However, facts are more effective when ideological barriers are first weakened. For example, conservatives are more likely to accept the science when presented with free market solutions, as opposed to government regulation. Scientists John McCuin, Katharine Hayhoe, John Cook, Daniel Bedford, and Scott Mandia reported success in climate education through misconception-based learning. People form mental structures of the world, and debunking a misconception can leave a gap in those structures. As it turns out, people would rather have a complete but incorrect understanding of the world than an incomplete but more correct understanding. Thus, the most effective education and communication must explain why a person’s misconceptions were formed and why they’re incorrect, replacing the mental gaps with factually correct information. In April 2015, the University of Queensland will be hosting a free online course (MOOC) taking this approach to teaching climate science. At AGU, my colleagues and I recorded many lectures for that MOOC, and John Cook interviewed a ‘who’s who’ list of climate rock stars. In those interviews and during other talks and events, I heard about the attacks many climate scientists have faced for having the temerity to do their jobs. Ben Santer was attacked for summarizing the evidence behind how we knew humans were driving global warming in the 1995 IPCC report. Michael Mann and Malcolm Hughes spoke of the incessant attacks they’ve faced since publishing their “hockey stick” study over 15 years ago (a result since replicated dozens of times). Katharine Hayhoe (quite possibly the nicest person on Earth, and one of the most influential) was attacked for writing a chapter about climate change for a book Newt Gingrich was writing. Naomi Oreskes, for publishing the first study in 2004 on the climate consensus.  My colleagues and I got a taste of those attacks after we published our follow-up consensus study last year. Fortunately, as Mann and Hayhoe and others noted in a terrific climate science communication session that I had the privilege of speaking in, they’ve borne the brunt of the storm. Young climate scientists today can do their research and communicate with the public with less threat of being attacked, thanks to those groundbreaking individuals and groups like the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund. As Hayhoe pointed out in one of her AGU talks, our infrastructure and society are constructed based on the assumption of a stable climate, but we’re in the process of destabilizing it. We’re not doing enough to protect our investments, security, or future wellbeing. Andrew Weaver spoke about his decision to shift from science to politics, quipping, We need evidence-based decision-making. What we have is decision-based evidence-making. Similarly, Aaron Goldner started working for Senator Sheldon Whitehouse after finishing his doctorate in paleoclimate research. He told me, After you study past warm climate intervals, it becomes quite clear where the world can go when you continuously add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. I feel like the next 10 years are the most critical in changing our trajectory in terms of temperature change.  I decided to follow a public policy path and go to D.C. because it’s important to understand the system as a whole, and also the role of a scientist in this political system. Scientists are respected and needed in policy discussions, and I believe I will ultimately be a better scientist the more I understand how to get the best information to the decision makers who can move us in the right direction. Within the fire hose of information presented at AGU 2014, the connecting thread was clear. Human-caused climate change poses a serious threat; the Merchants of Doubt have obscured that threat in a shroud of disinformation and attacks on climate scientists; but social scientists are making progress in learning how to effectively communicate the urgency of the problem to the public. Their work is crucial, because the next decade is critical in determining which climate path we take."

"They call him Moonbird, or sometimes, just “B95” – the number from the band on his leg. Moonbird is the most famous, charismatic member of a group of mid-sized shorebirds named Rufa red knots, whose numbers have plummeted so dramatically in the past several decades that they just became the first bird ever listed under the Endangered Species Act with climate change cited as a “primary threat”. Rufa red knots are among the avian world’s most extreme long-range flyers (especially in light of their relatively small size). They travel vast distances – some flying more than 29,000km – in the course of an annual migration that begins in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, and extends all the way up to the Canadian Arctic (and back again).  Which brings us to Moonbird’s distinction: because he is so old – he is at least 21 – he is believed to have flown as many as 640,000km in his lifetime. The distance to the moon varies, depending on where it is in its orbit, but the average distance is about 380,000km. Thus, Moonbird has not only flown the distance it takes to reach the moon – he has also covered the bulk of the return voyage. We know Moonbird’s age, explains nature writer Phillip Hoose (who has written an eponymous book about him), because he was originally banded in 1995. And even then, he was an adult bird, meaning he was at least 2 years old. Since then, the same bird, with the same tag, is still being spotted, most recently in May 2014 in New Jersey. That would make Moonbird at least 21 years old, a true Methuselah for his species. As a red knot, “if you can make it past your first year, you’ll live to be six or seven”, says Hoose. “The idea of a bird that’s 21, or 22, or even older, is really extraordinary.” Assuming that Moonbird is still living – the last sighting was in May – there are reasons to wonder whether there will ever be another bird that is his equal. Why? Simply put, his subspecies has been devastated, and climate change will make matters worse – making extreme survival of the sort that Moonbird has achieved that much more difficult. “It will become harder for a Rufa red knot to have that kind of longevity,” Hoose says. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, there has been a 75% decline in numbers of Rufa red knots since the 1980s. One key reason is that the birds, during their northward migration, stop off in Delaware Bay in May and dine on the buried eggs of horseshoe crabs – a food source upon which they vitally depend. But those crabs saw their numbers plummet when fishermen realised if they chopped up horseshoe crabs and threw them in the water, the smell would draw in eels and conch. When numbers of horseshoe crabs crashed, so did numbers of the birds. “The decline started in the 90s, and there was a virtual collapse in 2003,” says Larry Niles, a wildlife biologist who studies the red knot in collaboration with the American Littoral Society and the Conserve Wildlife Foundation. “We went from 50,000-60,000 birds down to 20,000, and then hit rock bottom at around 12,000.” As Niles’ words suggest, the more you learn about the Rufa red knot, the more you also realise how vulnerable it is. Because these birds fly so far, their bodies change dramatically to allow them to complete their journeys. They’ll take on fat and build flight muscles, and then fly 2,400km or more at a single stretch, arriving at their destination exhausted and vulnerable, and overwhelmingly dependent on being able to find easy food, which is what horseshoe crab eggs used to represent. “We had actually attached small devices that tracked their migrations,” explains Niles, “and they made six-day flights without stopping to get to the Delaware Bay. So they would arrive completely bereft of energy, their weight would be sometimes far lower than their fat-free weight, which meant they were burning muscle to get to the Delaware Bay. And the horseshoe crabs were laying eggs in such density that there was no work involved.” Niles says the “synchrony” involved, in which the birds managed to arrive at the bay precisely when the crabs were laying eggs, was “virtually magic”. For a while, anyway. Evolution and adaptation had built a good, albeit elaborate, survival strategy. And then everything changed. Clearly, for all of the reasons above, the Rufa red knot is a pretty amazing bird. Is it the most amazing of them all? That’s subjective and hard to say. The Arctic tern flies farther each year (it’s also a larger bird). And there’s something stunning about the peregrine falcon killing its prey through high-speed dives in mid-flight. Still, at minimum, the extremity and Hail Mary accuracy of the Rufa red knot’s long distance flights have to win some serious respect – and some serious concern for its plight. The horseshoe crab population collapse, and its after-effects, is the most immediate reason for the Endangered Species Act listing of the Rufa red knot (one of six subspecies of the red knot found around the globe – all of which are struggling, Niles says). But on top of the crash at the Delaware Bay, there are other changes along the birds’ vast flyway, and some of those involve climate change. The birds breed in the Arctic, which is being dramatically altered by climate change. Global warming is driving more Arctic storms, suggests Niles, which can wipe out young chicks. In addition, climate changes in the Arctic are disrupting lemming populations. If the predators that used to dine on lemmings – including snowy owls – can’t find enough of them, they may start to prey on red knots instead. There’s also the encroachment of sea level rise on the birds’ habitat, notes Walsh. As a result, the Rufa red knot has now made history: it is the first bird listed under the Endangered Species Act with climate change cited as a “primary” reason for it being on there. Other animals that have been listed for climate reasons include the polar bear, a number of species of ice seals, and 22 species of corals that are threatened by warmer waters and ocean acidification (also caused by global warming). This may be just the start for the listing of threatened and endangered avian species. Molly Matteson, a wildlife biologist with the US Center for Biological Diversity, observes that the group has “petitioned for other bird species that have climate change as one of their threat factors. It hasn’t happened yet”. As for Moonbird? By now, says Hoose, he should be back in Tierra del Fuego; we may hear a report of his arrival any day now. “This is a real marathoner,” says Hoose. “This is one of the most spectacular migrations available in bird life.” For now.

"Scientists have identified which parts of the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs are most capable of recovering from mass bleaching events which will become more frequent due to global warming. The information should help conservationists to target their efforts to protect the portions of reefs that are most capable of survival, they say.  Previous studies have shown coral reefs as they exist today will be largely wiped out by climate change in the long term, but the new work by an Australian team shows for the first time which reefs in the short term can be expected to bounce back from bleaching events. A major bleaching event is currently under way in large parts of the North Pacific, including the Marshall Islands and Hawaii, which experts have warned could be on a ‘historic’ scale akin to the record bleaching of 1998 that saw mass coral die-off around the world. Nicholas Graham, lead author of the study published in Nature on Wednesday, looked at the 1998 bleaching’s impacts on reefs in the Seychelles, and found 12 of 21 sites had recovered afterwards.  Looking at just two of 11 factors – water depth and the physical complexity of the coral – the team were able to use modelling to 98% of the time correctly predict whether a reef would recover or not. Deeper water and a more complex structure made a recovery more likely. Graham, who works on coral at James Cook University in Australia, told the Guardian that the results bought time for authorities to better manage climate-resilient reefs while bigger picture problems such as greenhouse gas cuts were addressed. “If emissions continue as they are, the longer term future is likely to still be bleak, even for those recovering at the moment [from bleaching], because the projections are coral bleaching will become more and more frequent. In a way it’s [the study’s findings] buying us time to keep as many reefs in good shape as we can, while we tackle some of these global, bigger issues.” The study’s findings suggest the parts of the Great Barrier Reef that are still relatively pristine, in the north and further offshore, are also those best placed to recover from bleaching events brought about by global warming.  Graham said the findings also raised concerns about the logic of dumping sediment from planned major port projects to expand coal exports along the Queensland coast, a local impact which could harm coral otherwise capable of surviving the global impacts of climate change.  “If you have these big dredging projects, such as at Abbot Point, if we’re dumping a lot of spoil and sediment into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, a lot of that will settle in deep water, a lot of which might be coral and a lot of which will do better under climate change. If we’re not actually doing enough to reduce local impacts, we’re doing ourselves a disservice under climate change.” The research could help organisations such as the reef’s marine park authority to better pinpoint which areas should avoid anchor damage from boats, which reduces physical complexity and thus the ability to recover from bleaching, Graham added. It could also help other coral nations, such as Kenya, to pinpoint where to limit damage by fishing gear. The research looked at a 17-year data set covering surveys undertaken in 1994, 2005, 2008 and 2011, and looked at eleven factors that influenced their recovery or die-off. The coral’s physical complexity and water depth were the two most important factors – sites deeper than 6.3 metres were found to be highly likely to recover – while whether a reef was in a marine protected area made no difference. Dr Aaron MacNeil, a co-author on the study from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “This gives reef management a major boost in the face of the threats posed by climate change and, encouragingly, suggests people can take tangible steps to improve the outlook for reefs.  “By carefully managing reefs with conditions that are more likely to recover from climate-induced bleaching, we give them the best possible chance of surviving over the long term, while reduction of local pressures that damage corals and diminish water quality will help to increase the proportion of reefs that can bounce back.”"
"NASA and NOAA have just reported that global surface temperatures in 2014 were the hottest on record. That also means 2014 was likely the hottest the Earth has been in millennia, and perhaps as much as 100,000 years. But what’s really remarkable is that 2014 set this record without the aid of an El Niño event. El Niño events create conditions in which sea surface and hence global surface temperatures are anomalously hot. We call this part of the Earth’s “internal variability” because these events just temporarily shift heat around between the ocean surface and its depths.   As this graphic shows (click here for an animated version), the last five record hot years of 2010, 2005, 1998, 1997, and 1995 were all assisted by El Niño events.  In contrast, 2014 had a slight cooling influence from La Niña-like conditions at the beginning of the year, a slight warming influence from El Niño-like conditions toward the end, and no net temperature influence from the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for the year as a whole. 2014 was by far the hottest ENSO-neutral year on record, and the first year since 1990 to set a record without influence from El Niño.  1998, which saw the strongest El Niño on record, now falls to 5th-hottest year on record. The intense El Niño event made global surface temperatures in 1998 about 0.2°C hotter than they would have otherwise been. Due to human-caused global warming, ENSO-neutral years are now hotter than even the most intense El Niño years a decade or two ago. As NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt said, This is the latest in a series of warm years, in a series of warm decades. While the ranking of individual years can be affected by chaotic weather patterns, the long-term trends are attributable to drivers of climate change that right now are dominated by human emissions of greenhouse gases As the above graphic shows, over the past 50 years, there has been the same 0.15–0.16°C per decade warming trend for La Niña years, for ENSO neutral years, and for El Niño years. So for example, an ENSO-neutral year today is about 0.25°C hotter than a similar year would have been in 1998. That’s why 2014 was hotter than 1998 despite the big difference in El Niño temperature influences between the two years. This is all happening during a time when we’re constantly being bombarded with inaccurate claims of a global warming “pause.” These mistaken claims stem from the fact that the rate of global surface warming has slowed a bit over the past 15 years, in large part because we’ve seen more La Niña events and fewer El Niño events during that time, and also due to heightened volcanic activity. In fact, at any point over the past five decades we can find a period during which global surface warming “paused.” Yet each such period was hotter than the last. That’s because each is just a temporary effect caused by a period with a predominance of La Niña events and other short-term cooling temperature influences. As this figure shows (click here for an animated version), underneath the short-term noise, human-caused global warming continues unabated. Following the global surface temperature records set in 2005 and 2010, a new record in 2014 is right on schedule. A 2011 paper by Stefan Rahmstorf and Dim Coumou found that as global warming continues, we should expect to set new records about once every four years. Indeed, if we only use the data of the past 30 y, these show an almost linear trend of 0.017°C/y, yielding an expected 2.5 new record hot temperatures in the last decade [1 per 4 years]. Given that we may see an El Niño event in early 2015, there’s also a chance that this record could be short lived, and 2015 might break it once again. On top of the record global surface temperatures, we also saw a record amount of heat accumulating on Earth, mainly in the oceans. According to NOAA, in 2014 the oceans accumulated an amount of heat equivalent to about 200 million atomic bomb detonations (13 zettajoules, or 13 billion trillion Joules). That’s about 6 to 7 atomic bomb detonations per second, on average, throughout 2014. That’s a lot of heat, likewise reaching record levels. Climate Nexus summarizes some other notable climate facts from 2014 in this video. In short, global warming continues unabated, and claims of a “pause” are misguided. Because of human-caused global warming, average years today are hotter than El Niño years just a decade ago, and the Earth continues to accumulate immense amounts of heat. Despite short-term noise, that long-term trend will continue until we cut our carbon pollution and curb global warming."

"Controversial lobbying group Alec has received an early Christmas gift from Overstock.com. The online retailer recently rejoined the group, bucking a trend among tech companies, many of which have recently disassociated themselves from it. Alec, the American Legislative Exchange Council, has lost the support of a number of top tech firms in recent months over its stance on climate change. Last week eBay became the latest to cut ties to the group, which lobbies for legislative change at the state level.   Ebay’s decision followed an exodus by tech firms that started after Microsoft quit the group. Following Microsoft’s exit, Google chairman Eric Schmidt said his company could no longer be aligned with people who deny climate change. “They are just literally lying,” he said. Alec denied Schmidt’s charges. Overstock was previously a member of Alec but let its membership lapse. Overstock confirmed it had rejoined Alec to lobby on internet sales taxation issues.  “Overstock.com did re-join Alec recently”, said a spokesman. “Our relationship with Alec is based on the organization’s access to lawmakers involved in the internet sales tax issue, which is a very weighty one for us. Alec’s stance on climate change did not factor into our decision, one way or another”.  Nick Surgey, director of research at the nonprofit Center for Media and Democracy, said Overstock, unlike Google and many other Silicon Valley companies, had never espoused progressive values on climate change or other issues.  Patrick Byrne, Overstock’s chief operating officer, is chairman of the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, a free market lobby group set up by the late Nobel economist Milton Friedman that champions vouchers for education, a cause also supported by Alec. “It appears they have made a business decision to push on a tax issue”, Surgey said. Google and Microsoft were followed away from Alec by AOL, Facebook, Yahoo and Yelp. “In the last four months, Alec has lost the support of companies worth trillions of dollars”, said Surgey. The recent wave of tech exits followed another exodus over Alec’s support of Florida’s “stand your ground” legislation, which became controversial nationally after the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. Alec worked with the National Rifle Association to lobby for similar legislation in other states. Amazon, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Kraft, McDonald’s and Walmart terminated their memberships after the killing."
"The government’s climate advisory body has delivered a stark assessment of the Coalition’s policies, stating it was unlikely that its Direct Action policy would meet Australia’s 5% emissions reduction target and calling for the renewable energy target (RET) to remain intact. The Climate Change Authority, which the Coalition unsuccessfully attempted to abolish, has conducted two statutory reviews for the government: one on the RET and one on the carbon farming initiative (CFI).  The existing CFI is being expanded into the $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF), which is the centrepiece of the Coalition’s Direct Action climate plan. The fund will provide voluntary grants to businesses that wish to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The review by the Climate Change Authority (CCA) said the evidence showed the ERF, in its current form, would “fall well short of achieving the reductions required to meet Australia’s minimum 2020 target”, which is a 5% emissions reduction based on 2000 levels. This damning assessment adds to previous independent modelling showing the policy would be insufficient. The government has conducted no modelling of its own on whether the policy would work, but has repeatedly expressed its confidence the target would be reached, partly because emissions from areas such as manufacturing have been declining due to other factors. The UN has cast doubt on whether Direct Action would meet the emissions target, stating in November that Australia was one of just four countries on course to miss 2020 emissions reduction goals. But the CCA said it was too early to completely write off the ERF, given that it had yet to start purchasing carbon abatement and that the “safeguards” mechanism – which would ensure emissions did not rise elsewhere in the economy – had yet to be finalised. Complementary action, such as the purchasing of international carbon permits and a “robust” RET, could also help Australia meet its 5% goal, although the target itself was “inadequate” and should be increased, according to a previous CCA review. The CCA’s report raised the concern that emissions abatement purchased through the fund would occur anyway and recommended the government consider an “additionality” test that would ensure emissions were cut beyond business-as-usual levels. The authority’s RET review recommended the target not be altered, although the timescale to achieve it should be deferred by “up to three years”.  The government held a review of the RET earlier this year, headed by the businessman Dick Warburton, rather than rely on the CCA’s advice. The Warburton review recommended the RET be either scaled back or abolished. Under the existing RET, 41,000 gigawatt hours of Australia’s electricity must come from clean sources, such as solar and wind, by 2020. The government is attempting to cap this target at a “real 20%”, which the renewables industry has said would involve a substantial cut to jobs and investment in the sector. Labor, which has previously walked away from talks with the Coalition on the future of the RET, is seeking to re-establish contact on the issue. Labor and the Greens oppose any major cut to the RET. The CCA’s report said that while the level of the large-scale RET target, which covers large solar and wind farms, should remain, pushing the timeframe beyond 2020 would help the target be reached due to the huge uncertainty in the sector that has seen investment drop 70% in just the past year. The RET is projected to reduce Australia’s emissions by 58m tonnes between 2015 and 2020, and “by much larger amounts in later periods”, the CCA report stated. It has been of “modest” cost to industry and energy consumers, it added. “The RET arrangements are not perfect but, in the authority’s view, they are effective in reducing emissions (at reasonable cost) in the centrally important electricity sector,” the report said. “Given the absence of effective alternative measures bearing upon this sector, the authority does not favour any significant scaling back of the 2020 LRET target of 41,000 GWh.” The chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor, said: “The CCA report notes that the emissions intensity of Australia’s electricity sector is higher than that of China and the rest of the OECD and that renewable energy will play a major role in cleaning up our power sector. “The Climate Institute calls on the government to step back from plans to dramatically reduce the RET and for both the government and the ALP to provide bipartisan support for renewable energy in Australia in recognition of the need to urgently decarbonise our energy sector.” The chairman of the CCA, Bernie Fraser, said there was neither a broad community consensus on the risk of climate change nor a “well-stocked toolbox” to reduce emissions. “The earlier broad political consensus has ruptured in recent years, and no early repair is in prospect,” he said. “And the toolbox is feeling less weighty, with the removal of the carbon pricing mechanism, an unproven ERF, and an uncertain outlook for the RET.” The Coalition attempted to scrap the CCA but a deal struck with the Palmer United party meant its survival until 2016, in return for PUP Senate votes to implement the ERF. The CCA will now review the effectiveness of emissions trading, as well as what Australia’s emissions reductions target should be beyond 2020. Countries’ post-2020 goals will be submitted early next year ahead of crunch climate talks in Paris. The chief executive of the CCA, Anthea Harris, told Guardian Australia it had been a “strange year” for the government agency. “We have got a job to do now and we will be making recommendations in the broader public interest,” she said. Asked if she expected the government to take on board the CCA’s work, she said: “We’ll wait and see.” Harris said there was “huge uncertainty” over the future of the RET and the effectiveness of the ERF. Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, said: “All of the experts agree that Tony Abbott’s relentless reversal on action to tackle climate change is ideology that flies in the face of facts, logic and economic responsibility.” A spokeswoman for Greg Hunt, the environment minister, said the government would carefully consider the reports and will respond in due course. “We are committed to reforming the RET and will continue to seek bipartisan support for a RET that achieves a real 20% share of renewable in Australia’s energy mix by 2020,” she said. “The door remains open to Labor to recommence negotiations. “The government welcomes the authority’s assessment that the Emissions Reduction Fund streamlines existing arrangements and expands coverage to allow crediting of emissions reductions across the economy. “The government is making strong progress implementing its ERF, with preparations for the first auction well underway, and nearly 20 new draft ERF methods released to expand emissions reduction opportunities for business across the economy.”"

"2014 was Australia’s third-hottest year on record, reflecting a long-term warming trend, according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate statement. Here is a summary of the report with six key charts that explain Australia’s climate in 2014:  According to the report, seven of Australia’s 10 warmest years have occurred since 2002, and the general trend since 1910 is towards a warmer climate. This graph shows the mean temperature anomaly (degrees difference from a 30-year average temperature) for each year: As you can see, more recent years are increasingly above average. This general trend is in line with preliminary estimates for global temperatures for 2014 from the World Meteorological Organisation, which suggest 2014 is likely to be the warmest year on record: Overall, the mean temperature for Australia was 0.91C above the 30-year average. However, this was mostly due to the southern parts of Australia, with large areas classified as ‘very much above average’ and some areas, such as southern Victoria, parts of NSW and a decent chunk of WA, experiencing the highest mean temperatures on record: Parts of the Northern Territory were below average, with other sections of north Queensland and NT experiencing average temperatures. According to the report, it was the warmest year on record for NSW, second-warmest for Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, equal third-warmest for Queensland and fourth-warmest for Western Australia.  While annual rainfall was very much above average for a large section of the NT and WA, regions in Queensland, northern NSW and southern Victoria experienced far lower than average rainfall. The situation in Queensland is particularly severe; according to the Queensland government, most of the state remains in drought as of December 2014. Here’s the BOM’s rainfall deficiency map over 26 months to November 2014, showing the regions in northern NSW, Queensland and western Victoria that are particularly below average: A number of areas experienced significant heatwaves and warm spells throughout the year, the report highlighting the heatwave of early January as one of the most significant on record for south-eastern Australia. The combination of high temperatures and lower than average rainfall in some regions led to serious bushfires in WA, NSW and Victoria. "

"2015 promises two big milestones for sustainability: the launch of the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) in New York in Autumn, and the COP21 climate talks in Paris in December. All eyes are on these processes, which promise to shape the future of sustainable economic development and climate change. For business, however, the outcomes in New York and Paris will constitute just the beginning of the story. It is no longer the case that grand international agreements set in motion binding regulations agreements for companies to simply comply with. Today change comes simultaneously from the top down, the middle out and the bottom up. As business gears up for a critical year, the wisest strategies will take all these elements into account. Make no mistake, even though the SDGs and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) won’t solve sustainable development and global warming, they are crucial enablers of progress and business leaders should make their voices heard. In the coming year, individual businesses have a stake in encouraging governments to establish ambitious policies that create the right incentives for companies to shift to low-carbon models. Business for Social Responsibility has co-founded We Mean Business, a coalition of seven business organisations focused on sustainability that are are helping to advance just such policies. It is our strong hope that the SDGs will provide clear direction on the key elements of widely shared prosperity and that the Paris summit will deliver new commitments to ensure global temperatures do not exceed the 2C mark. Business also has an opportunity to help construct solutions from the middle out. Waiting for national governments to agree is a fool’s game. Indeed, France is steering COP21 towards a network of commitments from multiple sources. Business has much to offer this model, and there are already many cases of companies making essential contributions to new models and frameworks that enable faster, deeper progress. For example, dozens of companies are piloting integrated reporting as part of the International Integrated Reporting Committee. Several hundred companies have called for a price on carbon, in concert with the World Bank, with many also applying a price in their internal operations.  The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights has launched an informal network of companies and civil society organisations that are making that international agreement a reality through application and learning. These examples reflect a much-needed global laboratory that encourages innovation in new models – the kind of thing that would take governments much longer to establish. Finally, the rise of the sharing economy and the circular economy are reframing the debate on sustainability. Innovation is leading to new companies, new collaborations and new ways of delivering value that decouple economic growth from the depletion of natural resources. Plenty of industries have experienced this kind of disruption already – utilities, cars, hotels and hospitality – and these examples will only multiply, changing the face of every sector in years to come. Figuring out how to maximise the sustainability benefits of these changes is the design challenge of the 21st century. As we enter 2015, the true test for any business is whether it is contributing to a just and sustainable world by using all of the resources at its disposal. This means engagement in traditional policy processes, joining diverse coalitions of action and applying the creative power of the private sector to come up with new ideas that meet the needs of a resource-constrained but thoroughly connected world.

"As you read this, a monster of a bill is passing smoothly and quietly through Britain’s parliament. It’s so big and complex, and covers so many topics, that it makes a mockery of democracy.  The infrastructure bill epitomises the rising trend of legislation-stuffing: cramming so many unrelated issues into one bag that parliamentary votes become meaningless. MPs must either accept this great bundle of unrelated measures in its entirety or reject it in its entirety. So laws can pass which no one in their right mind would have voted for.  Bills like this are good places for burying bad news, and this one is a graveyard. Among its outrageous and scarcely-debated provisions, slipped in by the government some time after parliamentary debates began, is a measure that undermines every claim it has made about preventing dangerous climate change. It is a legal obligation on current and future governments to help trash the world’s atmosphere. The government already has a legal obligation to do the opposite. The Climate Change Act 2008, supported by all the major parties, commits successive governments to minimise the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. The Infrastructure Act 2015 will commit successive governments to maximise them. Needless to say, that’s not quite how it is expressed. The bill obliges governments to produce strategies for “maximising the economic recovery of UK petroleum”: in other words for getting as much oil out of the ground as possible. Oil is extracted to be burnt; burning it releases greenhouse gases; maximising recovery means maximising greenhouse gases. The Infrastructure Act, if passed – and so far it is scarcely being contested (hello Labour, do you still exist?) – will be the Climate Change Act’s evil twin. Both acts oblige current and future governments to report at fixed periods on how they will achieve their contradictory objectives. The same person, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, will be responsible for both policies: ensuring that the UK both consumes less oil and produces more. Perhaps he’ll seek to minimise climate change by day, then, after a stiff dose of potion, come out at night to maximise it. But there could not be a greater contrast between the ways in which the two acts (or their relevant clauses) were developed. The Climate Change Act was the result of a massive campaigning effort, over many years, by citizens’ movements that mobilised public opinion and pressed MPs to act on it. The provisions in the infrastructure bill were slipped surreptitiously into the back of a legislative juggernaut that was already rolling down a six-lane motorway. In other words, the first act was an example of how democracy is supposed to work; the second is an example of how it gets corrupted. Now, on the day that MPs sit down in committee to discuss this bill, the journal Nature publishes the most detailed scientific paper yet on how much fossil fuel should be left in the ground if we’re to have a chance of preventing more than 2C of global warming. To deliver a 50% probability (which is not exactly reassuring) of no more than 2C of warming this century, the world would have to leave two-thirds of its fossil fuel reserves unexploited. I should point out that reserves are just a small fraction of resources (which means all the minerals in the Earth’s crust). The reserve is that proportion of a mineral resource which has been discovered, quantified and is viable to exploit in current conditions: in other words that’s good to go. The Nature paper estimates that a third of the world’s oil reserves, half its gas reserves and 80% of its coal reserves must be left untouched to avert extremely dangerous levels of global warming. 2C is dangerous enough; at present we are on course for around 5C by the time the century ends, with no obvious end in sight beyond 2100. The only sensible response to such findings, which some of us have been advocating for years, is a global agreement to leave these unburnable fossil fuels in the ground. But it’s not just that no such agreement exists, no such agreement has ever been mooted. Researching Don’t Even Think About It, which I see as the most important book published on climate change in the past few years, George Marshall discovered that there has not been a single proposal, debate or even position paper on limiting fossil fuel production put forward during international climate negotiations. “From the very outset fossil fuel production lay outside the frame of the discussions and, as with other forms of socially constructed silence, the social norms among the negotiators and policy specialists kept it that way.” I would guess that it is not altogether inconvenient for governments to ignore the role of fossil fuel companies in causing climate change. While most states have not taken the astonishing, ecocidal step of making it a legal obligation, almost all are pursuing the same policy as the United Kingdom: maximising the production of fossil fuels. And almost all pay lip service to the idea of minimising greenhouse gas emissions. There is no attempt to resolve this contradiction, or even to acknowledge it. They don’t have to. They know that it will resolve itself. If the stuff keeps coming out of the ground, it will be burnt, without regard to the feeble policies seeking to limit its consumption. I believe I might have been the first person to suggest in the media that the best means of addressing climate change is to leave fossil fuels in the ground, in a Guardian column in 2007. Since then, this solution has been championed by the indefatigable Bill McKibben, through his Do the Math tour and 350.org, and it has been picked up by many other organisations. But still our politicians pretend not to hear. Even the current secretary of state for energy and climate change in the UK, Ed Davey, who is often fairly responsive, blocks his ears and sings loudly when the crashing contradictions in his role are mentioned. Otherwise, how could he creep out at night to reverse the policies he pursues by day? Like Dr Jekyll, he could not live with himself if he was fully aware of what Mr Hyde was doing. Were the world’s governments to regulate the wellhead rather than just the tailpipe, logistically the task would be a thousand times easier. Instead of trying to change the behaviour of 7bn people, they would need to control just a few thousand corporations. These companies would buy permits to extract fossil fuels in a global auction. As a global cap on the amount of fossil fuel that could be burnt came into force, the price would rise, making low carbon technologies, such as wind, solar and nuclear, much better investments. The energy corporations would then have no choice but to start getting out of dirt and into clean technologies. The money from the auction could be used either to compensate poorer nations for not following us down the coal hole or to help them survive in a world in which some dangerous warming – but hopefully no more than 2C – will inevitably occur. For 23 years, governments have been wasting precious time by pursuing an unworkable solution. Perhaps that was their intention? But if the climate talks in Paris in December are to have any meaning or purpose, they should abandon the self-defeating policy of addressing only consumption, and concentrate on restricting production. This, I believe should be the focus of our campaigns. Through groups like 350.org, we must make this such a potent electoral issue that we drag governments out of the clutches of the fossil fuel industry. You think that’s tough? Well try the alternative: living in a world with 5C of global warming, in other words a world of climate breakdown. By comparison, almost anything looks easy."
"2014 was the UK’s warmest year on record, figures from the Met Office show. Provisional figures for the whole year reveal that it was the hottest for the UK in records dating back to 1910.   Last year was also the warmest in the Central England Temperature series, the longest running temperature record in the world which stretches back to 1659, recording temperatures in an area of central England. The average temperature for the year was 9.9C, some 1.1C above the long term average, and making it warmer than the previous record year of 2006. It was also the fourth wettest year in records dating back to 1910, the Met Office said. The figures for 2014 mean that eight of the UK’s top 10 warmest years have occurred since 2002, the weather and climate experts said. Across the UK, it was the warmest year on record for all countries and regions apart from Northern Ireland, which had its third warmest year behind 2007 and 2006, the figures show. There were no record-breaking hot months in 2014, but temperatures were consistently warm with only August experiencing below average temperatures.  The number of air frosts in the UK was the lowest in records dating back to 1961, the provisional figures show. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics (LSE), said the record temperatures in 2014 were “part of a pattern”, with most of the hottest and wettest years occurring since 2000. “This is clear evidence of the impact of man-made climate change on the UK,” he said. “However, the latest assessment by the independent Committee on Climate Change shows that the UK public is largely unaware of how climate change is affecting their exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events.  “The lack of awareness of the UK public of how climate change is already affecting them represents a colossal failure by the government and its agencies, including the Environment Agency and the Met Office, to communicate with the public about this issue.” The Met Office figures show that the provisional rainfall total of 1297.1mm (51.1 inches) is the fourth highest total on record, meaning five of the six wettest years in the UK have happened since 2000.  A large contribution to the high rainfall total came from the very wet weather in January and February, as a series of storms battered the UK, while May, October and November were also wetter than average.  But September was the driest on record since 1910 for the UK.  The most extreme weather in 2014 was the winter storms, which caused flooding both inland and at the coasts, while the summer had some fine weather, particularly in June and July, with no heat waves but some torrential downpours. the Met Office said."

"Senator Ted Cruz will chair the committee that oversees science and Nasa in the new Republican-controlled Congress, raising fears that the conservative Texan will cut funding to the space agency and science programs. Cruz’s appointment to the space, science and competitiveness subcommittee comes amid a broad shift of power in the Senate, where the GOP won a majority in the 2014 midterm elections. Cruz was the top Republican on the subcommittee before the elections.  He has publicly stated support for Nasa but has also attempted at least once to cut the agency’s funding, arguing that larger government cuts necessitated changes to the space program’s budget. In 2013, Cruz both tried to reduce Nasa’s budget and said: “It’s critical that the United States ensure its continued leadership in space.” Cruz has constituents invested in the space agency’s future – for instance, Nasa employees and contractors at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Cruz has also spoken out against decades of science that indicate climate change, telling CNN last year that in “the last 15 years, there has been no recorded warming” to support “a so-called scientific theory”. His vociferous opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and his support of extreme budget cuts could spell trouble for Nasa’s less prominent programs, such as its own climate research and sophisticated supercomputers. His role on the front lines of the 2013 government shutdown, which critics say had lasting negative effects on public safety, Nasa research and EPA scientists’ ability to visit contaminated sites, also suggests at best a narrow focus on Nasa’s largest projects and at worst a disregard for agencies that require science funding. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican from Florida, was named chair to the subcommittee on oceans, atmosphere, fisheries and coast guard, which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Nooa) and the protection of oceans and marine life in US jurisdiction. Rubio has said he does not “believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate”, which is a more lenient position than the new chair of the environment committee, Jim Inhofe, who denies climate science outright. In December, Congress gave Nasa a boost to its 2015 budget, setting aside hundreds of millions of dollars for its planetary science program and new Space Launch System rocket, which aims to revolutionize advanced rocketry.  Due to budget cuts and programs that the government has allowed to lapse, Nasa has increasingly relied on private space companies in recent years, including Elon Musk’s SpaceX. On Saturday SpaceX tested its own experimental rocket system, delivering supplies to the International Space Station before failing to land its reusable rocket on a floating platform."

"When it comes to human suffering, the IPCC doesn’t mince its words. According to its latest report – the culmination of seven years of research and intense negotiations – climate change is on its way to causing “severe, pervasive and irreversible” damage on the world’s people, cultures, ecosystems and economies.  The report identifies a series of imminent risks, including illness, the breakdown of infrastructure and public services, food and water insecurity, and loss of rural livelihoods.  The human cost of global warming has a name: climate injustice. The remedy, then, is climate justice. Climate justice is not just the recognition that climate change is a matter of human rights and development; it also involves recognising that the victims of global warming are not responsible for it, nor can their actions alone halt it. Take the Maldives islands in the Indian Ocean, coral atolls vulnerable to rising sea levels. In 2009, the country’s leaders and its people showed extraordinary foresight and courage as they embarked on a plan to become carbon neutral by 2020. But they cannot do it alone, they need the rest of the world to support them to achieve this goal. Solidarity is at the core of climate justice. It is about sharing the benefits and burdens of climate change – and our response to it – fairly, making sure that the 1.3 billion people living without access to electricity and the 2.7 billion relying on biomass for cooking reap the benefits of access to clean, sustainable energy. Climate justice also means sharing responsibility. Those most responsible must take the lead and show greatest ambition in their domestic climate actions and support for vulnerable countries. As we make the transition to a carbon neutral world, we should all participate in the decisions taken along the way. This is the challenge of climate justice, finding fair solutions to a global problem. The concept of climate justice has an advocate in one of the world’s leading legal organisations. The International Bar Association (IBA), the global voice of the legal profession, has released a detailed report on the role of international law in addressing climate change (pdf). Its assessment is frankly shocking. It finds that climate change touches on every area of international law – human rights, trade, investment, migration – and everywhere the law is coming up short. Yet the report is also full of hope. The authors, a group of eminent lawyers from around the world, looked hard at the international legal system and found that more effective and coherent use of existing laws, rules and norms would inform better climate responses at the international and national level. The report is also full of practical and realistic suggestions for reform, from sharpening state obligations under international human rights law to getting the World Trade Organisation to state clearly and publicly that trade policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gases do not fall foul of the rules. Of particular interest is the report’s strong call for better human rights protections for the victims of climate change. States must take into account the fact that carbon emissions cost lives. Likewise, I back the report’s call for nations to have the courage to prepare the ground for a legally-binding commitment on climate change which will address not just climate change but climate justice. The IBA’s backing for climate justice is pivotal, but we cannot leave climate justice to the lawyers. Climate justice is about all of us. It is about acknowledging our personal responsibility in an interconnected world. It is about acting outside the narrow confines of self-interest – even as it becomes clear that our self-interest can destroy the lives of our own children and grandchildren. The IBA report is not the last word on climate justice, but it is an important and credible voice. It is a clarion call, and a sign that the word is spreading.

"So, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was just named to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness as Republicans take over the Senate. This subcommittee (which used to be just Space and Science but was recently renamed) is in charge of oversight of, among other things, NASA. This is not a good thing. Just how bad it is will be determined.  Before I rip into this, I want to be as fair as possible here: Poking around the Web, I don’t see any statements from Cruz that I’d consider directly antithetical to NASA’s efforts specifically to explore space. For example, in 2013 he wanted to reduce NASA’s budget, but that was more so that it would comply with the caps set by the Budget Control Act. In fact, he made a statement saying, “Proceeding with an authorization while pretending that the existing law is something other than what it is, is not the most effective way to protect the priority that space exploration and manned exploration should have.” That’s at least superficially heartening. But that’s not to say he doesn’t pose a clear danger: Cruz is a staunch denier of global warming. In 2014, he said this in an CNN interview: The last 15 years, there has been no recorded warming. Contrary to all the theories that—that they are expounding, there should have been warming over the last 15 years. It hasn’t happened.  This is, to put it mildly, what comes out of the south end of a north-facing bull. Yes, the Earth has warmed over the past 15 years, and the science is incredibly, unequivocally clear about that. Anyone making this claim either doesn’t know what they’re talking about, or is trying to sell you something (or, to be more accurate, has been bought). Cruz has even joked about it, the punch line of which depends on one of the truly dumbest claims used to deny global warming: It’s cold outside. Yes, seriously. This is very worrisome. NASA is one of the key scientific agencies studying global warming and climate change. A good fraction of NASA’s annual budget goes to Earth-observing satellites critical in looking at various factors of climate change (like the recently launched OCO-2, which monitors CO2). This is as close to the analogy of putting the fox in charge of the hen house that there is. It would be as ludicrous as putting the rabidly anti-science Sen. James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) in charge of the committee that oversees the Environmental Protection Agency. Oh, wait. Also a matter of grave concern is that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) will chair the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, which oversees the NOAA. Rubio is also a climate change denier… and the NOAA is, after all, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Putting him in charge of the NOAA is like installing an atheist as Pope.* Rubio has also said he can’t be sure the Earth’s not 6,000 years old (and he used the deplorable and disingenuous “I’m not a scientist” line while doing so). When confronted on that, he then gave a mushy answer that did little or nothing to assuage any misgivings. He confused religion and science, or at least claimed he did; it’s hard to know if what he said was what he honestly believes or what he felt was politically expedient to say. Either way, someone who has no problem saying he denies the role of human-generated pollution in the changing climate has no business being in charge of NOAA. And yet here we are. The GOP controls both sides of Congress and is also the arguably the most anti-scientific group of politicians this country has seen in decades. Their ability to obstruct any progress on climate change was strong even when they only held the House; now that they control the Senate they may be able to actively reverse forward progress we’ve already made. After all, the first priority on the agenda of the new House was to give the go-ahead for the Keystone pipeline; the correlation between “yea” votes and funding from fossil fuel is unsurprisingly very high. As an aside, President Obama has said he will veto that bill, and it looks like the Senate may lack the votes needed to overturn such a veto. We’re just getting started here, folks. I can’t imagine what disasters the GOP will wreak with these new powers. And that’s only dealing with climate change. When it comes to other basic issues, I’m very concerned indeed … and already putting my hopes in 2016. The next two years are going to be a very difficult uphill climb. *Yes, I know a lot of people will say that would be a good thing. That’s not the point of the analogy, folks. Stay on target. • This post was first published by Slate, and is republished under The Climate Desk partnership."
"Planting trees for carbon offsets is little better than green-washing in many people’s eyes. But what if this sustainability cliche were turned on its head – if trees were planted to support agroforestry within a business’s direct supply chain? Welcome to the world of insetting. Coined and promoted by sustainability standards Plan Vivo and Pur Projet, it’s a potentially powerful concept that can benefit businesses and the environment. Offsetting may have long had a bad name (George Monbiot has strongly voiced his concerns), but it remains big business. Commodities Now reported that the globally-traded carbon market was expected to reach €64bn in 2014. If even a small slice of that were diverted towards sustainability schemes within supply chains, it could have a big impact.  The Accor hotel group, for example, has 470,000 rooms across 92 countries, and a water and electricity footprint akin to a 1 million inhabitant city. Its sustainable development manager, Arnaud Herrmann, explains that instead of offsetting, “we wanted to support projects that made sense with our own activities. The hotel industry is very water-intensive … and food and beverage represents about 40% of Accor’s turnover. So it was natural to support local projects committed to sustainable water and agriculture.” Teaming up with Pur Projet, Accor identified the potential to bolster community groups within its supply chain. One such project in Morocco planted olive groves and helped to set up a female-run olive oil business. “Women in the area can have trouble finding work,” says Herrmann, “so we provide the budget to plant the olive trees, the women of the region take care of the trees and transform the olives into olive oil, and part of the olive oil produced is sold back to our hotels.” Accor now has similar projects in other countries growing rice and vegetables. It also supports more traditional tree-planting for CO2 reduction, but does so only in areas close to its hotels that its clients can see. Herrmann believes this is valuable for marketing and customer loyalty. The coffee firm Nespresso has also committed to planting 10m trees by 2020, and plans to do so among its suppliers’ farms and surrounding ecosystems. “By planting trees in coffee farms,” explains Jérôme Perez, head of sustainability at Nespresso, “you are protecting the coffee bushes from heavy rain, and we know that adverse weather events impact a lot on the production of Arabica coffee in the last few years in Colombia. Trees also prevent landslides … I met with farmers in March this year [2014] who lost their entire farm due to a landslide. The trees protect the soil, the water, the biodiversity, and ultimately the sequestration of carbon. All of these elements are making insetting a very relevant approach.” Nepresso already has a direct relationship with its 60,000 suppliers through its own AAA sustainable quality programme, in partnership with Rainforest Alliance, and employs 300 agronomists to work directly with farmers. The appeal of offsetting for some businesses, however, is that it’s simple and done at arm’s length. Insetting by contrast sounds like a lot of work. “Initially it could be quite a challenge for businesses if that’s not how they typically operate,” says Christopher Stephenson, director at Plan Vivo Foundation, who recently ran a one-day capacity-building workshop on insetting. But he relates the experience of one business: “Offsetting for them was an expense, it was a cost line. They recognised that that could become a more strategic investment for the company. Instead of being a simple cost on their balance sheet, they can actually transform that into an investment, plus a fantastic communication and marketing tool.” While both Plan Vivo and Pur Projet are predominantly interested in agroforestry initiatives with smallholders in the developing world, both are clear that the insetting concept is bigger than that. “The term is obviously a derivative of offsetting, and offsetting is traditionally known around carbon,” says Stephenson. “But insetting can extend into other areas”. Tristan Lecomte, co-founder and president of Pur Projet, also told businesses at Davos last year that “insetting is a way to help companies to regenerate the ecosystem that they depend upon … to make the offsetting strategy more legitimate, more linked with the business.” A paper by Ecometrica also suggests insetting could extend to commuting or home insulation for employees, joint investment in energy efficiency projects with suppliers, or joint recycling schemes between companies within a neighbourhood or office complex. In a sense, insetting is nothing new. Sustainability has been spreading to supply chain management for some time, and many business CSR activities could be described as insetting. But rather than adding another term to the already overladen sustainability lexicon, it actually pulls several together, uniting sustainability and procurement at the same time. The Body Shop, Ben and Jerry’s and construction firm Costain are just a few examples of companies now working on active insetting projects. A business guide to insetting has also been produced, with Paul Comey of Sustainable Food Lab quoted as saying: “When you realise that you’re spending real money on carbon offsets, you start to wonder if you can spend that same money to strengthen your supply chain.” That, says Stephenson, is the point. “If this helps communicate the benefit of businesses working with their own supply chains in a more holistic, sustainable way, then that can only be a very positive thing.” Read more like this: The supply chain hub is sponsored by the Fairtrade Foundation.

"Scientists warn extreme sea temperatures could cause a “historic” coral reef die-off around the world over the coming months, following a massive coral bleaching already underway in the North Pacific. Experts said the coral die-off could be the worst in nearly two decades. Reports of severe bleaching have been accumulating in the inbox of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch programme since July.  A huge swathe of the Pacific has already been affected, including the Northern Marianas Islands, Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Hawaii, Kiribati and Florida. Some areas have recorded serious bleaching for the first time. “On a global scale it’s a major bleaching event. What it may be is the beginning of a historic event,” said Coral Reef Watch coordinator Dr Mark Eakin. In the Marshall Islands, bleaching of unprecedented severity is suspected to have hit most of the country’s 34 atolls and islands. The Guardian witnessed devastated expanses of coral that look like forests covered with snow. Warm water will soon begin hitting reefs in the southern Pacific and the Indian Ocean as the seasons and currents shift. Eakin said coral watch modelling predicts bleaching on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as early as January. Bleaching is caused by persistent increases in sea surface temperature. Just 1C of warming lasting a week or more can be enough to cause long-term breakdown of reef ecosystems. The worst coral bleaching event on record is a mass die-off during 1998. A massive El Niño event combined with climate change to raise global sea and air temperatures to never-before-recorded levels and killed around 15% of the world’s corals. 2014 has already surpassed 1998 as the hottest year recorded - with a mild El Niño still predicted in the new year. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a coral reef expert from the University of Queensland, said the current bleaching event was on track to be as bad or worse than 1998. “Many coral reef scientists are expecting something similar to 1997-98 to unfold in the next six to 12 months.” Eakin said even under a weak El Niño, bleaching could continue until 2016 – lasting twice as long as the 1998 event. High sea surface temperatures due to climate change are making El Niño a less decisive factor in coral bleaching. “Despite the fact that there’s really not a big El Niño, we’re seeing these patterns of severe bleaching. So what’s happening is, as global temperatures increase and especially as the ocean warms through the increase of carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases in the atmosphere, it’s warming the ocean so that it doesn’t take as big an El Niño to have the same effect on water temperatures,” said Eakin. Initial analysis of the Guardian’s photos from the Marshallese atoll of Arno showed its reefs could be added to the fast-growing list of seriously affected places. In less extreme temperatures bleached coral may not die completely.  But Karl Fellenius, a coral reef manager from the University of Hawaii said that in the Marshall Islands “it’s looking like the thermal stress was so profound that the corals died within days of getting bleached”. This does not augur well for the future of the world’s reefs under climate change. “The real problem is that recovery from a major bleaching event can take decades and these events keep coming back every 10 years or less… [Reefs] just don’t have time to recover,” said Eakin. The combined effect of rising temperatures and sea levels – corals can only survive near the surface – could mean the end for coral reefs in the next 50 years even if world leaders combine to keep global temperature rise below their target of 2C, said Hoegh-Guldberg, who was lead oceans author for the UN’s definitive climate science report. “Temperatures projected under even mild climate change scenarios may be too damaging to coral reefs for them to survive beyond the mid to late part of this century.”"

"When the news arrived from the White House on Tuesday that Barack Obama would veto the GOP’s Keystone pipeline bill – or at least “that the president would not sign this bill” as is – I thought back to a poll that the National Journal conducted of its “energy insiders” in the fall of 2011, just when then issue was heating up. Nearly 92% of them thought Obama’s administration would approve the pipeline, and almost 71% said it would happen by the end of that year. Keystone’s not dead yet – feckless Democrats in the Congress could make some kind of deal later this month or later this year, and the president could still yield down the road to the endlessly corrupt State Department bureaucracy that continues to push the pipeline – but it’s pretty amazing to see what happens when people organize.  The fight against the XL pipeline began with indigenous people in Canada, and spread to ranchers along the pipeline route in places like Nebraska. And then, in the spring of 2011, when the climate scientist Jim Hansen pointed out the huge pool of carbon in the Canadian tar sands, the fight spread to those of us in the nascent climate movement. We had no real hope of stopping Keystone – as the National Journal poll indicated, this seemed the most done of deals – but we also had no real choice but to try. And so people went to jail in larger numbers than they had for many years, and wrote more emails to the Senate than on pretty much any issue in history, and made more public comments to the government than on any infrastructure project in history. And all that effort didn’t just tie up this one pipeline in knots. It also scared investors enough that they shut down three huge planned new tar-sands mines, taking $17bn in capital and millions of tons of potential emissions off the table. And it helped embolden people to fight every other pipeline, and coal port, and frack field, and coal mine. The Keystone fights helped spur a full-on fossil-fuel resistance that now mounts a powerful challenge to the entire fossil-fuel industry at every single turn.  It’s not as if we’re winning the climate fight – the planet’s temperature keeps rising. But we’re not losing it the way we used to. If the president sticks to his word, this will be the first major fossil-fuel project ever shut down because of its effect on the climate. The IOU that the president and the Chinese wrote in November about future carbon emissions is a nice piece of paper that hopefully will do great things in the decades ahead – but the Keystone denial is cash on the barrelhead. It’s actually keeping some carbon in the ground. The fossil-fuel industry’s aura of invincibility is gone. They’ve got all the money on the planet, but they no longer have unencumbered political power. Science counts, too, and so do the passion, spirit and creativity of an awakened movement from the outside, from the ground-up. So the “energy insiders” of Washington are going to have to recalculate the odds. Because no one’s going to believe that any of these fights are impossible any more. "
"The Oceti Sakowin, the traditional name for my Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota peoples, are rising up to protect Mother Earth. We are mobilizing a resistance that could prove to be the game changer in the fight to stop the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and help shut down the tar sand projects in northern Alberta. Our resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline and other tar sand infrastructure is grounded in our inherent right to self-determination as indigenous peoples. As the original caretakers, we know what it will take to ensure these lands are available for generations to come. This pipeline will leak, it will contaminate the water. It will encourage greater tar sands development, which, in turn, will increase carbon emissions.  As Oceti Sakowin people, we cannot stand silent in the face of the potential ecological disaster that the pipeline promises our homelands, along with our brothers and sisters of the Cree and Dene First Nations in Alberta, where this carbon-intensive dirty oil comes from. Our acts of resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline are a perfect example of us wising up to the ongoing modern colonialist game, and a proactive step toward protecting future generations from the worst impacts of climate change. As indigenous peoples, as Oceti Sakowin, we were handed down the original teachings on how to live in balance with Mother Earth. We must see all aspects of life as related, to respect the feminine principle of creation and to maintain a sustainable relationship with the land. These tenets are antithetical to the extractive economy we are faced with today. The land, air, and water are commodified. Mother Earth is being drilled, fracked, clear-cut, and destroyed with such brutality. We are on the brink of climate catastrophe. In order to avoid drastic climate change, we need a moratorium on fossil fuel development and we need to invest in a zero carbon economy: our original teachings demand no less than this. The lack of proper consultation with tribal nations along the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline violates basic tenets of US Federal Indian Law and the principle of free, prior and informed consent recognized in international law. I applaud President Obama’s decision to veto any Congressional Keystone XL bill, but I also encourage him to respect indigenous people’s self-determination and our need to protect Mother Earth by rejecting the presidential permit for the KXL pipeline, too. I urge our allies to stand with Native people, heed our call for systemic change to how we create and utilize energy and the policies that regulate both, support our right to self-determination, and join our movement to protect the territorial integrity and sacredness of Mother Earth. Reject the Keystone XL pipeline. Shut down the tar sands. Let’s put an immense collective effort forward to ensure that each of our future generations have a healthier, far more sustainable world than what we have today. For that, my relatives, would be our greatest triumph."

"Solar entrepreneur Jeremy Leggett wagered this week that one of the major oil companies would renounce its hydrocarbon fantasies in the near future, and commit to the world of renewable energy. In the near future? I doubt that. But it will happen eventually. Where else is there to go, after all? Ever since Forum for the Future was established in 1996, we’ve spent a lot of time asking ourselves when that exit moment for an oil major might happen. One of our very first projects was with BP Solar, investigating the future market for solar power in the UK. We were predictably upbeat, as were our immediate colleagues in BP Solar. But the rest of the company paid not the slightest attention to our report.   There have always been good, far-sighted people in the big oil and gas companies. From time to time, they’ve succeeded in getting sufficient traction amongst their senior colleagues to make the prospect of becoming ‘genuinely integrated energy companies’ – investing as much in renewables, storage and energy efficiency as in hydrocarbons – more or less realistic.  That’s what provided the Forum with the rationale to continue working in partnership with BP and Shell. Our corporate guidelines mean we can only partner with companies that are at least capable of conducting their business ‘on a truly sustainable basis’. But with BP that moment came and went under the leadership of John Browne; and with Shell, that ‘integrated agenda’ pretty much died after Mark Moody-Stuart moved on. In both companies, the hydrocarbon supremacists rapidly regained the ground they’d lost; doing renewables as Corporate Social Responsibility was fine, but anything that threatened to go seriously ‘beyond petroleum’ was deemed to be deviant heresy.  But the truth of it is that we continued working with them anyway for some time. Maybe things would turn again, we told ourselves. Surely one of them would be sufficiently convinced by the grim science of accelerating climate change as to proactively plan an exit strategy rather than wait for that inevitable ‘too late’ reckoning coming down the track at them?  It didn’t happen. Worse yet, the lengths they went to to justify their continuing investments in new hydrocarbons (to the tune of billions of dollars every year) have become more and more extreme. Even the emergence of the ‘unburnable carbon’ analysis (with the headline that very significant percentages of already proven, extractable reserves of coal, oil and gas will need to stay in the ground to give us any chance at all of avoiding the spectre of runaway – and potentially irreversible – climate change) left them entirely unmoved.  Please remember that these are companies that employ some of the best scientists in the world, and who have explored in commendable detail various scenarios regarding the impact of climate-induced change. One of Shell’s scenarios is appropriately titled ‘Chaos’, but apparently without the remotest trace of irony.  And these are companies whose senior managers know, as an irrefutable fact, that their current business model threatens both the stability of the global economy and the longer-term prospects of humankind as a whole. Once knowledge of that kind has been internalised, for any individual, however well-meaning and ‘sincere’ they may be, it must get harder and harder to look oneself in the mirror every morning and feel anything other than moral regret.  It’s certainly got harder and harder for me to look them in the face knowing what they knew, and witnessing at first hand the intricate patterns of denial and self-deception that they were forced to adopt.  Without some kind of truly traumatic shock to the system (‘Macondo x 10’, as one of my erstwhile and most trusted colleagues in BP once described it), we came to the conclusion that it was impossible for today’s oil and gas majors to adapt in a timely and intelligent way to the imperative of radical decarbonisation. Although a small proportion of our total funding comes from oil and gas majors (for specific projects we believe have the potential to transform part of their value chain) and from companies that are involved in the offshore energy supply chain, we felt we had no option but to end our long-standing partnerships with both Shell and BP.  All oil majors are trapped by a short-term mandate that leaves little room for manoeuvre. Shareholder expectations still dominate, and are still largely untouched by any kind of ‘unburnable carbon’ analysis of the staggering amount of economic value now at risk. Plus, most people’s pension funds would take a massive hit if any of these companies proved me wrong and Jeremy Leggett right.  But there are all sorts of ways of mitigating that unforgiving short-term mandate – for instance, by dramatically scaling down investment in further exploration and development of new hydrocarbon assets, and by dramatically ramping up investment in cost-effective renewable energy and storage technologies. Knowing what we now know about man-made climate change, is that such an unreasonable demand?  This has been quite a painful journey for me personally. I so badly wanted to believe that the combination of reason, rigorous science and good people would enable elegant transition strategies to emerge in those companies. But we learn as we go. And go those companies surely will, if not in the near future."

"We are learning to see climate injustice. We see it in the distressing stories of lives destroyed, epic droughts, floods and typhoons, and families and whole peoples uprooted. Climate injustice is not at first glance a legal problem any more than climate change itself is: it is economic, political, scientific. And yet, year after year, it is to law we turn for a solution in the hope that each next round of climate talks will yield a binding international agreement.  Today, faced with the reality of the human cost of climate change, all around the world people are turning to law for help, seeking a remedy, redress, some guarantee that it won’t happen again. This is the challenge of climate justice.  So far, the law has not seemed up to the task. Indeed, as the recent report of an International Bar Association (IBA) Task Force (pdf) has shown, some of our laws, both national and international, apparently make climate action more rather than less difficult. The report, however, has plenty of suggestions for improvement. Here are five recommendations that are politically palatable and could make a big difference. We need to recognise that climate change has victims and give them a day in court. The report proposes that states adopt a “model statute on legal remedies for climate change” that can open doors to those directly affected by climate change. This is largely a matter of clarifying procedural rules. As a next step, the IBA has already embarked on drafting a model statute of this kind. It has been clear for a long time that climate change harms human rights. What has been less clear is whether courts can apply existing law and legal precedent to cover these violations. After all, the law was developed without the enormity and urgency of climate change in view. But, like other human rights harms, climate change has agents, victims and injuries. It does not require much legal imagination to make the causal connection. Politicians, lawyers and the international community can help by making the connection clear. At present, multinational corporations can escape carbon accountability in much the same way as they have often escaped responsibility for human rights violations caused by subsidiaries and suppliers abroad. As with human rights, what is needed is simple due diligence. The point must be to ensure that carbon emissions are counted right along the international supply chain, from sourcing to production to distribution to point of sale. When it comes to environmental disputes, states rarely make use of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the world’s principal court for international law disputes.  No climate-related actions have come to the court. There are political reasons for this, of course, but there are also concerns about the competence of the court to manage what are often highly technical questions.  The ICJ needs bolstering. Recent appointments to the court’s judicial panel may help. A recently-disbanded environmental panel could be reconstituted and strengthened. Courts are at least better than arbitration panels in these matters. But where states do choose arbitration, especially in disputes with investors over energy or environmental policy, everything should be fully transparent – not always the case today. The IBA also suggests making use of the environmental expertise at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. We need to make sure trade rules do not penalise climate actions such as low carbon trade policies. The same governments who have spent decades hashing out a climate agreement can more easily send ministers to the WTO to make this happen. At present, governments wanting to tax high-carbon imports, for example, may fear a slap from the WTO’s judicial authority. It is an easier matter by far to issue a ministerial declaration to the effect that such measures are lawful. Of course, similar measures ought to be included in all bilateral and regional trade agreements, such as the Transpacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership now under negotiation. These and any other future agreements need to be thoroughly vetted for long-term climate impacts before they are finalised. The IBA report has much more to say besides these recommendations and, in my view, ought to be mandatory reading for lawyers and policymakers everywhere. It is high time we began thinking seriously about preventing and redressing the human harm caused by climate change.

"The year was much more than the Lindt cafe, though 2014 will come to be remembered for little else. Most years have their hostage dramas, usually pathetic affairs that end with the sacked worker or the estranged husband putting down his gun and disappearing into jail. But this was the work of an Iranian-born madman in a year that’s seen the world alarmed by a new brand of terrorism with many names: the Islamic State, Isis and Isil. All the easy predictions for Australian politics in 2015 were junked in the hours of the siege. The killings in the Lindt cafe didn’t change Australia, but they will change the tenor of public life in this country for a long time. The theme song of politics is no longer the budget blues. The harsh critiques of Tony Abbott’s first full year in office now look provisional. Even so, 2014 was a terrible year for the new prime minister. Great trade pacts were signed; G20 brought the world leaders to Australia; the carbon tax is dead and gone; the seaborne invasion of Australia by refugees has been defeated; the Palmer United party has splintered under the strain – yet Abbott and his government have languished in public esteem. Pollsters have no precedent for such a slide in the fortunes of a first-term government. By New Year’s Day, the voters who put Abbott in office had already changed their minds. The Liberals are departing. How the Lindt cafe will play into this we don’t yet know. There was a moment after the terrorism scare in September when the graphs steadied. They may steady again. But in 2014 after that brief pause, the gap between the parties measured by Essential, Ipsos and Newspoll widened steadily month by month. In late November the Australian put its protege on notice. The paper has chided Abbott once or twice since he came to power. Those were mere tugs on the reins. The November editorial “The Abbott government is doomed without a narrative” marked rumbling in the political foundations. No Australian prime minister needs to be reminded of an iron rule of politics in this country: News Limited backs winners. No one disputes Abbott’s achievement in one key area in 2014: shaping political language. He has given the nation “team Australia”, “shirtfront” and – particularly lately – “death cult”. George Brandis offered his own take on “metadata” and Scott Morrison entrenched “on-water matters” as Canberra’s new way of saying: “Get lost, we’re not going to tell you”. This year began early with the death of a child in a village in Guinea. Children die easily in that country and no particular heed was paid, but two-year-old Emile Ouamouno was patient zero. His mother died a few days later, then his sister Philomène and, on New Year’s Day, his grandmother. All had shown the same terrible symptoms: fever, vomiting and black diarrhoea. The village of Meliandou lies in a remote corner of the country near the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia. Mourners returning home from the grandmother’s funeral carried the disease with them to their villages and a nearby city. Death began to stalk the region. Nurses died. Doctors fled. But it was more than two months before a team from the Ministry of Health arrived to investigate. Blood samples were sent to Lyon and Hamburg. On 24 March, news broke that the mysterious killer in Guinea was Ebola. By year’s end, nearly 7,000 people in six countries had died. Ebola reached the US and Europe. For a few weeks it seemed the disease might even land here. First and foremost, 2014 was a plague year. Australia’s response was grudging. This is new. Humanitarian gestures used to be our glory. But 2014 was a year we showed ourselves especially discriminating in the face of world challenges. Ebola: excuses, delay and a little money. Global warming: excuses, delay and slippery promises. Refugees: a shark net flung across the oceans. Foreign aid: cuts of $11bn over the next four years. Isis’s conquest of Mosul: deployment of the RAAF. Some years rush by. Not this 2014. It’s hard to believe, in December, that Schapelle Corby was released from her Bali prison in February. Kate and William were surely spinning their strange magic in another century? No, the royal tour was in April. Though an almost forgotten figure these days, the premier of New South Wales, Barry O’Farrell, glassed himself with an old bottle of Grange only in April. Time played this trick because, until its dramatic end, the year was strangely shapeless. It was one of long, slow slides. The slide of slides was the iron ore spot price: from US$135 at the start of January to below US$70 now. Iron is taking the nation down. Growth is slowing. Tax revenue is falling away. So are confidence, the share market and the dollar. The slide took Gina Rinehart 11 places down the Forbes list of the world’s 100 most powerful women. She now sits 27th, one spot behind Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat leader in the US House of Representatives. It’s tough for the Rinehart children: if the price of iron ore slips much further, there may be little point in them suing their mother. Savings have had to be made in Canberra, savings that show where the government’s heart lies. Not sacrificed in the welter of small economies was $245.3m to put chaplains into high schools for the next five years. How can such largesse be funded? Easy: by matching cuts of $254m from the ABC over the same five years. Even so, religion has had a mixed year, with a royal commission putting Christianity through the wringer. One cardinal, several bishops, priests, ecclesiastical officials, church lawyers and hellfire preachers found themselves in the least likely situation for men of the cloth: a witness box being cross examined about children raped and abused, their abusers sheltered and assets hidden from victims. The grim work continues. Rolf Harris, 84, was jailed in July on 12 counts of indecent assault of young women and girls. Other great judgments in 2014 include Oscar Pistorius, 28, for culpable homicide; Craig Thomson, 50, for stealing $5,650 from the Health Services Union; and Freya Newman, 21, for leaking details of the $60,000 scholarship awarded by the Whitehouse Institute of Design to the prime minister’s daughter Frances in 2011. No conviction was recorded in her case. Islamophobes in government ranks were hobbled. At the last minute, the minister for social services, Kevin Andrews, abandoned plans to deliver the opening address to the World Congress of Families in August where Islam, euthanasia, divorce and homosexuality were to come under hardline attack. Other no-shows were official congress supporters and Liberal senators Eric Abetz and Cory Bernardi. Bernardi is not easily stopped. After the dawn raids of September he tweeted: “Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust.” Thus began the brief great Canberra burqa panic of 2014. Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust Bronwyn Bishop, responding to the senator’s fears and baseless talkback rumours of black-clad demonstrators descending on parliament, ordered the segregation behind glass in the public galleries of all women with covered faces. None in burqa had ever been seen in parliament before. None appeared now. After an agony of public embarrassment which seemed to last far longer than a fortnight, the Speaker reversed herself. The raids that gripped Bernardi and the nation were carried out by 800 or so NSW and federal police, backed by Asio officers, in 16 suburbs of Sydney and Brisbane. Arrested and charged was Omarjan Azari, 22, whose tapped telephone call a few days earlier had provoked the security sweep. He’s now facing trial for preparing to commit a terrorist act. His barrister, Winston Terracini SC, claims the phone call was mistranslated. “There was at least one appalling error which goes to the absolute crux of whether this man ever actually acquiesced in the carrying out of a terrorist act.” Parliament passed two anti-terrorism laws in the aftermath of the raids. One gives the government power to punish Australians for travelling to no-go zones abroad. The second threatens journalists – among others – with prison for up to 10 years for unmasking undercover Asio agents or exposing Asio’s new “special intelligence operations”. Abbott has, after the shootings in the Lindt cafe, commended a third bill waiting in the wings: “We do face a very real threat from people who want to do us harm and who invoke this death cult ideology as a justification, and that’s why we put forward the metadata retention laws, that is why we are determined to deal with them as quickly as we can in the new year.” Freedom Abbott has not survived transition to government. “We are the freedom party,” an exuberant Abbott told the Institute of Public Affairs in opposition. “We stand for the freedoms which Australians have a right to expect and which governments have a duty to uphold.” To be fair, he was speaking at a particular time with a particular purpose: encouraging the Murdoch press to weather all scorn in the pursuit of Julia Gillard over her dodgy boyfriend Bruce Wilson, her home renovations and a 1992 AWU slush fund. News Limited sleuth Hedley Thomas had a cache of fresh documents and the revival of the scandal at this point was gold for Abbott. Thomas hardly needed the leader of the opposition’s encouragement. Over the years since he has written – or had a hand in writing – a further 89 stories about Gillard, Wilson and the slush fund totalling some 85,529 words. Unimpressed by this gargantuan effort was Dyson Heydon of the royal commission into trade union governance and corruption. Last week he concluded: “Julia Gillard did not commit any crime and was not aware of any criminality on the part of these union officials.” This was a year that proved predictions wrong. In March, after 12 years in office, the Labor government of South Australia survived another election. In June flame-haired Rebekah Brooks was acquitted on all charges arising out of the News of the World phone hacking scandal. In November, officer Darren Wilson of Ferguson, Missouri, was not sent to trial by a grand jury for killing unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Riots followed. And later the same month, the former president of Egypt Hosni Mubarak had charges over the sale of gas to Israel and the slaughter of protesters dropped by a Cairo court. Still awaiting justice in Egypt is Peter Greste, who is accused with two al-Jazeera colleagues of defaming Egypt on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood. Despite there being no evidence against him, Greste was sentenced to seven years in June. The Abbott government has pledged every effort to have the Australian journalist out of jail and home by his 50th birthday. He turned 49 in December. Frankly, 2014 was not a year in which the applause of the world rained down on Australia. Particularly narky were international refugee and human rights bodies that failed to enter the spirit of Australia’s war against the boats. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Antonio Guterres, took Australia to task for towing refugees back to Indonesia; for forcing refugees to live in camps on Manus Island and Nauru; for conditions in those camps; for doing a deal to offload refugees on Cambodia; and for repudiating, late in the year, the principle of non-refoulement, the historic obligation under international law not to return victims of persecution to their persecutors. “Would you have me abandon the policies that are working?” asked the minister for immigration, Scott Morrison. There’s another word for the lexicon of recent Australian political English: “working”. In December, Senate crossbenchers caved in to a threat so grubby it has already entered the history books: Morrison told them he would keep holding 100 or more children in detention on Christmas Island until they gave him absolute power to decide the fate of refugees in Australia. Malcolm Fraser raged at the senators for handing Morrison these “dictatorial, tyrannical powers” and “tearing up international conventions, practices of international law, all necessary if we are ever to establish a better and a safer world”. Of course 2014 wasn’t all brickbats. The world also had a number of bouquets to present Australia: But Stockholm disappointed. Though we had no Nobels in 2014, some splendid discoveries announced this year promise prizes down the track: But nothing beats Rome for discoveries. Pope Francis and Emeritus Pope Benedict joined forces in St Peter’s square in April to reveal that their predecessors, John XXIII and John Paul II, were saints. John has only a single miracle to his name but the recovery of Sister Caterina Capitani after stomach surgery is considered astonishing enough to earn his canonisation. Despite the removal of the nun’s stomach, pancreas and spleen, she continues to lead an active life having applied to her fistula a fragment of the bed sheet on which John died. According to reports, the dead pope appeared to her in a dream and declared: “Eat what you want.” On the food front: kale passed its peak. Cupcakes are dead. Mexican restaurants are opening on every corner. Meals are served on breadboards. Sharing is mandatory. Yotam Ottolenghi went mainstream. Ribs are big. Peruvians can no longer afford quinoa. While the 2:5 diet cuts a swath across Australia, real men are staying on Paleo. Topknots and woodcutter beards are it this year. Skin is still inked, a trend stimulated by the sight of rapper 360 (aka Matt Colwell) on Q&A in October with his tattooed neck in a suit, shirt and tie. Ties are back. Ditto suits, but tight. Men’s clothes are tight. Pants short. In July Ian Thorpe declared: “I’m not straight.” Despite his star power, coming out did not become fashionable for sportsmen in 2014, though the assumption that men’s professional sport is an absolutely heterosexual world was left looking more ragged than ever. The Sydney Convicts won the international gay rugby competition, the Bingham Cup. Attending the match in August was the governor of NSW, Dame Marie Bashir. Talk about camp: 2014 saw Tony Abbott bring back knights and dames. He called this “an important grace note in our national life.” Women’s fashion is dominated by sports luxe, that is, dressing as if always on the way to pilates. Hipster women try to look like librarians, sweet librarians. Twin sets and pearls are not out of the question. Dots are big. The fashion lead given this year by royalty is rather confusing: broderie anglaise and G-strings. Architects report their world is post-beige. Instead of limestone floors, Moroccan concrete tiles. Corrugated iron endures. Brass is back. The dressing room has swamped the walk-in wardrobe. Downstairs the look is industrial: black walls, knife-edge stainless steel and rough wood. The indispensable kitchen appliance of 2014 was the sub-zero fridge. The world continues to warm despite the best efforts of the Coalition. Last year was Australia’s warmest and the World Meteorological Organisation predicts 2014 will be the hottest recorded on the globe. The 21st century has so far delivered 13 of the hottest years ever recorded. And, by the by, investment in renewable energy in Australia this year dropped 70%. Abbott’s resolve in the face of these figures was, for much of the year, absolute. He withdrew funding from the Climate Council as soon as he was elected and in March abolished the Department of Climate Change. With the backing of coal miner Clive Palmer, the carbon tax was abolished in July and the Coalition’s Direct Action plan, which will cost $2.55bn over the next four years, became law in October. True, the Senate baulked at further destruction of Labor’s strategies, but these were significant political victories. At the opening of the Caval Ridge coalmine in central Queensland in October, Abbott declared: “Coal is good for humanity, coal is good for prosperity, coal is an essential part of our economic future, here in Australia, and right around the world.” But the prime minister was not bringing the public with him. Essential polls revealed in November that only 28% of us consider Australia is taking the right approach to climate change. And a bare 1% see bushfires, floods and cyclones as less likely in the future. Now, figures like that resonate with a prime minister. A ministerial tag team eventually flew to Lima for the UN climate change conference in December, and Abbott kicked $200m into the UN’s Green Climate Fund. In an Australian first, two ministers reproached a president of the United States. Barack Obama’s deal with China on his way to G20 and his pep talk to Queensland University students the day he arrived made him the least welcome US president since anti-war protesters lay in front of Lyndon Johnson’s motorcade in Sydney. But this was not 1966 all over again. This time, the students applauded and the government was outraged when Potus warned: “The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened.” This was a year of invasions. Crimea was in Russian hands by March. At this point, Russia also had troops fighting in eastern Ukraine. According to the UN, fighting there has already claimed 4,000 lives including 38 Australians among the 298 killed when flight MH17 was shot out of the sky. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, confronted Vladimir Putin in Milan and at G20 over the crash. He would promise only to assist access to the crash site. Fighting continues. Isis swept across Iraq in June, killing, raping, beheading and bombing in the name of the Caliphate. The rebels swiftly seized Iraq’s second city, Mosul, and established a regime of extreme Islamic law. According to the UN, more than 5,500 had been killed in the fighting by October. After kidnappings and rocket fire, Israel invaded Gaza in July. This was the third invasion of the Palestinian territory by Israel in the past seven years. The invasion ended in August, leaving 71 Israelis and 2,100 Palestinians dead. In November, in the far depths of space, after a 10-year journey, the European Space Agency placed little Philae on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Alas, it bounced and landed in the shade. Death cut its usual swath through Hollywood in 2014. Many gathered were of great age: Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, Joan Rivers, Eli Wallach and Maria, the last of the Trapp family singers. But some were too young to go: Robin Williams, 63, took his own life and Philip Seymour Hoffman, 46, was carried off by heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and amphetamine. Truly astonishing was the slaughter of great conductors in 2014: Claudio Abbado, once of La Scala and the Berlin Philharmonic; Lorin Maazel of the New York Philharmonic; Frans Bruggen of the Orchestra of the 18th Century; and Christopher Hogwood of the Academy of Ancient Music. Departing also was a phalanx of world leaders long past their years of power: General Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland; Ian Paisley of Northern Ireland; Eduard Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union and Georgia; General Ariel Sharon of Israel; Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier of Haiti and Gough Whitlam. Whitlam’s death in October provoked a truce not unlike – and not much longer than – the football games in no man’s land at Christmas 1914. For a brief time public life was seen at its best. Politicians behaved. Great speeches were delivered. Commentators – not all of them – put aside their old agendas. This couldn’t last, of course, but in death as well as life Gough reminded us of what we might be. But 2014 ended with flowers heaped in Martin Place in Sydney to remember two citizens killed by a madman who, for a moment, captured the attention of the world. Tori Johnson was the young manager of the Lindt cafe and Katrina Dawson, a barrister who worked upstairs, was among his many customers that morning buying chocolate and coffee. It isn’t time yet for them to rest in peace. The new year will be dominated by the search for answers to a single question: why did they die?"
"In his renowned 1998 study of power and rationality, the Danish social scientist Bent Flyvbjerg concluded: “Power determines what counts as knowledge ... while it ignores or suppresses that knowledge which does not serve it.” Tony Abbott used climate denial to support his purpose of bringing down the Rudd-Gillard government and gaining power, but it now seems to be a hindrance to his government.  During the 2013 election, Abbott walked a fine line, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with climate deniers. Then, on his first day as prime minister, he sacked the Climate Commission, the authoritative body set up by the previous Labor government to educate the public about climate change. A few months later, his mentor, former prime minister John Howard, spoke in support of climate change scepticism, saying he “instinctively feel(s) that some of the claims are exaggerated”.  Howard baldly admitted that he only agreed to act on climate change and to consider an emissions trading scheme in 2006-7 for political purposes. Later, a climate denier, Maurice Newman, was appointed as Abbott’s chief business adviser. Dick Warburton, another denier, conducted a review into the Renewable Energy Target. And research by the University of Technology, Sydney found Abbott had help in the media: nearly all of the 36% of coverage in Australian newspapers in 2012 that did not accept the scientific consensus on global warming was published by the Murdoch press. The Abbott government then commenced its well-documented destruction of environment and climate change laws, policies and programs – the supposed salve for which was the so-called Direct Action policy. It was continuously criticised for being unworkable, expensive and worse, that it would encourage “rent-seeking” and create a “subsidy culture”.  Then overseas support was sought for the Abbott government’s retrograde approach to the environment. The overreach became starkly obvious. In response to the failed attempt to delist 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian forests, the Portuguese delegation to the world heritage committee described the justifications presented as “to say the least, feeble” and slammed the potential move as “setting an unacceptable precedent”. While Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper stood with Australia on opposing carbon pricing in June, Abbott’s attempt to create a broader “conservative alliance” that also included Britain, India and New Zealand fell embarrassingly flat. David Cameron and New Zealand’s prime minister, John Key, both expressed strong support for global action on climate change, including emissions trading. The story of an alliance disappeared almost as quickly as it had arisen.  What was astounding was how poorly Abbott misread the views of his fellow conservatives. He seemed oblivious of the fact that a few months earlier Britain had joined France, Germany and Italy in calling for a raised EU emission reduction target of 40% by 2030. From then on, it only got worse. The New York Times reported on 2 January 2014 that John Kerry was determined to play a major role in brokering a global climate treaty in Paris in 2015, including by focusing the US relationship with China on the issue. You could have guaranteed that in closed-door meetings between Kerry and Julie Bishop, the US secretary of state would have spoken on the issue. Similarly, Abbott and his ministers would have been well-briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs on China’s commitment to a national emissions trading scheme to commence by 2016. So when Barack Obama and Xi Jinping, the two most powerful men in the world, announced a joint commitment on climate change in Beijing in November, what could Abbott say? He hadn’t been at the UN climate summit in New York in September, arriving instead one day later for a security council meeting. He hadn’t planned to send any ministers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conference of the parties in Lima in December. He certainly hadn’t planned to commit any Australia dollars to the international Green Climate Fund, dismissing such programs as “socialism masquerading as environmentalism”. He had steadfastly refused to have climate change on the agenda for the G20 in Brisbane. Then the leader of the free world came to Brisbane and “shirt-fronted” Abbott on climate change, giving a rousing speech noting “the incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened”. Abbott was subsequently forced to allow discussion of climate change and fossil fuel subsidies in the G20 communique and then, remarkably, he talked up the value of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Australia’s green investment bank which he has promised to abolish) in a bilateral meeting with French president François Hollande. Next, Julie Bishop put her foot down and told cabinet she was going to Lima. Abbott responded by sending Andrew Robb, another climate change denier, as a chaperone, catalysing a round of media speculation about Bishop’s leadership ambitions and potential. $200m was found for the Green Climate Fund.  Across the chamber, Bill Shorten has played this issue well. Abbott might have thought it was electoral suicide committing to reintroduce a price on carbon more than two years out from an election, after the “toxic tax” line seemingly worked so successfully against Julia Gillard. Time and events have changed the debate. People have not noticed the claimed extra money in their pockets from the carbon price repeal. They have noticed that emissions are again increasing. Advocates have also made much of the fact that more than 24,000 people are employed in the renewable energy industry and around three million voters now have solar electricity generators on their roofs. There are two major climate change questions for Abbott in 2015. The first is how will he deal with resolving the impasse over the future of the RET. Billions of dollars of investment are at stake. While Origin CEO Grant King has been campaigning against both the carbon price and RET for several years – and is said to have the ear of the prime minister – a successful industry and citizen campaign to save solar is raising the profile of the issue with voters. Will Abbott continue to advocate for polluting big businesses or will he agree to a compromise with Labor? The second is the question of narrative. In response to the dramatic Sydney bushfires in October 2013, Abbott said “these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they are just a function of life in Australia”. He then accused UN climate chief Christine Figueres of “talking through her hat” when she said (in general terms) bushfires are “absolutely” linked to climate change. To return to our Danish social scientist, Flyvbjerg notes that “in a democratic society, rational argument is one of the few forms of power the powerless still possess”.  The voices of the powerless are now being amplified: climate change stories are now being told by the most powerful men and women in the world. As bushfires rage, floodwaters rise and cyclones blow over the next year, how will the prime minister modify his language and use of the facts?  Gabrielle Kuiper was senior adviser on climate change, energy and environment to former prime minister Julia Gillard. She now works in energy policy and is a director of the Australian Solar Council."
"America has 2.5m miles of oil and gas pipelines. But none of those pipelines are anywhere near as contentious as the Keystone XL, which would transport tar sands crude oil from Canada to refineries on the US gulf coast. Over the past six-plus years, Keystone has become a stand-in for a broader debate about climate change. It’s also the subject of much myth-making about climate change and the economy. Below, a look at some of the most prominent of those myths, and the truth behind them.  The State Department said the pipeline would not have a significant impact on development of the tar sands or crude oil demand – and so would not have much impact on climate change. But even the State Department’s own analysis found found the pipeline, once operational, would cause the equivalent emissions of 300,000 cars a year, and it noted that tar sands were 17% more carbon intensive than the average barrel of US crude oil. Subsequent analyses by the Congressional Research Service have found tar sands up to 20% more carbon intensive than the average barrel of crude.  The American Petroleum Institute lobby group claimed in 2009 that Keystone would create up to 343,000 new US jobs over a four-year period, based on demand for new goods and services, and add up to $34bn to the US economy in 2015. However, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service found those estimates were based on an internal study that had not been subject to review. The State Department in its analysis found Keystone would create about 42,000 direct and indirect temporary construction jobs, and about 50 permanent jobs once construction is finished.  Canada already supplies up to 33% of US oil imports – more than Mexico and Saudi Arabia combined. “The energy security implications of increased Canadian crude supplies in a global market are, therefore, somewhat unpredictable,” the Congressional Research Service found. Most of the 830,000 barrels of oil a day transported by Keystone will be exported. There is a plan for a lateral spur, which will take up to 12% of Keystone XL capacity, for oil from the Bakken shale which covers North Dakota and Montana.  Gasoline prices are already at their lowest levels in decades, as any driver knows. Keystone will have no effect on local prices at the pump because there is no direct link between gas prices and local oil production or availability. Gas prices are determined by the international prices for a barrel of oil. "
"Climate change talks next year will be make or break for international efforts to curb global warming, with the credibility of the UN-backed process at stake, the outgoing EU climate chief, Connie Hedegaard, has warned. World leaders are expected to sign an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 onwards at a Paris conference in December 2015. It could be pivotal in climate negotiations, if China, the US and Europe agree to hold global warming within what scientists say are safe limits.  But the risks are great, according to Hedegaard, who recently left the post of European commissioner for climate action and hosted the Copenhagen climate talks in 2009. “Say Paris could not deliver,” she said to the Guardian. “Who would believe the UN process would have credibility after that? That is what [we need] to make leaders understand – it’s now.” At preparatory talks earlier this month in Peru, a framework was agreed for the coming year. Three of the world’s major economic blocs – Europe, China and the US – came forward with proposals on curbing emissions, but Hedegaard was adamant that these must be strictly scrutinised to ensure that no country shirks its responsibilities. “We need to know who is bringing what [commitments] in order to have time [before] Paris to see how all this adds up? Does it bring us closer to bridging the gap [between the world’s current emissions and the cuts needed to prevent more than 2C of warming], or are we more distant from it? Is it fair, is it not fair? That’s a difficult exercise.” For Paris to succeed,the world’s major economies would need to be ambitious about greenhouse gas emissions, she said. There are reasons to be optimistic. China’s decision in November to set a peak year on its emissions has brightened the prospects for a global agreement. “It is good that China accepts that their emissions [are] of interest to the whole world. I remember when [asking] the Chinese when their emissions would peak destroyed the good atmosphere in a room. I hope it will make India [and others] reconsider their strategy, and I see signs that the new Modi government is doing exactly this.” She also praised the US, which set new post-2020 carbon targets, that were announced jointly by President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping. “In 2009 [at the Copenhagen summit] China and the US played ‘after you, sir’ – none of them really moving. It makes a huge difference that they now move forward hand in hand and that they recognise their huge responsibility [as the world’s biggest emitters and economies],” she said. But Hedegaard, who played the lead role in getting governments to agree to meet in Paris, also had stern warnings. “2030 is a very late peak year for China,” she said. The later the peak year, the higher emissions would be before that. She also questioned the value of the US promise to cut emissions by 26-28%, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. “It is not certain how the US will deliver the 2025 targets – one year after Paris, Obama will be out of office.” Hedegaard knows how hard it will be to succeed. She presided over the Copenhagen summit, arguably the most important talks in 20 years of climate negotiations, which was attended by leaders from nearly every country on the globe, including Barack Obama, Wen Jiabao, Gordon Brown and Angela Merkel. Copenhagen ended with the most significant agreement on climate change to date – the first time developed and major developing countries had acquiesced to curbing their greenhouse gas emissions: a concord between the US, China, India, Europe and all the major emerging economies had been unthinkable only a few years before. But it was marred by scenes of chaos, with some leaders railing against one another. NGOs also criticised the outcome for falling far short of expectations. If Copenhagen was a “nightmare”, in Hedegaard’s words, two years later she came back with an audacious plan. Without Hedegaard, there would be no Paris conference. The process of forging a post-2020 climate agreement started with her extraordinary single-woman stand at the climate talks in Durban in 2011, where in the face of fierce opposition she pushed through a timetable for new negotiations that would culminate in 2015 with the signing of a global pact to come into force in 2020. She crafted a grand alliance of most of the world’s developing countries, and the tacit support of the developed world. By the end, only China and India refused to countenance the timetable, and the exasperation of those two countries was clear. It was a close-run thing. Even into the final minutes, after 48 hours of non-stop talks, all of the main participants were quietly briefing the Guardian that Hedegaard would cave. If she had done, the world would be without a way of tackling climate change. She did not. China and India backed down and Durban was a watershed. Hedegaard will not be part of the EU negotiating team in Paris – “I was never too keen, too fond of UN conferences” – and although she will be chairing a foundation with 1bn Danish kroner to spend on climate and the economy, it is unlikely to be her only new job. “I left politics as a 29-year-old – I was spokesperson in parliament for the prime minister’s party and I left – people couldn’t understand that. Then I went into journalism and I wrote, then I was head of radio news, then I was a minister, then a European commissioner. I’ve had the experience that yes, you say goodbye to something but always it has also been fantastic what came after,” she said. “I’ve been looking forward so much to a new chapter in my life.”"
"13 January   In January and May we heard news of the “irreversible decline” of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Stark headlines reported three studies of huge glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea that, if right, could mean a considerable sea-level rise over the next few hundred years. Interestingly, it isn’t a simple story of “humans cause global warming, ice melts”. While that’s true in some parts of Antarctica and Greenland, changes in the Amundsen Sea were triggered by water that’s already warm circulating under the ice. The jury’s still out as to whether human activities influenced this circulation in the past. But there’s reason to think we might make this and other triggers more likely in future. The big questions are: how long will this decline continue, how fast will it happen, and could it begin in other parts of Antarctica? I’m researching this fascinating story right now, so watch this space…Dr Tamsin Edwards, environmental scientist, the Open University 21 February Functional imaging techniques such as fMRI allowed us to ask many questions about the functions of healthy human brains. A study this year really raised the bar by looking at brain function in humans and in domestic dogs. Both species showed activity in the superior temporal sulcus when they listened to emotional sounds (from both humans and dogs), though both showed a greater brain response to their own species. Dogs are highly social, and humans have been argued to have selected for particularly relevant cognitive skills in our co-evolution with dogs – dogs are capable of learning to understand many spoken words and are one of the few animals to understand what pointing means. This, the first inter-species fMRI study, opens up a way of looking at these shared skills from a brain perspective. And it was made possible by training the dogs to lie still in the scanner, a necessity which may make the first human-cat study some way off.Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience, UCL 17 March My science story of the year was the announcement by a team of cosmologists in March that they had detected ripples in space left over from the birth of the universe. The results came from an experiment carried out at the South Pole called BICEP2, which detects weak microwave radiation from space using highly sensitive telescopes. I went on record saying I thought the discovery was worthy of two Nobel prizes: one for finding evidence of gravitational waves from the Big Bang and another for providing indirect evidence that our universe is not the only one, but is part of a “multiverse”. Unfortunately, the excitement didn’t last long. As part of their analysis, the researchers had used preliminary data taking into account space dust floating around the galaxy. By late May, a more careful reanalysis by scientists at Princeton concluded that the result had underestimated the effect of this dust, calling the whole discovery into question. Oh well, that’s science.Jim Al-Khalili, professor of physics, University of Surrey 25 June Three hundred years after the Longitude prize was first launched and a watchmaker named John Harrison revolutionised navigation at sea with the chronometer, the Longitude committee was reinstated and the public called upon to have their say on which of six challenges should be chosen for 2014’s £10m prize. I championed antibiotic resistance, which threatens a cornerstone of modern medicine, and am thrilled that it was chosen. The Longitude prize has not only allowed us all to play a part in shaping the future by deciding how science can be used to mitigate a global problem, but it is also spurring on the innovation and collaboration needed to further existing technologies so that a cheap, fast and easy to use point-of-care diagnostic test can be developed that correctly identifies bacterial infections. Thousands of individuals and organisations have already put forward their solutions. And perhaps, once again, the answer will come from a surprising and unexpected source.Liz Bonnin, TV presenter, Bang Goes the Theory 2 July I spent the afternoon of 2 July pretending to work while really being distracted by Nasa TV. In the dark and fog in California, a rocket was preparing to launch. The payload was the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, a satellite capable of making detailed carbon dioxide measurements from space. But this was Mark II, because the first version never got to orbit. In 2009, a “launch vehicle anomaly” had scuppered the first satellite designed to watch our planet breathe, and it burned up on re-entry before making a single measurement. The wait has been really frustrating. But this time everything went to plan, and OCO-2 is up above us now. The satellite will scan our planet in low-earth orbit, monitoring CO2 concentrations using spectrometers and reflected sunlight. We’ll be able to see where and when CO2 comes and goes with the seasons, mostly naturally but also with the help of humanity. In 2015, we’ll finally be able to watch our planet breathe.Dr Helen Czerski, physicist and oceanographer, UCL 30 July Can you imagine sitting still, in the dark and cold more than a kilometre beneath the ocean surface for 53 months? No, nor can I. But the story about the octopus mother who sheltered her eggs for more than four years described exactly that situation. There was even doubt that she had eaten during that time. That story obviously could be taken in an emotional way – the doting mother who gives up her all for the sake of her children-to-be (death after the eggs hatch seems to be the norm for these species). But there are also interesting scientific questions: does such a long gestation produce offspring better able to survive? What metabolic processes enable such a long, motionless, foodless existence for the mother? Or was this just a freak longevity that happened to be observed, rather than a typical gestation?Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at the University of Cambridge and master of Churchill College 6 October My science moment of the year was hearing that Professor John O’Keefe from UCL, along with Professors May-Britt and Edvard Moser from the Kavli Institute in Norway, had been awarded the Nobel in physiology or medicine for the discovery of a navigation system in part of the brain called the hippocampus. Their research revealed the neural mechanisms of how we remember routes and places, and it paved the way for an entire field of neuroscience dedicated to spatial memory and navigation. This was a great moment for British neuroscience, as much of the research was carried out in the UK. It was also a reminder that science is an international endeavour: O’Keefe is American and many of the brilliant researchers who have trained in his London-based lab are from other countries, underlining the value of enabling people from all over the world to come to the UK for scientific training.Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience 31 October When in 2009 Virgin Galactic announced that it would be taking orders for its first commercial space flights I was one of many to rush to buy a ticket. Five years later the ticket price of $250,000 is still beyond my means, but I don’t begrudge those rich enough to sign up. Space is a new frontier and if I’m ever going to have a chance to go, then engineers proving that it is possible have to be funded somehow. So I felt huge disappointment, and sympathy for the family of the pilot, when the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo blew up on a test flight on 31 October. Up until this point this new space ship design had been making steady but slow progress towards full operation. The root cause of the crash is not yet known, but as a result of this setback the chances of commercial space flight this decade have receded significantly.Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society, UCL 13 November It wasn’t the astonishing shots from Philae landing on Comet 67P, it was the cameras pointing the other way. As the message of touchdown beamed into the Rosetta mission control, the Open University’s brilliant professor of planetary sciences, Monica Grady, was leaping around like – well like what? Not a footballer scoring a goal, because she was without ego or histrionics. No, Monica Grady was bouncing and yelling like a scientist. There are very few moments in a scientist’s career when something truly extraordinary comes to fruition after decades of work – most of us will never experience it. But thanks to a project that seized the public imagination and showcased humankind’s terrific ability to reach beyond our grasp, we all got to share in the purest joy of success. Monica describes herself as “short, round, bespectacled, busy and bossy”. I’d like to add to that “joyous”. May the stereotype of old haywire men with unkempt hair be banished for ever. Scientists are just people, but this is what discovery feels like.Dr Adam Rutherford, presenter, Inside Science, Radio 4 3 December Earlier this month, publication of a study in Nature sent shock waves through the science of human origins. The report included a description of one find in particular that pulls off that trick – so common in palaeontology and archaeology – of carrying huge import while looking quite fantastically unremarkable. But when I looked at the photo of the half-a-million-year-old shell from Indonesia I was excited beyond words. This was just a mussel shell – but with an incised, zigzag pattern. Made not by modern humans, nor by Neanderthals, but etched by some earlier species – probably Homo erectus. Archaeologists and anthropologists have agreed that creating geometric patterns is “modern behaviour”. Before this shell, the earliest geometric pattern we knew of was on a piece of ochre from Blombos Cave in South Africa, dating to around 75,000 years ago – comfortably within the time-frame of Homo sapiens. But what this shell means is that the “modern mind” is much more ancient than we’d ever imagined.Alice Roberts, professor of public engagement, University of Birmingham 5 December The Orion capsule’s successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean a few hundred miles west of Baja, California, did it for me this year. Redolent of the days of Apollo, it represents the first tangible hardware that might carry us once more outside the confines of low Earth orbit. Orion is a vehicle set to become the foundation of the state of the art in Nasa’s programme of human exploration, with space station, the moon, Mars and destinations beyond in its potential repertoire. Human space flight is hard. We wrap bubbles of artificial life support inside capsules and mount them on the top of launchers with terrifying explosive capacity. We do that in the hope that neither the vehicle nor her crew are destroyed in the process. Making systems like that work with reliability you’d be willing to bet your life on is no easy task. December’s test flight saw an unmanned Orion capsule flung into a high elliptical orbit, travelling further from Earth and faster than any human-rated vehicle in more than 40 years. There’s plenty more mileage that needs to be covered yet before we can achieve our wider interplanetary goals but that splashdown was, for me, one of human spaceflight’s all important small steps.Dr Kevin Fong, associate director, Centre for Altitude, Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, UCL 8 December Amid all the economic gloom and the mixed news about climate change, 2014 has marked the exciting moment when the price of clean, low-carbon solar electricity approached that of oil, gas, and nuclear without subsidy. Thin-layer semiconductors, materials that conduct electricity poorly in the dark but allow electrons to flow freely when the sun shines, lie at the heart of this technology. Though silicon dominates the market, chemists are making huge progress. Cells based on cadmium telluride, a much less energy-demanding material than silicon, and lead-halide perovskite, a revolutionary substance only discovered in 2009, have both reached efficiencies around 16-17% this year, threatening to knock silicon off its perch. And other more complex systems are pushing past 40%. But even without these developments, the price for silicon cells has dropped so dramatically that you can even buy panels at Ikea. Spread the word. Green electricity is here to stay.Andrea Sella, professor of materials and inorganic chemistry, UCL"

"It is worth recalling that world leaders all agreed to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change as long ago as 1992 at the Earth summit in Rio (Poorer countries demand more from rich on climate change, 13 December). Anything agreed in Paris next year will not be implemented until 2020 at the earliest, and will probably be voluntary. There will be no independent monitoring, so countries can continue to emit carbon while their leaders pay lip service to the need to tackle global warming. Since 1992, annual emissions of carbon dioxide have increased by 60% globally, and the rate is accelerating.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • It will be “nose-peg time again” (Letters, 12 December) here in Yorkshire if Labour forms a government with a weak response to the risks of fracking. Locals suffered the stench of escaping gas before Rathlin closed down its shale-gas exploration well at West Newton recently. We have just found out there was also a fire in the well. Despite strong opposition to fracking from local Labour and Green activists, national Labour policy continues to support regulation rather than an outright ban.Val and Jon MagerBeverley, Yorkshire  • A propos the Belo Monte project in Brazil (Report, 16 December), it must be noted that none of the indigenous territories in the Belo Monte influence area will be flooded as a result of the project, nor will the indigenous population have to be resettled.

"On a day when much of the US struggled with bone-chilling cold, federal meteorologists said America’s weather in 2014 wasn’t really that bad. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced on Thursday that the US average temperature in 2014 was half a degree warmer than normal and that weather was less disastrous and drought-struck than in previous years. While 2014 was warmer than 2013 in the lower 48 states, it was still only the 34th warmest on record.  That contrasts with the experience of the world as a whole. Globally, it will probably go down as the warmest year on record. Japan’s meteorological agency has already calculated 2014 as the warmest year worldwide. The NOAA and NASA will announce global 2014 figures next week, but data through November points toward a new record. The US covers only 2% of the world’s surface; eastern North America was about the only exception to the “hot” rule globally last year, and even that chill was outweighed nationally by record heat in the west, said NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch. It was the 18th straight year US temperatures were warmer than the 20th-century average. “This fits within the context of a long-term warming trend both here and around the globe,” Crouch said. California, Nevada and Arizona had their hottest year in 120 years of record keeping, while Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and New Mexico each had one of their five warmest years on record. Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Wisconsin and Michigan each had one of their 10 coldest years on record. “It was a strange year for the US,” said University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles. “The extreme warmth and droughts in the western US and the extreme cold winter and cooler summer in the east and midwest were largely driven by blocking patterns at high latitudes in the Arctic.” Wuebbles said those blocking patterns meant warmer Alaskan temperatures and cold invasions south – such as last January’s (and, probably, this week’s) deep chill. For the first time in 101 years of record keeping, Anchorage, Alaska, never got below zero in 2014, Crouch said. Last year there were eight weather disasters that caused more than $1bn in damage, according to the NOAA. The last five years have averaged 10 such billion-dollar disasters each. Munich Re, an international insurance giant, calculated that natural disasters – including earthquakes – caused $15.3bn in US insured losses in 2014, down from an average of $29bn between 2000 and 2013. The area of the US affected by drought shrank 2% from 2013, yet California’s historic drought continues, the NOAA said."

"According to figures from Nasa, parts of the northern United States are currently experiencing temperatures considerably colder than those on Mars. The high “air” temperature on Mars, according to the latest data from Nasa’s Curiosity Rover, occurring in the Gale crater near the Red Planet’s equator, hit a balmy daytime high of 17.6F (-8C).  This means that, comparing day for day, Mars was nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than Chicago on Thursday, and almost 12 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than Detroit.  Green Bay, Wisconsin, makes the Gale Crater look like a positively attractive holiday destination. It was nearly 15 degrees colder on Thursday than the crater – and that’s before you factor in the wind chill of Earth’s atmosphere. All in all, parts of Washington, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire, much of upstate New York and almost all of Maine and Minnesota were colder than the Red Planet on Thursday. Mars has just passed its perihelion – the moment when its orbit brings it closest to the Sun. But even so, it is more than 50m km farther from the Sun than the Earth is. Still, if you’re starting to get jealous of the robot currently enjoying the Martian sunshine, this might cheer you up: once the sun goes down the temperature plummets, meaning Curiosity is set for a nighttime low of around -144F.  Bruce Sullivan, a meteorologist for the US National Weather Center, said it was “interesting” that the temperature on Mars was higher than in parts of the US right now, but he demurred when asked if “colder than Mars” might become the organisation’s new benchmark for “really cold”."
"The numbers are in. The year 2014 – after shattering temperature records that had stood for hundreds of years across virtually all of Europe, and roasting parts of South America, China and Russia – was the hottest on record, with global temperatures 1.24F (0.69C) higher than the 20th-century average, US government scientists said on Friday. A day after international researchers warned that human activities had pushed the planet to the brink, new evidence of climate change arrived. The world was the hottest it has been since systematic records began in 1880, especially on the oceans, which the agency confirmed were the driver of 2014’s temperature rise. The global average temperatures over land and sea surface for the year were 1.24F (0.69C) above the 20th-century average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) reported. Nasa, which calculates temperatures slightly differently, put 2014’s average temperature at 14.67C – 0.68C above the average – for the period 1951-80. The scientists said 2014 was 0.07F (0.04C) higher than the previous records set in 2005 and 2010, and the 38th consecutive year of above-average temperatures. That means nobody born since 1976 has experienced a colder-than-average year. “Any one year being a record warm one is not in itself particularly significant, but this is one in a series of record warm years that are driven by the continuing underlying long-term global warming,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies. “We expect that heat records will continue to get broken – not everywhere and not every year – but increasingly, and that does not bode well for a civilisation that is continuing to add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere at an increasing rate.” “It is not just 2014, but the long-term trend, so we may anticipate further records in the years to come,” Schmidt said. The odds of that temperature shift occurring because of natural climate variability were less than one in 27 million, according to the Climate Central research group. “The data from Nasa and Noaa is the latest scientific evidence that climate change is real, and we must act now to protect our families and future generations,” said Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat and climate champion. “Deniers must stop ignoring these alarms if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.” The findings from Nasa and Noaa were in line with reports from the United Nations weather organisation, the UK Met Office and Japan’s meteorological agency confirming the steadily upward march of temperatures over the last decades. Thirteen of the 15 hottest years have occurred since 2000. “Nineteen eighty-eight was also a record warm year at the time. Now it doesn’t even rank in the top 20,” Schmidt said. “We can safely say it’s probably the warmest year in 1,700 and 2,000 years, and I think it’s probably safe to say 5,000 years,” said Don Wuebbles, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois who has worked on a number of IPCC reports. “You have a continuous upward trend over the last century and that is telling us something. We have a clear signal that our climate changing, and when you look at the evidence it’s because of human activities.” “The evidence is so strong I don’t know why we are arguing any more,” Wuebbles said. “It’s just crazy.” The last record cold year was more than a century ago in 1911. The scientists noted that the 2014 record occurred without the help of a strong El Nino, a global weather phenomenon known for pushing more heat into the atmosphere. Campaign groups said the milestone ought to spur new efforts to fight climate change. “The Obama administration must back international efforts to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050,” said Shaye Wolf, the climate science director with the Center for Biological Diversity. “We need a global agreement that keeps most dirty fossil fuels in the ground and provides ample support for developing nations to leapfrog into clean energy economies.” On the current emissions trajectory, the world will attain warming of 4 or 5C by 2100, which climate scientists say would be catastrophic.  Ocean surface temperatures were far warmer in 2014 than any year on record, especially in the northern Pacific. In April, westerly winds began spreading that very warm water out along the equator to the eastern Pacific and around to the Gulf of Alaska – releasing heat that had been locked in the depths for nearly a decade. The unusually warm waters shifted hurricane tracks, weakened trade winds, and led to widespread bleaching of coral reefs in Hawaii. Vast expanses of the north-western and south-eastern Atlantic, most of the Norwegian Sea, and parts of the central to southern Indian Ocean were also extraordinarily warm. Global sea-surface temperatures were 1.03°F (0.57°C) above the 20th-century average. On land, temperature records toppled almost everywhere. Much of Europe and parts of North Africa sweated out heatwaves. England saw its hottest year in three and a half centuries, according to the Central England Temperature data set. Nearly every weather station set new records. Transport crew in Norway had to hose down runways to prevent them buckling in the heat. Finns were warned they may soon face Decembers without snow. Australia had a series of heatwaves. “Every continent had some aspect of record high temperatures,” Thomas Karl, director of Noaa’s National Climatic Data Center. For North America – aside from California and Alaska – it was the opposite story. The year was so cold it spawned two new meteorological terms: polar vortex for the Arctic blast at the beginning of the year and lake effect, for the 2ft of snow dumped on Buffalo in November. But California saw its hottest year, with annual average temperatures 4.1F (2.3C) higher than 20th century average, and scant relief for a punishing drought. Elsewhere, Argentina was plagued by water shortages and power blackouts as extreme heat engulfed South America, setting new temperature records in Brazil and Bolivia. The year also brought heavy rainfall and flooding in some countries. Parts of Turkey saw five times the normal amount of rain, and France experienced its wettest summer since 1959. Rivers broke up earlier than ever recorded in Siberia. Millions of people were affected by heavy rains and severe flooding in northern Bangladesh, northern Pakistan and India. Sea ice extent was below average on the Pacific side of the Arctic and near-average on the Atlantic side. It was another year of declining sea ice in the Arctic. However, Antarctica actually saw the highest sea ice extent. “There are some interesting things going on in Antarctica,” Nasa’s Schmidt said.  • This article was amended on 26 January 2015. An earlier version said incorrectly that “Britain saw its hottest summer in three and a half centuries” last year."

"Australia is pressing ahead with huge new coalmining projects, just as a new study has calculated that more than 80% of the world’s current coal reserves must remain in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change. The research, by the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, found that globally a third of all oil reserves, half of all known gas deposits and 82% of coal capacity would have to remain unused by 2050 if the world was to remain within an internationally agreed limit of 2C warming compared with pre-industrial times. The report found the world needed to stay within a carbon dioxide “budget” of 1,100 gigatonnes emitted between 2011 and 2050 to have at least a 50% chance to avoid more than 2C warming. That level of warming is considered to have highly damaging consequences for human health, coastal infrastructure, food production and endangered species. Despite its commitment to the 2C warming limit, Australia is pushing ahead with a massive escalation in its coal output, with prime minister Tony Abbott declaring in October that coal is “good for humanity” while warning against any “demonisation” of the fossil fuel. Nine new coal projects are earmarked for the Galilee Basin region of central Queensland, producing a combined 330m tonnes a year at capacity. This coal, destined for export to countries such as China and India, would produce an estimated 705m tonnes of CO2 when burned – substantially more than Australia’s entire annual greenhouse gas emissions of 542m tonnes.  Several international financial institutions have rejected funding the largest of the Galilee Basin mines, Adani’s Carmichael project, but the Queensland government has stepped in to provide taxpayers’ money for construction, citing the jobs the mine would create. Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the Australian government’s energy policies “fly in the face” of the need to avoid digging up the vast majority of known coal reserves. “Rather than acknowledge the problem and transition energy sources over time, Tony Abbott is wedded to an idea of digging up coal as fast as possible before we’re not allowed to do so, which is a globally irresponsible position,” he told Guardian Australia. “At the current price of thermal coal, the profit margin is zero. It makes no sense to sponsor these projects when the world is awash with coal. Why is Queensland providing millions of dollars to projects that aren’t commerciallly viable? Why does a project funded by a foreign billionaire need taxpayer subsidy?” Buckley said Abbott’s argument that coal could lift people in developing countries out of poverty was “a highly embarrassing parroting of a coal industry PR campaign”. Victoria McKenzie-McHarg, climate campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia was “completely out of kilter” with the required action to avoid dangerous climate change. “Tony Abbott and [Queensland premier] Campbell Newman have bent over backwards to push through coal projects and side with polluting mining companies over the need to protect Australians from climate change,” she said. “If we become the greedy polluter, it puts unfair pressure on developing nations to cut their emissions when Australia has been one of the largest polluters for so long. We have a responsibility to clean up our act and take advantage of our real natural resources, such as wind and solar.” But the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) disputed the findings of the report, stating that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made it clear last year that carbon capture and storage technology would ensure that fossil fuels could remain widely used. “The report’s apparent conclusions are at odds with a series of recent forecasts by a range of respected international bodies, including the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” said Brendan Pearson, chief executive of the MCA. “Those reports show that addressing climate change, eradicating energy poverty and a continued strong future for Australia’s energy sector are not mutually exclusive goals.” Pearson said the International Energy Agency’s 2014 outlook showed that the global coal trade was set to grow by 40% by 2040, with Australia forecast to regain its ranking as the world’s top coal exporter by 2030. According to the UCL institute’s paper, published in Nature, companies spent $670bn last year searching for and securing new fossil fuel deposits. The research was funded by the UK Energy Research Centre."

"Celebrities and campaigners including Matt Damon, Bill Gates, Jody Williams and Malala Yousafzai are joining forces to launch an international campaign to persuade the planet’s leaders to make 2015 the defining year in the fight against world poverty and climate change. The campaign action/2015 – which launches on Thursday backed by more than 1,000 organisations across 50 countries – is focused on securing successful outcomes for two pivotal UN summits, one in September on remodelled development goals, and the other in December in Paris on a new international agreement on climate change.  In Britain, the campaign’s specific aim is to ensure politicians do not put the issues on the backburner during a general election that will inevitably be dominated by domestic issues. In a letter to David Cameron, the celebrities, businessmen and Nobel peace prize winners tell the prime minister that the summits represent “the opportunities of a lifetime, yet with months to go few leaders are playing the leadership roles we need”. They add: “If this does not change, we fear you and your fellow leaders could be sleepwalking the world towards one of the greatest failures of recent times.” Other signatories include Bono, Desmond Tutu, Richard Branson, the entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim, the actor Aamir Khan, the Avaaz network founder Ricken Patel and Queen Rania of Jordan. Cameron, who flew to the US on Wednesday, met some of the campaigners before he left. And in a speech on Thursday, Ed Miliband will endorse the campaign. The Labour leader will say: “I know tackling climate change, global poverty and inequality are not as fashionable as they once were. But I also know they are more important than ever. “For me, they are not luxury items in our programme for change. They are not part of a branding exercise. They go to the heart of my beliefs and the reason why I entered politics.” Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, also acknowledged the campaign’s importance, saying: “Whatever the colour of the next government, I want the UK to seize 2015 as a crucial opportunity to take big global decisions.” The campaign’s vast international scale has meant the aim at the outset is as much raising awareness of the importance of the summits as pushing specific demands. The goals include: • An end to poverty in all its forms, including UK backing for zero-based targets in strategic development goals such as poverty and child mortality. • Meeting fundamental rights and tackling inequality and discrimination, and for this to be a priority for the UN framework agreement. • An accelerated transition to 100% renewable energy, requiring UK commitment to this as the long-term goal for UN climate change negotiators. Speaking for action/2015, Ben Jackson of Bond, the umbrella body for UK non-governmental organisations, said: “If we get this wrong, we could see the number of people living in poverty increase for the first time in our generation. But if we get it right – tackle poverty, inequality and climate change – we could eradicate extreme poverty within a generation. “The UK has the potential to play a critical galvanising role on these issues, but we’re worried, with a UK election in the middle of the year, they might take their eye off the ball.” According to new research, almost a billion extra people face a life of extreme poverty if the two summits fail to agree ambitious goals backed by financing packages. The data, released by the action/2015 coalition, shows that the number of people living in extreme poverty – defined as less than $1.25 (80p) a day – could be reduced dramatically from more than 1 billion to 360 million by 2030. Based on work by the University of Denver, in the year 2030, about 4% of the global population would live in extreme poverty, compared with 17% today, if critical policy choices on inequality, poverty investment and climate change are made this year and implemented thereafter. Under the best case scenario the number of people living in poverty could be reduced to 360 million by 2030. In the worst case scenario the number of people living in poverty could increase to 1.2 billion, a difference of 886 million."

"Two energetic and extraordinarily knowledgeable scientists from Australia have worked tirelessly for years to help us better quantify our changing climate. Dr. Susan Wijffels and Rebecca Cowley are a complementary team that has dramatically improved ocean measurements and set a standard for quality. As I’ve written before, “Global Warming” is, in truth “Ocean Warming.” The vast majority of the extra energy that enters our climate system ends up in the oceans. But measuring the long-term increase in ocean heat is a major challenge. First, we need accurate measurements that can tell us how much energy is contained in the waters. Second, we need those measurements to be made for years and decades so that long-term trends can be identified.   So how would someone measure the vast oceans? Well, over the past century or so, a comprehensive measurement system has evolved from buckets, to mechanical devices, to bottles, until our modern Argo float system. But as the measurement methods change over time, they introduce uncertainty and potential biases in the archived data. Without understanding the past accuracies and biases, we cannot quantify the long-term increase in ocean heat content. And this is where Dr. Wijffels and Cowley come in. While both Susan and Rebecca are extremely busy, between writing papers, planning new scientific studies, arranging oceanographic cruises, or deploying ocean instrument, I was able to get some of their time to learn more about them. I asked these scientists a few questions to learn more about their background, what motivated them to get into science in general and oceanography in particular. Rebecca Cowley studied aquatic biology and chemistry at Deakin University in Australia. She moved to the climate-science group CSIRO as a hydrochemist and spent years as a sea-going nutrient/oxygen/salinity chemist. There, she built her programming and quality control skills and found that she could transfer these new skills to oceanography. Her unique combination of skills, of chemical and physical oceanography along with computer programming and data quality, was much needed by the climate community. Now, she spends much of her time at sea collecting data and working with international collaborators to improve the quality of historical data for other researchers. One of her most impactful contributions to the field is her leading role on data quality. How do we know that the information collected across the Earth’s climate are accurate? What standards can be put in place to ensure continued high quality data? What impact does measurement accuracy have on our emerging understanding of climate? These are the questions she asks and answers. When I asked her about her background, she told me,  I became a scientist because I liked solving problems and balancing chemical equations. The most fun I had at school when I was in the lab doing experiments. Science was exciting and different and not many people went into science degrees. I didn’t get into physical oceanography immediately, gradually developing and changing my skills. There were no obvious aha moments, but I did know what I didn’t enjoy doing and naturally moved away from that and got better at what I did enjoy doing.  I also asked what advice she might give the next generation of scientists. Her response was,  Be flexible and find work that you enjoy. Don’t expect that what you start out doing will be what you end up doing. I asked similar questions to Dr. Wijffels, Research Oceanographer at CSIRO in Australia. She has a BS with honors in Earth Sciences and a PhD in physical oceanography. She told me that she has always been interested in science. Way back as a child, she avidly read science magazines which her mother acquired. She specifically remembers reading about the different climates on various planets and the importance of the ocean in making our planet hospitable. By the time she was in high school, she knew she wanted to be an oceanographer. I wanted to know if she has had any “aha” moments. She said absolutely. In fact, very recently with her student Paul. They discovered a “beautiful and repeating pattern of long-term salinity change in each of the ocean basins.” It turns out they are ocean fingerprints both of long-term warming but also water-cycle intensification.  Dr. Wijffels has worked on many key oceanographic areas in her career. Some of the most important contributions she has made was on understanding the Indonesian Throughflow. She has also made great contributions to changes and patterns in the oceans. In fact, her research has forced her to dig into old oceanographic data; she has become a bit of a historical archivist. She is also proud of being a participant in the Argo project which has revolutionized out access to high-quality ocean data. Dr. Wijffels and her team are building long and precise climate records; not just for her peers but for future generations. What advice does she have for upcoming researchers? First, take a step back and ask yourself what problems can you tackle that will have an impact on advancing our understanding of the Earth. She also recommends that working in multiple countries provides great experiences that young researchers should think about pursuing.  After meeting and talking to Dr. Wijffels and Cowley, I remember back to what inspired me to get into science. I hope they inspire others to pursue scientific exploration."

"It would be an understatement to say that a lot happened in 2014. There was pervasive civic and social unrest across the US, bringing issues like racism and justice to the forefront yet again, as well as a historic agreement with China to mitigate carbon emissions. Meanwhile, India enacted a law requiring companies to spend 2% of their net profits on social development, the Philippines suffered yet another big typhoon, and the Ebola crisis killed more than 7,000 people in west Africa. Then there were the media shakeups, including buyouts at the New York Times, a mass exodus at the New Republic and a shift in Bloomberg’s top ranks.  But front and center in my universe as a close – and often vocal – observer and practitioner of corporate social responsibility and sustainability was climate: call it the “water-energy nexus,” the “resources dilemma,” or another variant. But in 2014, every sector of our industrial economy felt the weight of climate change.   More significantly, many more people began to interweave the repercussions of a changing climate with issues – like poverty, urbanization, lifestyles, economic standards and community development – that had previously appeared as separate prongs on any impact chart. (Remember the cute versions of the “triple bottom line” separating social from environmental and economic issues?) And, as a result, we saw the needle move.  Corporations like Unilever set ever more aggressive and inclusive goals and created marketing plans to persuade others to join. CVS Caremark disrupted its sector by announcing that it would stop selling tobacco and would rebrand itself as CVS Health to better align its brand with its goals. And for policymakers, the year saw clear action from US President Obama, bolder commitments from the European Union and new willingness to understand climate science – and shift its energy plan accordingly – from India. So as we head into what promises to be the most tumultuous year yet for sustainable business, here are some of the themes I expect to dominate our decisions and strategy whiteboards.  Based on its annual data, CDP forecasts the impact of a warmer planet and climate change will be felt in as little as four to five years. Take a look at its Global Water Report for example, or the S&P 500 Climate Leaders report, which rates companies on climate readiness and market volatility for the first time. Expect these forecasts to assume practical proportions and get embedded much more strategically into risk management and business development plans. And plan to become best friends with your investor relations department and the chief financial officer’s office. Some companies are already putting an internal price on carbon, for instance, to educate their investments (think Microsoft).  Others are starting to marry emissions with market performance, community health, urbanization and the sundry other elements that, ultimately, dictate growth. Keep an eye out for new standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board – which just issued provisional standards for 10 service industries, for example – and for Bob Willard’s Future Fit Business Benchmark. The next phase of the UN’s Millennium Development Goals, fittingly termed the Sustainable Development Goals, shift priorities from insular goals like reducing poverty and increasing hygiene to more inclusive and integrated ones that push for systemic change like the rule of law, dignity and prosperity for all. The implications are significant. And business is being called on to provide active support for the first time. This presents an unprecedented opportunity to tie businesses’ growth to their communities and the environment. For the first time, capitalists are welcome and actively needed at the table. This marks a key acknowledgement that determining our path forward as an interconnected economy will require the tensile strength of every single sector.  So how do you make sure your business is syncing its growth plan with the new UN goals? How do you get past the loftiness and map the real changes that are needed against the trajectory of your business plan? You’ll want to start by investing in some scenario planning. If a majority of your supply chain works in Bangladesh, for example, you’ll need to ask: are you equipped to handle disruptions from hurricanes and floods in the region and the consequential loss of life and infrastructure? If not, might investing in water conservation or employee and consumer empowerment initiatives make your business more resilient? If your 10-year plan includes expanding in Africa, you should view the Sustainable Development Goals as a critical roadmap to help align your strategy with the continent’s social and environmental priorities and realities. This type of scenario planning ensures not only that your business model is resilient, but also that your employees, customers and communities will play a critical role in your decisions. Apple CEO Tim Cook made the news in 2014 for many reasons beyond the launch of the iPhone 6. Among the highlights was his Climate Week speech advocating more aggressive action from his peers on climate change. On stage in New York, he noted he “wanted [Apple] to be one of the pebbles in the pond that creates the ripple” on climate change and the environment. He wasn’t alone. Unilever CEO Paul Polman has spoken often and loudly on the need for businesses to align their missions and growth models with action on climate and other key issues. “In the absence of politicians, we need to move faster,” he said. “Climate change is a great opportunity for business … the needle is starting to move in the US. The tornadoes and hurricanes are starting to drive the message home for people. … [T]he urgency cannot be watered down.” As rhetoric and action begin to align across boardrooms, expect more business leaders to step out of their corner offices to spark more sustainable business practices, whether through regulation – Nike and Starbucks support Obama’s climate rule – or through well-funded lawsuits, investor-led demands, strategic partnerships or remapped business models.  As the crescendo for more action builds, you’ll want to ask the right questions to rebuild your narrative, remap your strategy and ensure your business is nimble enough – and able to collaborate sufficiently with its employees, consumers and other stakeholders – to remain an active participant in the next 25 years of economic development.  While the Rana Plaza fire was not the first of its kind, the 2013 disaster continued to catalyze action across the apparel industry this year, with new partnerships and commitments in recent months. In 2014, the electronics industry had a similar moment when a report by nonprofit Verité found forced labor in Malaysian factories. You can expect these disruptions to continue.  My advice to sidestep them? Forecast into the next two decades, not two years.  One term that has stuck in my mind in recent months – and one I plan to use ever more rigorously – is future-proofing. How will you use the next 12 months to ensure your long-term viability as an organization, as an economic contributor, as a consumer, as an employee, as a leader and as an informed decision maker? For me, my mantra is clear. Tell the whole story, help our executives and leaders connect the dots, identify the context, and empower stakeholders through knowledge. When I started writing about these issues, I committed to connecting the dots. Always. A decade later, that hasn’t changed.  And remember, joy is contagious. But so is skepticism. Stay clear. Steer carefully – and lead gracefully – onwards.

"Pope Francis waded into the global debate about climate change on Thursday, saying that he believed that man was primarily responsible and that he hoped this year’s Paris conference would take a courageous stand to protect the environment.  The Pope said his long-awaited encyclical on the environment was almost finished and that he hoped it would be published in June, in time provide food for thought ahead of the UN climate meeting Paris in November.   Speaking to reporters on the plane taking him from Sri Lanka to Manila, he was asked specifically if man was mostly to blame for climate change.  “I don’t know if it is all (man’s fault) but the majority is, for the most part, it is man who continuously slaps down nature,” he said.  The words were his clearest to date on climate change, which has sparked worldwide debate and even divided conservative and liberal Catholics, particularly in the United States.  “We have, in a sense, lorded it over nature, over Sister Earth, over Mother Earth,” said Francis, who since his election in 2013 has made many appeals for the protection of the environment.  “I think man has gone too far,” he said. “Thank God that today there are voices that are speaking out about this.”  Last month, about 190 nations agreed the building blocks of a new-style global deal due in 2015 to combat climate change amid warnings that far tougher action will be needed to limit increases in global temperatures.  Under the deal reached in Lima, governments will submit national plans for reining in greenhouse gas emissions by an informal deadline of 31 March to form the basis of a global agreement due at a summit in Paris at the end of the year.  He faulted the Peru conference for not doing enough about climate change.  “The Peru meeting was nothing much, it disappointed me. I think there was a lack of courage. They stopped at a certain point. Let’s hope the delegates in Paris will be more courageous and move forward with this,” he said. "

"Environmental campaigners are hoping that 2015 will be the year when the UK’s cities go green. Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Munich, Seattle, Sydney and Lima have all committed to switching to using 100% clean energy by 2050, and now grassroots campaigns calling on civic leaders to endorse the initiative have been launched in 123 towns and cities across the UK. It is hoped that as many as 20 will pledge their commitment before the end of this year. One city expected to be at the vanguard of the scheme is Oxford, which has launched a “low-carbon hub” that aims to install solar panels on schools, put water turbines in its stretch of the Thames and develop solar farms.  Persuading cities to switch to clean energy is crucial in tackling climate change, according to research by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, the increasingly influential body that comprises former heads of government, former ministers, economists and business leaders. The commission recently produced analysis suggesting that, by 2030, the world’s 724 largest cities could reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by up to 1.4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide – greater than the annual emissions of Japan – purely by developing more efficient transport systems. It also claimed that adopting low-carbon technologies, such as using energy-efficient building materials and switching to electric buses in 30 of the world’s megacities, would create more than 2m jobs and avoid some 3bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 years. More than 100 countries backed the clean cities initiative at last year’s climate talks in Lima. There is also considerable global public support for the idea. The campaigning organisation Avaaz, described as the world’s largest and most powerful online activist network, recently delivered a petition to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, signed by 2.2 million people, calling on local, national and international leaders to shift to 100% clean energy. Avaaz hopes to persuade 100 cities around the world to join its campaign over the next 12 months. “Last year people took to the streets to demand a shift to clean energy, and this year these same people will be making that goal a reality, one town at a time,” said Bert Wander, senior campaigner at Avaaz. “Cities all over the world have already started announcing 100% clean-energy targets, and where cities lead, entire countries can follow.”   Unlike other high-profile Avaaz campaigns, the green cities initiative is being run by Avaaz members at a local level. In the UK, more than 150,000 people have signed up. Wander said support for the initiative was growing exponentially: “A renewables revolution is happening right now, and in just a few months it’s gone from pipe dream to mainstream, with countries including Norway and Uruguay flicking the ‘clean’ switch, and cities such as Frankfurt, Seattle and Copenhagen doing the same. We hope that cities and towns across Britain will follow their lead this year.” Jon Crooks, who is helping organise the Manchester petition for Avaaz, said the time was right for cities to play their part in tackling climate change, in particular helping their countries cut emissions by 80% by 2050, a target set out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2007. “Governments aren’t committing to this,” Crooks said. “But if we can get cities to commit, then governments will have to respond. This is the right fit for Manchester right now. The city is to get an elected mayor and things that can be done to make a city 100% clean, like sustainable transport and housing, could become real electoral issues.”"

"There’s no doubt humans are attracted to oceans. Globally, 44% of all people on Earth live within 150 km (93 miles) of the shore, and eight of the 10 largest cities in the world are near the coast. But global sea levels have risen about eight inches in the last century and are projected to rise another one to four feet this century. That growth comes at quite a cost. World Bank economist Stephane Hallegatte led a 2013 study, published in the Nature Climate Change journal, forecasting that average global flood losses would multiply from $6bn per year in 2005 to as much as $1tn a year by 2050 if large coastal cities don’t take steps to adapt.  All this means that buying a dream home on the beach could amount to throwing money into the sea. Luckily, a growing number of studies have measured the risk from rising oceans, taking into account how many people live in low-lying areas, the value of at-risk real estate and business operations, the levels of preparedness (including countermeasures, such as Amsterdam’s dykes, to prevent flooding damage) in different areas – and predictions for how those factors may change in 2030, 2050 or 2070.  If you’re looking for coastal property for your dream home – or just dreaming – here are 10 seaside metropolises where investments face high risks from climate change: Historically known to Westerners as Canton, Guanzhou is the third largest city in China, with a population of nearly 13 million. Located on the Pearl River Delta and the South China Sea, close to Macao and Hong Kong, Guangzhou is a center of car manufacturing, biotechnology and heavy industry. As Asian economies grow and urban populations boom, Asian cities, especially in China, Thailand and India, will leap to the head of the pack when it comes to risk. Guangzhou is already there, and it lacks strong protection against sea level rise. Even with savvy infrastructure upgrades for resilience, Guangzhou could see $13.2bn in annual losses by 2050, according to Nature Climate Change. In his prescient 2001 book Holding Back the Sea, Christopher Hallowell documents New Orleans’ numerous flooding risks. It has a poor location that is historically prone to flooding. Oil and gas drilling has lowered the ground elevation while engineering on the Mississippi River has starved the area of rejuvenating alluvial deposits. Meanwhile, its marshes have been weakened by invasive species. Sea levels rise around it as extreme storms batter it. Over the last century, the sea has swallowed more than one-third of Louisiana’s coastal plain. Hurricane Katrina brought that all home in 2005, when the resulting flood lasted for weeks and the recovery reconfigured the city. In general, wealthier cities have better protection against sea level rise than those in developing countries, but New Orleans, along with Miami and New York, lag behind. Post-Hurricane Katrina investments in New Orleans, however, including decisions to relinquish some areas to the ocean, are helping. The commercial, manufacturing and population center of Ecuador, Guayaquil sits at the mouth of Guayas River, near the Gulf of Guayaquil the Pacific Ocean. Home to more than 2 million residents, its major industries include business, agriculture and aquaculture. Even with flood protection upgrades, Guayaquil could see $3.2bn in annual losses by 2050, according to Nature Climate Change.  Home to 7.4 million people, Ho Chi Minh City sits on the banks of the Saigon River, where the Mekong Delta empties out into the South China Sea. One-third of the city is already exposed to flooding, with much land just a meter or so (about three feet) above sea level. But with the economy and population booming, it is building out towards the coast, exposing new real estate to risk of flooding. Rising sea levels are already turning inland water saltier, making it unsuitable for growing rice. Rotterdam, another delta city in the Netherlands, is advising Ho Chi Mihn City on how best to adapt. The Vietnamese city launched a climate adaptation strategy in 2013 that would wield technologies and policies that have helped Rotterdam fend off the sea. The economic capital of Ivory Coast, Abidjan, lies near the Gulf of Guinea on the Ébrié Lagoon, an industry epicenter. With 13 million people in the greater urban area, its population is second only to Lagos, Nigeria, in the region. Major industries include a large oil refinery as well as food production, lumber and manufacturing, including cars, textiles, chemicals, and soap. An engineering project to turn the lagoon into a deepwater port, though, is causing erosion problems. Human activity is causing some places along the West African coastline to lose 23-30 meters (75-98 feet) a year, damaging valuable infrastructure such as roads and houses. Formerly known as Bombay, Mumbai is one of the world’s true megacities, with a metro area population of nearly 21 million. The capital of Maharashtra state, Mumbai is also the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India. Many of Bollywood’s most famous stars own mansions there.  But all this is built upon seven islands, which were fishing colonies in another era. Coastal flooding wouldn’t just make homes soggy, it would reduce the availability of freshwater due to seawater intrusion and flood submerged waste dumps, contaminating the limited water supply. Even with protection upgrades, Mumbai could see $6.4bn in annual losses by 2050, according to Nature Climate Change. Located at the mouth of the Miami River, between the Everglades and Biscayne Bay, most of Miami is just six feet (1.8 meters) above sea level. The glitzy city, with a metro-area population of 5.5 million, is already seeing regular flooding of city streets at high tide (pdf).  A two-foot rise in sea levels is expected by 2060, according to the US Geological Survey. Miami has always flaunted its seaside locale, building $16bn of real estate below a two-foot (0.6 meter) elevation (pdf). Nevertheless, insurers and lenders continue to support the city’s development.  New York City needs no introduction as a global hub of finance, art, culture and education. But its location on the Atlantic Ocean, at the mouth of the Harlem River and in a tidal strait, isn’t doing it any favors. And despite having a larger GDP than London, Tokyo and Amsterdam, it has lower levels of protection than they do, according to Nature Climate Change. Aside from sea level rise, NYC is threatened by regional changes in ocean currents. Together these factors are likely to increase loss of wetlands, coastal flooding, storm surge, erosion and property damage. Hurricane Sandy was an early warning of what could come, pushing floodwaters over barrier islands and into seaside communities, destroying or damaging 305,000 homes in New York and 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey.  Located just two hours’ drive from Guangzhou, Shenzhen lies at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta. Shenzhen was the first of China’s Special Economic Zones, attracting foreign investment, turning it from a small village into the 15 million-person city it is today. It is home to a stock exchange and high-tech companies and is one of the world’s busiest container ports.  As a village, it perched on hills. But most of those hills have now been leveled for development. Migrants from inland are now flowing into the city, and nearby hills are also being leveled to make room for more development. All this increases its risk. Osaka is Japan’s third largest city. For centuries, it has been an economic center of Japan, benefitting from its location at the mouth of the Yodo River on Osaka Bay. But now that location could make it vulnerable to coastal flooding (pdf). More than 10% of greater Osaka’s 2.5 million population and more than US$200bn in economic assets are at risk, according to a report from OECD. As the city continues to expand, those losses could damage nearly US$1tn in assets by 2070. The Vital Signs platform is funded by Avery Dennison, Domtar and Chiquita.

"Last year was a rough one for the climate change secretary, the Lib Dems’ Ed Davey. The big government offer in 2010 of a clear, market-driven energy policy turns out to have been easier to promise than to deliver. That is partly the fault of coalition politics. Energy became the battleground for the most fundamental differences between the two partners. As a result, a policy area that demands long-term thinking has been mired in uncertainty. The case for green energy has been widely undermined by misleading accounts of its cost to the consumer. David Cameron, the man who used to say vote blue, go green, now talks of cutting the green crap. In the midst of the political squabbling, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has lurched between crises. Last month, faced with warnings from the power-generation industry that they were working at something close to full capacity, with a margin of as little as 2% at times of peak demand, Mr Davey’s department looked for a cast-iron guarantee that the lights would stay on. Although many independent observers argued that the 2% margin was likely to be breached only in an extreme winter, and then only for a very short period, last month the National Grid held the first ever auction for capacity contracts which can ensure the lights will not go out. The generators guaranteed they would have power available and, in return, were guaranteed sales at a price that, when it comes on stream three years from now, will cost consumers about £1bn a year.  This deal is due to be approved by Mr Davey on Monday. There are two particularly contentious aspects to it. First, it has turned out to be a subsidy to generators for doing something that they would do anyway. Second, instead of encouraging a new generation of gas-fired power stations to enter the market, two-thirds will come from existing capacity, which means that nearly a fifth of the supply will come from dirty coal and contentious biomass, while EDF, the major nuclear power operator, will generate a further 16%. Meanwhile, the Decc has rebooted the struggling green deal, the flagship project to encourage home owners to invest in energy efficiency. Beset by complexity, at the end of its second year in 2013, green deal had attracted fewer than 4,000 takers. It has now been rebranded as the green deal home improvement fund, and extended to allow consumers to borrow up to £6,000 to invest in more difficult projects like solid-wall insulation. The experience of the green deal home improvement fund has been the reverse of its predecessor. It’s so successful that it’s a complete sellout. Reshaping energy policy will inevitably be a long-haul project. The political right argues that, with well-designed market incentives, innovative technologies will emerge. Incentives certainly have their place. But, overall, this is too big a challenge, as Mr Davey’s experience has shown, to rely exclusively on incentivising. Moreover, in moral terms, this is a challenge that cannot be left wholly to the market. At its heart, energy policy generates conflicting rights. Only the state can ensure fairness between them."
"This Greenpeace campaign gets top marks for recognising the creative opportunities that iconic Lego brand offered for engaging the public. While the Everything is NOT Awesome video was the most viewed in Greenpeace’s history, the images of Lego characters staging a series of protests outside Shell garages and international landmarks kept interest alive on social media. The online campaign was supported by a child-led protest outside Shell’s HQ highlighting the emotional link between climate change and future generations. Lego announced in October that it would not renew its 50-year partnership with Shell. Possibly one of the most high-profile campaigns of all time, not everyone was convinced by the approach, believing it too simplistic and failing to acknowledge how entrenched oil is in society (not least as a raw material for Lego bricks). The David versus Goliath campaign of the year. In October, a group of climate warriors from 13 Pacific Islands travelled to Australia to raise awareness of the impact of the fossil fuel industry on their homes and livelihoods. With the campaign slogan “we are not drowning, we are fighting” they used traditional handmade canoes to paddle out into the harbour of the world’s largest coal handling port to stop exports for a day. The Pacific Climate Warriors then joined Australians in peaceful occupations of fossil fuel companies. The message that the islanders are no longer content to sit and wait as the “canary in the coal mine” for climate change was made very clear. The true measure of success will be if the islands are guaranteed a future.  Oxfam is one of the few NGOs that seems able to balance the use of carrot and stick with major corporates, calling out bad performance while still celebrating the good. Its Behind the Brands campaign encourages people to use its scorecard to tell the ‘Big 10’ food and beverage companies exactly what needs to change in their supply chains. In May, Oxfam started to highlight harmful food production practices that contribute to climate change. Kellogg and General Mills were identified as the worst offenders. After only a few months of Oxfam applying the stick, both companies announced strengthened climate commitments. General Mills, previously ranked last on climate change policies, made some more ambitious commitments and was rewarded by a significant improvement in its climate score. Girls like pink, boys like blue. Girls like dolls, boys like superheroes. Retailers may think these old stereotypes hold true, but parents - their target consumers - don’t. A parent-led campaign, which grew out of a discussion thread on parenting site Mumsnet, brought together mums and dads frustrated by the rise of gender-based promotion and marketing to children. After 14 retailers in the UK agreed to stop gendered marketing, the campaign was then extended to books, asking publishers and retailers to allow children to choose freely what kinds of books and stories interest them. In November, Dorling Kindersley, Chad Valley and Miles Kelly Books all confirmed that they will not be publishing new titles labelled for boys and girls. Ladybird also pledged to stop labelling books in this way as it did not want “to be seen limiting children”. The growth in people-powered campaign movements has been one of the campaign success stories of the last decade. With more than 40 million members globally, it is relatively easy for organisations such as Avaaz to mobilise protestors. In September, hundreds of thousands of people marched in New York, London and across the world calling for 100% clean energy from policymakers and business. A small number of progressive business leaders from IKEA, Unilever, Ben & Jerry’s and NRG joined the myriad campaigning organisations. Patagonia closed its stores so that its employees could join the march alongside chief executive Rose Marcario. Although it is difficult to assess the tangible impact of such protest events, the day was seen by many as a seminal moment in the climate change movement. It made the front page of many national newspapers, increasing pressure on politicians and decision-makers worldwide. President Obama acknowledged the occasion in his regular address: “Our citizens keep marching. We cannot pretend we do not hear them. We have to answer the call.” Virunga, Africa’s oldest national park, came under threat when the Congolese government awarded three concessions for oil exploration. Save Virunga is a global initiative that gives a voice to local communities who depend on the survival of the park for their livelihoods and recognises how important local actors are to the long-term survival of protected areas. WWF-UK added its weight to the campaign in 2013, filing a complaint against oil company Soco under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Meanwhile 750,000 WWF supporters signed a petition, and in June 2014 Soco announced that it would end its operations in the park. The cause has just been given a boost by the film Virunga, backed by actor Leonardo di Caprio, which is being broadcast on Netflix. The movie brings the focus back to the local communities, telling the tale of the park rangers and the risks that they are taking to protect one of the world’s richest pockets of biodiversity that is home to some of the last mountain gorillas. With a focus on the oil sector, Platform uses education, exhibitions, art events and book projects to inspire change. One focus area is sponsorship of major art and cultural institutions. In June, as part of the Art Not Oil coalition, a week of creative activism took place around the opening of the National Portrait Gallery’s opening of the BP Portrait Award. In one protest, 25 performers had oil poured over their faces and created “portraits” throughout the gallery. Platform also published Picture This – A Portrait of 25 Years of BP Sponsorship, which looked back at the chequered social and environmental history of BP and the role of art in society in relation to ethics and sponsorship. While no notable victory has been recorded, this campaign has started to stigmatise cultural and arts institutions funded by oil companies in a similar way to the highly successful fossil-fuel divestment campaign. Launched in 2012, this campaign scored a notable victory in the UK in 2014 when the UK government announced it was to launch a National Pollinator Strategy – a 10 year plan to help pollinating insects survive and thrive. In the last few years, much attention has been paid to the plight of bees and their loss of habitat. Alongside traditional campaign tactics, Friends of the Earth also provided practical advice on the creation of bee-friendly spaces and asked supporters to pledge to provide food, water and nesting spaces for bees. On April 24 2012, a building housing five garment factories in Bangladesh collapsed killing 1,138 people and injuring more than 2,000. Many of the major brands whose products were manufactured at the Rana Plaza factory contributed to the official compensation fund for survivors and their families. Matalan was the only major British retailer not to donate - until 38 Degrees launched the #PayUp campaign that is. Following pressure from members of 38 Degrees, Matalan announced it had paid into the official compensation fund, but would not disclose how much. In a hyper-transparent world this was seen by 38 Degrees as an incomplete response and its members took the campaign to the high streets and directly to Matalan’s stores. Following this action the company finally divulged the amount and, while £60,000 was seen as a win by 38 Degrees, the organisation is keeping up the pressure on Matalan to donate more. The fastest growing divestment campaign ever, the movement had a turning point in the US this year when it was announced that the Rockefellers Brothers Fund would withdraw its investments from fossil fuels investments. The campaign first took hold in the US with Bill McKibben’s Do the Math speaking tour. The activist took to the road by bus and at each venue in the US was joined by artists, actors and musicians, all working together to empower the audience to act through a mix of music, interactive, video and discussions. The campaign is now seeing success in Europe, with the University of Glasgow the first academic institution to announce it will divest. This was followed by the Diocese of Oxford becoming the first religious institution to follow suit. Frances Buckingham is an associate at SustainAbility and editor of Radar.

"Three hundred professors at Stanford, including Nobel laureates and this year’s Fields medal winner, are calling on the university to rid itself of all fossil fuel investments, in a sign that the campus divestment movement is gathering force. In a letter to Stanford’s president, John Hennessy, and the board of trustees, made available exclusively to the Guardian, the faculty members call on the university to recognise the urgency of climate change and divest from all oil, coal and gas companies.  Stanford, which controls a $21.4bn (£14.2bn) endowment, eliminated direct investments in coalmining companies last May, making it the most prominent university to cut its ties to the industries that cause climate change. Months later, however, the university invested in three oil and gas companies. Campus divestment campaigns have spread to about 300 universities and colleges over the last few years, but are largely dominated by students. The Stanford letter was initiated by faculty, and signed by the first female winner of the prestigious Fields prize in mathematics, Maryam Mizarkhani, as well as the Nobel laureates Douglas Osheroff and Roger Kornberg, Paul Ehrlich, a population analyst, Terry Root, a biologist and UN climate report author, and others – 300 faculty members in total. The letter calls on Stanford to pull out of all fossil fuel investments, not just coal. “The urgency and magnitude of climate change call not for partial solutions, however admirable; they demand the more profound and thorough commitment embodied in divestment from all fossil-fuel companies,” the letter says. “The alternative – for Stanford to remain invested in oil and gas companies – presents us with a paradox: if a university seeks to educate extraordinary youth so they may achieve the brightest possible future, what does it mean for that university simultaneously to invest in the destruction of that future? Given that the university has signalled its awareness of the dangers posed by fossil fuels, what are the implications of Stanford’s making only a partial confrontation with this danger?” Elizabeth Tallent, an English professor and one of the organisers of the letter, said she saw the campaign as a natural extension of her work as a professor. “I think if you want what you do to matter, and not only for a moment in the classroom, you think: how can students make use of this in 10 years or 20 years? If you are imagining the future of youth in 20 years, then you run into the problem of what the world will look like.” Ehrlich, known for his warnings about overpopulation, said Stanford had an obligation to protect its endowment. “It’s crystal-clear that fossil fuels, most of them, are going to have to remain in the ground if we are going to avoid a real catastrophe and of course the value of stock is tied to that,” he said. “If we are not going to be able to use those fossil fuels, the stock is going to tank and places like Stanford have a fiscal responsibility to maintain the endowment. Having an investment in fossil fuels is a very bad investment.” Stanford would not comment directly on the petition. But a spokeswoman, Lisa Lapin, said in an email that Stanford had completely withdrawn its investments from coalmining companies. She said an advisory panel was studying the feasibility of further fossil fuel divestment. “Stanford takes all concerns raised with the university about the nature and impact of its investments very seriously,” Lapin said. The fossil-fuel divestment campaign has grown rapidly over the past few years, driven by the deepening awareness that most of the world’s coal, oil and gas reserves must stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change. According to the world’s leading climate scientists, those safety limits could be breached within 30 years if the world goes on burning fossil fuels at the current rate, Last September, the heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune withdrew their $860m philanthrophic fund from investments in tar sands, coal, and oil. Campaigners claimed at the time to have persuaded 800 investors – foundations such as the Rockefeller brothers, religious groups, healthcare organisations, cities and universities – to withdraw a total of $50bn from fossil fuel investments over the next five years. But Harvard rejected a campaign by students and 100 faculty to remove fossil fuel holdings from its $32bn endowment, claiming such a move would have only a negligible financial impact. George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan and a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution who has tried to push fellow Republicans to act on climate, said the university should think instead about imposing a revenue-neutral carbon tax. “I am very much on the side of worrying about climate issues,” he said. But he did not support the divestment campaign, adding: “It’s mainly to make people here feel good.” Ehrlich said it was important for leading universities such as Stanford to take a stand. “It is very important that educational institutions in particular and organisations that think of themselves as part of civil society make this important step,” he said. “It is symbolic. It is not going to instantly change the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but it is damn important.”"

"Congress is to vote on whether climate change is real. Seriously. The measure, which will come up in the debate about the Keystone XL pipeline, will ask the Senate to vote on whether climate change is real, caused by human activities, and has already caused devastating problems in the US and around the world.  It is intended to force Republicans who deny the existence of climate change – and they are a majority in Congress – to own their anti-science positions, said Bernie Sanders, the Independent senator from Vermont behind the amendment. “The bottom line is that I think as a nation that we walk down a very dangerous road when the majority party in the United States Congress is prepared to reject science,” Sanders told the Guardian. “I think it is important for Republicans to tell their constituents, to tell the American people, and to tell the world whether they agree with the science or not.” That could make for some very awkward moments. Sanders’s amendment has no chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress – and he acknowledges that is not the point. Indeed, when Sanders first introduced the measure in the Senate energy committee last week, one of his fellow Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, objected to the final clause urging the US to get off fossil fuels and move towards a clean energy economy. But the amendment promises to produce some embarrassing footage from the Senate floor as Republicans try to align the party leadership’s position on climate change with the scientific community – and indeed much of the world outside the United States. The Republican leadership for several years now has marched in lockstep on climate change, denying its existence and opposing measures to deal with the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing it as part of their strategy against Barack Obama.  Of Republicans in the Senate, 70% deny the existence of climate change or obstruct action on climate change, according to Climate Progress.   Some, such as Jim Inhofe, the chair of the Senate environment and public works committee who calls global warming a hoax, have practised climate denial for years. Others have shifted positions as the Republican party drifted to the right – and Sanders suggested their newfound denial was a result of political expediency. “I think some of them – Jim Inhofe, who I like and is a friend of mine, is very sincere in his belief that climate change is a hoax, who absolutely believes that,” Sanders said. “But I think there are other senators who do not believe that. There are other senators who have scientific backgrounds but for political reasons are not prepared to come out and say that climate change is real.” One such senator could be Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican facing re-election next year. Earlier this month, Kirk appeared to have effected a conversion to climate denial, dismissing global warming as “political correctness”. Kirk later hedged on that position. Such non-denial denials are widespread, Sanders went on. “I think many moderate Republicans, including many business people, know how serious this problem is and want to do something about it,” he said. But there are powerful forces promoting climate denial, Sanders said. “On the other hand, we have the Koch brothers and energy companies pouring millions into the coffers of the Republican party.” Republicans blocked a similar climate vote last July – after objections from Inhofe. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, seems inclined to allow a vote this time around. The Keystone bill, while guaranteed passage, is unlikely to gather enough support to circumvent a threatened presidential veto. McConnell has an interest in extending the debate on Keystone, if only to pick off more Democrats to vote in favour of the bill. Other Democrats would also like to tack riders on the Keystone bill, though none dealing directly with climate change. McConnell told reporters on Tuesday afternoon that all of the proposed amendments could go ahead. “We are not anxious to block anybody’s amendment. We are wide open,” he said. That could make for some interesting moments. Flat-out climate denial – though still acceptable in the Republican party leadership – is not shared by all rank-and-file Republicans. New research this week from the Yale Project on Climate Communications found majorities of moderate and liberal Republican voters do accept the existence of climate change and do want to fight climate change. Climate denial is also becoming a potential political liability, a signifier that Republicans are old and out of touch with reality. Climate denial has come under sustained attack from environmental campaigners and the green billionaire Tom Steyer, who poured millions into the midterm elections. A number of prominent Republicans in tight races with Democrats shied away from outright denial, adopting a new formulation: “I’m not a scientist.” Even Mitch McConnell, in his race for his Kentucky Senate seat, took up the “I’m not a scientist” wording. Sanders refused to speculate on how senators might vote when put on the spot on climate change. But it’s fair to say that he will enjoy the spectacle. • This article was amended on 15 January 2015 to clarify that the Yale research found that majorities of moderate and liberal Republican voters accept the existence of climate change, rather than a majority of all Republican voters. An earlier version referred to “majorities of Republican voters”. "

"Last year I wrote that 2014 needed to see a stronger, more unified business voice to help put climate change back on the political agenda. We have undoubtedly seen that – and more. Leading companies are pushing ahead with green investments and ambitious emissions cuts, and are setting long-term targets because they recognise that it makes business sense.  In turn, policymakers have also made historic progress, including the European Union, China and the US, which all announced long-term climate targets beyond 2020. This helped spur momentum for the Lima Call for Climate Action, the accord agreed by over 190 governments in December which marked the first time all countries have agreed to net-zero emissions by 2050.  There is, however, only so much carbon we can emit before we dramatically increase our chances of pushing temperatures above 2C, the limit agreed by governments and climate scientists. To stay within that budget, the question remains if the long-term targets – to be announced by all governments next year – will be enough to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. Companies too will have to join this race to set bold climate targets in 2015. While emissions targets are increasingly becoming the norm for successful businesses, the reality is that too few are aligning these targets with the requirements of climate science. That is beginning to change. A small handful of businesses such as Autodesk, BT and Mars are already attempting to incorporate climate science into their goal-setting strategies. Now some 30 businesses, including L’Oréal, Sodexo and Unilever, have committed, through CDP, to set emissions reduction targets that are aligned with limiting global temperatures to below 2C. The changing economic landscape, especially in the energy field, will spur more company action in 2015. In September, research from investment firm Lazard found that large wind farms and solar plants were now cost-competitive with gas-fired power in parts of the US, even without subsidy. In a year that is set to be the hottest on record, this comes as a much-needed tipping point to drive further innovation and investment. Forward-looking companies are already starting to pick up and capitalise on the opportunities from renewables. US electric utility firm NRG announced in November it would be cutting emissions by 90% by 2050, due in part to the opportunities to supply energy to other businesses looking to reduce their emissions. In December, Germany’s largest utility firm E.ON said it would focus on renewables over coal and gas because of the “dramatically altered global energy markets.” How many more will follow suit in 2015? Investors are also increasing their scrutiny of climate and environmental risks. The Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, launched in September, is a group of investment institutions which asks investors to commit to reducing the carbon footprint of $100bn (£64.3bn) of investment by December 2015. Building on last year, the global business community will need to continue to push policymakers to legislate a carbon price to reflect the true cost of doing business. Smart companies, including Dow Chemical Company, Mars and Walt Disney, are already factoring a price on their carbon emissions into investment decisions. The growing expectation from companies that there will be a price on carbon is another sign that we are moving closer to a low-carbon future. While some of this hinges on the success of the planned global climate deal in Paris next year, governments have a critical responsibility to ensure their contributions are long-term and in line with the science. If companies want to succeed in this future, they too must ratchet up their ambition and start playing the long game on climate action. Paul Simpson is chief executive officer of CDP.

"The dramatic decline of one of Britain’s butterflies may be because climate change is creating a “lost generation” according to research by Belgian scientists. The disappearance of the wall brown (Lasiommata megera) from swathes of southern England has mystified conservationists for two decades but new evidence suggests that the butterfly is dying out because warmer weather is causing generations to hatch out too late in the year to survive.  In recent years, instead of the offspring of the wall butterflies found flying in July and August spending winter as a caterpillar before emerging as a butterfly the following year, warm conditions encourage the caterpillars to quickly turn into a butterfly by September and October. By emerging so late in the year, these butterflies fall into what researchers, led by Professor Hans Van Dyck of Louvain University, call a “developmental trap”. By autumn, it is too cold and there are not suitable plants for their offspring to eat before winter. In effect, these autumn butterflies are a lost generation, leaving no caterpillars that can survive to become butterflies the following spring. Similarly doomed generations of other species have also been found flying in the autumn in recent years, including the white admiral, Duke of Burgundy and orange tip, which traditionally only fly in spring or summer. In Britain, the wall has decreased by 86% since 1976 – vanishing from much of central and southern England – but it has survived at coastal sites. In research published in the international journal Oikos, enclosed pots of captive-bred wall caterpillars were placed at coastal and inland sites in Belgium of similar latitude during the summer. All the caterpillars placed at inland sites quickly developed to become a third generation of wall butterflies which emerged in the autumn. At coastal sites, however, just 42.5% developed into a third generation, with the majority following the species’ traditional life-cycle – spending winter as a caterpillar before emerging as a butterfly the following year. The scientists found that the micro-climate at the inland sites was on average 1.2C warmer than at coastal sites, suggesting that cooler conditions by the sea enabled the butterfly to maintain its traditional life-cycle.  While climate change should benefit many sun-loving butterfly species, the fate of the wall could be shared by many other insects struggling to adapt their lifestyles quickly enough to rapid changes in temperature. The white admiral is another butterfly once only spotted in July which is now producing a small extra generation which flies in September, when scientists doubt it can produce offspring capable of surviving the winter. “This year there were a lot of unusual sightings of moths in the autumn – late spring species suddenly being seen again,” said Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation. “It probably is an effect that will be seen across species that use temperature and other environmental cues that relate to temperature as part of the decision-making process driving their development.” Fox said he hoped that natural selection would ensure that the genotypes of wall browns that try to squeeze an extra generation into the year are selected out of existence “but whether the butterfly can adapt and not fall into this trap is a big question – some species adapt and thrive but lots of species become extinct.” Other butterfly species have surprised scientists by the speed in which they have adapted to changing conditions. In North America, a subspecies of the quino checkerspot butterfly defied expectations it would become extinct by moving to higher altitudes and choosing a new plant on which to feed. In Britain, brown argus caterpillars switched to a new food plant in warmer conditions, enabling the butterfly to rapidly expand its range northwards. The Belgian scientists stressed that their findings are not the “smoking gun” and further research is required. Fox warned that there may be other factors apart from climate change causing the wall’s decline. Another theory is that increased nitrogen pollution is changing vegetation and stopping its caterpillars from feeding successfully. “It’s a very elegant theory but there may be more to it,” said Fox. “There often is with butterflies.”"
"The launch of a ‘New Ecology’ movement by France’s National Front (FN) this week has been condemned by environmentalists as opportunistic and inconsistent. The far right eco-nationalist grouping was launched by Marine Le Pen, with a ‘patriotic’ platform of opposition to international climate talks and support for France’s nuclear industry. The FN has made political capital about cruelty to animals in the preparation of halal and kosher meat in the past, and its MEPs are preparing a resolution that would limit shale gas exploration, despite the party voting against a shale moratorium in the last parliament. “The New Ecology movement is based on national interest and patriotism. We have to be closer to our people and not against our country’s interests,” the FN MEP and environment committee member Mireille d’Ornano told the Guardian Marine Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was a climate sceptic who once cut open a watermelon to illustrate how environmentalists were supposedly red communists underneath. But the issue of whether human activity caused global warming was “a very technical question,” d’Ornano said. “We have to find a balanced position and we don’t have to be politically correct or ideologically biased about it. There are pros and cons to the scientific evidence. We have to find out what really comes from human activity, or doesn’t.” The world’s leading climate scientists in the UN’s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change last year said that the evidence linking human activity to global warming was “unequivocal”. But d’Ornano dismissed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international climate talks process, as a “communist project,” adding: “We don’t want a global agreement or global rule for the environment.” Yannick Jadot, a French Green MEP, said that the new FN grouping was a sham. “They never talk about biodiversity because that means respecting diversity,” he told the Guardian. “They oppose animal cruelty, but they also defend hunters and big agricultural industries. They pretend to defend fish but vote in favour of deep sea fisheries. Again today [Wednesday] they voted in favour of allowing Canadian tar sands in EU fuel.” The FN also takes a strong stand in favour of nuclear power, which d’Ornano described as an issue of “national sovereignty”, although all the uranium used in France’s reactors comes from abroad, according to EurActiv France. In philosophical terms, the FN was presenting idealised visions of a past natural order to mask the monocultural hierarchy that they would replace it with, Jadot argued. “The extreme right say it was better before because we were all white and Christian - Catholic - and gay weddings were not an issue and we were somehow in a better relation with nature. This is now part of a fake image that they are trying to sell about the former order in terms of family, nature and race,” he said. New Ecology’s launch closely follows a spectacular, if unsuccessful, campaign by ‘eco-nationalists’ in Switzerland to cap immigration levels at 0.2% of the resident population. In Hungary, the neo-Nazi Jobbik party has campaigned against invasive flora from abroad which they say is destroying Hungarian plants and animals as it spreads unchecked. The far-right Danish People’s Party is virulently opposed to immigration, multi-culturalism and multi-ethnicity. But it also pledges “to ensure that the way in which the earth’s resources are used bears the stamp of consideration, care and a sense of responsibility for the natural world and all its living creatures.” With rising discontent among the young unemployed in France finding expression in the Sivens Dam campaign, and a traditional constituency among small farmers, Jadot said that the FN’s environmental tilt was not an isolated example. “Clearly, there is a trend,” he said. “Five years ago most of the European extreme right parties were very different, but now they want to have power and be in governments so they have to widen their voting base.” “I would warn people that they have no legitimacy and they lack credibility. They pretend to defend a cause but have no solutions. They should not be considered environmentalists or part of any Green movement at all.” "
"The Victorian government wants to join forces with New South Wales and South Australia to press the federal government for more action on climate change in the wake of record or near-record temperatures in the three states in 2014. Victoria’s environment minister, Lisa Neville, said she was seeking “urgent” talks with the NSW and SA governments to forge a united front against Tony Abbott’s stance on climate change.  Neville told Guardian Australia the states would seek greater clarity on how the federal Emissions Reduction Fund, which will provide grants to businesses, would work. The federal government’s leadership on climate change would also be questioned. “I’m looking to have urgent conversations with NSW and South Australia on the role they can play with us,” she said. “We’ll look at whether there’s a shared view on emissions reduction and also national advocacy so we can put climate change back into public debate. “Each state has a responsibility to push the federal government in this area. National action will have the most impact on climate change, so we need a unified voice to get the federal government, first of all, to acknowledge climate change. “The Abbott government has, unfortunately, walked away from its responsibility to act on climate change. We’d prefer strong national and international action, but if we have to play a leadership role in Victoria, we will do that. “We need to put pressure on the federal government as well as build a proper community conversation about climate change again.” Neville, who will have her first meeting with the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, this month, said the federal Coalition needed to resolve the “mess” surrounding its attempts to cut the national renewable energy target and ensure its ERF grants were spent effectively to bring down emissions. Victoria’s Labor government, which came into power in November, is formulating its own climate change strategy, which may include the reinstatement of a state-based emissions reduction target. But there is no plan to phase out Victoria’s highly polluting brown coal generators. South Australia’s renewable energy investment has forged ahead of Victoria and NSW, at a time when all states are experiencing a trend of rising temperatures. The Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate report, released this week, showed that NSW had its warmest year on record in 2014, with Victoria and South Australia both experiencing their second warmest years on record. The NSW government, while keen to not publicly criticise its Coalition counterpart in Canberra, has indicated that it wants stronger action on climate change. A NSW Coalition source said: “We are the NSW government, we believe in climate change.” The NSW environment minister, Rob Stokes, said: “We strongly believe in protecting the vulnerable by providing the community with the best available science and energy efficiency solutions. “We are also using this information to plan for the future delivery of infrastructure and vital services such as health and emergency services. We believe it is an important duty for a responsible government to help communities understand future risk.” “The NSW government also has a renewable energy action plan to increase the proportion of renewable energy in NSW and has made its position on the renewable energy target clear.” Stokes said the NSW government had spent $3m on climate predictions out to 2070, to help the state prepare for change. The federal government has stressed that it accepts the overwhelming science of human-influenced climate change and says its Direct Action climate plan will ensure Australia cuts its emissions by 5% by 2020 on 2000 levels, although the Climate Change Authority has expressed doubt over this. In its first year in power, the federal Coalition scrapped carbon pricing, disbanded or attempted to disband a number of climate and clean energy agencies and is involved in on-and-off negotiations with Labor over its desire to limit Australia’s energy mix to 20% of renewables and no more. Hunt’s office did not respond to a request for comment."
"Harvard has newly invested tens of millions of dollars in oil and gas companies, rebuffing campaigners’ demands to sever the wealthy university’s ties to the companies that cause climate change. The university’s refusal to withdraw an $32.7bn endowment from fossil fuels has frustrated campaigners and resulted in a law suit brought by seven Harvard students. The university – the world’s richest - is due to appear in court next month. Now it emerges Harvard increased its holdings in publicly traded oil and gas companies by a factor of seven during the third financial quarter of 2014, the latest data available. The new investments increased Harvard’s stake in oil and gas companies – including those involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster and fracking – from $11.8m (£7.8m) to about $79.5m, according to an analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings by campus divestment activists. Jim Recht, assistant professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and a supporter of the divestment campaign, described the new oil and gas holdings as “blood money” and said they indicated Harvard’s unwillingness to review its policies despite the growing awareness of the dangers of climate change. “That’s blood money,” he said. “It is making money out of something we see as fundamentally illicit.” The biggest single investment was $57.4m in Anadarko Petroleum, which was involved in the Deepwater Horizon disaster and last year agreed to a $5bn fine for the clean-up of toxic waste sites. Other investments were in companies involved in fracking including Concho Resources Inc ($9.6m), Pioneer Natural Resources Inc ($9.3m), Range Resources Corporation ($2.2m) and WPX Energy ($979,000). The SEC filings cover only a small fraction of Harvard’s $34bn endowment, said Chloe Maxmin, a co-founder of Divest Harvard, who analysed the investments. Most of the $34bn is not held in direct investments, and is not included in the SEC filings – which means fossil fuel holdings could be even greater.  Those new investments – and Harvard’s refusal to consider changes to endowment policies – have spurred new protests from students as well as faculty. In a petition made available to the Guardian, five Harvard faculty members,including Recht said the new investments put the university out of step with a small but growing number of universities and philanthropic institutions, such as Stanford and the Rockefeller Brothers, that have reviewed or taken steps to eliminate fossil fuel holdings. “In striking contrast to these other institutions, Harvard has newly invested tens of millions in publicly traded fossil fuel companies,” the five Harvard faculty members wrote.“Can putting tens of millions in companies like Anadarko be regarded as responsible sustainable investing – investing that befits a charitable corporation dedicated to scientific truth and ethical education? Such investments... signify an investment policy that is profoundly indifferent to its consequences,” the letter said. “We are among a growing number of concerned faculty who question the idea thatinvestment returns are justified at any cost, including the enormous cost our students and future generations will need to pay for what the fossil fuel industry is doing now and — more importantly — for what it is planning and lobbying to do, with writing checks to political organizations a key part of that planning.” Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard’s president, has rejected fossil fuel divestment as not “warranted or wise”. In October 2013, she wrote: “The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.” Jeff Neal, a spokesman for Harvard, said in an email that the university acknowledged the “serious threat” of climate change. “We agree that threat must be confronted, but sometimes differ on the means. Harvard has been, and continues to be, focused on supporting the research and teaching that will ultimately create the solutions to this challenge,” he said. Harvard’s unwillingness to reconsider its investment policies has frustrated campaigners. Seven students last year brought a lawsuit against the university, which the five faculty members supported in their letter as a “new and necessary type of thinking”. The lawsuit argues that Harvard’s continued investment in fossil fuels is an abdication of its responsibilities to current and future generations of students. “We are saying that investment in fossil fuels amounts to mismanagement of public charitable funds,” said Alice Cherry, one of the law students bringing the suit. “The language of the charter says that Harvard needs to protect the education and advancement of youth so that’s something we think is inconsistent with fossil fuel investments.” The suit faces a high barrier, however. Harvard has sought its dismissal on the grounds that the students don’t have the standing to sue on behalf of future generations. James Engell, an English professor and one of those who signed the letter, said the campaigners saw little evidence Harvard was considering a change in its policies. “It is an interesting indication that Harvard went ahead about bought close to $80 million late last year in fossil fuels. It just shows that their attitude has not changed at all and they feel that for whatever reasons these are good investments,” he said. “It sends a message that they are sticking to their policy.”"
"Right now it’s the Adelaide Hills. In 2013 it was the Blue Mountains, in NSW. In 2009 it was the terrible Black Saturday fires in Victoria. While bushfires have always been a part of Australia, the behaviour of fires is changing on the back of increasing extreme weather incidents.  For our continent, extreme weather can mean a number of things depending on locality – unseasonable storm and tempest activity, extreme flooding, and extreme bushfire activity. Firefighters deal with all of these. But bushfire, in particular, is core business for us. It’s a business that’s getting harder and more dangerous.  Last October, the Climate Council released a report focused on the NSW bushfire threat. It found that over the last 30 years hot days have become hotter, heatwaves longer and more frequent, and consequently we have seen increasing drought conditions in the south east of the state.  The fire season has been starting earlier and lasting longer, extending into spring and autumn. This not only means longer periods in which conditions are ripe for bushfire, it also reduces the time in the off-season when firefighters can take preventative measures to minimise exposure in the coming season. All of these changes are expected to increase in the coming decades. Put simply, changes in weather behaviour are making bushfires bigger and more dangerous. What does this mean for those of us on the front line?  Firefighting is a labour intensive exercise. At its most basic it involves dragging hose to a position where you can best attack the fire, or the backbreaking work of starving a fire of fuel through constructing firebreaks or through backburning. These methods haven’t changed much in the past century. In much the same way as our predecessors did, we respond to calls for help, we ship a standpipe, roll hose, and get to work. These days we have breathing apparatus instead of a wet sponge to breath through, trucks instead of horse drawn fire pumps, and modern personal protective equipment rather than brass helmets and the old “lion tamer” uniform. At its essence firefighting is a manual job, performed by men and women in often dangerous situations.  There have been technological changes that have made aspects of our job easier and more efficient. Better fire pumps, foam additives to water that make a better extinguishing agent, improved personal protective equipment, and use of aerial resources to fight fire are all relatively recent improvements in the industry. None of these have led to revolutionary changes in the way we fight fire.  But the world is changing. Our fire prone continent is experiencing more frequent and more intense bushfire activity, so what do our frontline firefighters need to deal with this challenge? We need three things. First, a change in how fire services are structured and run, and a change in the how the work of the service is understood. In NSW, there is a wasteful duplication between Fire Rescue NSW (the professional service) and the Rural Fire Service (the volunteer agency). Similar situations exist in most states and territories. There is no good reason for this, apart from the politics of decades past. A single fire service, with a holistic approach to the challenge of bushfire in a changing world, is an absolute no brainer. Second, we need more of us. Around Australia the numbers of professional firefighters is either decreasing or remaining static. The Climate Council estimates (conservatively, in my opinion) that there will need to be a doubling of the number of firefighters in Australia by 2030 to deal with increased fire behaviour. In 2015, the number of professional firefighters nationally is going backwards, not forwards. Volunteer labour is an important part of the firefighting industry, but we cannot expect volunteers to fill this enormous gap. There is a long-term decline in volunteering numbers, but even if this is overcome it is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect volunteers to provide the level of protection we will require.  Finally, we need the federal government to start being a part of the solution to this problem, rather than denying it exists. This is the critical decade for international action on climate. The recent unexpected statements from both China and the US on the question of carbon emissions gives some hope that action may be taken, but if this does occur it will be in spite of our own government’s position.  Firefighting may not have changed that much over the past century, but our weather is changing and we need to change with it. Sensible reform of fire services, a modern understanding of their role, and increases in resources are needed to give us any hope of being able to deal with the challenges ahead. It’s always preferable to prevent a fire from occurring rather than fight it. Prevention in the 21st century means more than smoke alarms and backburning. It means international action on climate change. Jim Casey is the state secretary of the NSW Fire Brigade Employees’ Union."
