"European leaders dismissed Donald Trump’s claim that the Paris climate accord can be renegotiated after the US president announced he will pull out of the deal struck in 2015 to seek better terms.  Shortly after Trump’s announcement, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy released a joint statement rejecting Trump’s assertion that the climate deal can be redrafted.  “We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible, and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,” said German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni.  The three leaders called on their allies to speed up efforts to combat climate change and promise to do more to help developing countries adapt. Merkel called Trump immediately after he delivered his announcement to personally express her regret at his decision, her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Twitter. During the conversation she stressed that Germany would stick to the agreement. He added in another tweet in English: “Chancellor Merkel disappointed w/Pres. Trump’s decision. Now more than ever we will work for global policies that save our planet,” he wrote. Chancellor Merkel disappointed w/ Pres. Trump's decision. Now more than ever we will work for global climate policies that save our planet. Immediately after her call to Trump, Merkel telephoned Macron, he said, and they agreed that “Germany and France will grasp at new initiatives in order to ensure the climate agreement is a success”. In a televised address in French and English, Macron said that Trump had “committed an error for the interests of his country, his people and a mistake for the future of our planet”.  “I tell you firmly tonight: we will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord. There is no way,” said Macron. “Don’t be mistaken on climate: there is no plan B because there is no planet B.”  In contrast, the British government was slow to respond to the announcement. Downing Street issued a statement saying that Theresa May had told Trump of her “disappointment” at his decision and stressed that Britain remained committed to the agreement.  Downing Street sources would not say whether the prime minister had been asked to sign the letter of condemnation sent by Germany, France and Italy, but said that she had made her point directly to Trump. The unyielding response of Italy, France and Germany came amidst a tsunami of global condemnation for Trump’s decision to renege on an agreement made by 195 countries after decades of negotiation. The US will join Syria and Nicaragua as the only governments to be outside the agreement. The most furious reaction was in Germany, where tomorrow’s front page of German tabloid Berliner Kurier carries the blunt headline: “Earth to Trump: Fuck You”. Prime ministers of America’s neighbours condemned the decision and reaffirmed their support for the Paris agreement. In Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto said: “Mexico maintains its support and commitment to the Paris agreement to stop the effects of global climate change.” The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, called Trump to express his disappointment at the decision, but said he was inspired by “the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies”. The Vatican said a US pullout represented a “huge slap in the face” for the pope and a “disaster for everyone”. Pope Francis only days ago met Trump and impressed on him the importance of protecting the environment from climate change. Japan’s foreign ministry said: “Climate change requires a concerted effort by the whole of the international community. Japan believes the leadership of the developed countries to be of great importance, and the steady implementation of the Paris agreement is critical in this regard. The recent announcement by the US administration on its withdrawal … is regrettable.” In stronger comments, Japan’s environment minister, Koichi Yamamoto, said: “It’s as if they’ve turned their back on the wisdom of humanity. “In addition to being disappointed, I’m also angry.” In Australia, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was disappointed with Trump’s decision but reiterated the government’s full commitment to meeting its Paris targets. “We believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable.” New Zealand’s climate change minister, Paula Bennett, said that “so much of what [Trump] said is wrong”, arguing that America was not paying a disproportionate cost to be part of the deal. Trump said he was taking his decision to protect US jobs. “We’re getting out,” the US president had said, in attacking the Paris accord’s financial burdens as “draconian”. However, many business leaders say he has handed the advantage in the key field of renewable energy to rivals in China and the Europe. Scientists said they feared for their children.  Environmentalists described the decision as a “hugely disappointing” mistake. Youth groups accused Trump of jeopardizing their future. World leaders had already begun preparing for a US exit. China’s premier, Li Keqiang, said on Thursday that fighting climate change was a “global consensus” and an “international responsibility”. The EU and China have forged a new alliance on climate change and are currently midway through a summit in Brussels at the end of which they will announce plans to step up efforts. The EU’s commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Cañete, said Trump’s unilateral decision marked a sad day for the global community, but he vowed the accord would endure.  “Today’s announcement has galvanised us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership. Europe and its strong partners all around the world are ready to lead the way,” he said. The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, said: “It is a matter of trust and leadership. This decision will hurt the US and the planet.” Izabella Teixeira, who lead the Brazilian negotiating team in 2015, described Trump’s announcement as a “heart attack” but said the world would survive. She dismissed suggestions that any new deal would have to ignore US historical emissions. “These are old ideas, old politics,” she told the Guardian. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the decision was a “major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security”.  The Indian government did not immediately react to Trump’s announcement, which came shortly after 1am local time, but India’s energy minister recently reaffirmed the south Asian giant’s commitment to the global climate agreement. The world’s third-largest carbon pollution emitter is on course to exceed the renewable energy targets it set in Paris in 2015 by nearly 50%, and three years ahead of schedule. Trump’s withdrawal announcement came in the late evening in Russia, and official commentary was not immediately available. But Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said earlier on Thursday that Russia “attaches great importance” to the Paris climate accord, and a US withdrawal could complicate the agreement’s implementation. “Of course, the effectiveness and realisation of this convention will be hampered without key participants,” Peskov told journalists. “There is no alternative (to the accord) at this time.” The US has long been a key – though not always enthusiastic – player in international efforts to mitigate the already apparent trends of increasing temperatures, rising sea levels and more frequent and intense droughts, floods and storms. Trump is accused of jettisoning this international role and putting the domestic fossil fuel industry first. Though his term may be too short to complete the job he has begun. Lukas Hermwille, scientific researcher in the field of international climate policy at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, drew attention to the fact that the exit from the agreement would anyway only come into effect in around three years’ time “ironically”, he told Die Welt, “on the day after the next US presidential election”. But Trump could still spend the rest of his time in office torpedoing climate protection from the inside out, he added.  Environmental groups were appalled. Tanya Steele, CEO of WWF said the decision makes it harder for the world to reach a safer and more prosperous future. “It is hugely disappointing that President Trump is making the mistake in rowing back on the Paris agreement,” she said, “Climate change is a very real global issue that affects the successful future of our planet.” Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory said the decision “creates the risk of a domino effect” that could put the target of keeping temperature rises below 2C (3.6F) out of reach, though he held out hope that global talks can make greater progress in reducing fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy in the absence of a country that has flitted back and forth between leadership and obstruction. Many US mayors have said they will abide by climate commitments regardless of the White House U-turn. This was echoed by municipal leaders overseas. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who chairs a group of 40 major cities, said: “No matter what decision is made by the White House, cities are honouring their responsibilities to implement the Paris agreement. There is no alternative for the future of our planet.” Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris, Alec Luhn in Moscow and Michael Safi in Delhi"

"We know humans are causing climate change. That is a fact that has been known for well over 100 years. We also know that there will be significant social and economic costs from the effects. In fact, the effects are already appearing in the form of more extreme weather, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and so on. So why haven’t humans done much about the problem? Answering that question may be more challenging than the basic science of a changing climate. Fortunately, a new review just out in Science helps us with this question. Lead author, Dr. Elise Amel, a colleague of mine, completed the review with colleagues Drs. Christie Manning, Britain Scott, and Susan Koger. Rather than focusing solely on the problems with communicating the science of climate change, this work takes a wider view on the hurdles that get in the way of meaningful action.  The review points out that since the 1970s, extensive efforts to educate people have not lead to significant shifts in behavior. They also acknowledge that using fear or guilt has not been effective in getting people to act. So, what can help?  Well, first we must understand that it is not just internal forces (emotions, beliefs, attitudes, etc.) that affect human behavior, but external influences as well. External factors, like social networks, societal roles, cultural worldviews, habits, infrastructure, investments, etc, are often severely underestimated in the extent to which they steer behavior. One fault of prior messaging is an almost exclusive focus of the first (internal) set of factors and a near-complete neglect of the latter (externals). The authors write: Change is hard. Human beings are reticent to change their behavior even under the most compelling of circumstances, and environmental dangers do not tend to arouse the kind of urgency that motivates individuals to act. Mass transformation of unsustainable systems will be even more difficult than shifting individual behaviors, for unlike ants and bees, humans are not well equipped to coordinate behavior for common benefit. Here is really the center of the problem, the social dilemma wherein it is in the collective’s interest to act in one way but individuals may benefit personally if they act in another way.  This struggle for humans to manage our impact on climate is made more complex by the unique issue of climate change; it is a long-term problem that has no apparent immediate and personal threats. Simply put, we need to take actions now to avoid problems later on even though we personally may not experience these consequences.  To counter this disconnect, climate change discussions need to be framed as matters related to current impacts at the local level. It is great that we want to save polar bears, but what really will motivate people are the risks to them right now. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your viewpoint, it is becoming easier and easier to make these connections. Examples abound for instance terrible flooding in the central USA, the record drought in California, recent heat waves in central Asia, or in Australia, as just some examples.  The authors identify a variety of strategies for moving forward with human limitations in mind. Since they acknowledge humans tend not to protect those things they either don’t know or don’t value, ingraining a sense of value in the natural world may be critical. In fact, there is a strong relationship between an individual’s connection to nature and their ecological behavior. In today’s world of growing industrialization and severing of the nature/human connection, the challenge may be to find and create new connection opportunities. More immediately, the authors encourage efforts to change the social norms surrounding environmentally sound behavior - making it cool again.  In fact, individuals play a critical role in inspiring collective actions within various spheres of influence (see the above figure), which is the kind of behavior needed to change the enormous systems - food, transportation, retail, etc. - disproportionately impacting the planet. The review highlights how transformational individuals - those who decide to step outside of accepted social norms - can bring about large-scale change in their social networks and within the organizations of which they are a part. While it feels incredibly awkward to do something different than the norm, we are all capable of it. And, it’s easier if we don’t have to do it alone, so supporting others who take a stand is a crucial role we can all play. I think the summary of the paper does a great job encapsulating the work’s important lessons. The authors write: Psychological research suggests that humans can move toward a sustainable society by creating conditions that motivate environmentally responsible collective action – conditions that help people surmount cognitive limits, create new situational drivers, foster need fulfillment, and support communities of social change. Individuals whose actions are informed by a deeper understanding of how the planet really works can galvanize collectives to change the larger systems that drive so much of human behavior. To radically alter the way humans think and live; educate the next generation; and design physical, governmental, and cultural systems, humans must experience and better understand their profound interdependence with the planet.  And this is where the important research is going. Physical scientists have shown without any remaining doubt that humans are causing climate change. There are no reputable scientists that would disagree. So now that the physical science battle has been won, it is time to move on to hearts and minds. We need both individual and collective change. If we are smart, we can not only save the planet but we can develop a rich relationship with the world and our neighbors and save the future of our species."
"People who work on building infrastructure understand the risks of climate change. As the Earth warms, new stresses are applied to our buildings, bridges, roads, houses, and other structures. Some of the obvious threats to infrastructure are from extreme weather including heat waves, storms, and intense rainfalls. There are some other less obvious threats, and many of the threats vary by location.  Regardless, the planning for infrastructure relies upon a reasonable estimation of future climate changes. To help quantify such an estimate for the civil engineering community, a recent paper was published by the Institution of Civil Engineering Journal of Forensic Engineering (I was fortunate to be a coauthor). The article was prepared with the collaboration of Dr. Michael Mann from Penn State University and Dr. Lijing Cheng from the Chinese Institute of Atmospheric Physics.   The paper in question does not uncover new facts. We didn’t discover past warming that wasn’t known. We didn’t create new predictions that were previously uncreated. Rather, we assembled available information to provide a solid basis that can be used for future plans involving infrastructure.  The first thing we established was the long-term trend in the global temperature. While there are many groups around the world that collect global temperatures, two of the best known groups are NASA and NOAA. As shown in the data below, which I downloaded and graphed for the paper, temperatures have risen by about 1.4°C (approximately 2.5°F) from their low point circa 1900. Since scientists constantly argue against cherry picking; we used an average temperature over the 1880–1930 time period. Relative to that time, temperatures have risen about 1.2°C (1.8°F) I have long argued and certainly continue to believe, that the surface temperature trend is not the best way to quantify warming. If you really want to measure global warming, you have to look in the oceans where the vast majority of heat is being stored. As I have reported here before, the oceans are telling a similar story – climate change is certainly happening. However, since we are not building infrastructure deep in the oceans, its temperatures are not very relevant for the present discussion.  What all this proves is that the Earth is warming. But civil engineers want to know what the Earth will be like in a decade, or two decades, or even longer. To predict that, you need other tools. You could make predictions based on the past temperature record of the planet or you could use computer simulations of the climate. But if you are going to use a simulation, you want to have some reassurance that the results are valid. So, the next thing we did in the paper was compare computer simulations of Earth’s surface temperatures with measurements.  The results are shown below. The figure shows four different data measurement sets and a range of model predictions (grey-shaded region). I’ve highlighted the temperature of 2016 with a red star; it’s slightly above the middle dashed line, which means it’s slightly above the average prediction of the models but certainly within the grey range. As you all know, scientists don’t really care whether one year is hot or another is cold; what we look at is the long-term trend. Clearly, the long-term trends are going up, whether you look at the measurements or the predictions. While it is too early to put the 2017 temperature into the graph, so far, it is almost exactly equal to the 2016 value. If that trend holds for the rest of the year, it will be another case where the models are running slightly too cold. We also showed in the paper that in other instances, the models are under-predicting change. For example, models are under-predicting changes to ocean heating (and to arctic ice loss). But, in general, they are doing a pretty good job. So, if we can trust the models, what do they tell us about the future? This is the question most civil engineers are interested in. In the paper, we showed that we expect the Earth to warm by about 4°C more (7°F) over the present temperature by the year 2100. This is near the upper end of the last IPCC reports. In the paper, we conclude that engineers know enough to begin to prepare. While people in the halls of Congress or in homes at holiday time may still argue about whether climate change is happening, scientists and engineers now have enough information to make informed decisions.  In a certain sense, this latest paper reflects a growing collaboration between climate science and engineering. Climate scientists tell us what is happening to the planet. Engineers are helping us prepare."
"The White House has declined to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change as the president pulled America out of the Paris agreement. Administration officials were also unable to offer revised US carbon emission targets or say what changes to the global landmark accord would persuade Trump to re-enter it. But they did offer assurance that America will abide by the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal, waiting three-and-a-half years to formally withdraw. Trump announced on Thursday the US would join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries to shun the Paris agreement, characterising it as “a reassertion of America’s sovereignty” and saying he was “elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”. There was a chorus of condemnation from world leaders, former president Barack Obama and Trump’s defeated election opponent Hillary Clinton, who branded it “a historic mistake”. Shortly after Trump spoke in the Rose Garden at the White House to applause from supporters, two senior administration officials briefed reporters in the west wing. The officials, who did not wish to be named, did nothing to alter perceptions of the US president as a climate change denier when asked whether he believed human activity was a contributory factor. One official replied: “So I think the fact that the president in his speech today said he wants to come back and renegotiate a better deal for the United States and for the world I think speaks for itself.” The journalist shot back: “So is that a yes? It’s a yes or no question.” The official said: “Again, I think that speaks for itself.” The journalist pressed: “It doesn’t speak for itself, so is that a yes? Does he believe human activity contributes to climate change?” The official said: “I have not talked to the president about his personal views on whether – I was not with the president on his trip. I did not talk to the president about his personal views on what is contributing to climate change.” The official insisted his own views were irrelevant, while a White House staff member interjected: “Can we stay on topic please?” The official echoed: “Can we stay on topic please?” – implying that Trump’s views on the causes of climate change were irrelevant to the Paris decision. On 27 March the same official proved evasive on Trump’s views when questioned by the Guardian. This week Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, also said he had not asked the president’s opinion on the matter. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said he “would not agree” that carbon from human activity is the primary cause of global warming while, in 2014, Trump referred to it as a “hoax”. On Thursday, in a speech that kept a campaign pledge and echoed the fiery “America first” nationalism of his inaugural address, Trump said: “As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord.” During Obama’s tenure, the US had agreed under the accord to reduce emissions by more than a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. The administration officials declined to specify new targets or give even a rough estimate of America’s intended nationally determined contribution to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But they pointed to America’s existing record. “I think leading the world is pretty good, right?” one said. “I think that speaks for itself.” The Paris accord came into effect on 4 November 2016. It makes provision for parties to withdraw, but notice can be given only three years after it kicks in. Withdrawal would take effect a year after that, meaning November 2020, a date that coincides with the next US presidential election – raising the prospect that the issue remains alive during the campaign. “First of all, the whole withdrawal process will be consistent with the Paris agreement,” an official said. “So the Paris agreement has to be in force for three years before you can actually submit a notice formally for withdrawal, which takes at least a year. “During this period, the United States will not acknowledge or do anything to implement the current pledge put down by President Obama. Now what’s the negotiating process? I think that’s going to be determined by the president as we move forward.”  The leaders of France, Germany and Italy joined to express regret at Trump’s decision and insisted the agreement “cannot be renegotiated”. One of the administration officials responded: “If you look at the Europeans, if you look at other major economies or allies or partners, they have a strong interest in finding common ground with the United States and again, we don’t want to get out ahead of ourselves here on what may be discussed or not. “There are a lot of different issues related to the international climate agenda that may not necessarily fall into the Paris bucket per se.” He added: “The president is very sincere when he says he wants a better deal, he wants to negotiate, potentially bringing us back in Paris depending on what that looks like ... I think it’s a little bit more nuanced than stay in or not.” Officials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) challenged a set of talking points issued to support Trump’s decision as misleading. A statement from MIT said: “The relevant MIT researchers believe that the Paris agreement is an unprecedented and vital effort by nearly 200 countries to respond to the urgent threat of global climate change.”"
"The Paris climate pact agreed at the end of 2015 was a historic achievement after more than two decades of failed efforts to reach a global consensus on climate change. It became legally binding about a year later, after countries responsible for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions had ratified it. Only two countries have not joined: Syria, which was crippled by war at the time of negotiations, and Nicaragua, which refused to sign up because it considered the deal too weak. Therefore, as the US pulls out it becomes the only country in the world to argue that the Paris accord demands too much of signatory nations.  The Paris deal bridged yawning divides on how to limit emissions, partly by focusing more on ambitions than obligations. It aims to keep the overall increase in global temperatures below 2C, with an aspiration of limiting them to 1.5C. Scientists say these are the largest increases possible without risking catastrophic and irreversible change in the world’s climate. Developed and developing countries, which squabbled for years about who should foot the bill for cleaner growth, must all limit their emissions and try to achieve a zero-emissions economy by the end of this century. Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. There are no legally binding requirements, and even the voluntary caps on emissions agreed so far are actually far too loose to hit the treaty’s own targets. Instead they are likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C. But governments are committed to meet every five years to review targets and progress, starting in 2023, potentially ramping up their goals. Environmentalists and governments backed the compromise deal in the hope that it would spur investment in clean technology, while both peer pressure and example would spur officials to tackle their emissions. There is some indication that just the existence of the deal is having a positive effect, and the market for green energy is growing so fast that US firms including Exxon Mobil have pushed Donald Trump to stay in. The US is not bound to any targets by the Paris accord, and is already moving away from Barack Obama’s commitment to cut emissions. It will continue to do so regardless of whether it remains part of the global deal. There are fears that formal withdrawal could dent the soft-power impact of the agreement. But other major emitters including the European Union and China point out that the US would be as free to rejoin as it is to leave. They have vowed that their commitment to tackling climate change will not be affected, perhaps bolstered by polls showing that the deal has the backing of a firm majority of US voters."
"The UN’s deputy secretary general has accused President Donald Trump of “treading water” over a decision on the future of the Paris climate change agreement, on which the fate of millions of people depend. Amina Mohammed told the Guardian she was hopeful the US would not renege on the deal signed last year, but that Trump appeared to be avoiding a public declaration after taking such a hard line during his campaign for the White House.   Trump has previously described climate change as a hoax orchestrated by China. During his battle for the presidency against Hillary Clinton he vowed to “cancel” the historic agreement, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature does not rise 2C above pre-industrial levels.  Since being elected Trump, who is on a world tour starting with a visit to Saudi Arabia, has delayed announcing his administration’s position, although it is widely believed he will be forced to make a statement at the G7 summit in Italy next weekend. Mohammed said: “[The US] coming out of the agreement does put the track for the ambition of attaining the target in jeopardy and we have to claw that back and make sure that doesn’t happen.” Under the Paris agreement’s “members determined contributions” (MDCs), former president Barack Obama pledged to cut US carbon dioxide emissions by 26% by 2025, bringing it down to 28%. Mohammed, a former environment minister in the Nigerian government, said the White House, while generally sceptical of the detailed terms of the agreement, appeared divided over what steps to take. She said: “As far as the US administration’s discussions are concerned, on the one hand there is the case of staying in the agreement and determining how they would respond to the MDCs and the commitments of the previous administration. They would rather be at the table than not. “On the other hand, there is the other side that says even if you stay in the agreement there is no room for manoeuvre. Those two positions are being worked out. We continue to talk to both sides about the imperative to stay and give the opportunity to go through the MDCs and work together with them on that. “I think he is treading water until he has to say something, probably at the G7 meeting. Maybe he will find a reason why he is not ready then either. What we have seen is there is an understanding in his administration that withdrawing from the agreement is not the best and they would probably be better served to stay in.” Obama hailed last year’s Paris agreement as a historic “turning point” in the fight against climate change, should countries fully commit to cutting emissions. However, Trump has already started stripping away many of the pollution rules imposed by Obama’s administration, such as the signature clean power plan, vehicle emissions standards, clean water regulations and curbs on toxic discharge from power plants. Mohammed said the president needed to be persuaded that while jobs might be lost in the coal industry, they would be regained in renewables if the US stuck to its promises. She said: “The world has recognised that climate change is very real, the science shows emissions are having a detrimental effect and will be catastrophic unless we try to reduce them below two degrees and certainly 1.5. And so, the US being one of top emitters it is essential to have them in the agreement. “Globally, the implications are huge for countries that will go under water, coastlines that will lose investment to high-level sea rises. This is very real. I see hope for the US staying in the agreement. I think there is a bigger challenge of us keeping the ambition of the MDCs.”"
"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has said America has nothing to apologise for on climate change and retains a seat at the negotiating table, claiming: “After all, we’re the United States.” Scott Pruitt joined other officials in declining to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change, a day after the president pulled America out of the landmark Paris agreement. Pruitt claimed Trump wants better terms within the Paris framework or an entirely new deal, and dismissed warnings from world leaders that it is not negotiable. “Well, that’s up to them, right?” the EPA administrator told reporters. “The United States has a seat at the table. After all, we’re the United States and we are leading with respect to CO2 reduction. We have made tremendous progress. “If nations around the globe want to seek to learn from us on what we’re doing to reduce our CO2 footprint, we’re going to share that with them, and that’s something that should occur and will occur in the future. We will reach out and reciprocate with nations that seek to achieve that.” Trump announced on Thursday that the US, the world’s second biggest greenhouse gas emitter, would immediately stop implementing the 195-nation agreement brokered by Barack Obama in 2015. There was a global backlash, and the EU said on Friday it will increase cooperation with China to combat climate change. Pruitt denied that America has abandoned the victims of climate change around the world, arguing that it has done “a tremendous amount” to reduce carbon output to 1990s levels and will stay engaged and continue to export relevant technology. “This is not a message to anyone in the world that America should be apologetic of its CO2 position. We’re actually making tremendous advances. We’re just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country.” He echoed Trump’s attack on members of the agreement as having economic rather than environmental motives. “The world applauded when we joined Paris, and you know why? I think they applauded because they knew it was going to put this country at an economic disadvantage, and the reason European leaders want us to stay in is because they know it will continue to shackle our economy, though we are leading the world with respect to our CO2 reduction.” The EPA administrator was asked repeatedly whether Trump believes climate change is a hoax, as Trump previously claimed, but refused to give a straight answer. “There’s enough to deal with with respect to the Paris agreement and making an informed decision about this important issue,” he said. “That’s where our focus has been the last several weeks.” For his own part, Pruitt acknowledged that global warming is occurring, and that “human activity contributes to it in some manner”. But he added: “Measuring with precision, from my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was similarly evasive on the topic. Asked if he can talk to Trump about the cause of climate change and report back at the next press briefing, he replied: “If I can, I will.” Spicer gave short shrift to suggestions that Trump’s decision will lift China as a global leader. “I think part of the reason the president said it was a bad deal yesterday was because countries including China were not making substantial progress in reducing their carbon footprint. “They weren’t doing enough and America was carrying the load, so I think by negotiating a better deal, hopefully we can get a better result for our country and the world.” Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord; the former says it is not ambitious enough. Under a long exit process, America’s withdrawal will not be become formal until November 2020."

"People who have been following Australia’s tortured climate change policy debate for a long time could be forgiven for wondering whether the whole area is cursed. Just when it looks like there could be a prospect of progress, an obstacle emerges. In this case, the obstacle is Donald Trump, who by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord has turned America from leader of the free world into free rider.  The US president’s willingness to surrender global leadership on important issues is, from this distance, truly unfathomable. Even his withdrawal patter on Friday morning was pathetic. America was out, but would come back in if it could get a better deal. America was out, but possibly back in, because the citizens of Pittsburgh apparently don’t care about climate change. Seriously. What a performance. As Malcolm Turnbull might have said breezily before he almost lost an election, what a time to be alive. I know there’s a valid school of thought that says silly Trump doesn’t matter, that America’s recklessness will galvanise the public around the importance of climate change, that the trend towards decarbonisation is now hard-baked in to the system – but that’s not how things look if you sit on the Australian government’s perch. For Turnbull and his government, Trump’s timing is deeply unhelpful, to put it mildly. Right now it is trying to land its own energy policy plane, and whenever you put climate and the Coalition in the same sentence, you know things are going to get complicated. This week the government announced it would change the rules governing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to allow investments in carbon capture and storage – to make the government’s so-called “green bank” more technology-neutral in its outlook. This rule change was in large part about laying some groundwork for a more substantial process which is lurking, just visible over the horizon. A week from now, a much anticipated report from the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, will be made public. For months, Finkel has been beavering away trying to save the government from the significant problem it created for itself when it decided, after an internal rebellion, to rule out a carbon trading scheme for the electricity sector.  He has been trying to come up with alternative options which would give the market a clear signal to kickstart new investment in generation capacity – with an eye to Australia’s emissions reduction commitments. This is no easy brief, particularly with one arm tied behind your back. The word around the major interest groups says Finkel will maintain his preliminary advice that an emissions intensity scheme would be a good option, but he will also recommend the government consider a low emissions target, which in practice works like a technology-neutral renewable energy target. A low emissions target is a regulation requiring that a percentage of electricity be generated annually from “low-emissions” sources. This will certainly be renewables and gas. It could even be high efficiency coal if you were (1) a government wanting to placate Australia’s resources sector (which is already warming its jets for “axe the carbon tax” round two), and (2) a government needing to apply a stun gun to climate sceptics inside your own party room. Including coal in a low emissions target would be a completely ludicrous development, but ludicrous is what you get after 10 years of zero sum, win-at-all-costs, peak stupid politics. If you engage in the sort of destructive political madness the Coalition has engaged in over the past decade, you unfortunately get to be the hostage of your dancing partners, both internal and external – unless you develop the guts to stand up and tell them to get stuffed. Steering a low emissions target through a party room which contains a rump of climate sceptics, who are already campaigning full tilt to get rid of the current renewable energy target, isn’t even the hard part. The really tricky bit will come after that. A low emissions target isn’t a silver bullet that will magically make Australia meet its Paris emissions reduction targets, particularly if the target isn’t ambitious. Additional abatement measures will be required on top to meet the current Paris commitments, and there will be internal fights about what those measures should be, and their impact on power prices. It doesn’t take much imagination to envisage a scenario where government conservatives would argue that one foolproof way for Australia to get out of its Paris “problem” would be to get out of Paris, or substantially lower the level of ambition, using the US exit as justification. A bunch of people inside the government are already saying this – some have been saying it from the moment Trump was elected – and I believe most of them mean it. You don’t have to ask me how dangerous these discussions get in the Coalition. We can just ask Turnbull, who lost the party leadership over the issue back in 2009. To their credit, Turnbull and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, are absolutely holding the line. Turnbull pushed through the Paris ratification five minutes after Trump was elected, and both say Australia will not withdraw from the accord. Frydenberg is also trying to thread the needle on Finkel. He’s mapped out a route through the obstacle course, strapped on his crash helmet, and set off at a steady jog. But again, it’s not just the Coalition’s tortured internals the prime minister and the energy minister have to war game about. The government also has to think about how its reworked energy policy might ultimately attract bipartisan support. This might seem a laughable concept given all the toxic sludge that’s gone under the bridge this past decade, but the problem the government faces in a public policy sense – a demonstrably sub-par energy grid – can’t be solved unless industry finally gets some certainty out of Canberra. Even if Frydenberg demonstrates over the coming months that he has the wisdom of Solomon and the magic skills of Penn & Teller, and can somehow emerge from his own temperamental party room with a workable and credible climate and energy policy, business won’t believe we’ve finally declared a truce in the climate wars until a truce between the major parties is actually declared. Stakeholders in the energy market are completely over all the brinkmanship and the bullshit. They want a fix, and they are delivering that message loudly and clearly to both sides of politics. Getting a durable public policy fix that will unlock the dollars required for new investment means the government will have to deliver a policy that has a sufficient level of ambition to convince Labor to sign up. Labor isn’t opposed in principle to a low emissions target, and has already stepped back from its original ambition on carbon pricing in an effort to try find where the mythical centre on climate policy might be. But Labor will oppose a low emissions target that isn’t a low emissions target in practice, and if national policy is still bitterly contested, reason suggests investors will keep their wallets in their back pockets. In the end, all this comes down to three simple questions. Does the government have the collective fortitude to ignore Trump’s shameful audition to be the mayor of Pittsburgh, and try instead to do what’s in Australia’s interests, both as a nation and as a responsible citizen of the world? Do Turnbull and Frydenberg have the guts, the intellect and the dexterity to try to push through to get a sensible climate and energy policy, regardless of all the obstacles they face? And if the answer to question two is yes, will Coalition colleagues stop punching themselves (and the country) in the head and let them?"
"The UK could be a green business powerhouse in the next three decades, but only if given proper support by government, a group representing more than 30 low-carbon companies has said. The low-carbon economy in the UK employs at least 432,000 people, with a turnover of more than £77bn in 2015. This is larger than industries such as car-making and steelmaking, which are frequently given the spotlight when politicians discuss industry and jobs.  Growth in green business is also expected to outstrip other sectors of the economy, as international opportunities open up for low-carbon goods and services. Investments by major developing countries alone are projected to be $23tn by the end of the next decade, with green business’s supporters arguing that the UK is well placed to take a share of the burgeoning market.  In a letter to the Guardian, a group representing more than 30 of the UK’s green and low-carbon companies forecast that the low-carbon economy would rocket from 2% of the UK’s GDP today to 13% in the next three decades, boosting both manufacturing and services, but only with government support.  The business leaders urged politicians across the spectrum to respond, as the policies of the next government will play a major role in determining how the sector develops and whether job opportunities are realised. They wrote: “Stable policies to grow the UK’s low-carbon market will be essential to turn this potential into reality and ensure our economy remains competitive on the global stage.” Green businesses have been disappointed by the apparent lack of interest in the sector during the general election campaign, and by the absence of strong public commitments in the manifestos. The signatories to the letter concluded: “We call on the new government to put in place ambitious and long-term policies to tackle climate change and improve the state of the environment at the heart of its industrial strategy and vision for the UK.” The letter was coordinated by the Aldersgate Group and also signed by 11 companies including Kingfisher, Aviva Investors, Anglian Water, Siemens, and Scottish and Southern Energy. Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, said the decision by US president Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would not make a major dent in the prospects for growth.  He noted that the shift to a more efficient and lower carbon economy is well under way across the globe, with the cost of clean technologies, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, falling rapidly, and investment growing strongly. “Following the commitments made by six world leaders at the recent G7 summit, and the news of greater cooperation between China and the EU on climate change, major global players like the UK must continue to build competitive, low-carbon economies and honour their commitments under the Paris agreement.”  Environmental businesses in the UK have been hit in recent years by swings in government policy that have led to job losses and uncertainty among potential investors. These swings include the scrapping of subsidies and harder planning requirements for onshore wind farms; the slashing of support for solar panels and restrictions on solar farms; the abandonment of the “green deal”, which was intended to boost home insulation; the removal of the promised £1bn funding for carbon capture and storage facilities; and the scrapping of the target to make new homes zero-carbon.  Last week, Labour accused the Conservative government of failing to come up with plans on how to achieve the statutory targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, set out under the Climate Change Act. Green groups fear that a new Conservative government under Theresa May could scrap the Climate Change Act, leaving the UK without firm targets on cutting greenhouse gases. However, the government has pointed to increased investment for electric vehicles, support for new nuclear power stations, and a boost to offshore wind as evidence of its commitment to low-carbon infrastructure.  Since May 2010, the UK has installed more than 11GW of wind power, generating enough electricity for more than 7.8m homes.   "
"Craven, cynical and corrupt: an alliteration that sums up Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accord on climate change.  He rebuffed the entreaties of everyone from Elon Musk to the pope. He ignored scientific evidence that already shows catastrophic beach erosion, cracking Arctic ice and flooding cities. Instead, he cast in with his climate change-denying EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, and the barons of the world’s dirtiest industries, coal and fossil fuels.  It was a craven act because the US over time is the biggest contributor to the carbon dioxide that is poisoning the atmosphere and sizzling the planet. Given our culpability in creating an urgent worldwide environmental crisis, it was a moral duty to keep our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 2C (3.6F). To walk away is supremely selfish. “In cumulative terms, we certainly own this problem more than anybody else does,” David G Victor, a longtime scholar of climate politics at the University of California at San Diego told the New York Times. “Many argue that this obligates the United States to take ambitious action to slow global warming.” While moral arguments don’t seem to matter to this president, geopolitical gamesmanship does. Trump’s decision was self-defeating for the country and him. For someone so hellbent on being the big man on the world stage that he pushed the prime minister of Montenegro out of the way so that he could be front and center in a photo, his decision radically shrinks American influence.  He has handed a unique leadership role in curbing climate change to China, assuming it will remain in the accord. Already the Chinese leadership is licking its lips over Trump’s nationalist retreat from anything perceived as globalism, particularly his bungled messaging on Nato at last week’s G7 meeting in Brussels. He left Angela Merkel fuming that Europe could no longer count on the US to defend its interests. Look eastward, the Chinese say, beckoning Europe to look to its support, deals and friendship.  The splintering of the post-second world war alliance, which ushered in an age of liberal democracy in the west, would be a tragedy beyond imagining. But Thursday’s announcement abandoning the Paris accord is a dangerous step in that direction because it fuels the perception that no one can really depend on the US to keep its word. Already there was deep annoyance with the US when, after spending years negotiating a climate agreement with the Clinton administration, rich and poor counties were confronted by another turncoat president, George W Bush, who backed out of it.  Now, less than a decade later, it is Trump doing the about-face on the long-fought climate agreement struck with Barack Obama. Why would other countries ever again trust the US to stick to an agreement on global warming or waste time negotiating one with the US again? Trump’s pledge that the US will stick to the letter of the accord’s withdrawal process, which would take more than four years, might also be forgotten. Justifying his reactionary positions on global warming with the myth of job creation is beyond cynical. In his remarks, Trump listed sectors of the US economy that would suffer lost revenues and jobs if the country remained part of the accord. But the only evidence he used is a study that has been roundly disputed by credible environmental experts.  The dubious study claims the agreement would cost 2.7m jobs by 2025. The reality is quite the opposite, as Obama noted in his biting remarks about his successor’s decision. “The nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,” he said in a statement. It is cynical and cruel to raise the hopes of out-of-work coal miners, claiming that by abandoning the accord he will bring back their jobs. Almost everyone else, besides the conservative coal barons who support him and were feted in the White House, and a few misguided politicians in the coal counties of Virginia, Tennessee and West Virginia, know those jobs are gone for good.  Long ago, lopping off mountaintops and strip mining, which required machines instead of humans, erased good mining jobs. This was long before the Paris negotiators sat down for their first meeting in 2015. On Thursday, the Koch brothers and their allies in big oil must have been turning cartwheels of glee over their rigs. Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the influential libertarian brothers Charles G and David H Koch, was one of the leaders of a coalition that urged exiting from the treaty. The groups also included ones bankrolled by the Mercer family, patrons of Steve Bannon, the White House aide who held the president’s hands to the fire to keep his base-pleasing promise to trash the Paris accord. While the Kochs were initially cool to Trump as a candidate, his decision on the Paris accord will surely help cement their support and financial largesse for years to come and in 2020, if Trump survives and seeks re-election. This is precisely the kind of corrupt pay-to-play politics that Trump pledged to end by “draining the swamp”. He will need the support. The political blowback is already huge. Former vice-president Al Gore, who was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for efforts to educate about global warming, called Trump’s decision “a reckless and indefensible action”. Former secretary of state John Kerry called the move an “abdication” of leadership and “self-destructive”. Gore is touring the country in advance of the premiere of his new documentary on global warming, an update on his blockbuster An Inconvenient Truth. Already, with his self-defeating immigration policies, Trump has turned a cold heart to much poorer nations. His decision to abandon the climate agreement that virtually every other country on Earth approved is even colder. One of the central tenets of the accord was that richer countries and the biggest polluters – the US and China – would help to fund the efforts to curb global warming by much smaller and poorer nations.  Trump often invokes his young son, Barron, in his speeches. His terrible decision leaves his son’s generation facing scorching environmental problems. For the father, this will indeed be an inconvenient truth."
"All signs now point to Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the closest thing the international community has to a plan for dealing with climate change.  In the lead-up to this week’s expected decision, the nationalist, Steve Bannon-led wing of the White House has tried to paint climate change – and the agreement, by extension – as a concern of elites.   Headlines on Breitbart over the weekend derided Gary Cohn (“Carbon Tax Cohn”, to some) for trying to change Trump’s mind about pulling out of the deal, complete with a globe emoji alongside the Goldman Sachs veteran’s name – a double entendre for his belief in globalization and global warming.  Real Americans care about reviving the beleaguered coal industry and unleashing the power of America’s natural resources to create jobs, their argument goes. The only people who care about climate change are bankers and celebrities. The problem is that they aren’t entirely wrong – at least, from looking at headlines.  Billionaires such as Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio have become some of the most recognizable faces of the fight against climate change for producing high-profile documentaries on the subject and jetting around the world to spread their gospel. Elon Musk – the Tesla CEO now under fire for mistreating his workers – has been celebrated by environmentalists for building electric cars and batteries to store solar power.  Climate change is a frequent topic of conversation at 1% confabs such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, where this year’s 15 sessions on climate featured 60 CEOs. Over the past several weeks, greens such as the Natural Resources Defense Council have touted the fact that corporations including Walmart, BP and Unilever all favor sticking with Paris.  Even JP Morgan Chase head and Trump adviser Jamie Dimon has joined the fold, signing a letter with Musk and business magnates in the Wall Street Journal expressing their “strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement”. Especially given the scale of change needed, “believes in climate change” – or in remaining in the Paris agreement, for that matter – is a godawful litmus test for deciding who gets to be called a climate hero. If there is a pragmatic economic case to be made for switching over to renewables and divesting from fossil fuel assets, then elites will chase profits. They don’t need to be lauded for doing so.  Moreover, continuing to praise bankers and billionaires for symbolic statements on climate helps do Bannon and Breitbart’s work for them. In populist times, salvaging any hope for real progress on climate change “post-Paris” – domestically and internationally – will mean making the case for taking on climate change in strictly populist terms.  Luckily, that case practically makes itself. The brand of climate denial that informs Trump and the Republican party line is the result of one of the global elite’s most effective projects yet. It’s been multinational corporations funding the campaign to cast doubt on scientific consensus. ExxonMobil, for instance, has poured at least $33m into such efforts since the Kyoto protocol was launched in 1997. Despite this long-running disinformation campaign, the majority of voters in every state support the United States’ participation in the agreement. What’s more, any reasonable solution to climate change will require massive amounts of job creation, putting people to work doing everything from installing solar panels to insulating houses to updating the country’s electric grid to nursing and teaching, jobs in two of the country’s already low-carbon sectors.  “If you are genuinely serious about shifting to a low-carbon society within the timeframe we have, then it is an absolute agenda for jobs,” climate scientist Kevin Anderson said earlier this year. “You are guaranteeing full employment for 30 years if we think climate change is a serious issue. If we don’t, we can carry on with structural unemployment.” Climate policies can improve people’s lives in the here and now while preventing a truly catastrophic end to the 21st century. So don’t chide Trump and the rest of his party for denying climate change when they pull out of the Paris agreement. Chide them for denying millions of Americans the well-paying jobs and stable future they deserve. The silver lining of the climate crisis is that it may be the United States’ greatest opportunity yet to upend its vastly unequal economy, and kick the executives who engineered both out of power. It’s one of history’s greatest “us v them” scenarios, pitting a handful of oligarchs and profit-hungry fossil fuel CEOs against the rest of humanity. Let’s not let those optics go to waste."
"Despite the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate change (Anger at US as Trump rejects climate accord, 2 June), the global market for low-carbon goods and services is rapidly growing and the UK must make the most of this opportunity. Spurred in particular by major investments in low-carbon technologies by countries such as China, India, Mexico and South Africa, the Paris agreement could open up $23tn (£18tn) worth of opportunities for low-carbon investments in emerging markets between 2016 and 2030. The commitments made by six world leaders at the recent G7 summit and the decision by China and the EU to collaborate more closely on climate change support this trend.  The UK is well placed to benefit. Its low-carbon sector employed 432,000 people and produced a turnover in excess of £77bn in 2015. The UK’s strengths include manufacturing ultra-low emission vehicles and offshore wind turbines, piloting innovative ideas in energy, water and resource efficiency and providing financial and legal services for clean energy projects worldwide. The focus on developing low-cost, low-carbon infrastructure is gaining momentum across all key economic sectors. The low-carbon economy could grow from 2% of UK GDP today to 13% by 2050. However, stable policies to grow the UK’s low-carbon market will be essential to turn this potential into reality and ensure our economy remains competitive on the global stage. We therefore call on the new government to put in place ambitious and long-term policies to tackle climate change and improve the state of the environment at the heart of its industrial strategy and vision for the UK.Nick Molho Executive director, Aldersgate Group, Chris Newsome Director of asset management, Anglian Water, Steve Waygood Chief responsible investment officer, Aviva Investors, Nigel Stansfield President, Interface Europe, Middle East and Africa, Pierre Woreczek Chief customer officer, Kingfisher, Jens Tommerup CEO, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, Matthew Knight Director of energy strategy and government affairs, Siemens UK, Alistair Phillips-Davies Chief executive, SSE, Julia Barrett Director, Willmott Dixon Re-Thinking, David Symons UK Director of Sustainability, WSP, Piers Guy UK country manager, Vattenfall, Paul Greensmith UK country leader, XL Catlin • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Barnaby Joyce has declined to say whether Australia should remain within the Paris climate accord if the United States pulls out, in a departure from the official government line that Australia will stay the course. While Australia’s energy and employment ministers have said this week Australia will honour its Paris commitments regardless of what Donald Trump decides, the Nationals leader and deputy prime minister was more guarded on Thursday. Asked what Australia should do if Trump quit the treaty, Joyce told reporters: “Well, um, to speculate on a whole range of things is dangerous, to speculate on what Donald Trump might do is insanity.” Pressed with a second question, Joyce said: “I’m going to watch my Twitter feed and see what happens.” The US president confirmed on Thursday morning Australian time the formal decision of his administration about Paris was imminent. I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Over this past weekend, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, repeated previous statements by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, that Australia was in the Paris accord for the long haul. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, during an appearance before Senate estimates on Wednesday, said the government had made it clear that the US staying the course with the global climate agreement was desirable and in Australia’s national interest. She said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and to our carbon emissions reduction target, and she said Australia’s interests were best served by the US maintaining its commitment to the Paris agreement. Frydenberg said on Wednesday afternoon what Trump did was a matter for him but he noted the emissions intensity of the US economy was at its lowest level in 20 years. “It is moving in the right direction,” he said. He said more than 140 countries had ratified the Paris agreement and “Australia takes our obligations to agreements we sign up to and ratify very seriously. “Australia has commitments and we are sticking to those. I think we can meet our targets and we are making good progress in doing so.” On Thursday, Malcolm Turnbull was asked whether history would repeat itself. Turnbull was asked whether he would follow Trump out of Paris, just as John Howard had followed George W Bush out of the Kyoto treaty. Turnbull said Australia was staying in the agreement. “I repeat today, what I said on the 16th of November, when the treaty was ratified, when Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” “We are committed to the Paris agreement, and we’re on track to meet our targets.” In a television interview later on Thursday, Joyce also indicated Australia would stay the course. “The whole point of having international agreements is you comply with them,” the deputy prime minister told Sky News. Joyce said Australia would comply with the Paris agreement in a way that would have a “minimal impact” on the job prospects of Australians. But government conservatives have been signalling for months that Australia should review its commitments if Trump quits the treaty. The chairman of the government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, Craig Kelly, told Guardian Australia on Thursday if the US pulled out, Australia would need to consider its position. “I think we should reconsider where the entire treaty is up to,” Kelly said. The Sydney Liberal said Australia’s commitment under the agreement was “one of the most significant in the world” and he contrasted that commitment with undertakings from China and Russia, which he characterised as negligible. He said the Paris treaty weakened America economically at the expense of two strategic adversaries, China and Russia. “Is that a good thing from Australia’s point of view?” Kelly said if Trump chose to stay within the Paris framework, but scale back the US emissions reduction commitments, then Australia could follow suit. As reports emerged from the US that Trump would likely pull out, Kelly posted on Facebook that he had “the champagne on ice”. Kelly’s view will be shared by other conservatives. While he is yet to enter the fray on the Paris deal, Tony Abbott has been campaigning publicly against the renewable energy target he adjusted as prime minister for some months. The assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed Seselja, one of the government’s up-and-coming conservative figures, said last month Australia was already “doing more than our share, in my opinion”. The frontbencher said Australia was committed to the Paris treaty as things stood, but if America withdrew, that would change the nature of the agreement. “Obviously you wouldn’t want to speculate, but if they were to pull out obviously that would change the nature of that agreement.” Trump’s likely withdrawal from the Paris deal complicates the politics of energy policy for the Turnbull government, which next week will be handed the Finkel review of the national electricity market. In a speech to an economic thinktank late on Wednesday, Frydenberg referenced the climate wars of the past decade, noting that energy policy had “destroyed two prime ministers and one opposition leader”. He predicted “big battles” both within the Coalition – and potentially within Labor – and externally with stakeholders, as the government seeks to land a new policy post-Finkel. There a widespread expectation among key industry groups that the chief scientist will use his looming report to recommend the government adopt a new low-emissions target, which would work in practice as a technology-neutral renewable energy target (RET)."
"The heads of some of the largest and most influential American technology companies expressed their “deep disappointment” at Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord.   In separate statements and messages on social media, leaders of Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft and IBM declared climate change an “urgent” threat that required a global effort to combat.  “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted on Thursday. “Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called the decision “incredibly shortsighted” and a “move backwards by the federal government”. He also retweeted several stories and statements disapproving of Trump’s move to extract the US from the Paris agreement, including a message from the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, that read: Make Our Planet Great Again.  This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o Facebook CEO Mark Zuckererg said Trump’s decision “puts our children’s future at risk”. He said the social media giant was committed to ensuring that every new data center is powered by 100% renewable energy. “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted: “Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.” Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, followed through with his promise to step down from two of Trump’s business advisory councils if the president removed the US from the global climate agreement.  IBM said in a statement that the tech company “supported and still supports US participation in the Paris agreement”. IBM said, however, confirmed that its CEO, Ginni Rometty, will remain on Trump’s business advisory council. “IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it,” the statement said.  Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a statement the company has been a “steadfast supporter of the Paris agreement” and was therefore “disappointed with today’s decision by the White House”.  Smith said his company had worked for months to persuade Trump to remain in the Paris agreement, though ultimately that effort came up short. “We’ve sent letters to and held meeting on this topic with senior officials in the state department and the White House. And in the past month, we’ve joined with other American business leaders to take out full-page ads in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and New York Post, urging the administration to keep the United States in the Paris agreement,” Smith said in a statement. Microsoft was part of handful of influential technology firms behind an eleventh-hour push to keep the US in the Paris climate accord ahead of his Thursday announcement in the White House rose garden.  “Climate change presents both business risks and business opportunities,” read a letter signed by more than two dozen companies and published as a full-page advertisement in several US newspapers on Thursday morning. “Continued US participation in the agreement benefits US businesses and the US economy in many ways.”"
"World leaders, businesses, investors, scientists and development charities have joined in urging Donald Trump not to withdraw the US from the Paris climate change agreement. The US president is due to announce his decision at 3pm ET on Thursday and is expected to pull the world’s largest economy, and second greatest polluter, from the global accord agreed unanimously by almost 200 nations in 2015. The agreement to fight global warming is based on voluntary pledges to cut greenhouse emissions but Trump has argued this could damage the US economy. However, a huge range of US business leaders argue the opposite, saying the fast-growing green economy is an opportunity for the US. Twenty-five leading companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Levi Strauss and Unilever, are running an advert in the US media on Thursday, urging Trump not to abandon the Paris deal. They say the accord’s “stable and practical framework” creates jobs and is good for business.  More than 1,000 other US companies and investors, including DuPont, eBay and Nike, have also backed the Paris deal, saying: “Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.” The Tesla boss, Elon Musk, said he had urged Trump to back Paris and would resign from two presidential advisory bodies he serves on. World leaders also stated their commitment to the Paris deal, with China’s premier Li Keqiang saying on Thursday that fighting climate change was a “global consensus” and an “international responsibility”. The EU and China have forged a new alliance on climate change, stating on Wednesday that the Paris deal had their “highest political commitment”. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, tweeted at Trump on Thursday: “Please don’t change the (political) climate for the worse.” Trump was isolated on the climate issue at a recent G7 summit in Italy. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia, which has in the past opposed climate action, said the country would remain steadfast in its support for the Paris agreement. Russia has said it attaches “great significance” to the Paris deal. On Tuesday the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that if Trump withdrew from the Paris deal there could be negative economic, security and societal consequences for the US. Trump’s own secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has said the US should remain in the Paris accord, as has the man who replaced Tillerson as CEO of ExxonMobil. Another key Trump adviser, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, noted recently the large rise in renewable energy in the US. “If you think about how much solar and how much wind power we’ve created in the US, we can be a manufacturing powerhouse and still be environmentally friendly.” Trump himself once backed climate action, signing a 2009 letter to Barack Obama that stated: “Please allow us, the USA, to serve in modeling the change necessary to protect humanity and our planet.” Development NGOs warned that a US withdrawal from the Paris agreement would harm those in poor countries who had contributed least to the problem. “This will have very serious consequences for millions around the world, whose lives are on the line because of climate change,” said Heather Coleman, of Oxfam America. “Pulling out of the Paris agreement [would be] a huge embarrassment that puts the US in the same camp as Nicaragua and Syria – the only two states who are not party to the agreement.” Scientists have also joined calls for the US to remain. Prof Gabi Hegerl, of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said: “We know that to limit warming and the impacts it causes, we need to limit the total amount of carbon added to the atmosphere. This can only be done if the world economies work together. If Paris is abandoned or weakened, I fear for the future of our children.” If Trump does pull the US from the Paris deal, US city mayors have said they will abide by it nonetheless. The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, said on Twitter: “The president withdrawing from the Paris agreement would be horribly destructive for the planet, the country, and this city. He should know that climate change is a dagger aimed straight at the heart of New York City.”  The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who chairs a group of 40 major cities, said: “No matter what decision is made by the White House, cities are honouring their responsibilities to implement the Paris agreement. There is no alternative for the future of our planet” Analysts have warned that a US withdrawal could see carbon taxes placed on US exports in the future. Richard Black, director of the UK’s Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “A pullout would widen the diplomatic rift with Europe that emerged at the G7 summit and could even lead to trade barriers being erected against US exports.” There are few voices supporting Trump, but Bjørn Lomborg, a Danish scientist, said: “The carbon-cutting treaty approach has failed politically and economically for two decades. It is an incredibly expensive distraction from the green energy R&D investment that is needed to solve climate change.” In Australia, Craig Kelly, the Liberal party chair of the parliament’s environment committee, backed US withdrawal, saying: “It’s not confirmed yet but we have the champagne on ice.”"
"Donald Trump has thrown a hand grenade into the global economic architecture that was so painstakingly constructed in the years after the end of the second world war. The attempted destruction of this rules-based system of global governance – now manifested in Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement – is just the latest aspect of the US president’s assault on our basic system of values and institutions. The world is only slowly coming fully to terms with the malevolence of the Trump administration’s agenda. He and his cronies have attacked the US press – a vital institution for preserving Americans’ freedoms, rights and democracy – as an “enemy of the people”. They have attempted to undermine the foundations of our knowledge and beliefs – our epistemology – by labelling as “fake” anything that challenges their aims and arguments, even rejecting science itself. Trump’s sham justifications for spurning the Paris climate agreement is only the most recent evidence of this.  For millennia before the middle of the 18th century, standards of living stagnated. It was the Enlightenment, with its embrace of reasoned discourse and scientific inquiry, that underpinned the enormous increases in standards of living in the subsequent two and a half centuries. With the Enlightenment also came a commitment to discover and address our prejudices. As the idea of human equality – and its corollary, basic individual rights for all – quickly spread, societies began struggling to eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and, eventually, other aspects of human identity, including disability and sexual orientation. Trump seeks to reverse all of that. His rejection of science, in particular climate science, threatens technological progress. And his bigotry toward women, Hispanics, and Muslims (except those, like the rulers of Gulf oil sheikhdoms, from whom he and his family can profit), threatens the functioning of American society and its economy, by undermining people’s trust that the system is fair to all. As a populist, Trump has exploited the justifiable economic discontent that has become so widespread in recent years, as many Americans have become downwardly mobile amid soaring inequality. But his true objective – to enrich himself and other gilded rent-seekers at the expense of those who supported him – is revealed by his tax and health-care plans. Trump’s proposed tax reforms, so far as one can see, outdo George W Bush in their regressivity (the share of the benefits that go to those at the top of the income distribution). And, in a country where life expectancy is already declining, his health-care overhaul would leave 23 million more Americans without health insurance. While Trump and his cabinet may know how to make business deals, they haven’t the slightest idea how the economic system as a whole works. If the administration’s macroeconomic policies are implemented, they will result in a larger trade deficit and a further decline in manufacturing. America will suffer under Trump. Its global leadership role was being destroyed, even before Trump broke faith with over 190 countries by withdrawing from the Paris accord. At this point, rebuilding that leadership will demand a truly heroic effort. We share a common planet, and the world has learned the hard way that we have to get along and work together. We have learned, too, that cooperation can benefit all. So what should the world do with a babyish bully in the sandbox, who wants everything for himself and won’t be reasoned with? How can the world manage a “rogue” US? Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the right answer when, after meeting with Trump and other G7 leaders last month, she said that Europe could no longer “fully count on others”, and would have to “fight for our own future ourselves”. This is the time for Europe to pull together, recommit itself to the values of the Enlightenment, and stand up to the US, as France’s new president, Emmanuel Macron, did so eloquently with a handshake that stymied Trump’s puerile alpha-male approach to asserting power. Europe can’t rely on a Trump-led US for its defence. But, at the same time, it should recognise that the cold war is over – however unwilling to acknowledge it America’s industrial-military complex may be. While fighting terrorism is important and costly, building aircraft carriers and super fighter planes is not the answer. Europe needs to decide for itself how much to spend, rather than submit to the dictates of military interests that demand 2% of GDP. Political stability may be more surely gained by Europe’s recommitment to its social-democratic economic model. We now also know that the world cannot count on the US in addressing the existentialist threat posed by climate change. Europe and China did the right thing in deepening their commitment to a green future – right for the planet, and right for the economy. Just as investment in technology and education gave Germany a distinct advantage in advanced manufacturing over a US hamstrung by Republican ideology, so, too, Europe and Asia will achieve an almost insurmountable advantage over the US in the green technologies of the future. But the rest of the world cannot let a rogue US destroy the planet. Nor can it let a rogue US take advantage of it with unenlightened – indeed anti-Enlightenment – “America first” policies. If Trump wants to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax on US exports that do not comply with global standards. The good news is that the majority of Americans are not with Trump. Most Americans still believe in Enlightenment values, accept the reality of global warming and are willing to take action. But, as far as Trump is concerned, it should already be clear that reasoned debate will not work. It is time for action. • Joseph E Stiglitz is a Nobel prizewinner in economics, professor at Columbia University, a former senior vice-president and chief economist of the World Bank, and one-time chair of the US president’s council of economic advisers under Bill Clinton © Project Syndicate"
"Donald Trump doesn’t give much thought to his legacy because he has little interest in living outside the blinding present. Ideas and impulses come and go, defining national policy, rendering past and future meaningless. Now the world trembles as this erratic president mulls whether to withdraw from a climate change accord that may determine the course of the century.  If Trump moves to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, as he once vowed to do as a candidate, he would successfully undercut global efforts to avert a coming catastrophe. As the world’s largest economy and second largest greenhouse gas polluter, the US cannot unilaterally destroy the 195-nation pact, but it can encourage other nations more skeptical of the deal, such as India and the Philippines, to follow suit.   The goals of the agreement – to lower planet-warming emissions enough to mitigate the extreme heat, massive storms and coastal flooding projected for the coming decades – will be even harder to reach.   Trump is a climate change skeptic, a severe outlier on the world stage but not so in his retrograde Republican party. Democrats, beset with their own challenges and hypocrisies, at least understand that climate change poses an existential threat. This is not like Trump hemming and hawing over pulling out of Nato, a military alliance that is not required to protect the stability of human civilization. This is much worse.   But these are not terms Trump thinks in. Despite fancying himself as some kind of master builder, he has only shown himself to be a dismantler, a destroyer. His proposed budget guts the government programs needed by the most desperate Americans, many of whom voted for him.  His obsession with repealing Obamacare, which no longer consumes most rank-and-file Republicans now that Barack Obama has left office, will only further destabilize healthcare markets and ensure the suffering of the oldest, sickest and the poorest.  A true populist, even one disdainful of democratic institutions, would at least try to protect the economic safety net that saves the very people who put him in office. Not so with Trump. Maybe the most galling aspect of this new American order is the lack of any organizing philosophy, a workable plan to replace the things he wishes to dismantle. Like a toddler at play time, he smashes things and refuses to clean up. His building blocks are left on the mat.  What could be gained from pulling America out of the Paris agreement or introducing new caveats? Will a few more Trump voters cheer on their man for staying true to his insanity? Maybe. But if the cult of Trump has proven one thing, it’s that it’s forgiving of inconsistencies. It will remain intact whether the strongman swings left or right. It will be there for him if he decides to reaffirm America’s commitment to guarding the health of the planet.  To the people who voted for Trump in coal country, environmentalists will always be the sworn enemy, even if it’s ruthless corporate titans, technological automation and the decline of unions which have doomed them. Trump’s happy to keep that canard alive. And he’s just as happy to offer them nothing else.  Most politicians have a conception of what their utopia might look like, or at least advance ideas or policies towards building a world they’d like to see. Trump, ever more willing to co-opt the nihilism of his party’s most rightwing flank, has no use for seriously investing in his country or the world’s environmental sustainability. That would force him to think deeply about the future. And everyone knows he doesn’t make time for that. "
"During the course of my presidency, I made climate change a top priority, because I believe that, for all the challenges that we face, this is the one that will define the contours of this century more dramatically perhaps than the others. No nation, whether it’s large or small, rich or poor, will be immune from the impacts of climate change. We are already experiencing it in America, where some cities are seeing floods on sunny days, where wildfire seasons are longer and more dangerous, where in our arctic state, Alaska, we’re seeing rapidly eroding shorelines, and glaciers receding at a pace unseen in modern times. Over my eight years in office, we dramatically increased our generation of clean energy, we acted to curtail our use of dirty energy, and we invested in energy efficiency across the board. At the 2015 climate change summit in Paris, we helped lead the world to the first significant global agreement for a low-carbon future.  But here’s the thing: even if every country somehow puts the brakes on emissions, climate change would still have an impact on our world for years to come. Our changing climate is already making it more difficult to produce food, and we’ve already seen shrinking yields and spiking food prices that, in some cases, are leading to political instability. And when most of the world’s poor work in agriculture, the stark imbalances that we’ve worked so hard to close between developed and developing countries will be even tougher to close. The cost will be borne by people in poor nations that are least equipped to handle it. In fact, some of the refugee flows into Europe originate not only from conflict, but also from places where there are food shortages, which will get far worse as climate change continues. So if we don’t take the action necessary to slow and ultimately stop these trends, the migration that has put such a burden on Europe already will just continue to get worse. Now, the good news is that there are steps we can take that will make a difference: in the United States, we have been able to bring our emissions down even as we grow our economy. The same is true in many parts of Europe. Take food production, for instance. It’s the second leading driver of greenhouse gas emissions, second only to energy production. But we have already identified ways in which we can address this challenge. The path to a sustainable food future will require unleashing the creative power of our best scientists, and engineers and entrepreneurs, backed by public and private investment, to deploy new innovations in climate-smart agriculture. Better seeds, better storage, crops that grow with less water, crops that grow in harsher climates, mobile technologies that put more agricultural data – including satellite imagery and weather forecasting and market prices – into the hands of farmers, so that they know when to plant and where to plant, what to plant and how it will sell. All these things can help to make sure that food security exists in poor countries, but it can also help us ensure that, in producing the food that we need to feed the billions of people on this planet, we’re not destroying the planet in the process. A part of this is also going to be wasting less food. We have to create a food culture that encourages a demand for healthier, more sustainable food. In fact, making sure people have healthy food to eat alleviates a lot of the medical cost that we’re seeing increasing in the advanced world, and if we’re able to reduce our healthcare costs, that in turn will allow us to divert those resources into further relieving poverty in many parts of the world. When families get the nourishment they need, we see education outcomes rise, we see healthcare costs fall, and we see economic activity improve; and when, in the United States, the number one disqualifier for military service is obesity, we might even be able to strengthen our security as well. So the good news is that we’re starting to see a better way to feed a growing planet, combat hunger and malnutrition, put healthy food on the table and save our environment. And none of this is impossible. We can look at the successes we’ve already made: in just the past decade, the number of undernourished people in the world is down by more than 160 million. I do not believe that any part of the world has to be condemned to perpetual poverty and hunger. And I do not believe that this planet is condemned to ever-rising temperatures. I believe these are problems that were caused by man, and they can be solved by man. I’m fond of quoting the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who believed that there is such a thing as being too late. When it comes to climate change, the hour is almost upon us. If we act boldly and swiftly, if we set aside our political interests in favour of the air that our young people will breathe, and the food they will eat, and the water they will drink; if we think about them and their hopes and dreams, then we will act, and it won’t be too late. And we can leave behind a world that is worthy of our children, where there’s reduced conflict and greater cooperation – a world marked not by human suffering, but by human progress. Food has not been the focus of climate change discussions as much as it should have been. Part of the problem is that we haven’t publicised the impact of food production on greenhouse gas emissions. People naturally understand that big smokestacks have pollution in them – they understand air pollution, so they can easily make the connection between energy production and greenhouse gases. Most people aren’t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane. So part of the problem that we need to address is just lack of knowledge in the general public. Keep in mind how long it took to educate people around climate change, and we still have a lot of work to do. Part of it is that food is a very emotional issue. Because food is so close to us, and it’s part of our families, and it’s part of what we do every single day, people are more resistant to the idea of government or bureaucrats telling us how to eat, what to eat, how to grow it. The truth is that agriculture communities in every country are very strong, politically. Historically, in the United States, the one area where Democrats and Republicans agree is on the agriculture committee, because they usually come from agricultural states, and they are very good at joining across party lines to protect the interest of food producers. If you combine all those things with the fact that the system is so uneven – there are countries that just need more food, and there are countries where there is a glut of food – it makes for a difficult political dynamic in which to shape rational policy. Now, having said that, this is an area where we are starting to see some progress. In the United States, one of the things that we tried to do is to work with farmers to think about how they could produce the same amounts of food more efficiently, with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. And what I’ve always said is that if you want to make progress in this area, you have to take into account the interests of the producers themselves. Farmers work hard, and especially with small farms, or family farms, they feel that they are always just a step away from losing everything. Obviously, a large portion of agriculture is dominated by agribusiness, but to the extent that you can show small- and medium-sized farmers ways to do things better that will save them money – or at least doesn’t cost them money – they’re happy to adopt some of these new processes. But if what they see is that you are putting the environmental issues as a priority over their economic interest, then they’ll resist. That’s true in advanced countries, and it’s also true in poor countries. My father is from Kenya. The first time I visited, I was speaking to some conservationists who were very upset because some of the game parks were being encroached upon by farmers – either the Maasai with their cattle, or subsistence farmers who were slashing and cutting down the ecosystem. And my sister – who’s from Kenya and has a less romantic view about animals and game parks – said: “Well, if all the money from the game parks is going to the tour agencies in Nairobi and not going to the farmers next door, then of course they are not going to care. But if they see some economic interest in helping to conserve this land, they’ll participate.” And that, in fact, has been the case. Where you’ve seen success in conservation, it’s because you’ve brought in the local farmers and you’ve taught them how this is better for them. So that has to be a top priority. If we’re going to be successful, we have to engage producers. We also have to engage consumers. My good friend Sam Kass cooked for us at the White House, and helped to shape America’s nutrition policy. He worked with my wife to promote healthy eating, and most of the impact he had was not legislation, it was raising awareness with parents about what unhealthy eating was doing to their children, and showing how millions of young children could eat healthier meals. The key is giving people good information. We can make progress in educating the advanced world about the need to reduce, just for dietary reasons, the amount of meat that people consume at any given meal, particularly if it’s wasted. When you have fresh food, you are less likely to waste it, because it doesn’t last as long – you buy it on the day that you are going to eat it and you use it. We’re seeing businesses in the United States trying to come up with efficient, smart ways in which people can have the convenience of fast food, but with the food being healthier, and as a consequence, less is wasted. If people feel as if they don’t have control over their lives, or that their children don’t have a good future, then they will resist efforts to deal with climate change because right now they’re concerned about feeding their child. It’s a luxury to worry about climate change; you have to have enough to eat before you start worrying about what’s going to happen to the planet 30 years from now. If we do not pay attention to increasing inequality – and the fact that technology and globalisation are accelerating – there will be a backlash. Technology is making many sectors of the economy far more capital-intensive and far less labour-intensive. We saw it in manufacturing, but it is now moving through large portions of the service and managerial sectors as well. This is going to be a major problem in the advanced world, and over the long term, in the developing world as well. It’s one of the things I worry about most, because work does not just provide income – it also provides people with a sense of dignity and status in their society. I am certain that in many countries in the Middle East, for example, or in south Asia, part of the problem that leads to radicalisation and conflict is having large numbers of unemployed young men who don’t have anything to do – that lack of meaning and purpose will channel itself in unhealthy ways. The best example of the kinds of issues that we’re going to face comes from driverless cars. Driverless cars are coming. The technologies are here and eventually the regulatory barriers are going to break down. The truth is that we can create a system of driverless cars that are safer, more fuel-efficient, and more convenient. But in the United States alone, there are 3 or 4 million people who make good livings just driving. And where are they going to work, if suddenly trucking and buses no longer need drivers? We have to anticipate those things now. My guess is that, ultimately, what is going to happen is that everybody is going to have to work a little bit less, and we’re going to have to spread work around more. But that’s going to require a reorganisation of the social compact. That requires that we change our mindset about the link between work, income and the value of people in the teaching profession, or healthcare, or certain things that cannot be done by AI or a robot. And one of my goals as president – one of the goals of every leader of every country right now – was thinking about that time 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, when technology will have eliminated entire sectors of the economy. How do we prepare for that? How do we start creating, or at least having a conversation in our society about making sure that work and opportunities are spread, and that everybody has the chance to live a good and fulfilling life, rather than having a few people who are working 80 or 90 hours a week, and making enormous incomes, and then a large portion of redundant workers that increasingly have a difficult time supporting families. That’s not a sustainable mechanism for democracy and a healthy society. The people who know me best would say I have not changed much since I became president. And I’m happy about that. One of the dangers of being in the public eye, being in the spotlight, being in positions of power, is how it will change your soul. There is an expression: you start “believing your own hype” – you start believing that you deserve all the attention. I actually found that I became more humble the longer I was in office. But I also think that I became less fearful. When you are young, you feel like you have something to prove, and sometimes you worry about making mistakes. Once you’ve been president of the United States, then a) you’ve made a mistake every day; b) everybody has seen you fail, and large portions of the country think you’re an idiot – but it’s a liberating feeling when you realise, “OK, I’m still here, I still wake up every day, and I still have the opportunity to do some good”, so that as time went on, I got rid of some of the anxieties that come with youth. When I was president, wherever I’d go, I would always meet with young people. And it would always give me energy and inspiration to see how much talent and sophistication and optimism and idealism existed among young people in the United States, all across Europe, all across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The problem is that so often, young people’s voices aren’t heard, and when they want to get involved in issues, they don’t know how, and they don’t have the tools. So I and others have been talking about how we can create an effective network of global activists – some of whom are in politics, some of whom are in business, some of whom are in journalism or working for NGOs – and provide them with the tools, the training, the networks, the relationships, the funding, so that they can be even more effective. That’s probably what I’m going to be spending most of the next 10 years on. I have a lot of grey hair now. People always ask me, “Oh, Mr President, you know, we need you, we want you to get involved”, and I’m happy to get involved, but the greatest thing I think I can give is to make sure that somebody who is 20 years old, or 21, or 25 – who is ready to make their mark on the world – I can help them, so that they can take it to the next level. When I was young, I gave my mother a lot of headaches. I wasn’t always the best student, and I wasn’t always the most responsible young person. It wasn’t until I got to college that I began to think about many of the broader issues that the world was facing, but the moment for me in which I started to understand leadership was when I moved to Chicago. I had been inspired by the civil rights movement, and I wanted to be involved in some way in bringing about change. I got a job working with low-income communities, and what I learned was that the mark of a good leader is somebody who is able to empower other people. So often we think of leadership as somebody at the top who is ordering other people around. But it turns out that – for me, at least – what made me understand leadership was when I could see somebody who thought they didn’t have a voice, or that they didn’t have influence or power, and teach them how they could speak up about the things that were affecting their lives. When we think about issues like food security or climate change, ultimately politicians can help guide policy. But the energy to bring about change is going to come from what people do every day. It’s going to come from parents who are concerned about the kind of impact climate change may have on their children, or from enlightened business people who say: “How can we use less energy in producing the products that we are making?” It’s millions of decisions that are being made individually that end up having as much impact as anything, and that’s certainly true in our democracies. People have a tendency to blame politicians when things don’t work. But, as I always tell people, you get the politicians you deserve. And if you don’t vote and you don’t participate and you don’t pay attention, then you’ll get policies that don’t reflect your interests. We have an expression in the United States: “The squeaky wheel gets the oil.” It’s certainly true that politicians and governments respond to people making noise and making demands, and sometimes, if certain groups have not been heard before, they have to get the attention of those in power. But the biggest mistake sometimes made by activists – when I was an activist, sometimes I made this mistake – is forgetting that once you’ve got the attention of the people in power, then you have to engage them. So you have to do your homework and you have to have facts, and you have to be willing to compromise and not expect that you’re going to get 100% of what you want, because – at least if you’re in a democracy – your demands may clash with the demands of someone else. It’s very important to be willing to put pressure on government but it’s also important to propose concrete solutions, to take what you can get and then try to make more progress after that. The second thing that is increasingly important is how to shape public opinion. It is very important for people who are interested in issues like climate change or inequality, or whatever it is that you care about, to find effective ways to speak to the public and to change public opinion. Abraham Lincoln used to say: “With public opinion there’s nothing I cannot do, and without public opinion there’s nothing I can get done.” And I’ve learned that first-hand myself. We need to find ways to speak to young people who are getting all their information off a phone, and will not sit down and read a 50-page report. You may have two minutes to get your message across, or five minutes, and they may be more interested in a video than they are in reading a text. You’ll need to create a strong, truthful, powerful message that leads them to action – that’s something I’m going to be spending a lot of time thinking about. Young people are more conscious today, they are more innovative, they are more entrepreneurial. Because they are more sceptical of government and politics, it seems as if a lot of people think: “That’s a dirty business, I don’t want to go into it, who wants to be criticised and attacked all the time?” So you’re seeing a lot of people who want to change the world thinking that maybe the best way to do it is by going into business or non-profit organisations. If I were an entrepreneur today, trying to make money and sell my products or services, I would want to understand this youth market. They want to do the right thing, too. If they find out that what you’re selling isn’t good for the environment, or what you’re selling is not good for people, or if they hear that you do not treat your workers well, and do not pay them a decent wage, and don’t provide decent benefits, that can affect your brand. And so part of what has changed is the nature of the entrepreneurs themselves, who may be more socially conscious, coming into their business. Even if you don’t care about these issues, your customers care. And you’ve got to be paying attention to that.

"A bit of a quieter week for Donald Trump – except towards the end, when he did his best to push the planet into a watery grave. The US president stepped off the plane from his world tour last weekend with his aides refusing to comment on a Washington Post report that his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a key adviser, discussed setting up a secret back channel for conversations between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin. Trump’s last act with his fellow world leaders at the G7 in Sicily had been to resist pressure from all of them to commit to remaining in the Paris climate change deal. He would make up his mind in the coming week, he tweeted, easing back into his old habits after a few days of more disciplined social media messaging and uncharacteristically bookish tweets such as: “I look forward to reading the @CommerceGov 232 analysis of steel and aluminum- to be released in June.” The floodgates really opened on Sunday, with a series of messages hailing the victory of the Montana Republican charged with assaulting a Guardian reporter and hitting out at leaks from his administration and the “fake news media”. As usual, Trump was particularly scathing about the use of anonymous sources. On Memorial Day, following mounting pressure, the president condemned a racist attack in Portland, Oregon, that left two men dead, calling it “unacceptable”. He also issued a statement saying he had “total confidence” in the beleaguered Kushner, as newspaper articles suggested the young “princeling” was falling from the president’s favour. Meanwhile German chancellor Angela Merkel warned that her experience dealing with Trump at the G7 suggested the US might no longer be a completely reliable partner. Not one to shy away from a fight, Trump responded to Merkel with a tweet complaining: “We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military.” Press spokesman Sean Spicer described their relationship, somewhat ambiguously, as “fairly unbelievable”, but claimed: “They get along very well. He has a lot of respect for her.” Spicer was also forced to answer questions about his own position, after the resignation of communications director Michael Dubke reignited speculation that a major staff shake-up was imminent. In Russia investigation news, Trump’s longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a request for documents from the House intelligence committee, as reports claimed that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was reportedly now prepared to provide documents to the committee’s Senate counterpart. Trump also retweeted a Fox News story that reflected relatively well on Kushner, clearly feeling it merited making an exception to his usual rule about stories based on anonymous sources. Early on Wednesday morning, Trump sent the cryptic tweet: “Despite the constant negative press covfefe”, delighting the internet. You might agree with Chrissy Teigen that the president “meant to write ‘coverage’. That’s it. It’s not that deep and not that funny.” But at least one man disagreed – Spicer. Trump’s spokesman said the next day that “the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.” So there you have it. At the same press briefing, Spicer also said the White House would no longer answer questions about the ongoing investigations into Donald Trump’s alleged links to Russia – instead referring them to Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz. And CNN cut ties with comedian Kathy Griffin after she appeared in an art video holding a likeness of the president’s severed head. Things got serious again on Thursday when Trump ended days of speculation by announcing he was pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord. Criticism was swift and brutal both at home and abroad, with Barack Obama issuing a rare statement saying the administration had joined “a small handful of nations that reject the future”. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump said. (Pittsburgh took exception to that.) The president also reneged on a campaign promise to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And the Guardian learned that Brexit leader Nigel Farage was a “person of interest” in the US counter-intelligence investigation looking into possible collusion between the Kremlin and Trump’s presidential campaign. In other Russia news, the Senate intelligence committee announced that former FBI director James Comey will give evidence in public and in private on 8 June. EU leaders told Trump the Paris deal was not up for renegotiation and pledged instead to bypass Washington to work with US business leaders and state governors to implement the accord’s commitments. It was reported that special counsel Robert Mueller had expanded his investigation into Trump and Russia to take in Flynn’s foreign lobbying. Vladimir Putin chipped in to back up Trump’s frequent contention that the various Russia investigations had been flammed up to distract people from the fact that Trump won the 2016 election fair and square. “In all honesty, I myself sometimes thought that the guy was going too far, but it turned out he was right: he found an approach to those groups of the population and those groups of voters he counted on, and they came and voted for him,” Putin said. Unfortunately for Trump, that probably won’t be the last word on the matter."

"Three days after Donald Trump announced that the US would pull out of the Paris climate accord, senior members of his administration could not present a united front in response to questions about the president’s beliefs on climate change.  Trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax, tweeting in 2012 that it was “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. UN ambassador Nikki Haley said in interviews broadcast Sunday that Trump “believes the climate is changing”, partly because of pollution. But Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), passed up five chances to say whether Trump subscribed to such mainstream scientific belief. Asked by State of the Union host Jake Tapper if saying the Chinese invented climate change to achieve an economic advantage was “a big box of crazy”, Haley said: “President Trump believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of that equation. So that is the fact. That is where we are. That’s where it stands.  “He knows that it’s changing and the US has to be responsible for it and that’s what we’re going to do. Just because we got out of a club doesn’t mean we don’t care about it.” On CBS’s Face the Nation, Haley added that Trump was “absolutely intent on making sure that we have clean air, clean water, that he makes sure that we’re doing everything we can to keep America’s moral compass in the world when it comes to the environment”. On ABC’s This Week, however, Pruitt responded to host George Stephanopoulos’s first question on the subject by saying: “I think the president made it clear that the climate changes. And I think what needs to be emphasised here with respect to the Paris accord was about the efficacy of the agreement as it relates to the environment, how it impacts the economy. “The president said on Thursday that engagement internationally is something that’s going to continue but what Paris represents is a bad deal for this country and as such is something we need to exit.” Pruitt was asked if it mattered whether the president said climate change was a hoax. He said: “With respect to the Paris accord, the focus is on the efficacy, the merits of the deal and the demerits of the deal. The president indicated very clearly that engagement by this country internationally is going to continue.” Pruitt also heralded US efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, saying: “We’re leading by example … we are leading with action, not words.” The former Oklahoma attorney general, who regularly sued the EPA in that role, has said carbon dioxide emissions are not a primary cause of global warming, a position rejected by the vast majority of climate scientists. Stephanopoulos asked Pruitt a third time why the president couldn’t say openly whether he believed in manmade contributions to climate change. “Well, frankly, I think the whole question is an effort to get it off the point and the issue of whether Paris is good for this country or not,” said Pruitt. “And the president has indicated the climate changes.” Asked a fourth time, Pruitt said: “What matters is what you do about it. What matters is what steps you take to address CO2 reductions. And what matters when you look at Paris is that China and India didn’t take any steps, while this country did. The environmental left has a very short memory. When Paris was executed they criticised it, said it did not hold China and India accountable.” Stephanopoulos tried a fifth and final pass: “Do you know if President Trump still believes climate change is a hoax?” “Our discussion has been about the efficacy of the agreement,” Pruitt said. “That’s what we spent the last several weeks focused upon. He put America first. He said he could put jobs and the environment first, by the way.” The Paris accord, agreed in 2015 and signed in 2016 under the Obama administration, sets voluntary targets for the reduction of emissions which cause climate change. The US will join only Syria and Nicaragua – the former racked by civil war, the latter believing the terms of the deal not strict enough – on the sidelines. The former vice-president and environmental campaigner Al Gore appeared across the political talk shows on Sunday. On CNN, he called the decision to pull out of the Paris deal “reckless” and “indefensible”.  “It undermines America’s standing in the world,” Gore said. “It threatens the ability of humanity to solve the climate crisis in time.” Gore met Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, in New York City in December, to discuss the president-elect’s campaign-trail threats to leave the Paris deal. Saying he had spoken to the president’s daughter a number of times since then, Gore added: “I thought that he would come to his senses on it, but he didn’t.”"
"Perth is pumping recycled water into the underground aquifers that provide its drinking water supply as part of a strategy to drought-proof the city against climate change.  The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) on Monday approved an application for the Western Australian water authority to double the capacity of its groundwater replenishment scheme, bringing the amount of recycled water pumped into the Gnangara Mound every year to 28 gigalitres.  The most recent proposal would see the Water Corporation build a 12.8km pipeline from a proposed recycled water plant at Beenyup in the northern suburbs to two different aquifer points, where it will be pumped into Leederville and Yarragadee aquifers. About 14 gigalitres of wastewater per year would be processed and treated to potable standard at the new Beenyup recycled water facility, before being pumped into the aquifers. The same amount of water will extracted from those aquifers every year to be treated again and used as drinking water. Murdoch University professor of desalination and water treatment, Wendell Ela, said pumping recycled water into the underground system rather than using it directly once it was treated to a potable standard, reduced “the yuk factor”. “That’s inevitable and it’s not a bad thing because any time we talk about water we should be interested in the water we are getting and the quality we are getting,” Ela told Guardian Australia. Ela said the aquifer also provided a “very large, very cheap storage tank,” which allowed the water corporation to replenish groundwater at a steady rate but only withdraw water when necessary.  “You want it to essentially be a net zero balance,” he said. The Water Corporation spokeswoman Clare Lugar said the groundwater replenishment scheme was part of a long-term plan to secure water supplies in response to climate change. Lugar said the proposal ticked two of the organisation’s three strategies for water security, the third being encouraging people to use less water. “Groundwater replenishment ticks two of these boxes - increases water recycling and developing a new source,” she said. “It is a climate-independent source of water, and the new plant at Beenyup will have the capacity to supply the same amount of water used by 100,000 homes each year.” The scheme is part of a project to make Perth’s water supply “climate independent” by 2022. Without intervention, Perth is projected to have a supply gap of 70 gigalitres a year over the next 10 years, the EPA report said. By 2060, one fifth of Perth’s water supply is expected to be replenished groundwater. Construction on the project begins in July."
"There was plenty of gloom this week as the US elected to join Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries not backing the Paris accord on climate change. But activists immediately responded, outlining plans to resist Trump, and elected officials across the country said they would ignore the president’s pullout and abide by the terms of the Paris agreement. The Sierra Club is urging people to call the White House, and 350.org listed some of the wins that have already emerged from the accord, and immediately launched a petition. Governors from 10 states have said they will abide by the terms of the accord, and 83 mayors from across the country have committed to “adopt, honor, and uphold the commitments to the goals enshrined in the Paris agreement.” Those goals include striving to limit temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and achieving net zero carbon emissions in the second half of the century. The mayors include Eric Garcetti from Los Angeles, Marty Walsh from Boston and Bill de Blasio from New York City. PS: regarding Syria and Nicaragua not signing up to the Paris accord, the Guardian’s Haroon Siddique says that those countries’ “reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax.” Read Haroon’s piece here. Former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016, announced his bid for Maryland governor on Wednesday, and will speak at the People’s Summit in Chicago next weekend. Jealous joins Sanders in speaking at the summit, where thousands of activists will meet for workshops and activism training sessions. He sits on the board of Our Revolution and the Huffington Post reckons his candidacy “is liable to nationalize the primary, turning it into yet another proxy war between the party’s progressive and establishment wings.” We’ll be reporting from the People’s Summit all weekend, from 9-11 June, and producing a super special edition of this newsletter from Chicago.  The future of Illinois’ minimum wage is now in Governor Bruce Rauner’s hands, after the state’s house and senate approved a bill that would raise the mandatory payment from $8.25 to $15 an hour by 2022. Activists with Fight for $15 have spent years campaigning for the increase in Illinois and around the country. On 24 May, thousands of people marched in Chicago to protest against McDonald’s wages, but demonstrations in Illinois go back to at least 2013, when fast-food workers went on strike to demand a raise. The House voted in favor of the bill 61 to 53 on Tuesday, and the Senate approved it 30-23 on Wednesday. Rauner, a Republican, has not indicated how he plans to act. His press office told the Guardian the bill is “currently under review”. • “Don’t just blame Trump for quitting the Paris deal — blame the Republican party,” says Andrew Prokop over at Vox. Trump’s decision has been portrayed as a decision driven by his hard-right advisers, Prokop says – but actually, the president is “solidly within the GOP’s consensus on climate change”. • The Democratic party “continues to assume that power shall simply be given to it by dint of their being ‘not Trump’,” writes Douglas Williams. Williams says the party is paying scant regard to progressives who have the energy to defeat Republicans in the 2018 mid-terms. Cities around the country lit their buildings green on Thursday, in a show of support for the Paris agreement. It’s unlikely to change Trump’s mind on Paris, but it still offered a little bit of hope after a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day."
"A group of leading economists warned on Monday that the world risks catastrophic global warming in just 13 years unless countries ramp up taxes on carbon emissions to as much as $100 (£77) per metric tonne. Experts including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern said governments needed to move quickly to tackle polluting industries with a tax on carbon dioxide at $40-$80 per tonne by 2020.  A tax of $100 a tonne would be needed by 2030 as one of a series of measures to prevent a rise in global temperatures of 2C. In a report by the High Level Commission on Carbon Prices, which is backed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, they suggest poor countries could aim for a lower tax since their economies are more vulnerable. The aim of a tax on carbon would be essential to meet the targets set by the Cop21 Paris Agreement in 2015, they said. The call for action will sting European leaders, who have presided over a carbon trading scheme since 2005 that currently charges major polluters just €6 (£5.20) for every tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere. The European scheme, which issues firms with carbon credits that can be traded on a central exchange, has come under fire for allowing heavy energy users to avoid investments in new technology to cut their emissions. Critics accuse officials of issuing too many credits and allowing the price to fall to a level that makes it cheaper for companies to pollute than change their behaviour. Stiglitz and Stern said prices should rise to $50-$100 by 2030 to give businesses and governments an incentive to lower emissions even when fossil fuels are cheap. The Trump administration has rejected calls to introduce a carbon tax in the United States, saying it would cost jobs.  Washington’s refusal to adopt a tax has deterred Brussels from moving to a more substantial charge on emissions, which would have the effect of increasing energy costs, at least in the short term, and imposing higher costs on European manufacturers. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the world’s biggest scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. It covers 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries, whose carbon emissions make up almost 50% of Europe’s total."

"The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, says Australia’s national interest is best served if Donald Trump stays the course with the Paris climate agreement. With the US president expected to make a decision this week about whether America will pull out of the Paris accord, officials were asked during Senate estimates hearings whether Australia had made diplomatic representations to the Trump administration encouraging the president to remain in the agreement.  Cash, who was the minister at Wednesday’s hearing, said the government had made it clear that the US saying the course with the global climate agreement was desirable and in Australia’s national interest. She said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and to our carbon emissions reduction target, and she said Australia’s interests were best served by the US maintaining its commitment to the Paris agreement. The secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and former foreign policy adviser to Malcolm Turnbull, Frances Adamson, was asked whether Australia had made representations to the Trump administration about the Turnbull government’s pro-Paris position. Adamson said she could not point to a “particular discussion” but she said the Australian government’s view on the Paris deal was well known to the Trump administration. The ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, said discussions between political leaders were “confidential” but he told the hearing he had expressed Australia’s commitment to the Paris deal in contact with US officials. Adamson said it was in Australia’s interests that all the current signatories to the deal maintained their commitment. If particular countries left the agreement, that would weaken the accord. After Trump indicated after the G7 summit in Italy this past weekend he would make a decision about US participation in Paris this week, the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said Australia would stay the course with the agreement. But government conservatives have already signalled a US withdrawal would mean Australia needs to reconsider its position. The frontbench conservative Zed Seselja has noted if the US withdraws “that would change the nature of that agreement”. Seselja’s observation followed an earlier public warning from the chairman of the Turnbull government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, and fellow conservative, Craig Kelly. Kelly has argued Australia will need to review its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change if Trump pulls out. The US Republican senator and one-time presidential aspirant John McCain, during his visit to Australia this week, argued the US should uphold its commitment to the Paris agreement, or accede to it with minor modifications. McCain said the death of the Great Barrier Reef was one of the “great tragedies of our lives”. He said climate change was undeniably real and world leaders needed to act now to halt and reverse global warming."
"After a week of Donald Trump’s diplomacy, one thing is impressively clear: the US is not Montenegro. It won’t get pushed around by some bigger leader who wants to get ahead of the rest of the pack. It won’t lead from behind when there are deals to be done, or undone, and redone. If there’s an international agreement on trade, security or climate change – especially one negotiated by a president not called Trump – then you know that agreement is living on borrowed time. Much like the planet itself.  No, the US is not Montenegro. It won’t accept a deal that involves some kind of trade-off or negotiation. The US shouldn’t have to pay billions for a climate change deal when it can pay trillions in sea defenses for no climate change deal. That’s the kind of long-range thinking you can expect from President Trump. “At what point does America get demeaned?” he asked his rapt audience in the Rose Garden on Thursday, as his unusually golden comb-over glinted in the afternoon sun. “At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? … We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won’t be. They won’t be.”  No they won’t. They won’t dare to laugh at an American president who takes a motorized golf cart through the streets of Sicily while his fellow leaders walk like pedestrians. They won’t laugh at a president whose handshake is a form of mortal combat where only one hand survives with its dignity intact. They won’t laugh at a president who thinks that saving the world is just another way to destroy the US.  Trump knows that this world is a zero sum game where the US is losing if someone else is winning. Nothing is shared on land, sea or air. Even the sea and the air themselves. “This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,” Trump explained. “The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement – they went wild, they were so happy – for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.” This is the kind of insight unique to business moguls and global statesmen. Especially business moguls who become global statesmen. The first sign that your deal sucks is when the rest of the world is happy because human civilization might possibly be saved.  “A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound,” said our totally non-cynical president. Nobody in the world knows more about self-inflicted major economic wounds than Donald Trump. This is his specialist subject. Even China and Europe know how much he has mastered this topic, as they prepare to dominate clean energy science and technologies.  Granted, there is the special relationship to consider: those ancient ties between Great Britain and the United States that mean the Brits are the Olympic athletes of self-inflicted major economic wounds.  Perhaps that’s why Trump’s Rose Garden speech sounded so much like Theresa May’s negotiating position on Brexit: that no deal is better than a bad deal. “So we’re getting out,” Trump explained. “But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine.” As Samuel Johnson said about second marriages, this sounds like a triumph of hope over experience. And Donald Trump knows a lot about second marriages.  No, the US is not Montenegro. It won’t get its hand squeezed to death by that annoyingly fresh-faced French president who keeps inviting American scientists to move to France. Emmanuel Macron promised that he would never turn his back on Americans, even if America was turning its back on the world. This from a man who literally turned his back on Donald Trump. Ce soir, les Etats-Unis ont tourné le dos au monde. Mais la France ne tournera pas le dos aux Américains.  “Make our planet great again!” Macron tweeted, in a brazen attempt to steal one of Trump’s favorite phrases. Next thing you know, he’ll be stealing all the other Trump-invented phrases like “prime the pump”. pic.twitter.com/3g5LYO9Osj France and Germany can lead Europe if they want. China can lead Asia and Africa if it wants. But the US leads the world in seeing the Paris accord for what it is: a last-ditch global effort to destroy Trump’s coal-mining votes in West Virginia. What the world doesn’t realize is that Trump has torn up the Paris accord because he loves the environment so much. Not because he loves it so little. Trump carries an Amazon rainforest of concern about the climate: that’s what makes him so very upset about Paris.  “Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals,” he explained. “The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We’ll be the cleanest. We’re going to have the cleanest air. We’re going to have the cleanest water.” See? This is good news, not fake news. Trump’s US will be the cleanest and friendliest and most idealistic about the environment, because Trump says he is “someone who cares deeply about the environment”. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump told the world. Never mind that the good folks of Pittsburgh are citizens of the United States. Never mind that the Paris accord does more than represent those fascinating old ladies of the 16th arrondissement. So get over it, Montenegro. Join the back of the line. And take the Chinese and the French and the Germans with you. Trump has got Syria and Nicaragua in his corner, and that’s all he needs to lead."
"The death of the Great Barrier Reef is one of the “great tragedies of our lives”, US senator John McCain has said, arguing America should uphold its commitment to the Paris climate agreement, or accede to it with minor modifications. Speaking in Sydney on Tuesday night, the veteran politician and former Republican party presidential candidate said climate change was undeniably real and that it was incumbent upon world leaders to act now to halt and reverse global warming.  “I think that climate change is real. I think that one of the great tragedies of our lives is the Great Barrier Reef dying [and] the environmental consequences of that,” he said. The position of the world’s second-largest carbon emitter on the Paris climate change agreement is uncertain and a subject of global speculation. US commitment to reducing emissions or otherwise could have significant ramifications for other countries upholding their promised reductions. Donald Trump has said he will announce this week whether the US will uphold the Paris carbon reduction commitments it agreed to in 2015, under his predecessor Barack Obama. McCain said he wanted to see America remain in the Paris accord. “I would like to see us ... either accept the agreements as were made by the Obama administration or suggest modifications which would make it palatable for us and acceptable to us to join. “If we don’t address this issue, I am very much afraid about what the world is going to look like for our children and grandchildren.” Climate change caused unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 on the Great Barrier Reef, killing almost half of its coral. The federal and Queensland’s governments’ two-year-old plan to protect the reef until 2050 is reportedly already redundant because the impacts of climate change are far more severe than predicted. Recent surveys have found bleaching is significantly worse than predicted, with more than 70% of shallow-water coral north of Port Douglas killed last year. McCain was in Australia as a guest of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. In a wide-ranging speech he conceded that the Trump administration was mired in scandal, but urged America’s allies to stand by the US as it navigated troubled times. He said America’s reputation had suffered in the early months of Trump’s presidency as scandals over ties to Russia, nepotism, FBI investigations and foundering relations with other world leaders have rocked the administration with crippling consistency. “We are going through a rough period,” McCain said. “We really are, and for me to tell you that we aren’t, politically, is not fair. But we’ve gone through other troubled times. I can remember Watergate scandal and how it brought down a president. I’m not suggesting that’s going to happen to this president, but we are in a scandal, and every few drops another shoe drops from this centipede, and we’ve got to get through that.” McCain said observers of the US must look beyond the president. “Our foreign friends always tend to focus on the person in the White House. But America is far bigger than that. America is our courts of justice. America is our state and local governments. America is our Congress.”"
"For a president who prizes personal chemistry, a day and a half cloistered with the leaders of the six major capitalist economies in the medieval Sicilian coastal town of Taormina might seem attractive – even if it marks a come-down from Mar-a-Lago. But no one knows if Donald Trump, reaching the end of an exhausting week-long tour, will take to world summitry. Multilateral fora would not seem his natural habitat: he is hardly likely to be interested in the dense final communiques these meetings tend to produce – and which remain largely unread by anyone but the functionaries who toiled over every ambiguous sub-paragraph.  There are few specific deals to be made, just frank views to be exchanged and understandings reached. The format is deliberately informal, if not unstructured. And the absence of Russia and China may make Trump question the G7’s continued relevance. Moreover, the prospect of Trump being totally alone with his six interlocutors will certainly cause palpitations amongst the officials listening to the discussion on headphones in an adjoining room.  Few can predict the course of his conversation, the span of his concentration or what state secrets he might divulge. The risk is that – on a range of agenda items – Trump finds himself in the G1. His six colleagues, with varying degrees of emphasis, are likely to want to change his instincts on climate change, protectionism, the treatment of refugees and novel ideas like a web tax on the giant technology companies. Japan will be seeking a tougher strategy on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. According to diplomats, the leaders have been exchanging views on how best to engage Trump, or locate the true figures of influence in the White House.  One diplomat said: “We need to show a degree of humility. In foreign policy terms, the second half of Trump’s 100 days were immeasurably better than the first half, recognisably Republican. The trick is to make sure he does not feel cornered, and if you have an idea, make him feel it is his idea, and in America’s interest. At the same time, we need to get some commitments from him.” The team around Emmanuel Macron – one of four leaders attending his first G7 – say they will be pressing Trump hard on the argument that the US cannot afford to backtrack on the agreements Barack Obama struck at the UN Paris climate change conference summit. In some ways, it is a replay of the arguments the G7 staged with George W Bush at the start of the decade. Some western powers are trying to frame the climate change discussion as a national security argument, pointing to the risk of war and terrorism if mass migration explodes out of drought-ridden Africa. Trump’s aides insist he remains in listening mode on climate change, and no decision will be made for a few weeks. The British, eternal optimists, at least sense he is moving on the issue. Results may have to wait for the G20 summit, to be attended by China in Hamburg in June. It may be a tougher ask to get Trump to sign up to words extolling the virtues of free trade – standard fare in G7 communiques since its inception in 1975, but anathema to Trump’s protectionist tax-cutting instincts. Time has been set aside for a lengthy debate on Friday evening. Angela Merkel – facing elections this year – cannot be seen to cave to a man who is political kryptonite among her voters. Trump was joined by his full entourage on his first overseas trip as president. His innermost circle comprises his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is the president's closest foreign policy advisor. Just outside that circle is Hope Hicks, a former spokeswoman who has become a constant presence at Trump's side. Then there are the competing White House barons: chief ideologue Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and national security adviser HR McMaster. Preibus and Bannon returned to Washington after the tour's first stop, in Saudi Arabia. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state – and only cabinet secretary on the tour – and the outgoing acting assistant secretary of state, Stuart Jones, rank next in terms of access and influence. The next ring comprises Gary Cohn, the president's economic advisor; Dina Powell, the deputy national security advisor, who is Egyptian-born and speaks Arabic; Stephen Miller, a nationalist anti-immigration policy advisor; and Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman. Spicer's deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is also present, as is the spokesman for the national security council, Michael Anton. It is not clear is how many national security council experts have been brought along. Equally, Italy’s prime minister, Paulo Gentiloni, supported by Merkel, will want to broaden Trump’s perception of fighting terrorism, an issue made more urgent by the Manchester atrocity. Gentiloni wants the US to look at the way in which climate, migration and security are increasingly intertwined. The seven leaders will be looking out at the Mediterranean – a sea which this year alone has seen over 1,300 migrants drown as they attempt to reach Europe from Libya. About 50,000 have reached Italy, a figure large enough to suggest more than 200,000 migrants will arrive in the country this year. Italy feels strongly that it has been left alone to handle a crisis in which the accidents of geography have handed it an excessive burden. But Italy is also eager to discuss the root causes of African migration. So the discussion will go wider than Libya’s political stability, coastal patrols, or even closing migration routes to address how to foster economic innovation in Africa. The vast cuts announced by the White House this week in the US foreign aid budget run counter to this, and an Italian plan for an African food security fund at the summit has been scaled back. Trump will meet five African leaders from Tunisia, Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya. The presence of Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will also ensure North Korea’s nuclear ambitions get high billing. If North Korea is only two years away from gaining an intercontinental weapon, as many experienced diplomats believe, this becomes an issue that Trump and most of the other G7 leaders know they will have to address on their watch. The speed of Pyongyang’s progress with missile technology is alarming all sides. At issue is whether the G7 should seek to engage or instead persuade China to bring the regime of Kim Jong Un to its knees by cutting off oil supplies, risking a dangerous chaos, and mass refugee flows. Experienced Korean diplomats privately say the chances of the current standoff ending peacefully are limited, as low as 10%, and predict North Korea will have intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking Washington within two years. Despairing diplomats hope that Trump’s unpredictability may prove to be an asset in the crisis since his personality will make an anxious North Korea unable to forecast his next move. That same anxiety, of course, is shared in a different way by the other members of the G7, and the intrigue in the two days ahead may lie in the extent to which Trump manages to reassure or instead deepen concern about the “leader of the free world”."
"ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, was compelled by shareholders to be more open about the impact of climate change on its business in a “historic” surprise vote on Wednesday. The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly prepared to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change.    Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon’s management at the company’s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change affects Exxon’s business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. “Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world’s largest investors,” he said. “Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.” Exxon’s management sought to head off the proposal championed by the pension funds of the Church of England, New York and California and other large shareholders, which will force the company to conduct an annual “stress test” measuring how its oil assets will be affected by climate change regulation and new technology. Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38% of shareholders who voted. Addressing the meeting Mason said many of the company’s board members had made clear that “they recognised the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change” in their other roles. Board member Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox, signed the Obama administration’s climate pledge, and fellow board member Kenneth Frazier chairs Merck, a pharmaceutical company that supports “national and international action to address the challenges presented by climate change”, said Mason. He pointed out that another board member, Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had told the Financial Times: “Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.” “Members of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend the ExxonMobil board meeting?” Mason asked. Chief executive Darren Woods said: “We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.” But he said the company was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business and that the board was against the proposal. “The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments,” he said. Earlier this month, shareholders overcame management opposition to similar proposals at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, and passed resolutions forcing the companies to more clearly explain how climate change could affect their businesses.  BlackRock, Exxon’s largest shareholder, backed the resolution at Occidental’s shareholders’ meeting, the first time the investment group had voted against a company’s management over climate change. “When we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,” BlackRock said a statement. Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at the sustainable investor network Ceres, called the vote “historic”. “This is a very strong message from investors that climate change matters and must be addressed. Now we need to see Exxon take action.” New York comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli said: “This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil. The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.” The ExxonMobil resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, says that the company “should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target”. The resolution adds: “This reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.” The meeting, the first since former CEO Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state, was held at the IM Pei-designed Morton H Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas."
"Moments before the US president, Donald Trump, strode into the Rose Garden, TV cameras pictured his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, shaking hands and looking generally pleased with himself. Bannon once called global warming a “manufactured crisis”.  Bannon, with Trump’s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, were among the loudest and most forceful voices in Trump’s ear, imploring the president to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement.  During his speech, Trump claimed the Paris deal was bad for America. The themes were economic, but the speech was laced with jingoistic protectionism. “Our withdrawal represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty,” he said. But make no mistake here. The foundation for Trump’s dismissal of the Paris deal – and for the people who pushed him the hardest to do it – is the rejection of the science linking fossil-fuel burning to dangerous climate change.  Or rather, Trump’s rejection of the Paris deal was built on the flimsy, cherry-picked and long-debunked talking points of an industry built to manufacture doubt about climate science. Once you fall for those arguments, making an economic case suddenly feels plausible. After Trump signed off with his catchphrase pledge glib enough to fit on a baseball cap, he invited Pruitt to say a few words. Pruitt, who as the attorney general of Oklahoma had a long history of backing fossil-fuel interests over environmental concerns, has denied that CO2 causes global warming. Bannon is the former boss of Breitbart – the hyper-partisan right-wing outlet that pushes climate science denial and an overt hatred for climate scientists. As Guardian US has has reported, Trump’s team has been filling the administration with climate science “sceptics”. Myron Ebell, the man picked by the Trump campaign team to engineer the EPA’s transition from an agency that acknowledges the risk of fossil-fuel burning to one being forced to publicly deny it, is a long-serving member of that climate science denial industry.  As long ago as 1998, Ebell joined the fossil-fuel industry for a campaign that aimed to reset the public’s understanding of climate science from acceptance to doubt. Moments after Trump’s announcement, Steve Milloy, one of Ebell’s colleagues in that 1998 campaign who was also drafted by Ebell to help him “transition” the EPA, tweeted: “Congratulations to all climate skeptics! We have reaped a tremendous victory.” Congratulations to all climate skeptics! We have reaped a tremendous victory. #ParisAgreement Earlier this week, the veteran coal lobbyist Fred Palmer was salivating in a column for Breitbart over Trump’s intentions. “Stay on the course that recognizes the Paris agreement incorrectly demonizes carbon and CO2 emissions,” wrote Palmer, who is now a senior fellow at the climate science-denying Heartland Institute. Palmer has explained to me how some 25 years ago he kickstarted what is thought to be the first fossil-fuel funded campaign aimed squarely at undermining the science linking fossil-fuel burning to dangerous climate change.  Since then, elements of the fossil-fuel industry have run a relentless campaign of self-interested misinformation that puts the protection of their industry above the protection of communities, habitats and species across the planet. They got together with so-called “free market” advocates whose view on the world tells them governments have to be small and that regulations are bad. Just weeks ago, a collective of conservative “free market” organisations wrote an open letter to Trump urging him to cut ties with the Paris deal. The first name on the letter was Ebell’s. Many signatories reject entirely the role of fossil-fuel burning in changing the climate. Many of the groups those people represent have taken millions of dollars in donations from the petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch. Those groups are the same ones who have developed talking points, compiled reports, appeared in the media, written newspaper columns, gone on speaking torus, given testimony to congress – all geared to protecting the fossil-fuel industry while relegating, ignoring or misrepresenting the science. Several members of that denial industry – including Ebell – were reportedly invited to the Rose Garden to hear the news. As Rhode Island senator and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse said in the moments after Trump’s announcement, Trump “is betraying the country, in service of Breitbart fake news, the fossil fuel industry, & the Koch brothers’ climate denial operation.” .@POTUS is betraying the country, in service of Breitbart fake news, the fossil fuel industry, & the Koch brothers’ climate denial operation pic.twitter.com/J3YwrORboA So what comes next? Hopefully, one realisation will be this.  Now is the time to learn about the methods, the tactics, the personnel, the structure and the reach of the global climate science denial industry. They just convinced the leader of the United States to pull the plug on a historic deal signed by almost 200 countries, and instead join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries not signed up. It is time to take that climate science denial industry seriously. "

"Since day one as a contender for the Oval Office, current US President Donald Trump has pushed a dominant narrative: he’s a businessman. He gets economics. He knows the art of the deal. This week, with his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, the president has given the world strong reason to reject that narrative.  His rationale – that it’s a choice of economy over environment, and a fossil fuel economy is the top priority – is outdated and false. States and nations around the world have harvested the fruits of clean energy, and are redefining their economies and energy sources accordingly. Yet under false pretenses that “clean coal”, natural gas and other fossil fuel fixes are better than energy conservation and clean energy, the US forges its own, lonely path.  The idea that clean, renewable energy will generate power for our planet for generations to come is not rhetoric. The extent of human-caused climate change – and the rapidly improving economics driving the proliferation of renewable energy sources – make it fact. If the US administration isn’t ready to move forward, hundreds of individual states and other countries will.  California is already a world leader on climate policy. Texas is rapidly expanding its wind energy capacity. In Germany, clean energy has become a movement itself, focused on thousands of small-scale projects under the Energiewende program. In Scotland, wind generation has increased by 81% over the past year, and in March this year, it produced enough energy to satisfy 136 % of the country’s household energy needs. These are just a few examples. The US’s withdrawal doesn’t mean Americans and US investors will sit still, either. There is substantial economic opportunity in renewables. The US solar industry alone creates one in 50 new jobs. Worldwide, nearly 10 million people already work in renewable energy. Global clean technology exports doubled between 2008 and 2015, surpassing $1.15tn per year. Even America’s corporate giants – from Apple and Google to Walmart, and even oil giant Exxon Mobil – support the Paris agreement. The economics are clear. So what about the political implications of the decision? By withdrawing from this historical agreement, Trump will make more enemies than friends. Polling results from Yale University’s Climate Change in the American Mind survey (conducted after the US election) show that 73% of Trump voters want the US to use more renewable energy. (His own supporters!) As recently as May 7, a small but increasingly vocal group of Republicans has embraced the reality of global warming, taking steps to press the issue in Congress. Elsewhere in the world, 195 countries and the European Union have signed the Paris Agreement, 147 of which have ratified it. Only Nicaragua and Syria have not signed on.  When news of the potential withdrawal reached the United Nations, the organization’s Twitter page read: “Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” A Globe and Mail report showed that even fossil fuel companies – the likes of ExxonMobil, BP and Shell – think the US should stick with Paris. This withdrawal is an ugly decision, made by a country that ought to be leading the transition to a cleaner future – not only because of its stature as an international economic powerhouse, but also because of its less-than-desirable environmental track record. After China, the US is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter.  In response, China has been become a leading producer of solar energy technology and is slowing its coal power construction. The US, meanwhile, hangs on to a coal industry that should have been dissolved decades ago. Just north of the border in Canada, where I live, the situation is delicate. We have been plagued by recent missteps such as approval of fossil-fuel-driven pipeline projects, but at least our governments claim a commitment to a sustainable, clean energy future. In my home province of British Columbia, recent election results may even reverse the approval of some of those infrastructure projects.  But we’re far from safe ground. These types of actions by the US administration show that environmental rights – for Canada and all countries around the world – are vital, now more than ever. Yet, while 110 countries worldwide have environmental rights written into their constitutions, Canada does not.  I tend to focus my advice on domestic matters like these. But today, I offer a word to the US president:  A global shift to renewable energy is on. There’s no denying it or turning it around. It’s good for business. This is not fake news. It’s real life. And it’s happening with or without you.  You claim you know a good deal when you see one. Well, you just passed on one of the best our planet has ever seen. "

"US secretary of defense James Mattis has urged allies to “bear with us”, noting it would be a “crummy world” if Americans retreated into isolationism.  Mattis was responding to questions at a conference in Singapore about US leadership and commitment to a rules-based international order, in the wake of Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration will leave the Paris climate change accord, putting the country in the company of only Nicaragua and Syria.  “As far as the rules-based order, you know, obviously we have a new president in Washington DC,” Mattis said at the event organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “We’re all aware of that. And there is going to be fresh approaches taken.”  He defended Trump, pointing out that the president had just made his first foreign trip, “straight into the heart of one of the most bewildering and difficult challenges” in the Middle East. However, the defense secretary did acknowledge a historical “reluctance” among Americans to engage with the world. “The 20th century took us out of that,” he said. “What a crummy world if we all retreat inside our own borders. How many people deprived of good lives during the Depression? How many tens of millions of people killed in WWII? Like it or not, we’re part of the world.” Mattis said that though there was a sense among some Americans that the country was bearing “an inordinate burden”, global engagement was still “very deeply rooted in the American psyche”. “Bear with us,” he said before going to paraphrase a quote from Winston Churchill: “Once we’ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.” Kori Schake, a Stanford University defense expert who has co-edited a book with Mattis on the relationship between the US military and civilians, said he had given “a speech replete with the reassurances America’s Asian allies crave: the importance of a rules-based international order, America’s enduring commitment to its allies and willingness to run risks for our common security, centrality of values in our alliance relationships”. “Yet despite the enormous admiration allies have for Mattis, every question was some version of, ‘How can we believe you when the president talks and acts so differently?’ added Schake, who was a senior defense official in the Bush administration. Mattis did not directly address the decision to leave the Paris accord, but during the administration’s internal debate on the issue he said it was not really his job to intervene in the argument.   “Frankly, it’s not inside my portfolio, that aspect,” he told CBS News last weekend. “Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that’s just another one of many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.”  Past Pentagon and intelligence community assessments have presented climate change as a serious long term threat to national security.  A former senior official in the national security council, Loren DeJonge Schulman, said the White House debate did not seem to have been carried out in a very organised way, with no representations from the Pentagon and not much science.  “No one appeared to be in charge of running the debate,” Schulman, now at the Centre for a New American Security, said on Twitter.  “That matters for a few reasons: no one was ensuring that all perspectives were included. Mattis called this not his job jar, but [the defense department] and [intelligence community] have each commented, across admins, on costly and risky impacts of climate change ...  “But most importantly: we had no scientists with a real voice in the room.”  "
"  In March, Scott Pruitt infamously said about carbon dioxide that “I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see”, in contradiction to climate scientists, including those at his own agency. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief has deep ties to fossil fuel interests and joined with them on numerous occasions to challenge EPA pollution rules while attorney general of Oklahoma. He has opined that the EPA has become distracted from its core mission by climate concerns and has begin the process of ripping up Obama-era emissions regulations. Trump’s proposed budget would cut the EPA’s budget by nearly a third, a move that many Republicans have called draconian. Climate and clean energy programs are earmarked for the scrapheap, with even the data collection process for companies’ greenhouse gas emissions wound down. Climate considerations in federal permitting have been abolished, measures to reduce methane emissions have been halted and new standards to improve fuel efficiency of cars and trucks have been suspended.  An executive order in March demanded a review of the clean power plan in order to remove “regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production”. Trump has repeatedly vowed to dismantle the plan, which aims to curb carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. Several analyses have shown that without the plan, the US will fail to cut emissions to the level pledged at the Paris agreement. Trump has instructed the interior department to review dozens of national monuments to see if they could be scrapped or resized to allow better access for oil and gas drilling. A moratorium on coal mining on federal land has been lifted while a bar on offshore drilling off the Atlantic coast is being reviewed. Trump’s budget also calls for drilling in the Arctic national refuge in Alaska, a plan that has dismayed environmentalists. In one of his first acts of presidential pen wielding, Trump called for the rapid approval of the controversial Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. The two oil-carrying projects are now pushing ahead, with the Dakota Access pipeline already registering its first leaks before it is even fully operational."
"He said he was doing it for Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh replied: stop polluting our city’s good name. In withdrawing from the Paris climate accord Thursday, Donald Trump explained that he was striking a blow on behalf of American manufacturers such as US Steel, the company that once made Pittsburgh a global industrial capital.   “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president explained. To hear Pittsburghers tell it, the president might as well have been talking about Pluto. “As you can imagine, we are extremely disappointed,” said Michelle Naccarati-Chapkis, CEO of Women for a Healthy Environment, a locally based not-for-profit organization.  There was a time – 30, 40 years ago – when Pittsburgh was synonymous with the country’s biggest industrial interests and home to their worst ills. Ringed by the smokestacks of US steel, the city once choked on its own air and wanted for the kinds of regulations the Paris accord phases in worldwide.  “Back in the day we were known as ‘hell with the lid off’, and we had air pollution that impacted the entire region,” said Naccarati-Chapkis. “But this is a region that’s thriving and growing, and to depict it by its antiquated industrial past is really not a true reflection of what’s happening.” However, since the steel mills mostly shut down in the 1980s, the city has been reinvented as a center for medical research, technology companies, healthcare – and environmental innovation. Trump may have depicted a Pittsburgh whose past industrial glory is being choked by over-regulation. But the real story, people who live there say, is that environmental conservation has gone a long way toward freeing Pittsburgh from its industrial past.  Vivien Li, president and CEO of Riverlife, a local nonprofit, said she welcomed Trump’s having brought up her city in a speech sure to be watched closely by environmentally-minded citizens around the world.  “I think hearing Pittsburgh mentioned in the environmental context on the international stage really gives us the opportunity to remind people that the 21st-century Pittsburgh is very different from the industrial image that we had throughout the last century,” Li said. “Right now everyone wants to live by, work by, and play on the city’s three rivers, whereas 20 years ago they were seen as a little bit too dirty, maybe a little dangerous, and without the amenities there today.” The quickest Pittsburgher to upbraid the president after his speech on Thursday was the city mayor himself, Bill Peduto, a Democrat. Peduto pointed out that while Trump may claim to represent Pittsburgh, the city did not want him to be president. “Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world and will follow Paris agreement,” Peduto tweeted. “As the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy and future.” On Friday, Peduto issued an executive order committing Pittsburgh to the Paris climate accords, joining a movement that in only 24 hours swept up hundreds of municipalities, states and businesses. The movement, led by the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, counted 82 so-called “climate mayors” representing 39 million Americans, it said. The true story of Pittsburgh, activists said,was visible in employment numbers and municipal planning. The city has 13,000 employed locally in renewable energy, according to the city, versus 5,300 in iron and steel manufacturing. The city has its own plan to reduce greenhouse gas production by 20% below 2003 levels by 2023. The plan wasn’t drafted to respond to Trump; Pittsburgh drafted its first climate action plan in 2008.  The city is home to the world’s largest “green” building and the first convention center in the world to rank platinum in the US Leed (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification matrix. Wind turbines power lighting on bridges in downtown Pittsburgh that cross three rivers bordered by 800 acres set aside for habitat restoration and green spaces. Court Gould, the executive director of the not-for-profit group Sustainable Pittsburgh, said the president simply did not know what he was talking about. “I listened to the speech and was aghast at the depiction of Pittsburgh as having an un-futuristic economy,” Gould said. “President Trump, who lost badly here in the election, is grossly off target in identifying Pittsburgh and associating it with his outmoded, irrelevant vision.”  Perhaps, as Peduto put it, it was the first place Triump’s speechwriters thought of starting with a “P”.  "
"Will Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement tip the world into fiery catastrophe? The extraordinary unity of the rest of the world’s nations in tackling global warming, allied with the booming green economy, driven by plummeting renewable energy costs, are strong reasons to think not.  A much more likely casualty of Trump’s choice is the US economy he claims to be protecting: America’s brilliance at innovation, investment and building businesses will no longer have its government’s support. The prize of leadership in the 21st-century economy could be sacrificed in a doomed attempt to revive the fossil-fuelled economy of the 20th century. However much Trump “digs coal”, he cannot force companies to build coal-fired power stations if wind and solar are cheaper and executives are smart enough to realise that a billion-dollar bet on a new plant – likely to be closed by Trump’s successor – is not a winner. Instead, US states and cities will continue to pursue the green future that secures clean air, water and the promise of climate stability for their citizens. That is no small deal: combined together, California and New York City would be the fourth biggest economy in the world. Climate change is, of course, a global issue but, around the globe, leaders from China to India to Russia to the European Union have lined up to reassert their commitment to confronting the greatest challenge faced by civilisation. Most remarkable is China, the world’s biggest polluter, which has transitioned from climate laggard to climate leader in recent years. Can China be relied upon to match its words with action? The answer is yes, because its determination is not founded on lofty altruism but the hard-headed need to protect its vast population from the air pollution and looming water and food problems that stem from carbon emissions. Furthermore, China is coming to dominate the supply of renewable energy technology. But the US pullout still undoubtedly brings risks for the rest of the world. There are lots of possible pathways to the zero-emission global economy needed in the second half of this century to avoid the “severe, widespread and irreversible impacts” warned of by the world’s scientists. But the best is to start early, with global carbon emissions starting to fall by 2020. Even a flattening of the decline in US carbon emissions – if not compensated for by other nations – will slow progress and might bump up global warming by a tenth of a degree or two. That could be enough to push the most vulnerable nations under the waves of a rising ocean. A rogue US, exporting goods manufactured with dirty energy, might tempt other nations to weaken their climate commitments in order to compete, although there is no sign of this at present. Alternatively, other countries could punish the US with heavy carbon taxes on its exports. But that would prompt retaliation, with unpredictable consequences. The US has also been a major funder of climate aid programmes, which have been vital in winning over developing nations that view global warming as a crisis inflicted on them by industrialised nations. Billions more will have to be contributed by the richest nations. But the breakthrough in Paris – getting the unanimous agreement of 196 nations to tackle climate change together – remains a deceptively solid foundation for beating global warming, a task that will take decades not years. German environment minister Barbara Hendricks said on Thursday: “The world’s climate will survive for eight years without the US.” But, despite the good reasons for optimism, a one-term Trump presidency would be even safer."
" Donald Trump has confirmed that he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, in effect ensuring the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases will quit the international effort to address dangerous global warming. The US will remove itself from the deal, joining Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries not party to the Paris agreement. There will be no penalty for leaving, with the Paris deal based upon the premise of voluntary emissions reductions by participating countries. “In order to fulfil my solemn duty to the United States and its citizens, the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accords or a really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States,” the US president told press in the White House rose garden on Thursday. “We will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” Trump said. “If we can, that’s great. If we can’t, that’s fine.” But Italy, France and Germany issued a joint statement shortly after Trump’s speech saying they believed the treaty could not be renegotiated.  Trump told the crowd outside the White House: “The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries should expel any doubt as to why foreign lobbyists should wish to keep our beautiful country tied up and bound down … That’s not going to happen while I’m president, I’m sorry.” He added: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, issued a rare statement saying the new administration had joined “a small handful of nations that reject the future”. But he said that US states, cities and businesses “will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got”. Former vice-president Al Gore called the move “reckless and indefensible”, while among the business leaders to express regret over the move was Jeff Immelt, chair and CEO of General Electric, who said “climate change is real” and “industry must now lead”.  Trump, who spoke after being introduced by a warm-up band playing the George Gershwin classic Summertime, argued that the Paris agreement disadvantaged the US to the benefit of other countries, leaving workers and taxpayers to absorb the costs and suffer job losses and factory closures. As of today, he said, the US will cease implementation of the nationally determined contribution and green climate fund, “which is costing the US a vast fortune”. In 2015, nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent the runaway climate change that would occur should temperatures spiral 2C or more above the pre-industrial era. Trump’s decision risks destabilizing the Paris deal, with remaining participants faced with the choice of trying to make up the shortfall in emissions cuts or following the US’s lead and abandoning the agreement.  The US emissions reduction pledge accounts for a fifth of the global emissions to be avoided by 2030, with an analysis by not-for-profit group Climate Interactive showing that a regression to “business as usual” emissions by the US could warm the world by an additional 0.3C by 2100. This would help push the global temperature rise well beyond 2C, causing punishing heatwaves, sea level rise, displacement of millions of people and the loss of ecosystems such as coral reefs.  The US withdrawal would not, though, derail global efforts to fight climate change, said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who delivered the Paris agreement. “States, cities, corporations, investors have been moving in this direction for several years and the dropping prices of renewables versus high cost of health impacts from fossil fuels, guarantees the continuation of the transition.” The US will be the loser from its withdrawal, said Prof John Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and former adviser to the EU, Angela Merkel and the pope. “It will not substantially hamper global climate progress but it will hurt the American economy and society alike,” he said. “China and Europe have become world leaders on the path towards green development already and will strengthen their position if the US slips back. The Washington people around Trump fail to recognise that the climate wars are over, while the race for sustainable prosperity is on.” “President Trump is putting his country on the wrong side of history,” said Laurence Tubiana, France’s climate ambassador during the negotiation of the Paris deal.  John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and a frequent critic of Trump, said he shared concerns about “flaws” in the treaty. “I’m convinced we can correct them and improve the agreement, however,” he said, “by showing leadership and constructively engaging with like-minded nations, not by joining the ranks of holdouts like Syria and Nicaragua.” Bernie Sanders, the leftwing senator and former Democratic presidential hopeful, called the move an “international disgrace” and an “abdication of American leadership”. But House speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, threw his support behind Trump’s decision, saying the Paris accord was “simply a raw deal for America”. “In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy,” Ryan said in a statement. “I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal.” Trump followed through with his campaign pledge to “cancel” US involvement in the Paris accord following months of conflicting signals over whether he would do so or just scale back the US ambition to cut emissions.   The withdrawal represents a victory for the nationalist elements in Trump’s administration, such as his strategist Steve Bannon, who have argued the Paris deal undermines an “America first” approach, harms domestic coal production and hinders efforts to repeal Barack Obama-era regulations such as the Clean Power Plan. On Tuesday, Trump met with Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency head who has called Paris a “bad deal” that should be discarded. In his speech, Trump sought to frame his decision as part of this nationalist agenda. “The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense,” he said. “They don’t put America first. I do, and I always will.” A group of 22 Republican senators, headed by majority leader Mitch McConnell, backed the anti-Paris view in a letter to Trump that urged a “clean exit” from the Paris deal, which they said added a “regulatory burden” upon the US. The anti-agreement faction had jockeyed for Trump’s favour over a rival school of thought, including secretary of state Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, that argued the US should remain in the Paris deal in order to preserve its diplomatic influence. Hundreds of large businesses, including Apple, Google and Walmart, also threw their weight behind the deal, with even fossil fuel firms such as ExxonMobil, BP and Shell supporting the accord as the best way to transition to a low-carbon economy and stave off the perils of climate change. In a bid to calm the frayed nerves of countries most at risk from rising temperatures, the EU and China announced an alliance to stay the course earlier on Wednesday. Their joint declaration called climate change a “national security issue” and a “multiplying factor of social and political fragility.” The Paris pact is a “historic achievement” and “irreversible”, the document says. “It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement,” said UN secretary general António Guterres. “If one country decides to leave a void, I can guarantee someone else will occupy it.” Environmental groups were scathing of Trump’s decision, with more than 20,000 members of the Sierra Club calling the White House within hours of reports that the president had opted to exit the deal. “Donald Trump has made a historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, said he will sign an order committing the city to the Paris deal due to the “destructive power” of disasters like Hurricane Sandy.

"“Thank you very much. [Applause.] Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected. “Before we discuss the Paris accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous – absolutely tremendous – economic progress since election day on November 8th. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We’ve added $3.3tn in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs. “I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. “In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. “Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up – and you see that, you see it all over – from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution. “One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president – whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous supreme court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And believe me, we’ve just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so. “On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments. And I don’t want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. “Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord – [applause] thank you, thank you – but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we’re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine. [Applause.] “As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers – who I love – and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. “Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune. “Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7m lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs – not what we need – believe me, this is not what we need – including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little. “According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12%; cement down 23%; iron and steel down 38%; coal – and I happen to love the coal miners – down 86%; natural gas down 31%. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5m industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that. “Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States – which is what it does – the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters. “For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years – 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. “Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America – which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We’re having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand new mine. It’s unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn’t happened. They asked me if I’d go. I’m going to try. “China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We’re supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants. “In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. “This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement – they went wild; they were so happy – for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world. “We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation – it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth – and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. “The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1% growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4% growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country – [applause] – will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. “Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree – think of that; this much – Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America – and this is an incredible statistic – would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes. “As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: ‘The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate.’ The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We’ll be the cleanest. We’re going to have the cleanest air. We’re going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs. We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly. [Applause.] “And I think you just read – it just came out minutes ago, the small business report – small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. “I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. [Applause.] “So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal. And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement. “I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world. “No responsible leader can put the workers – and the people – of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That’s not going to happen while I’m president. I’m sorry. [Applause.] “My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection. “Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it’s going very well. “The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense. They don’t put America first. I do, and I always will. [Applause.] “The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what’s happening. It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind. “At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won’t be. They won’t be. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. [Applause.] I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we’re down to business. “Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund – nice name – which calls for developed countries to send $100bn to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime. “The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1bn –nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything – including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism. That’s where they came. Believe me, they didn’t come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money. “In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100bn per year as ‘peanuts’, and stated that ‘the $100bn is the tail that wags the dog’. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450bn per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to? “Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated. America is $20tn in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that. “There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the US economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty. [Applause.] Our constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will. “Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal. “The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point – as bad as it is – not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. “As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris accord –[applause] – and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. “It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – along with many, many other locations within our great country – before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. [Applause.] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. “Thank you very much. Very important. I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.”"
"About 70,000 tonnes of seabird are now afloat or on the wing off the shores of the British Isles. This biomass – roughly the same as Salisbury Cathedral – is made up entirely of thinking, fishing, hunting, flirting, fighting, flying, diving and feathered beauty: 8 million breeders, several million more adolescents and, by the end of the summer, armies of chicks. Perhaps 15 million creatures in all.  They are here for sex, and the raising of the next generation. Eggs can’t be laid on the sea; bird embryos breathe air through the shell and would suffocate in water. Every coastal culture on Earth has evolved a double attitude to seabirds – using and loving them, nurturing and killing them, experimenting with them and selling them, looking at them with awe and making toys, hats and dinner out of them. They were never merely walking or flying larders but, as the archaeologists Marcus Brittain and Nick Overton have called them, “participants in life”, fellow beings, co-actors in the drama and struggle of existence. Stillborn children were buried on the wings of whooper swans in Mesolithic Denmark. At Isbister in Orkney, more than 600 sea eagle bones were mixed in with human remains in a bronze age tomb. In Shetland shepherds used to feed titbits to the bonxies – great skuas – that protected their lambs from sea eagles and ravens. Even now, Hebridean fishermen keep seagulls as pets in their gardens beyond the kitchen door. For generations, their mystery and power has been in their ability to come and go beyond any horizon. Now, thanks to technology – almost entirely fuelled by the miniaturisation drive of the mobile phone industry – we know what these birds do when beyond that horizon: wandering albatrosses sail five million miles in a lifetime’s voyaging around the Southern Ocean; each puffin holds within its mind a map of the North Atlantic, tracking across it to the same unmarked parts year after year; shearwaters smell their way around their 20,000-mile migrations from northern nest sites to southern fishing grounds in a two-hemisphere life of unbroken summer. But just as science is coming to understand the seabirds, we are destroying them. By one measure, in the past 60 years they have declined by two thirds, from about 1.5 billion to something like 500 million. The extension of the graph into the future reaches zero in about 2060. That won’t happen – the seabird phenomenon is too complex, with too many unknowns and local variations. But a disaster is unfolding, and it is one we have brought on ourselves: through overfishing; the massive accidental catching of birds in fishing gear; their deliberate destruction; introducing rats, cats, dogs, pigs, goats, rabbits and cattle to the breeding places of birds that are defenceless because they did not evolve with the introduced species (many Pacific birds literally cannot smell a rat); pollution by oil, metals, plastics and other toxins; the recently discovered fact that plastic that has long been floating in the ocean comes to smell like food, so 90% of all seabirds are now found to have plastic in their stomachs; the destruction of nesting sites by human development; and the multiple effects of climate change and the acidification of the sea. The details are horrible. Fulmars and other species are being caught by Spanish longliners; they are drowning in gill nets, which hang in the sea and are designed to trap fish by the gills but are just as effective at catching birds; and they are being killed under the heavy cables behind trawlers, where they gather to feed on offal. In European seas, fulmar numbers have declined by 40% over the past 30 years. They are predicted to crash by the same percentage again in the next 50. It is the same story for the world’s 11 million puffins. They will be 80% down by the second half of this century, and a rare sight anywhere south of the northernmost islands in Scotland. The tufted and horned puffins, of which there are about five million in the Pacific, are also declining. Their cousins, the guillemots and razorbills, are suffering too, with sharp losses in Iceland, one of the headquarters of auk life, with big colonies losing almost half their birds in the three or four years after 2005. There are now some 20 million kittiwakes strung around the northern hemisphere, but in places the population has halved in number since 1983. What is to be done? All that can be done. We must not preside over the ending of these marvels. Most of the practicalities are obvious: there needs to be a much wider understanding of the state of the world’s seabirds; their breeding places need to be protected from people and their predatory animals; much tighter controls must be imposed on all kinds of fishing vessels so that fewer birds are killed at sea; and, because the death rate of adult birds in winter has more influence on seabird populations than any other single factor, their winter feeding grounds need to be understood, mapped and protected – particularly the great oceanic upwellings off the continents. Finally, and most intractably, the rate at which we are changing the atmosphere and the ocean, both its temperature and its acidity, needs to be brought under control. Donald Trump’s relighting of the fires under global warming is to be accompanied by the cutting of funds to the US nature agencies. In the UK, groundbreaking censuses of seabirds were made in 1970, 1985 and 2000. There should have been one in 2015, but shamefully it was thought unnecessary and never carried out. The destruction will romp into the future. And unless we change our minds, it will also happen in the dark."
"A smell of burning coal fills the chilly air as delegates pile into the conference chamber. Outside, protestors shiver in polar bear suits under threatening skies and forbidding grey concrete; inside, smiles, colourful costumes and a warm glow. Negotiators, politicians, activists who have spent their lives fighting climate change are jubilant. The US has stalled global action on climate change for two full presidential terms, but no longer. In the chamber, at last, the White House meltdown is in full flow. This is no vision of a future under Donald Trump: it was the disaster and backtracking that marked the end of climate negotiations for his Republican predecessor, George W Bush, in 2008. Then, as now, a US president in thrall to oil interests tried to block international agreement on emissions. Then, as now, doomsayers foresaw a deathblow to the UN climate negotiations. Then, as now, the US economy was drunk on cheap fossil fuels. As Trump threatens to repeat the George W playbook, pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, reversing anti-carbon measures at home and trashing climate science, it is worth remembering how the last one ended: in humiliating defeat. Only this time, the world has changed. Trump’s own advisors, along with big US oil businesses, the US public, and the world’s next biggest economy, China, are lined up against him. This time a defeat is even more likely, and even more damaging to the US’s interests and economy. The closest advisor to George W Bush – some said the real power in the White House – was vice-president Dick Cheney, a former oil industry executive fanatically opposed to action on greenhouse gases. Aided by Republican majorities in Congress, he rubbished climate science, promoted denialist views, resisted efficiency standards, and blocked moves to cut emissions. When the Kyoto protocol came into force in 2005, rejuvenating the lacklustre UN negotiations on global climate protection, Cheney stood firm against joining the rest of the world. So the US, alone apart from Australia and a handful of tiny players, refused to take part in the post-Kyoto talks. At the annual UN conferences, the US forced a “twin-track” process, taking part in only the meetings it agreed with. Bush also took pains to undermine the UN from the outside. He set up US-led alternative meetings for the governments of big economies, including the Major Economies Forum, and withheld approval to address global warming in existing international groupings, such as the G8 and the G20. The expectation was that, with the US doing its best to undermine it, the UN climate process – and with it any prospect of a legally binding obligation on developed countries to cut their emissions - would flop. This was a terrible miscalculation. Every tactic tried by Bush failed. The Major Economies Forum turned into an instrument for forcing US action; the G8 leaders, led by Angela Merkel, rounded on Bush and forced him to sign up to their climate pledge; the UN carried on negotiations while ignoring Washington. The ultimate humiliation came at the UN conference in Bali at the end of 2007. Having held out for two weeks against allowing work to begin on a post-Kyoto agreement, the US negotiators were left isolated as fraught and sleepless talks headed into an extra day. Finally, in the sweaty tropical heat of the conference floor, the representative from Papua New Guinea shouted an impassioned ultimatum, to roars and cheers from the assembled nations: “If you’re not willing to lead, get out of the way!” Deserted by every ally, Bush’s chief diplomat could stand it no longer. The US conceded; the gavel came down; the process that would eventually lead to the Paris agreement was at last begun. Bush’s humiliation at the hands of one of the world’s smallest nations was total. Since then, the forces arrayed against US intransigence have multiplied. China for many years held out against any suggestion it should take on national targets to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. But at Paris, the Beijing government marked a major change, signing up to play its role in the global targets. This commitment came only after China had begun to realign its economy to a cleaner, greener footing. Having staked its prestige, Beijing will not turn back. For the Chinese, and other big developing nations from India to Brazil, Mexico to South Korea, the Trump administration’s attitude offers an irresistible opportunity. They can now claim the moral high ground, having signed up in good faith to make Paris a success, reducing their own emissions and investing in modern technology. They, not the US, have influence to gain here, by offering help to poorer developing nations, the worst affected by climate change. China and other big countries are no longer as dependent on the US economy as they once were – the financial crisis saw to that. Bush’s core mistake – about to be repeated by Trump – was to imagine the UN process was weak. The apparently ramshackle nature of the negotiations, in which every country, however tiny, has an equal say with the biggest economies, turned out to be its greatest strength. Doomsayers have confidently predicted the imminent demise of the 20-plus-year talks from the outset, yet somehow the process – never perfect, never adequate to the challenge – still emerges as a hopeful example of what global collective action can achieve. Never more so than at Paris in 2015, when cheers and whoops greeted the signing of the first global legally binding commitment to prevent warming breaching the 2C limit. Though Trump will not succeed in killing Paris, no one should under-estimate the damage he can do. US emissions are the world’s second highest, and under Trump they could rise again to add to the risk that warming will breach 2C. Already, the world’s poorest are suffering drought, floods, famine, and the inundation of low-lying coastal areas. Europe’s southern regions face increasing drought while floods hit the north. In the US, water shortages afflict crop-growing areas and wildfires threaten cities. The rest of the world will have to work harder to make up for US’s refusal to face reality. Inside that last chilly UN meeting of the Bush administration, in 2008, with Obama already voted in as president-elect, the representatives of the lame-duck White House were asked in the closing press conference if they had any regrets. Harlan Watson, Bush’s envoy, took the microphone. “Yes,” he said. “I wish I was a little bit taller, and a lot more handsome.” Eight years of trying to block global action on the biggest environmental threat to the planet, reduced to a feeble joke. This time, the stakes are too high for White House mockery. The world can stop Trump from making a farce out of a tragedy."
"The United States will meet its Paris accord greenhouse gas targets despite Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has said. A decision by President Trump to pull the US out of Parisand seek renegotiated terms “fair” to America has drawn widespread international condemnation. But Bloomberg, currently the United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change, said work would continue to reduce emissions despite Trump’s statement. “The US will meet our Paris commitment and through a partnership among American cities, states, and businesses, we will seek to remain part of the Paris Agreement process,” he said. “The American government may have pulled out of the agreement, but the American people remain committed to it – and we will meet our targets. “Americans don’t need Washington to meet our Paris commitment and Americans are not going to let Washington stand in the way of fulfilling it. “That’s the message mayors, governors, and business leaders all across the US have been sending.” The Paris accord commits countries to holding global temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, which will require global emissions to be cut to net zero by the second half of the century. Scientists have warned that a failure to curb dangerous climate change will lead to sea level rises, more intense storms and flooding, more extreme droughts, water shortages and heatwaves as well as massive loss of wildlife and reduction in crop yields, potentially sparking conflict and mass migration. Despite the decision by the US, the second biggest polluter after China, to pull out of the deal, many analysts suggest the shift to a low-carbon economy is now unstoppable, with renewable prices tumbling and new clean technology being developed and deployed. Trump’s decision prompted criticism from many US business leaders, including clean-tech entrepreneur and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney company, who said they had resigned from the president’s advisory council over the issue. Announcing his decision on Thursday, Trump claimed the Paris deal allows countries such as China and India to carry on polluting at the expense of the US economy and jobs. He said the US would stop implementing measures to meet its commitments under the agreement to cut emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2025, and end funding for poor countries to cope with climate change. In a press conference after a summit between the EU and China, European council president Donald Tusk said the bloc was stepping up co-operation with China on climate change. “Which means that today, China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the whole planet,” Tusk said. He said the US decision to leave the Paris agreement was a “big mistake”, bigger than its failure to ratify the previous international climate deal, the Kyoto Protocol, because the new agreement – which covers all countries – was fairer. “But the fight against climate change, and all the research, innovation and technological progress it will bring, will continue, with or without the US,” he said."
"Swift, smart and typically self-assured, Emmanuel Macron’s response to Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords confirmed a near-faultless debut on the international stage for France’s new president, analysts said.  “Make our planet great again,” Macron, a diplomatic novice not yet 40, exhorted the world, recycling Trump’s own slogan in an unprecedented address partly in English from the Elysée Palace soon after the US president had informed the world he was withdrawing from the global agreement on Thursday.   The phrase, tweeted minutes later as a graphic that rapidly went viral, was accompanied by a renewed invitation to US scientists, researchers and entrepreneurs disappointed by their administration’s move to “come to France and work with us together” on climate solutions. pic.twitter.com/3g5LYO9Osj “It was adroitly done,” said Thomas Gomart, the director of the French Institute for International Relations. “It showed a self-confidence, even a form of insolence … In terms of foreign relations, the early stages of Macron’s presidency have undeniably been a success.”  Macron’s brisk three-minute intervention on Thursday night won him praise on social media both abroad – where he was compared favourably to Trump – and at home, where it was widely and only half-jokingly suggested he should change his title to “leader of the free world”.  From his muscular handshake with Trump before last week’s Nato meeting in Brussels to his “extremely frank and direct” exchange with Russia’s Vladmir Putin in Versailles, the French president, less than a month into his mandate, has shown “boldness … agility and timing”, said the daily Libération. Strategically, in a world of Trump and Putin, with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the EU weakened by Brexit, Macron aims to restore and amplify France’s global voice at the heart of a stronger Europe based on a revival of the critical postwar relationship between Paris and Berlin. Alive to the importance of symbols and images, his style is at times purposely theatrical. Macron is determined to “rehabilitate the role of the president”, Gomart said, after what many saw as the vulgarity of Nicolas Sarkozy and the exaggerated normality of François Hollande. “So what we see is a convergence between this young president who is the incarnation of a form of modernity, and these symbols that resonate with the French, these references to France’s history,” Gomart said. “Don’t forget parliamentary elections are not far away.” French and international media had a field day with the Trump-Macron handshake, in which the 39-year-old French leader squeezed his much older US counterpart’s hand so hard that Trump’s knuckles whitened and he was eventually forced to relinquish his grip. Macron later admitted the move had “not been innocent” and was “a moment of truth”, describing Trump, Putin and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as men who see relationships “in terms of a balance of power” and to whom it was vital “not to grant even small concessions”. Much was also made of his public admonishment of Putin on Monday. With the Russian president at his side in the gilded splendour of the Palace of Versailles, Macron warned France would show “no weakness” if chemical weapons were used in Syria, would be “constantly vigilant” on gay rights in Chechnya, and expected the Minsk agreements on Ukraine to be implemented. He also said firmly that Russia Today and Sputnik, two Kremlin-funded news outlets, had behaved “like agents of influence and propaganda” that had repeatedly “spread serious untruths” about him during his election campaign. Polls suggest the approach is proving effective with French voters. Macron’s new political movement, La République En Marche, is on target for a 30% share of the national vote in next month’s elections – a 10-point advance since his arrival in the Elysée last month. An Ipsos poll this week suggested the cross-party movement could win between 395 and 425 seats in the lower house of parliament, comfortably above the 289 it would need to secure an absolute majority in 577-seat national assembly. But there were suggestions on Friday that Macron’s style may have backfired in one respect: the Washington Post reported that alongside intense EU pressure on Trump over the climate accord, agreed in the French capital in 2015, the younger leader’s tough stance could just have confirmed Trump in his intentions. Macron’s words “irritated and bewildered” the US president, the paper quoted unnamed White House aides as saying, and may have helped inspire his comment on Thursday that he “was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh – not Paris”. "
"Barack Obama led condemnation of his successor’s decision to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate accord, which the former president’s administration painstakingly negotiated over the course of several years. In a statement released just before Donald Trump officially announced that the US would remove itself from the deal, Obama said the administration had joined “a small handful of nations that reject the future”. He warned that the more than 190 countries that remained participants would “reap the benefits in jobs and industries created”, but he said that US states, cities and businesses “will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got”.  The rare rebuke by Obama was testament to the magnitude of Trump’s decision. The former president has commented sparingly on the new administration, weighing in only on matters he has framed as of moral significance, such as Trump’s stymied effort to impose a travel ban on refugees and citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. Trump’s withdrawal from the accord was not just a blow to one of Obama’s signature achievements, but to an issue routinely dubbed by the Obama administration as the greatest threat to US national security and future generations across the globe. The former secretary of state John Kerry, who represented the US in the negotiations over the Paris accord, said Trump had turned America into “an environmental pariah in the world”. In exiting the agreement, the US joined only Syria and Nicaragua in sitting on the sidelines even as widespread condemnation poured in from foreign leaders, climate scientists and many leading US companies. The reaction in Washington was nonetheless split on familiar partisan lines, with Republican lawmakers near unanimously throwing their support behind Trump while Democrats vowed revenge at the ballot box. Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who have long sought to thwart Obama’s environmental legacy, applauded Trump in their statements. “The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America,” Ryan said, adding: “In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy. I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal.” McConnell said Trump’s move followed through on congressional action “to rebuff then-President Obama’s regulatory rampage.” “When the previous administration signed America up for this unattainable mandate, we made it clear we would fight this unilateral action any way we could, and this day could not have happened soon enough,” McConnell said. “President Trump has once again put families and jobs ahead of leftwing ideology and should be commended for his action.” But at least two Republicans – from Florida, one of many coastal states grappling with the effects of extreme weather and rising sea levels – expressed disappointment with the president’s decision to withdraw.  “Something’s not right when Potus is putting our country on a list with bad hombres Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua,” congressman Carlos Curbelo, of south Florida, wrote on Twitter.  Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who represents south Florida, urged the US to establish a “long term-strategy against climate change”. She also noted that Thursday marked the the first day of hurricane season in the state.  Democrats were uniformly scathing in their assessment of Trump’s decision, with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer declaring it “a devastating failure of historic proportions”. “Future generations will look back on President Trump’s decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing,” Schumer said. “Pulling out of the Paris agreement doesn’t put America first. It puts America last in recognizing science, in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line, our economy and our planet.” Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said Trump’s position ran counter to that of Pope Francis, who during the president’s recent visit to the Vatican presented Trump with a copy of his encyclical on climate change. Democrats would join efforts with states, cities and the private sector to make good on initiatives to mitigate the threat of climate change, she added, “regardless of the reckless and short-sighted actions that the White House takes”. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who made climate change a pillar of his bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, decried Trump’s action as “an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace”. “When climate change is already causing devastating harm, we don’t have the moral right to turn our backs on efforts to preserve this planet,” Sanders tweeted. At least one senator, Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, appeared to be at a loss for words. “Dear planet, we’re sorry,” Murphy tweeted. “Please just hang on for three and a half more years and we’ll fix this. We promise.”"
"Donald Trump has resisted pressure from Europe, Canada and Japan to declare his support for the UN’s landmark climate change treaty signed in Paris in 2015, marking a defiant end to his first international trip as US president. The deadlock at the end of the G7 summit in Italy left other world leaders frustrated. The German chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussions “had been very difficult and not to say very unsatisfactory.  She added: “Here we have a situation of six against one, meaning there is still no sign of whether the US will remain in the Paris accord or not.” Instead, six of the seven nations used a communique at the end of the meetings to assert their commitment to implement the Paris plan, leaving Trump to tweet that he will decide next week whether the US will join them in their pledge. The US president announced his forthcoming decision on Saturday morning, on the final day of his first international trip as president. “I will make my final decision on the Paris accord next week!” he tweeted from Sicily. During the two-day conclave in Taormina, other leaders repeatedly urged Trump to recognise that as world’s second biggest carbon emitter, the US had to show leadership on climate issues. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said he had seen progress on climate change at G7, but revealed he had told Trump he would be making an error and ceding ground to China if he did not stick with the Paris accord. Macron said: “It is essential for international equilibrium and the reputation of America that it remains engaged with the Paris treaty. The G7 had shown issues such as climate change are not side issues that can be left to others.” He refused to speculate on the US decision, but he said: “Trump was a good listener, a pragmatic guy and open to debate.” The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was not going to lecture any country, but he added: “You cannot build a strong economic future unless you are protective and mindful of the climate.”  Others warned the US president that he risks a stampede, as others in the 195-nation agreement use American withdrawal from the treaty to reduce their own commitments. Trump retained the option of pulling out of the treaty altogether or, more likely, scaling back on the specific commitments made by the Obama administration. Obama pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26%-28 % below 2005 levels by 2025. Computer simulations suggest earth temperatures could rise by as much 0.2C if the US pulled out of the UN treaty altogether. Feverish negotiations by G7 officials until 3am on Saturday failed to forge a closer consensus, reviving the era when George W Bush was alone among G7 leaders in expressing scepticism about climate change. The White House had signalled at the start of Trump’s tour of the Middle East and Europe that the US would not make a decision on climate change until after the summit, but other G7 leaders, such as Merkel and Macron, hoped they could collectively persuade Trump to commit to the principles of the Paris accord. During the presidential campaign Trump railed against the damage the Paris deal would inflict on traditional US industry. At the summit, his aides said that although his own views were evolving, he would always put the interests of US industry first. In an assertion of US unilateral power, Trump also forced the Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni – the summit host – to shred plans for an ambitious statement stressing the plight of migrants was a global rather than regional responsibility. Italy had chosen Sicily as the venue for the summit as the symbolic bridge between Europe and Africa. As many as 200,000 migrants are due to reach Italy this year from Libya, and already more than 1,300 have drowned seeking to make the crossing. During the two-day summit in Taormina, the Libyan capital Tripoli has seen more than 50 deaths in militia infighting, Egypt has twice bombed alleged Islamist training camps in southern Libya, and more than 2,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to the Italian mainland, with scores drowning. Italy had planned a five-page G7 statement on human mobility, stressing migrants’ rights, their positive contribution to host nations and the threat they faced from traffickers. Instead the final statement highlighted the right of nation states to secure their borders, and set migration targets. Trump also shot down Italian plans on African food security, days after the White House revealed plans to cut American foreign aid by a third. In 2015 the G7 committed to lift 500 million people out of famine and malnutrition, but instead famines have spread in Africa. Friederike Röder, director at ONE, the aid charity, said: “In a year of greatly-diminished expectations, the G7 have managed to set a new low. The early promise of this summit was crushed by the Trump administration’s hostile negotiating posture and the evident lack of ambition.” Trump did concede some ground in the final leader’s statement by signing up to a pledge to oppose protectionism. His aides insist he wants free, fair and reciprocal trade. In a win for the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, the statement was expected to repeat a pledge from the Japanese hosted summit in 2016 to respect a rules based multilateral trade system embodied in the WTO. But Trump still intends to target German trade practices and its surplus, a stance resented by Merkel. At the end of the summit, Trump chose to give no closing press conference, presumably to avoid questions on whether he knew of his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s reported plans to set up a secret communications channel with Russia. Trump instead chose to address US forces stationed in Sicily, reprising the themes of his first foreign trip and making no mention of the climate change dispute. He said simply that he had staged a series of productive meetings with his allies at the G7, but again opened fire on Nato nations for failing to spend enough on defense, claiming contributions were starting to rise in a way they would not but for his election. Accompanied by his wife, Trump often cut an uneasy, even glowering figure in Sicily. His aides insisted he had not sought to dominate the discussions and had enjoyed the free-flowing conversations, likening them to a family dinner. Economic adviser Gary Cohn said: “He came here to learn. He came here to get smart. His views are evolving which exactly as they should be.” The two days, along with the mini Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, were seen as a chance for Trump to define his “America First” slogan, and test its compatibility with multilateral institutions such as the G7. At one point, Trump was seen ostentatiously not wearing translation headphones as Gentiloni led a discussion on African growth.        "
"Until now, at least for those watching from afar, the Trump show has been a spectacle. It has shocked and appalled, but with the compulsive appeal of something like entertainment. The accelerating investigation of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia has followed the story arc of a gripping political thriller, a real-life rival to House of Cards. Indeed, the latest episode of the Trump-Russia drama promises a cameo role for our own Nigel Farage, now named as a “person of interest” to the FBI’s inquiry (even if voters in seven UK parliamentary contests deemed him anything but). Meanwhile, Trump’s tweets have provided a daily source of jaw-dropping amusement for a global audience, a phenomenon that reached a peak with the kerfuffle over “covfefe”, the apparently mistyped word in an incomplete tweet that the president posted after midnight on Wednesday. The meme artists got to work on that one, imagining covfefe might be Trump’s safe word, or else an incantation that could summon an ancient spirit wizard from the deep. Unable to admit that his boss had been guilty of a simple typo, spokesman Sean Spicer – who back in January had pretended a small crowd was bigger than a big crowd – declared that “The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant”. Oh, how we laughed. But then, in the White House rose garden yesterday, came the announcement – trailed by Trump as if it were a season finale of the Apprentice – that the US would pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change. And suddenly Trump wasn’t so funny any more. The consequences seem obvious. An accord that took years to broker, painstakingly put together in 2015 after failure at Copenhagen in 2009: a deal that brought together the powerhouses of India and China as well as the old world polluters of Europe and sought, at one minute to midnight, to do something to save our precious planet – that deal will now have to proceed without the world’s biggest economy and dominant superpower. It is an act of the most wanton vandalism, taking a delicate structure assembled piece by piece by all humanity – and kicking it with a steel-toecapped boot. The environmentalist Bill McKibben put it succinctly: “It amounts to a thorough repudiation of two of the civilising forces on our planet: diplomacy and science.” Why would anyone do such a thing? The evidence of climate change and its destructive effects are as visible in the US as anywhere: on current projections, Trump’s own Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago will be under water by 2060. It can’t be that the president felt bound by the campaign promises he had made: he breaks those casually, whether it’s a commitment to deprive no Americans of existing healthcare coverage, or a pledge to shift the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (an incendiary promise Trump thankfully reneged upon this week). The speech announcing his decision gave it a philosophical patina, as Trump returned to the “America first” theme of his inaugural address, describing the world as a site of Hobbesian, dog-eat-dog competition in which global cooperation is for wimps and suckers. Any deal that delighted humanity as much as the Paris accord had done – “They went wild, they were so happy,” Trump recalled with lip-curled distaste – could only mean the United States was getting screwed. Or as he put it, the world was glad, “for the simple reason that [the Paris accord] put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage”. Naturally, insider accounts suggest electoral calculation: Trump reckoned that the people who put him in the White House, especially blue collar workers in the rust-belt states, have long seen global warming as a con. And they’re the ones he needs to keep sweet in time for next year’s midterm elections, and his own bid for a second term in 2020. I’d suggest that even that level of calculation gives Trump too much credit. Sure, he declared his love for coalminers, as if withdrawing from Paris is going to save their industry when US coal jobs have been declining for a century, and fewer Americans mine coal than work in Disney World. But this being Trump, you need to look for even baser motives. A desire to upend one of his predecessor’s big achievements will be one of them. But just as likely, surely, is that Trump was irritated by his treatment during last week’s Nato and G7 summits, and wanted to hit back. The Europeans barely hid their disdain for him, and so he seized the chance to deprive them of something they cherished. If we were discussing a normal president, it would be absurd to bring up such things, but Emmanuel Macron might have erred when he made public his deliberate attempt to out-alpha Trump with a knuckle-crushing handshake. Trump would think nothing of getting his own back by burning the entire planet. Witness the White House aide who confessed that European leaders’ “snarky comments” had not helped, while another said Trump saw the disappointment of European allies as a “secondary benefit” of breaking the accord. Fewer Americans mine coal than work in Disney World This, then, is the measure of the man in charge of the world’s most powerful nation. Consolation comes from the fact that others have stepped in to fill the void he has created. Inside the US, states and cities have said they will continue to honour their commitments, regardless of Trump’s tantrum. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump said, whereupon the mayor of Pittsburgh sided with his fellow mayors around the world and promised to abide by the agreement. Trump was perhaps unaware that in Pennsylvania renewable energy employs 65,000 – more than oil, gas and mining combined. Globally, it was a similar story, with Angela Merkel and Macron (but not, take note, Theresa May) apparently vying for the title to which Trump has lost all claim: leader of the free world. “Make the planet great again,” said Macron in an English-language video rebuttal of Trump. More quietly, China has signalled its own readiness to take up the role vacated by the US and, starting with climate change, to act as the dominant global power. That’s good for the planet, but not so great for the world. Of course, when it comes to climate change, some leadership is better than none; but the notion of an international order underpinned by China, a dictatorship, is hardly a cheering prospect. Yet this is the future that Trump, who last week refused to reaffirm the Nato principle of collective self-defence, is inviting. The New York Times columnist David Brooks greeted the Paris decision with a declaration that Trump is making “our country seem disgusting in the eyes of the world”. That is strong, but not far off the truth. Until now the world has been riveted, even amused, by the Trump show. As of this moment, it is sickened."

"Donald Trump’s rejection of the Paris climate change treaty is the most emphatic answer to date on the question the rest of the world has been asking since January: What does “America first” mean? “I am elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president declared in the White House rose garden, after a jazz group had entertained the invited audience.  With those words, the US joined Nicaragua and Syria in rejection of an accord signed by 195 states which was voluntary and open to amendment from within.  The UN climate change envoy, Ireland’s former president, Mary Robinson, declared the decision made the US “a rogue state on the international stage”. To US allies, Trump’s departure is an entirely needless piece of diplomatic and environmental vandalism, performed on live television for ratings.  For Trump’s embattled administration, however, ratings are now all-important to stave off disillusion among his core voters, who needed to hear to more of the combative populist they had warmed to on the campaign trail. But emphatic does not necessarily mean coherent. On a string of issues, Trump has pulled back from delivering some of the bold unilateralist policies he had used to stir up crowds during the campaign.  He has not dismantled the nuclear deal with Iran, nor has walked out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and he has opted against moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which would have been seen as a provocation in the Islamic world and beyond. But Thursday’s climate announcement marked a return to angry populism. It was Trump’s darkest speech since his “American carnage” inaugural address, once more portraying a nation in crisis and facing a global conspiracy against its people. The world was presented as something to fear rather than to aspire to lead.  The battle between continuity and radical departure swings back and forth each day between the self-styled populist “disruptors” led by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, and the “traditionalists” brought on since the election to lend gravitas to the presidency, such as Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state; the national security adviser, HR McMaster; and the defence secretary, James Mattis.  Between these two camps and somewhat above them is the family, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. But their influence is clearly not decisive. On the Paris accord, they leaned heavily toward the traditionalists and lost. The perpetual tussle has led to unpredictability. In the run-up to Trump’s turbulent trip to Brussels last week, reporters and diplomats were told by White House officials that he would explicitly re-commit the US to the mutual defence clause of the alliance, article 5. On the day, however, he opted not to, and instead harangued his fellow leaders for not spending enough on enough. Defence expenditure has been a longstanding irritant in the North Atlantic alliance, but it was the vituperative nature of Trump’s delivery, combined with his petulant body language, that convinced the allies they had better look to each other if they wanted a sense of direction. McMaster and Trump’s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, wrote a commentary earlier this week seeking to sketch out an overarching rationale for Trump foreign policy.   “The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a ‘global community’ but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,” McMaster and Cohn wrote, pointing out that in such an arena, the US had a decisive edge in “unmatched military, political, economic, cultural and moral strength”. “Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it,” McMaster and Cohn wrote. But in the same piece, they also imply almost the exact opposite: “‘America first’ does not mean America alone. It is a commitment to protecting and advancing our vital interests while also fostering cooperation and strengthening relationships with our allies and partners.” Missing from the argument is an explanation of how those very different ideas can be reconciled. It does not make clear how the US can show moral strength and foster cooperation when it approaches foreign policy as a ruthless struggle for national supremacy. There is nothing new in these dilemmas. They have swung the US from engagement to isolation and back for more than a century. The “America first” slogan was used by isolationists in the run-up to the second world war, led by Charles Lindbergh, who presented it in bluntly racial tones.  The George W Bush administration started out in 2001 by declaring the Kyoto protocol, the forerunner of the Paris accord, dead, and by “unsigning” the Rome statute establishing the international criminal court the following year. It was deeply sceptical of any multilateral endeavour, at least until it became hopelessly mired in Afghanistan and Iraq.  What is new about the Trump administration is its chaotic nature and the undisciplined character of its chief executive. For US allies, trying to follow Washington’s lead over the past four months has been akin to trying to drive in convoy behind a car swerving violently at high speed, as the competing factions inside lunge for the steering wheel.  One by one, Washington’s friends are making the decision to stop trying and chart their own course."
"British Airways and many other businesses have offshored electricity-dependent functions like IT services and call centres to northern India (BA chief refuses to resign after ‘catastrophic’ IT failure, 30 May). Increasingly this is a region in the grip of extended droughts and annual heatwaves associated with record-breaking temperatures that scientists say will only get worse with climate change. Catastrophic electricity system failures are exacerbated by heat-triggered thunderstorms and regional outages resulting from the air-conditioning-related energy demand spikes that are common in India. In July 2012 power failed for 600 million people in northern India in the biggest blackout in history.  It is rather surprising that business continuity planners allow their clients to relocate energy and water-hungry operations to such climate-challenged regions. British Airways’ Indian HQ is located in a tall glass tower with no opening windows in the New Delhi satellite city of Gurgaon. Once the limited backup power supplies are exhausted in such buildings they have to be evacuated. One simple solution is to design buildings very differently with sensibly sized and shaded opening windows, powered by solar energy. Another is to onshore electricity-hungry operations back to cooler Britain. I expect the business continuity community are re-evaluating their “future-proofing” strategies as I write. Possibly too late in many cases. We made these points in our 2009 book on Adapting Buildings and Cities for Climate Change, but people tend not to take action till the catastrophe happens to them. Perhaps they will now?Emeritus Professor Sue RoafOxford • Our modern world is dangerously exposed by this reliance on the internet and new technology. First of all we had the NHS hacking problems, which were entirely foreseeable. Whitehall has made us all rely on IT far too much when it is not reliable. Even massive quantities of tax-gathering are done this way. Now BA is effectively grounded during one of the busiest weekends of the year because of overreliance on modern technology. There are just enough old-time civil servants left alive and in service to turn back the clock and take away our dangerous dependence on modern technology. I hope the control tower at London City Airport will continue to be manned as a result of the events of the last fortnight.Nigel Boddy Darlington, County Durham • It is clear that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring risk is managed and that disaster recovery plans for IT systems are in place rests with the BA board.

"Life here in the US feels surreal lately, like a very bad reality TV show, thanks to Donald Trump. In no case is this more evident than the president’s decision – and the process and theatre around it – to abandon the Paris climate agreement and nearly every other country in the world. The Paris agreement was a groundbreaking deal that allowed each country to decide its own contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Even though it is non-binding, the agreement puts the world on the path to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2C, which scientists warn would be disastrous for our planet.  By abandoning the agreement, we are not only ceding global leadership but also effectively renouncing our global citizenship. The US is joining Nicaragua (which felt the agreement did not go far enough) and Syria (in the midst of a devastating civil war) as the only nations without a seat at the Paris table. As an American, I am embarrassed and ashamed of this abdication of our responsibility, especially since the US has been the world’s largest contributor of carbon emissions over time. We have become a rogue nation. This action will not put “America first”. Instead, we risk becoming, to cite an actual reality TV show, the “biggest loser” in a global race towards a new, more vibrant and innovative clean energy economy. Trump’s dubious claims regarding the impact of the Paris agreement have been widely discredited. No amount of rhetoric will bring back coal and nothing will stop the explosive growth of clean energy jobs. Already, wind and solar employ nearly three times as many people as the coal industry does, according to the Department of Energy’s 2017 energy and employment report. Trump claimed he was elected to represent Pittsburgh, not Paris. Pittsburgh’s mayor, William Peduto, fired back: “President Trump’s decision is disastrous for our planet, for cities such as Pittsburgh.” In fact, the once smoke-choked industrial city highlights the enormous benefits that come from adopting cleaner energy, as called for under the Paris agreement. The city is a recognised leader for investments in green infrastructure (green roofs, urban forest projects, etc) that create jobs, reduce emissions and protect citizens from climate impacts such as increased urban heat island effect and more intense storms. Pittsburgh has been named the US’s “most livable city” six times since 2000 exactly because of this. The transition to cleaner and more resilient communities around the US is under way. So too is a shift from dirty coal to cleaner natural gas and renewables. These changes are being driven by market forces that not even Trump can hold back. But policies do matter. The administration’s direct attack on the environment, from rolling back President Obama’s plan to cut power plant emissions to proposing draconian budget cuts in research and innovation, will slow the momentum in tackling climate change just when it’s more urgent than ever to accelerate action. Trump’s actions also threaten to cripple the US economy by slowing the growth in renewable energy jobs and by handing global clean energy leadership to China. Already, China has produced more than three times more clean energy jobs than the US has, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. If there’s any good news about Trump’s breathtakingly wrong decision, it has been the swift outpouring of outrage and opposition, both in the US and around the world. Dozens of US mayors and the governors of a number of states, including some Republicans, have vowed to forge ahead with ambitious climate and clean energy plans. In spite of Trump’s announcement, “Massachusetts is aggressively working to exceed the goals of the Paris agreement on the state level, while growing our economy through clean energy innovation and environmental stewardship,” said Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican. Like Pittsburgh and Massachusetts, other cities and states – and other countries – see huge benefits in the transition to clean energy. Contrary to the alternative reality presented by Trump, they have already proved that climate action spurs, not harms, economic growth. For example, California’s cap-and-trade programme and other environmental policies have slashed the carbon intensity of its economy by 7% at the same time that the state’s economy grew 6.6%. The regional greenhouse gas initiative, a cap-and-trade programme for the power sector in nine north-eastern states, has cut carbon pollution by 45%, while their economies have grown 8%.Similarly, Germany reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 12% between 2000 and 2015 as its economy grew 16%. More than 30 states and scores of companies have adopted clean energy targets and goals. A sizable majority of Americans, along with major companies such as ExxonMobil, Apple, Google and Intel, want to remain in the Paris agreement. If enough of these entities act, it’s even possible that they can keep the US within striking distance of meeting its targets in the agreement without any support from Washington, DC, at least in the short-term, though US federal leadership is essential to achieve the deep reductions required over time. If Trump thought he would blow up the Paris agreement and cause a stampede for the exits, he was terribly mistaken. If anything, he has stiffened the resolve for climate action around the world. The EU, which has met its previous ambitious carbon pollution reduction targets, has pledged to do more, with or without US leadership. The EU is also working to join forces with China on an emissions trading plan. And China plans to invest at least $360bn by 2020 in a push to be the global leader in renewables. “Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again,” declared France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. Like so many, I have been dismayed by the US abdication of leadership and responsibility on this central issue of our time. I’m worried about the growing risk of catastrophic climate change and the staggering toll it will take in human suffering when solutions are readily available. The Paris agreement represents unprecedented global co-operation to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. However misguided, Trump has put a spotlight on the undeniable need to act and galvanised people from around the world to create a cleaner and more resilient future. It’s up to all of us now to make that happen."
"The European Union has rejected Donald Trump’s offer to renegotiate the Paris climate agreement and pledged instead to bypass Washington to work with US business leaders and state governors to implement the historic accord’s commitments. Less than 24 hours after the US president announced his decision to withdraw from the 2015 agreement and strike a new, less ambitious deal with the rest of the world, Brussels declared its outright refusal to engage in such talks.  EU officials will instead cut out the White House to deal directly with the US states and major corporations, many of whom have already pledged to live by the terms forged in Paris.  In Britain, Theresa May faced criticism for not signing up to a joint declaration by Germany, France and Italy in opposition to the US move. A Downing Street source defended the prime minister, pointing out that other countries including Japan and Canada had not signed up to the letter either. In 2015, nearly 200 countries agreed in Paris to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent the runaway climate change that would occur should temperatures spiral 2C or more above the pre-industrial era.  In a worst case scenario, the US withdrawal could add 0.3C to global temperatures by the end of the century, the UN World Meteorological Organisation said. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, described Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris pact as a big mistake, but said the fight against climate change would continue with or without the US.  “Strong transatlantic ties are far more important and far more durable than the latest unfortunate decisions of the new administration,” Tusk said, as he addressed a joint press conference with the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, at the end of an EU-China summit in Brussels. “China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the whole planet,” Tusk added, in reference to a joint EU-China statement that vowed to “step up” efforts on global warming, including the raising of $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cut emissions.  Li pointedly told reporters that China believed in abiding by international rules. “There have been changes in the international situation and there have been rising uncertainties and destabilising factors and in such circumstances it is important for China-EU relations to become more stable”, he said.  Miguel Arias Cañete, the European commissioner for climate action, said the global agreement would not be allowed to fall at the whim of a domestic election. “The Paris agreement is fit for purpose,” the Spanish politician said, gripping a copy of the document that 195 countries have pledged to support. “The Paris agreement is here to stay. The 29 articles of this Paris agreement are not to be renegotiated. They are to be implemented. That’s what the EU will do.” He added: “The fight against climate change cannot depend on the result of elections in one country of another. When a country signs an international agreement it has to fulfil its commitments. There will be new administrations. I’m pretty sure President Trump hasn’t read the articles of this treaty. There is nothing to renegotiate here.” Senior EU officials said they had been pleased by the reaction of the leaders of corporate America and the federal states, with whom they would now work, in a remarkable example of Trump’s isolation on the world stage. The US president’s decision had been met with a chorus of disapproval from blue-chip companies including Facebook, Apple, Ford and Microsoft. A number of the governors of US states have also vowed to ignore Washington. The mayor of Pittsburgh hit back against Trump, who had told reporters on Thursday: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” Bill Peduto wrote on Twitter: “Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world and will follow Paris agreement. As the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy and future.” Jeremy Corbyn accused May of a “dereliction of duty to our country and our planet” for failing to issue a stronger condemnation of Trump, after the PM expressed disappointment on Thursday. The Labour leader told an election rally in York: “Given the chance to present a united front with our international partners, she has instead opted for silence and subservience to Donald Trump.” The former Labour leader Ed Miliband told the BBC that May was being “weak and feeble and spineless” for not being willing to condemn the US president. A Downing Street spokesperson said Trump had called May to discuss the decision to withdraw and said the door remained open to future US involvement in the deal. “She [May] said the Paris agreement provides the right global framework for protecting the prosperity and security of future generations, while keeping energy affordable and secure for our citizens and businesses,” the spokesperson said. “The president made clear that the door remains open to future US involvement in the agreement.” The US can pull out of the Paris agreement no earlier than 3 November 2020 – which happens to be the day of the next US presidential election. This is because article 28 of the Paris agreement, which the Trump administration says it will abide by, states that a nation can only submit a withdrawal three years after the agreement entered force – 4 November 2016. This withdrawal then takes effect one year later. No other country is yet to show any sign that they intend to ape Trump’s decision to split from the pact, of which only Nicaragua and Syria stand outside. Vladimir Putin said in response to Trump’s announcement that he wanted to “refine” the agreement from within. Germany’s powerful car industry also claimed that Europe would need to reassess its environmental standards to remain competitive after the US withdrawal. However, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, showed no signs that her resolve was weakening on the deal, insisting that Trump “can’t and won’t stop all those of us who feel obliged to protect the planet”. She added the move by the US was “extremely regrettable and that’s putting it very mildly”. Merkel, speaking at a press conference in Berlin, said Germany would not sway from the goals set out in the Paris agreement. “Nothing can or will stop us,” she said. “The road – there’s no doubt about it – is stony, but I am also convinced of the fact we cannot retrace our steps.” She said there were many other partners willing to work together and was “enthused” by the response from US companies who were supportive of the deal. “We need this Paris agreement in order to save our creation,” she said. India, despite facing the challenge of meeting the energy needs of millions of people who do not have electricity, firmly stood by the Paris agreement. The energy minister, Piyush Goyal, said: “India’s resolve to take up the leadership of saving the planet from climate change while others abrogate their leadership.”"
"The science of climate change is clear. Scientists know that the Earth is warming and that humans are the reason. We also know that the Earth will continue to warm in the future; however, we can do something about it. We can dramatically change the trajectory. If the science is so clear, why are there still so many people that don’t accept it? Why are there so many people who try to deny the evidence? Well, the why is something I will try handling in my next post. Here, I want to describe where things are, as I see them. Mind you, this is only my perspective, living in the USA, working on climate science and climate communication on a daily basis.  For various reasons, acceptance of climate science breaks down along ideological lines. First, a majority of people in every state in the US believes, for instance, that the Paris Accord is a good thing, that the USA should participate. It turns out, however, that there is higher acceptance of climate science and acceptance of the importance of action on the coasts (California, Oregon, Washington, New York, etc.).  There are exceptions to this rule but I am generalizing. It also turns out that the more liberal your politics are, the more likely you are to accept the science and the solutions. With respect to politics, the results are stunning. Vast majorities of Democratic and independent voters are supportive. Interestingly, small majorities of even conservative Republicans are supportive. There are other correlations. For instance, the more religious, particularly conservatively religious someone is, the more likely they are to doubt or deny the science. But again, this is a generalization and it has exceptions. In fact, some religious leaders have become climate-action leaders. Perhaps the best example is Pope Francis. Now, I am not saying that conservatives are not as intelligent as liberals, I am just pointing out that certain political and religious ideologies correspond to viewpoints on science. The correlations don’t end here. A hugely important work on the underlying motivations of people who deny the reality of climate change was performed by Dr. Naomi Oreskes in her book (and accompanying movie) Merchants of Doubt. One of her central conclusions is that the denial of human-caused climate change is driven by peoples’ distrust of the government and of government solutions to a problem, particularly when the solutions may impinge on personal freedoms.  While there is a clear relation between a scientist’s knowledge of climate change and their understanding of the human influence, such a relation is not apparent in the general public. So, if you look far and wide to find a scientist who claims humans are not a major influence on climate, it is very likely that scientist is not very knowledgeable about the topic, does not work in the area very much, or has a history of faulty research.  Conversely, the scientists who accept the consensus view are more likely to publish more, do more research and just know more. However, if you talk to people on the street, this view breaks down. I see this in my own interactions with people. I often run across general audience members who have a pretty good grasp of the science but they discount the effects. Or, people who know very little about the science but they fully accept it. What is most astonishing to me is where this all leaves us. Donald Trump has announced that America will withdraw from the Paris climate treaty. My view is, it would be better for us to leave the agreement so we cannot sabotage it from the inside. But, only time will tell. But back to where this leaves us. We have a situation in the USA and around the world where certain countries and certain political groups have inextricably aligned themselves with one or another side of this issue. For instance, in the USA, denial of human-caused climate change has become a litmus test for Republican candidates. The same is true in other countries. This is a real tragedy because Republicans don’t want to pollute the planet. They don’t want to screw things up for our future generations. But, their wholesale denial of the reality of climate change is doing just that. From a political standpoint, if we think about the silly things President Trump is doing and how it will affect the world, the one thing he may be most remembered for is his climate inaction. Climate change will have very long lasting consequences that we will be dealing with long after he is gone. Long after other issues like immigration, the economy, debt, jobs, terrorism, or new words like “covfefe” have passed from our minds, the implications of our climate effect will linger. Frankly, no challenge we are facing (except perhaps a potential nuclear war) presents the consequences that climate change does.  And this, sadly, will be the legacy of conservatives in my country. As we wake up to more severe weather, more droughts, heat waves, rising seas, severe storms, the world will remember that these issues could have been solved long ago but for an ideology and tribalism. It will be the job of scientists, historians, and the media to continually remind people of this. Climate change could have been solved. Those who will be blamed will certainly claim “But I didn’t cause this climate change. You cannot blame this on me!” But we can and we have to. People need to be accountable for their actions. If you are someone who has stood in the path of climate action, you own the results. And that is the sad part. Because as I mentioned earlier, this means a significant part of the population will be tarred with the legacy of climate change. And that population does not, as a rule, want the climate to change. No one wants sea levels to rise or droughts to increase. But this observation does not change the fact that without the obstruction of climate action, we would be in a very different place.  Another sad result is that my country has become a pariah – we have gone from leader to obstructionist on climate change. This saddens me.  What is ironic is that many of the people who deny human-caused climate change are the same people who live and breathe so-called “patriotism.” But this patriotism has become a “my country right or wrong” parochial slogan that is anything but patriotic. To call your country what it is, to be honest about our strengths and our shortcomings, to work to make your country better, to never settle for status quo – that is patriotic. And as a patriot, I am deeply saddened by my country’s lack of leadership on this important issue. And as a patriot, I will hope for, and work for change. Next time, I will give my personal opinion about why some people are more likely to deny the reality of climate change. Again, these will be from my personal observations and discussions with others. I am not claiming to be an expert in psychology or similar sciences. However, I’ve had enough experience to feel confident in my conclusions. I hope you will read my next post."
"  The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned on Tuesday that if Donald Trump withdraws from the Paris climate agreement, there could be negative economic, security and societal consequences for the US.  Guterres issued the warning after calling on world leaders to adhere to the agreement in his first major speech on climate change as secretary general. His remarks at New York University came as the world waits for Donald Trump to announce whether the country will continue to uphold the Paris deal, which nearly 200 countries signed as a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In a question-and-answer session after the speech, a student asked how the US can address climate change when its president has threatened to back out of the Paris accord.  “If someone leaves a void, I guarantee someone will fill it,” said Guterres, who went on to explain what consequences such an exit could have for the US. “Today, the economy and social aspects are linked to the environmental aspects, but they are also linked to the security aspects, they are linked to the risks of conflict.” He continued: “if you leave a void to others to occupy, you might be creating a problem to your own internal security.” Guterres said that if the US does withdraw from the agreement, it is important that American cities, states and businesses remain engaged with the goals the deal outlined. Trump’s threat has concerned leaders around the world, but Guterres, who became secretary-general on 1 January, has said the accord is not dependent on the US government’s participation. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said Tuesday that Trump “wants a fair deal for the American people”, adding that Trump was spending a “great deal of time” considering the agreement. Trump said on Saturday that he would announce this week whether the US would adhere to the Paris agreement after resisting pressure to announce the plans at the G7 summit. The other G7 countries – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – reaffirmed their support for the accord last week. The landmark agreement was signed in December 2015 and has been ratified by 147 countries, including the US. To underline the importance of the agreement, and other UN climate goals, Guterres spoke broadly about the threats climate change poses to the world, saying “the world is in a mess” because countries and communities everywhere are facing pressures such as overpopulation, water scarcity and food insecurity. He warned that “climate change is a multiplier of many other threats” including poverty, displacement and conflict, and that the people hit “first and worst” by climate change are the poor, vulnerable and marginalized. “It’s absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement and that we fulfill that duty with increased ambition,” he said. Guterres said addressing climate change was an economic necessity and highlighted the threat climate change posed to national security, noting that more than 24 million people in 118 countries were displaced by natural disasters in 2016, which is three times as many people as were displaced by conflict.  Guterres, the former Portuguese prime minister, also announced that there would be a UN climate summit in 2019.  His comments on the US were consistent with statements he has made since replacing Ban Ki-moon as secretary general this year.  “Even if some national governments backtrack in commitments, the combined impacts of sub-national authorities, businesses and civil society will create an unstoppable momentum,” Guterres said at a climate change meeting at the UN headquarters in New York in March. Last week, Guterres told the BBC the agreement would “not collapse” if the US backed out. “I think it is very important that the American government stays engaged, but this is not the end of the world,” he said.  Guterres did not specifically mention Donald Trump in the speech, but said his “door is open to all who wish to discuss the way forward, even those who might hold divergent perspectives”. He said each month, countries were moving to translate the Paris agreement into national plans.  “Yes, not everyone will move at the same pace or with equal vigor,” Guterres said. “But if any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course.”"

"The Roaring Forties and Furious Fifties are strong winds that encircle Antarctica. They are almost unimpeded by land except for the tip of South America and the southern end of New Zealand’s South Island.  These winds play a major role in Earth’s climate, helping to regulate the carbon dioxide exchange between the deep ocean and atmosphere, and influencing rainfall, temperature and sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere. Now scientists have uncovered a 17,000-year history of these shifting winds, sitting at the bottom of a New Zealand lake bed.  Last year, Gavin Dunbar and colleagues from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand drilled deep into the sediments underlying Lake Ohau – a lake that lies to the east of New Zealand’s Southern Alps, and underneath the path of the Roaring Forties.  In recent decades, growth of the ozone hole has forced the winds to shift southwards, resulting in summer rains decreasing by as much as 40% in southern New Zealand. This is reflected in the lake sediments, which accumulate when heavy rains wash them down the slopes of the nearby mountains. The scientists extracted 80m of layered sediments, and radiocarbon dated twigs and leaves in the sediment to reveal 17,000 years of climate history.  Using data they had gathered over the last seven years, Dunbar and his colleagues were able to calibrate the sediment layers and recognise the difference between dry summers (millimetre scale couplets of fine silt) and flood events (centimetre thick silt layers). Their findings are published in Earth & Space Science News.  Now the scientists are working through the sediments layer by layer, listening to the howling of ancient winds.  "
"A giant section of an Antarctic ice shelf is hanging by a thread and could break off at any moment, researchers have revealed. The split in the Larsen C ice shelf of the Antarctic peninsula will release a huge iceberg 5,000 sq km in size – an area about a quarter of the size of Wales.   “The rift is nearly 200km long now, and it has turned towards the ice front, suggesting that it has only got that last piece to go – and that last section is only 13km,” said Professor Adrian Luckman, a scientist at Swansea University and leader of the UK’s Midas project – an endeavour that has been monitoring the situation at the Larsen C ice shelf. “Like any fracture in something, the longer the fracture becomes the more pressure there is on the remaining part of it. So it is really only hanging by a thread here,” he told the Guardian. While the iceberg will not be the biggest ever recorded – the title is held by Iceberg B-15, a mass that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf in the year 2000 and had an area the size of Jamaica – it is expected to be among the top 10. “It is a big event and it will change the landscape of the Antarctic peninsula - the Larsen ice shelf will be left 10% smaller,” said Luckman. The team have revealed that the latest images show that between 25 May and 31 May alone, the rift grew by 17km – the largest hike since the start of the year.  Luckman cautioned that it was not possible to say whether the fracture was a result of climate change. “The rift has been there for decades; it might well have broken through at this moment, whatever had gone on. It could just be one of those cyclical factors in ice shelves – this is how they work, they grow and then they give birth to icebergs.” But he pointed out that climate change “won’t have helped”, adding that the process has been linked to the breakdown of other ice shelves. “The disintegration of Larsen A and Larsen B slightly to the north – it is widely accepted that they are climate-warming results,” he said.  “What happens to these ice shelves [of the Antarctic Peninsula] is in some ways a lesson for what might happen to the larger ice shelves that actually hold back ice from the main ice sheets – and that is potentially very significant into the far future,” Luckman added. The latest update comes in the same week that US president Donald Trump announced that the US will be withdrawing from the Paris climate accord- an agreement signed in 2015 by more than 190 countries to tackle global warming. With the next news from Larsen C – based on satellite data using radar imaging systems – not expected until Tuesday, the current state of the rift remains a tantalising mystery. “It could be any time now, days or weeks – it could have gone already because we haven’t had an image of the area for the last two days. But it could still hang on for months because it is just very difficult to predict how ice will fracture, because we don’t know very much about this ice – it is quite remote” said Luckman. “My feeling is that it is going to go fairly soon.”"
"As Donald Trump walked off the stage in the Rose Garden after announcing the US would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, one could practically hear the champagne corks popping in Beijing. Chinese leaders are eager for more influence on the international stage, and Trump’s move opened up another opportunity for China to fill a void left by the US.   “China is taking a very internationalist stance, so taking the leadership on climate fits in well to that and they will be able to dramatically expand clean energy investment and markets overseas,” said Kate Gordon, a senior advisor at the Paulson Institute focusing on climate change. “That’s all opposed to a very nationalist stance from the United States.” China is grappling with clouds of toxic smog that frequently blanket the country’s cities. In an effort to clean up the air and reduce emissions, the government plans to spend 2.5tn yuan (£280bn) on renewables by 2020, an investment that is projected to create 13m jobs in China.  While China is taking aggressive actions, it remains the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, about double the US. Although in terms of carbon emissions per person, China produces less than half compared to the US.  “There is no question that China will show leadership on climate, including putting a cap and trade system in place, investing in renewable energy, ramping down carbon emissions, ramping down coal,” Gordon added. “Those are all things they are committed to for environmental reasons, but also just for economic reasons.” Chinese president Xi Jinping is currently pushing a $900bn global investment initiative, known as the Belt and Road project, opening markets across Asia and Europe for China-made solar panels and wind turbines.  China is also working on establishing a national trading platform for carbon and officials have shown no sign of retreating from their commitments. “China will stay committed to upholding and promoting the global governance on climate change, and take an active part in the multilateral process on climate change,” Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said the day before Trump’s announcement. “We will work with all relevant parties to safeguard the outcomes of the Paris Agreement, press ahead with the negotiation and implementation of the enforcement rules, and promote green, low-carbon and sustainable growth of the world.” While Trump promised to “renegotiate” the Paris accord in his speech, the administration has not formed a team of negotiators to tackle climate issues, with other countries, particularly China, concerned about who the US will send to the table. In the meantime, China will likely look for a new global partner to tackle climate change, as Chinese officials are not entirely comfortable taking sole responsibility.  “The moment Trump announced his Paris pull out marked the divorce of US-China climate relationship and the beginning of a reinvigorated partnership between China and the EU,” said Li Shuo, climate policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia.  But some in China are wary of the newfound focus on China to lead the world in solving a problem its leaders have been slow to address. “The international community’s expectation of China will now rise sharply, and whether or not China will assume this responsibility is still a major question,” said Zhang Haibin, a professor at Peking University in Beijing and expert on environmental politics.  “China will not alter its commitments because of Trump, or follow him in quitting. But I don’t think China is currently able to independently assume the mantle of global climate change governance, China can’t fully take the place of the US.”  While much of the world is now looking to China, the country’s leaders may choose to lead in a radically different style. “Now China can step in and become the leader on climate, but without the pressure from the US, they don’t need to go as far to have that leadership mantle,” said Alex Wang, an environmental law professor at the University of California Los Angeles who formerly worked in Beijing for Natural Resources Defense Council. The US exit from the Paris agreement also gives ammunition to detractors within the Chinese government who want to slow down the pace of shutting down polluting industries, particularly local governments, Wang said.  Former US president Barack Obama cajoled China into committing to a peak in carbon emission by 2030 in a joint statement, a policy that was already in line with projections but gave Obama the opportunity to make commitments of his own. But China’s leaders have a distinctly different style.  China has long taken a hands off approach to diplomacy, with officials repeating the mantra of noninterference in the affairs of other countries. In terms of climate negotiations in the future, some say China may be less inclined to exert pressure or propose aggressive goals.  “It’s not a comfortable position for China to press other countries for more ambitious targets,” Wang said.

"The survival of coral reefs requires a radical rethink of what conservation means, as well as embracing some of the changes they are undergoing, according to a paper by leading coral reef scientists. “Helping coral reefs to safely navigate the Anthropocene is a profound challenge for multiscale governance,” the scientists say in a paper published today in the journal Nature.   They argue reef conservation must no longer be seen as an attempt to restore reefs of the past, or conserve their existing values, but rather to identify the parts of reefs that are essential to their continued existence, and protect those.  The paper comes amid increased urgency from conservationists and reef managers around the world, sparked by the worst global bleaching event in recorded history. It caused mass die-offs in every major coral reef region of the world. On the Great Barrier Reef alone, it is estimated that about half the coral was killed in 2016 and 2017.  In the paper, the scientists argue saving the world’s reefs requires the acceptance that the reefs of the future will look very different to those of today, and humans may need to help them adapt – perhaps by intervening to increase the proportion of coral species that are tolerant to rising temperatures. “In the coming centuries, reefs will run the gauntlet of climate change, and rising temperatures will transform them into new configurations, unlike anything observed previously by humans,” the paper says. But the overall message was one of hope, said lead author of the paper Terry Hughes from James Cook University in Australia.  “There’s no shortage of people saying reefs will be dead by 2030 or whatever,” Hughes said. “They are going to be different systems with a different mix of species but if we throw the kitchen sink at it and especially deal with climate change then we will have functioning reefs that will sustain and repair themselves and be of some use to people,” he said. The group of scientists, which includes both biologists and social scientists, argue the approach to reef conservation must change in several ways. As coral reefs change, the authors say scientists and conservationists must focus on aspects of reef ecosystems that are the most important to their continued existence. They say biodiversity is no longer the most important value to protect, since some species are more important to the ecosystem than others.  They also suggest that helping reefs adapt may become an important strategy. “Ecosystem composition change is already occurring naturally, as corals respond and adapt to climate change, and could be promoted further through efforts to actively manipulate ecosystem configurations,” they write. Besides embracing the fact that reefs will never be the same, they argue research and conservation must shift from the most direct impacts on reefs, and instead identify and target the root causes. For example, rather than focusing just on the role herbivorous fish play in suppressing seaweed, thereby allowing reefs to recover, conservation efforts should focus on what drives the overfishing of those fish – such as poverty and market demands. “We tend to propose bandaids rather than dealing with the root cause of the issue,” Hughes said. Underlying the finding that reefs will continue to survive is the assumption that agreements made at Paris to keep global warming to “well below 2C” are successful. The researchers reviewed published experiments that examined the response of coral to rising temperatures, and found none that looked at the carbon dioxide levels they say reefs are likely to experience over the next century. Instead, those studies universally examined much more extreme scenarios, equivalent to several degrees of global warming. “Most of the coral reef literature assumes business-as-usual emissions to the end of the century, which would result in global warming of 4, 5 or 6C,” says Hughes. “We will never get there – not because people will become more and more concerned about coral reefs – but because Florida will go under water and that will get people’s attention.”  Similarly, the authors said experiments examining the impacts of acidification looked at exaggerated scenarios, and the researchers said there were some suggestions acidification may not have a large impact on the growth of coral.  The understanding that coral reefs will never be the same is already affecting management practices around the world. In Australia, the Guardian revealed last week that advisers to the government’s plan to protect the Great Barrier Reef have said it must stop trying to “improve” and restore the natural heritage values, and instead should aim to “maintain the ecological function” of the reef, while accepting its overall health would inevitably decline. Similarly, sources have told the Guardian that discussions are occurring within Unesco, over how to protect natural heritage values, given that climate change means many heritage sites will inevitably be altered.  Not all coral reef biologists are supportive of efforts to manipulate reef ecosystems. Justin Marshall from the University of Queensland said the new paper made many good points, but that he did not think attempts to pick and choose parts of reefs to save would be successful. “We’re consistently crap at playing God – or playing Darwin,” Marshall said, adding that ecosystems were too complex to predict the outcomes of particular interventions."
"Donald Trump’s announcement that the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement was always going to be an exercise in idiocy. But he unwittingly brought it to new heights Thursday, when he chose exactly the wrong city to be the face of his disastrous decision. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh,” he said, “not Paris.”  Cities don’t speak but the numbers do, and the numbers say that Trump is full of it.  More than 75% of Pittsburgh voters backed Hillary Clinton. Having revitalized itself from a coal and steel-based economy, its renewable energy industry is now a major employer, providing an estimated 13,000 jobs. The editorial board of its flagship paper, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, has laid out in no uncertain terms how leaving the global agreement would hurt the US. And the city’s Mayor Bill Peduto, long an outspoken supporter of the global agreement, was actually in Paris in 2015 when the accord was drafted. Pittsburgh is — if anything — a posterchild for moving in the opposite direction on climate and Peduto has used every platform available to express his outrage over Trump’s line.  Expanding the lens beyond Pittsburgh doesn’t do Trump any favors either. Trump didn’t even win Pittsburgh’s surrounding Allegheny county, which swung by more than 10 points for Clinton. And though he did win the state overall, two-thirds of the state supports staying in the Paris agreement and the state’s governor Tom Wolf has no illusions about what Trump’s move will do for the local economy. “This decision hurts our economy and Pennsylvania residents,” he told the Post Gazette. Mostly though, it will hurt people overseas. Climate change was already expected to cause an estimated 250,000 deaths per year in coming decades, even before Trump’s decision pull out of Paris, according to estimates from the World Health Organization. Among the hardest hit will be the old and the sick and the weak living in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. Nevermind that seven in ten Americans support the Paris agreement, which countries all over the world have worked for decades to realize. And nevermind that the agreement, which seeks to limit warming to below 2 degrees celsius, is legally non-binding meaning Trump could simply ignore it: the standards the US would be held to under it are literally the standards that it sets for itself.  None of that mattered to Trump. He wanted to make a spectacle out of this moment. And standing, perversely, amidst the beautiful idyllic greenery of the White House rose garden, he proceeded to make the fate of the world just that: a fundamentally flawed talking point. Instead of observing the overwhelming reality of what scientific evidence tells us about the dangers posed by global warming, Trump’s decided to cater to the narrow, ideological interests of people like Myron Ebell and Scott Pruitt. As former secretary of state John Kerry put it in an interview with NPR Thursday: “Really, it’s one of the most disastrous, shallow, untruthful decisions a president of the United States has made in my lifetime.” Earlier this week we saw climate deniers in his cabinet and White House appeared to have prevailed upon the president to the point where he won’t even confirm that climate change is not a hoax. This is not politics as usual. We’re approaching flat earth territory.  And the Pittsburgh moment matters because it reveals a larger truth about how Trump is approaching his job in the White House and the fate of the world. It’s not just that he has no mastery of the material over which he’s presiding so powerfully — research might have fixed that error. He chose the line carelessly, presumably for its alliteration, and with an utter disregard for truth and the dire consequences his distortions will have on real people, including the very ones who elected him. Trump’s never cared much for integrity, but the dangers of his shallowness have never glowed more bright."
"Experts have challenged a claim by Bjørn Lomborg’s Copenhagen Consensus Centre that holding global temperature rises to 2C is a poor investment. In 2015 the education department abandoned plans for Lomborg to set up an Australian Consensus Centre, but gave the Copenhagen centre $640,000 to support its Smarter UN Post-2015 Development Goals project.  The project assessed dozens of development goals and found investment in keeping global temperature rises below 2C would return less than $1 for every $1 spent, which it rated “poor” compared with other possible investments. The claim was based on a 2014 assessment paper by Isabel Galiana. The finding on the 2C limit was one of the project’s most controversial, and has been cited in the political debate about whether such targets are worthwhile, as concerns are raised that president Donald Trump will lead the United States out of the Paris agreement. The report said the 2C target was “relatively ineffective or there is large uncertainty in the benefit-cost ratio” because it was “extremely costly due to a lack of low-carbon energy sources”. But academics have now said Galiana’s assessment underestimated the harm caused if atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeded 450 parts per million, and has been superseded by advances in renewable energy technology and the Paris climate agreement. And Galiana herself has conceded “the paper does not explicitly undertake a benefit/cost analysis of keeping climate change to two degrees” and that a 2C target might be justified if “tipping points” of accelerated environmental damage were considered.  Climate economist Peter Howard, the economics director at New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity, said the assessment paper provided “insufficient reasons for abandoning a 2°C limit”. Howard said the assessment “misinterprets the main papers that it cites in its defence – which actually demonstrate that immediate climate action is critical and that 450ppm is optimal under realistic scenarios”. One such paper, by Derek Lemoine and Haewon McJeon in 2013, used a break-even point based on economic damage estimates in work by Richard Tol in 2009 that have since been revised upwards in 2015 to “nearly double the value”, according to Howard. In particular, it “omits various climate impacts including tipping points – [which] implies an underestimation of the benefits of the 450ppm goal”. Howard said this and other papers cited concluded the 450ppm target was cost-benefit justified. Lemoine said his paper – relied on by the CCC’s assessment – did not seek to estimate the benefits of reaching a 450ppm target, but rather the “sensitivity to assumptions about these benefits”.  Overall, Howard said, the 2C limit was “a wise investment when combined with investment in energy R&D and adaptation”. “Despite much media attention and repeated negotiations within the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] framework, if measured by performance, global climate policy has failed,” the Galiana assessment paper said. The paper argued that meeting the 2C target would require “immediate and globally coordinated action” and warned that “delayed or fragmented action” would increase the cost of meeting the target. Jessica O’Reilly, an expert in environmental management and governance, said the assessment paper, dated October 2014, was produced before the Paris agreement “and therefore makes incorrect claims that international climate diplomacy has ‘failed’”. The Paris agreement, struck in December 2015, was the first universal agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, bringing together nearly 200 countries under a legal agreement that sets ambitious goals to limit temperature rises. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C, and to strive for 1.5C.   O’Reilly noted that the CCC’s assessment paper “opens with an introduction that states climate isn’t one of the millennium development goals”. “Those goals have now expired, replaced by the UN’s sustainable development goals, one of which, SDG 13, is explicitly about climate change.” “Since 2010, coal-fired electricity generation growth has increased more rapidly than non-fossil sources combined,” the Galiana assessment paper said. Assumptions about the availability of low-carbon technology “determine the estimates of the world’s ability to cost-effectively achieve given atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,” it said. Kylie Catchpole, an engineering academic with expertise in solar cells at the Australian National University, said the outlook for renewables was “rapidly changing”.  Her colleague Matthew Stocks said the availability of low-emissions technology was “no longer an issue”. “More renewable electricity capacity was installed in the last three years than fossil fuels. Renewables are rapidly growing and fossil fuels are slowing,” Stocks said. “This is not the result of major breakthroughs, just continued scale and competition driving down the costs of wind and [photovoltaics] in particular. “These costs are coming down much more rapidly than anyone has predicted. New-build wind and [photovoltaics] is now cheaper than fossils fuels.” Catchpole said: “New generation capacity for photovoltaics increased from 50GW in 2015 to 70GW in 2016 (with an extra 50-60GW from wind), while new coal decreased from 71GW in 2015 to 50GW in 2016.” Catchpole, who said a 2C target was “challenging but achievable”, pointed to dramatic reductions in the cost of photovoltaics, down from US$0.70 a watt in 2014 to about $0.45 in 2016, and of batteries “by about a factor of two over the last five years” – both trends that are expected to continue.  “Putting all of these trends together, the cost of transitioning to a low emissions electricity system does not have to be high.”  Stocks attributed development of low-emissions technologies to “artificial markets” – such as pricing greenhouse gas emissions or mandating a renewable energy target – and said “research and development alone would not have done this”. Galiana told Guardian Australia her paper had not explicitly undertaken a “cost-benefit analysis of keeping climate change to two degrees”. “The two degree goal is not particularly useful in developing policy except as an aspirational goal.” Galiana said achieving the 2C target in the next 50 years “requires an unprecedented reduction in emissions to well below current levels”. “It is true that if we are near a tipping point, and we may be, that even with very high costs of reducing emissions to meet the two degree goal may pass a benefit cost analysis.” She said that despite rapid growth in low-carbon technologies, “they still represent a small share of global energy use ... And, we have yet to develop enabling technologies that deal with the intermittency of large scale integration of these low-carbon technologies,” she said, a point disputed by Catchpole. “The current state of technology implies that a steep reduction in emissions is equivalent to a reduction in energy use and consequently a reduction in economic output (ie recession).”  Galiana proposed “moderate emission reduction policies that ramp up as technologies become available ... Strong support for low-carbon innovation and enabling technologies will be key.”  A spokesman for the Copenhagen Consensus Centre responded to questions about the Galiana assessment paper exclusively by referring to other academic works. One paper by Richard Tol for the CCC in 2010 found that keeping temperatures to 2.4C “would generate just $0.02 of climate benefits for each dollar spent,” the spokesman said, though Tol revised damage estimates upwards in 2015 and the 2010 paper predates advances in renewable technologies. A second peer-reviewed evaluation by Tol surveyed the literature of cost-benefit analyses of greenhouse gas abatement and found that it was “not in our collective best interest to stabilise concentrations unless there happens to a cheap, large-scale, carbon-free energy source”. No response was provided by the CCC to claims that low carbon technologies were now available. The spokesman said a third peer-reviewed study by William Nordhaus concluded the 2C target was “infeasible” and that even reaching a 2.5C target would require a $184 a tonne carbon tax compare with the estimated social cost of carbon of $31 a tonne. “This roughly means paying $184 for a benefit worth $31, or a benefit-cost ratio of 0.17. This, once again, confirms that the 2C target has a benefit-cost ratio of much less than one.” However, the Nordhaus paper measured a “hard” limit, which did not account for the ability to overshoot the target and then reduce emissions to reach the 2C target in the long term.

"After Trump’s decision to exit the Paris climate agreement, many of us are looking for a way to fight back. One of the simplest and most powerful things we can do right now is to divest from fossil fuels.  What we saw in the Rose Garden on Thursday was Trump and his advisors making a bet. A bet that the scientists have got it all wrong, that climate change is a hoax, and climate action nothing but a globalist scheme to hurt the American economy. For most of us, this sort of denial and paranoia is mind-boggling. But every time we invest another dollar in a coal company like Peabody Energy or an oil giant like Exxon, we’re taking the exact same gamble.   That’s because none of the major fossil fuel companies have presented a credible plan showing how they are going to comply with the goals in the Paris agreement. Sure, companies like BP and Chevron highlight lots of “green” initiatives on their websites, but take a quick glance at their business plans and it’s still drill-baby-drill.  Even companies like ExxonMobil, who have come out in support of the Paris agreement, did so because they think it will help them use more, not less, of their fossil fuel reserves. That’s because most countries’ pledges under the agreement are just strong enough to drive out the coal industry, increasing the demand for natural gas, but not so strong to take gas off the table.  For major natural gas producers like ExxonMobil, that’s a win-win: cut down King Coal so Big Oil can take the throne. For us, it’s just a loss: locking ourselves into decades more of natural gas use would ultimately make it impossible to meet the long-term targets laid out in Paris.  Divestment provides us with a powerful way to cut our ties with this destructive industry and start moving in a new direction. It’s also a strategy that’s really beginning to work. Thanks to the work of thousands of grassroots campaigners around the world, we’ve succeeded in getting over 700 institutions representing more than $5.4tn in capital to commit to going fossil free.  Meanwhile, the campaign continues to spread around the world: this May’s Global Divestment Mobilisation, a worldwide week of divestment action, saw actions in Japan, Kenya, South Africa, Indonesia and beyond. Together, we’re helping isolate the fossil fuel industry: taking away their social license to operate, weakening their stranglehold on our governments, and moving money out of climate destruction and into real climate solutions.  With Trump trying to make the case that climate action is bad for the economy, this work is more important than ever. We know that it’s the renewable energy sector, not fossil fuel companies, that are driving economic growth and creating millions of jobs, but as long as the public thinks that “smart” money is investing in fossil fuels, the clean energy future will still feel like a distant mirage.  When big institutions, like the University of California or the $350bn New York City and state pension funds are still investing in companies like ExxonMobil, it sends a signal that they aren’t really serious about their climate rhetoric. If they were, they’d practice what they preach and start investing their money in climate solutions.  By getting our pension funds, banks and public institutions to pull their money out of coal, oil and gas, and highlight their investments in clean energy and climate solutions, we can help fundamentally shift the conversation. As people start to see and feel the clean energy economy unfolding around them, they’ll be more likely to support politicians who are calling for a transition away from fossil fuels, and less likely to believe the type of lies Trump was spewing from the White House on Thursday.  We can also use divestment to hold back the expansion of the fossil fuel sector. As nervous investors start heading for the exits, fossil fuel companies are coming under pressure to sell off their coal, oil and gas reserves.  Just this week, for example, Shell announced that was effectively writing off all of its major tar sands reserves in Canada. Banks are also feeling the heat thanks to campaigns like DeFund DAPL, which is pressuring banks to drop their support for the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, an effort that will likely spread to include other infrastructure projects. Trump can huff and puff at the White House all day long, but if the money for new fossil fuel projects dries up, his agenda goes nowhere.  Whether you live in the United States, Europe or Brazil, there are already divestment campaigns underway near you. This isn’t the only strategy we need to pursue – by all means, keep riding your bike, going to marches, and pushing your city to commit to 100% renewable energy – but if you haven’t yet moved your own money, and then gotten your school, city, place of worship, and pension fund to do the same, now is the perfect time to start. There are all sorts of good resources and connections up on gofossilfree.org to help you along the way.  There’s no doubt that our work is cut out for us. While Trump was preparing to make his speech at the White House, scientists issued new warnings that the west Antarctic ice sheet could be facing complete collapse. Meanwhile, up in North Dakota, oil started flowing through the Dakota Access pipeline for the first time.  The two events are connected to each other, and then back to us, our institutions, and our money. Divestment is a way to break that chain of destruction, no matter that Trump does. "

"China and the EU will forge an alliance to take a leading role in tackling climate change in response to Donald Trump’s expected decision to pull the US out of the historic Paris agreement. Trump tweeted on Wednesday night that he would announce his decision at 3pm ET (8pm BST) on Thursday. There are fears that will he confirm reports that the US will soon join Nicaragua and Syria on the small list of countries refusing to back the climate accord, signed in 2015. I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! But Beijing and Brussels have been preparing to announce their intention to accelerate joint efforts to reduce global carbon emissions. According to a statement being prepared before an EU-China summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, the new alliance will say they are determined to “lead the energy transition” toward a low-carbon economy. The EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, told the Guardian: “The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy.” Cañete continued: “No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward. Our successful cooperation on issues like emissions trading and clean technologies are bearing fruit. Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action.” In their declaration, Brussels and Beijing will also call on all parties “to uphold the Paris agreement” and signal their “highest political commitment” to doing so themselves. The document describes climate change as a “national security issue” and “multiplying factor of social and political fragility”. The Paris pact is a “historic achievement” and “irreversible”, the document says. In a bid to calm jangling nerves in the developing world, the document reaffirms funding commitments and promises to bring forward new mid-century greenhouse gas reduction targets. The two blocs will also launch their first ever clean-energy cooperation, as well as measures on energy efficiency, low-emissions transport and low-carbon cooperation between cities. “The EU-China agreement on the full implementation on international commitments under the Paris agreement becomes even more important,” one EU source said. A senior EU official said there was a steely determination that the Paris agreement would not be allowed to unravel, having formally come into force last November. “This is not the end of the world,” she said. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.   It is hoped that the opposition for action on climate change in the White House will not be matched at the state level, where programmes are already in place and where there is a political will to defy the Washington line. The expected announcement in Brussels illustrates China’s determination to take a leadership role in the world as Trump turns the US inwards and prepares to shun its commitments under an international agreement Barack Obama had described as a “turning point for our planet” and a “major leap for mankind”. The joint EU-China statement will offer a high level of detail on how they intend to make real the promises they made when they agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C (3.6F). The EU, which has pioneered an emissions trading system, has agreed to provide China with €10m ($11.2m) to support its plan to roll out its own programme this year. Both sides will also promise to help developing countries reduce their carbon footprint, and the EU will increasingly share its technological knowhow. “Tackling climate change and reforming our energy systems are significant drivers of job creation, investment opportunities and economic growth,” the joint statement is expected to say. On Wednesday, reports emerged from Washington that Trump had, after months of prevarication, decided to remove the US from the agreement – despite pressure from world leaders at last weekend’s G7 summit. The speculation in the US was followed by a tweet from the president in which he said he would announce his decision “on the Paris accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” The expected decision from Trump – who once described climate change as a Chinese hoax – has appalled leaders in the EU and China, but there is a resolve to maintain the momentum behind the Paris agreement. EU sources said there was no evidence that any other countries would follow Washington’s lead. Finnish prime minister Juha Sipila reacted to the reports that Trump intended to withdraw from the Paris agreement by saying that climate change won’t be reversed “by closing your eyes” – and calling the expected withdrawal “a big setback”. In Denmark, the country’s climate minister, Lars Christian Lilleholt, said that “if true, this is a really, really bad signal from the United States.” On Thursday night in Brussels, the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, will join the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for an informal dinner before the main events the following day. A series of communiques and memorandums of understanding are expected to be released. The issues range from a need to increase free trade and ensure respect for global rules and norms, to dealing with non-competitive practices. The EU will also raise its continued concerns about human rights abuses in China, in particular in relation to new legislation on non-governmental organisations and the media. However it will be the joint climate change statement that will be the centrepiece of the summit. An EU official said: “The climate change discussions will be about how to promote the implementation of the deal in Paris. How to promote the use of clean energies. “This is a survival question for many Chinese cities and regions. And also for India. Europe has unprecedented knowhow in this field – technological knowhow, and also legal and regulatory knowhow to promote the use of such technologies. This is therefore a key area of cooperation between us.” Wendel Trio, the Director of Climate Action Network Europe said: “The summit shows that climate protection is and will remain top priority in the international cooperation, no matter what the US administration does. “The strengthened climate alliance between the EU and China should trigger more climate action. This will smooth the way for the two powers to ramp up their Paris climate pledges by 2020, when they are due to be resubmitted. Both are set to overachieve their targets and can afford to make an even bigger contribution.” Li Shuo, the climate policy adviser of Greenpeace East Asia, said it was crucial for the largest emitters of carbon to fill the vacuum left by the US’s likely decision. He said: “The rapid backlash of US climate action requires enhanced leadership from all other countries. At the upcoming EU-China summit, Beijing and Brussels need to demonstrate they are putting new and collective leadership into concrete terms. If US-China climate cooperation gave birth to the Paris agreement, now it is up to EU and China to defend and enhance it.”"

"Name: The American century. Date of birth: 1941.  Status: Dead. Now hold on a minute. A century is 100 years, right? Congratulations on your rudimentary counting ability. But you said the American century began in 1941. It did. The term was coined by Time publisher Henry Luce in February 1941, in an editorial designed to convince the United States to enter the second world war. Yes, that’s very nice, but … The editorial urged the US to forego isolationism to become a kind of global missionary, seeking to help countries most in need under “the triumphal purpose of freedom”. Right. But it’s 2017. Again, well done for knowing very basic things. 2017 minus 1941 is 76. We’re only three-quarters of the way through the American century and you’re already saying it’s dead. Don’t shoot the messenger! I’m only repeating what others are saying. Oh yeah? Like who? Samantha Power, Obama’s ambassador to the UN, who tweeted “The end of The American Century” last Wednesday. And the German newspaper Die Welt, which proclaimed the end of the American century on Friday. What has caused all this? Donald’s Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement yesterday. Oh God, that. It’s an act of such colossally short-sighted self-interest that the US can no longer justifiably call itself a global player. But you already knew that. Well, that seems a shame. What was the best thing the American century gave the world? At its peak, it set an exemplary can-do template. It showed the world that any of us can achieve anything we want, so long as we’re single-minded and competitive. And the worst? The Trump presidency, which showed the world it’s probably not so great to give someone whatever they want just because they’re single-minded and competitive. Should I be feeling as depressed as I do? Nope. Trump’s withdrawal might not be able to happen for four years, and hopefully he won’t be president by then. Plus, one president’s stupid decree won’t stop the rest of the world – or millions of sensible Americans, for that matter – from caring about climate change. Phew. Don’t get me wrong, though. We’re still screwed. We’re still all definitely screwed. Do say: “The American century is dead!” Don’t say: “Long live the final century!”"

"Donald Trump’s Twitter pledge to make a decision on whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement this week promises resolution to months of fevered lobbying over US involvement in the global accord. But while America’s traditional allies and environmental groups continue to urge Trump to stay within the Paris deal – in which nearly 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperatures to a 2C (3.6F) increase on the pre-industrial era – the actions of the US president, most recently at the G7 meeting in Sicily, have begun to provoke murmurs that perhaps the world would be better without American involvement.  The final G7 communique saw the US unusually break with the other six nations by failing to commit itself to the Paris agreement, which Trump promised to “cancel” during the presidential campaign, and reports on Wednesday claimed he had decided to exit. The exasperation of European leaders suggested they are ready to move on with or without the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. “The whole discussion about climate has been difficult, or rather very unsatisfactory,” said German chancellor Angela Merkel. “Here we have the situation that six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.” The US formally turning its back on perhaps the last best chance of a coordinated response to climate change would certainly carry heft. Frantic calculations by several thinkthanks and universities have estimated that US withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year, raising the global temperature by 0.1C (0.2F) to 0.3C (0.5F) by the end of the century. Such a regression would be compounded if other countries took the United States’ lead and also decided to quit Paris, or at least not strive to fill the void in emissions reduction. This would have grave implications for coastal cities facing sea-level rise, parts of the world already blighted by heatwaves and food insecurity, and the planet’s endangered species. While US emissions would start to level off rather than continue their gradual decline, there are signs that India and China, the two other national heavy hitters in emissions, are moving away from coal more quickly than expected, according to Climate Action Tracker. This has led several economists and large US businesses to fret that the coming boom in solar, wind and other renewable energies will not take place in the US. China signaled its intent earlier this year by announcing it will invest $360bn in renewable energy by 2020, creating more than 13m jobs in the sector. If the economic fallout of leaving the Paris deal does not sway Trump, the diplomatic and security ramifications may. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, has urged the US to “keep a seat at the table” in order to maintain its international standing, while UN secretary-general António Guterres has raised the possibility of “risks of conflict” if climate change is not properly addressed. If Trump does decide to stay in the deal, it is likely he will attempt to “renegotiate” it, which would mainly involve the US revising down its goal of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. Opponents of the deal, such as Trump strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, have framed Paris as a “bad deal” for the US that may even hinder Trump’s domestic agenda of winding back various environmental regulations. Several independent legal experts, as well as those who helped craft the Paris agreement, reject this view, pointing out that the edifice is built on a series of voluntary non-binding goals submitted by countries. Paris is essentially a statement of intent, a signal from governments to their citizens and businesses that low-carbon economies are on the way and that this inevitability should be financially supported. Some supporters of Paris are now wondering how useful it would be to have a disengaged US within such a structure. The American public is largely in favour of the Paris deal and could be given the misleading impression that their government is addressing the climate issue by simply staying put, despite tearing down Barack Obama’s climate policies such as the clean power plan at the same time.  “Wanting the US to remain is a short-sighted, knee-jerk reaction,” said Luke Kemp, an expert in international environmental policy at the Australian National University. “The international community should be much more worried about the real domestic actions of the US, rather than whether it is symbolically cooperating internationally.”  Kemp points out that the US could act as a drag upon the international climate effort if it doesn’t leave. “The US and the Trump administration can do more damage inside the agreement than outside it,” he said.  The momentum is reportedly with the “leave” faction, with a group of 22 Republican senators – minus the notable voices of Lindsey Graham and John McCain, who want the US to remain – urging Trump to make a “clean break” from Paris. On Tuesday, Trump again met with Pruitt, one of the most vociferous opponents of the deal.  But the White House’s confusion over the decision and its wider ramifications was perhaps summed up best by Sean Spicer, Trump’s spokesman, who on Tuesday was asked the simple question of whether Trump believed global warming was spurred by human activity, a subject he has previously vacillated upon.  “Honestly, I haven’t asked him,” Spicer replied. “I can get back to you.”"
"Unesco has expressed “serious concern” about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef and warned Australia it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality. The criticism was contained in a draft decision published as part of the agenda for the upcoming world heritage committee meeting (pdf), which will take place in Krakow, Poland, in the first two weeks of July.  It suggested the Great Barrier Reef should remain off the danger list, despite back-to-back coral bleaching events affecting about two-thirds of the reef and the latest data showing a sharp decline in coral cover in the north. The draft decision also praised the Australian and Queensland governments for initial work done to implement the Reef 2050 plan that included establishing a $1.28bn investment strategy, most of which will be spent on improving water quality. However, the report said progress on reducing the number of agricultural pollutants flowing into the reef “had been slow” and Australia would not, at this rate, meet either its interim or long-term targets to improve water quality.  It “strongly encouraged” Australia to “accelerate efforts to ensure meeting the immediate and long-term targets of the plan, which are essential to the overall resilience of the property, in particularly regarding water quality”. It also said climate change remained “the most significant overall threat” to the future of the reef, and “recommended that the committee express its serious concern at the coral bleaching and mortality that occurred in 2016 and at the second event underway in early 2017. “While the long-term effects of these events cannot be fully evaluated yet, their scale serves to underline the severity of the threat to the property from climate change,” Unesco said. “At the site level, there is a need to consider how these mass bleaching events influence the effectiveness of the [Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan] in its current form, notably in relation to the most urgently needed measures and improvements that contribute to the property’s resilience.” Meeting those water quality targets would require a ten-fold increase in investment to $10bn over the next 10 years, the leading expert on water quality for the reef, Jon Brodie, said. It would also involve transitioning farmland in the Great Barrier Reef catchment from sugar cane plantations, which use fertilisers that cause much of the water pollution in the reef, to a less high-intensity form of agriculture, such as grazing. “There’s things that could be done for the water quality part but it’s hard to see this government doing them,” Brodie told Guardian Australia. “The federal government is unfortunately just writing the Great Barrier Reef off. Other things are more important to them, like the support of farmers in Queensland, and the coal industry.” Brodie said improving water quality would “not be enough by itself” to save the reef, which faces its most direct threat from climate change. But unlike climate change, Brodie said, the quality of water flowing into the reef is directly under the control of existing Australian legislation. Improving water quality cannot prevent future bleaching events, but it can improve the capacity of the reef to recover. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, welcomed the Unesco draft decision on Saturday, which he said “confirms the Reef 2050 plan has been effective”.  “The draft decision points to the importance of the reef’s resilience despite the challenges faced from coral bleaching,” he said. Frydenberg acknowledged the committee’s push for accelerated action on water quality and said international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was “critical for reefs worldwide, including the Great Barrier Reef”. He cited Australia’s continued commitment to the Paris agreement, which the US president, Donald Trump, abandoned on Friday, as evidence of Australia’s efforts. Unesco is expected to release a second report on the impact of climate change on the health of all world heritage listed reefs before the July meeting. Richard Leck, oceans campaigner for the World Wildlife Fund, said that while the impacts of water quality and land clearing on the health of the reef were significant, climate change remained the major threat. If the global climate warmed by 1.5 degrees, Leck said, the Great Barrier Reef would not survive. “We need to have climate policies that will actually protect the reef and currently our climate policies are nowhere near sufficient to get the action required to save the reef,” he said. The Australian Marine Conservation Society seconded that concern, and called on the Queensland government to immediately introduce land clearing laws, scrapped under the Newman government, to reduce the amount of runoff flowing into the reef’s catchment.  The Palaszczuk government tried to reintroduce land-clearing laws in 2016 but failed to get them past parliament."

"Al Gore believes that Donald Trump will not halt the momentum of the climate movement even if he withdraws the US from the Paris agreement. Speaking at a press engagement for his new documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the former US vice-president and environmental activist said that he was confident Trump would commit to the historic climate change agreement, but that even if he did not, it would still not be enough to reverse the move towards renewable energy in many American cities.  “I don’t know what [Trump’s decision] will be, but I think there’s an excellent chance that he will surprise many by deciding to stay in the Paris agreement,” Gore said.  “But in the first four months of his presidency, we have already learned that he cannot stop the solutions to the climate crisis. Large states like New York, California and many others are moving faster than the commitments made by President Obama during the Paris agreement. Cities are now deciding to go 100% renewable – most recently Atlanta, Georgia.” However, Gore expressed concern that a withdrawal by the US from the Paris agreement could encourage other nations to do the same.  “The Paris agreement has an historic significance of its own,” he said. “And if the largest economy in the world were to withdraw, it would present a risk that some other countries might use that as an excuse. So it’s important that we stay in.” Trump is expected to make a decision on whether the US will remain in the agreement after he returns from the G7 summit in Italy next week. At a rally in Pennsylvania last month, Trump described the agreement as “one-sided”, prompting concerns that he would move to withdraw from the deal. Several countries, as well as companies such as Apple, BP and Google, have urged the US to maintain its involvement in the deal.  During the press engagement, Gore encouraged Trump to abandon his campaign promise to bring back jobs in the coal industry, and instead encourage miners to retrain for roles in the solar power industry. “The prospects of going back to the age of coal are zero,” Gore said. “Donald Trump’s promises to the coal miners cannot be fulfilled as he made them, but he could, if he chose, put them to work in the solar industry.” He added that solar jobs in the US were growing rapidly and that there were twice as many jobs in solar as in coal already, and that Trump’s populism could backfire on him.  “It’s not unknown in history for politicians to make promises to go back to a bygone era and then adjust their promises when people realise that it really was never a realistic hope. I don’t know if he’ll do that, but the country is going to do that.” Gore also discussed the election of Emmanuel Macron as president of France, declaring himself optimistic about Macron’s willingness to make climate change “a top priority”. “I met with President Macron in the days during the Paris conference and was very impressed with him,” Gore said. “And since his election he has appointed Nicolas Hulot as the head of his environmental transition and made the climate crisis a top priority, and announced new policies. I couldn’t be more impressed with what he’s doing and I’m very optimistic about it.” Gore was critical of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for pushing forward with plans to build further oil pipelines on the Albertan tar sands.  “Justin Trudeau has been a breath of fresh air, although I will add there are many in the environmental movement in Canada who are expressing some concern about the encouragement of the Tar Sands development in Alberta. I like Justin but I will put a little asterisk on that,” he said. Gore said that, despite the progress made, the threat of climate change remained “far higher than any challenge humanity has ever confronted”. “The dangers we face from the climate crisis are now more severe than what the scientists predicted. It has gotten worse. But the primary message of the movie is: we now have the solutions available. We can solve this. And we are beginning to implement these solutions. But the main challenge is to summon sufficient political will to implement these solutions and that’s why this movie has the message: it’s time for action.” An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is the follow-up to the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which followed Gore’s campaign to educate global citizens about the dangers of climate change.  The film won two Oscars at the 2007 Academy Awards, for best documentary and best song. An Inconvenient Sequel will be released in US cinemas on 28 July, Australian cinemas on 24 August and UK cinemas on 25 August."
"Jeremy Corbyn has accused Theresa May of a “dereliction of duty to our country and our planet” for failing to give a stronger condemnation of Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement. The Labour leader said the prime minister was showing herself to be subservient to the US president and claimed he would take a very different approach to relations with Washington.  Corbyn said he would be happy to host Trump in No 10 if he were prime minister and would try to politely persuade him over a cup of tea that tackling climate change was important. “I appeal to the American people, think about the consequences to the entire planet and your economy of what you’re doing,” he said. “Would I meet and host Donald Trump in Downing Street? Yes. Would I talk to him? Yes. Would I be polite? Absolutely. And I’d offer him some Yorkshire tea.  “I do not believe you get anywhere by insulting people and shouting at them. I would try and persuade him the best I could to understand the reality that there is no hiding place from environmental disaster and climate change.” May has expressed disappointment at Trump’s decision to pull out of the landmark deal on reducing carbon emissions but did not sign a joint statement between the leaders of France, Germany and Italy that made clear they believe the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated. Speaking at an event on Labour’s industrial strategy in York, Corbyn said Trump’s actions were “reckless and dangerous”, and May had not been strong enough in distancing herself from his position.  “Given the chance to present a united front with our international partners, she has instead opted for silence and subservience to Donald Trump. It is a dereliction of her duty both to our country and to our planet,” he said. “That is not the type of leadership Britain needs to negotiate Brexit.” Pressed on what his own approach would be, the Labour leader said: “It is a very sad day when the president of the US is trying to get off the bus that has taken so long for all of us to persuade others to get on. So I will give him that Yorkshire tea. I will persuade him the very best I can.”  At the launch event, Corbyn and his shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said Labour would help create a million jobs across the regions of the UK through a national investment fund. He said green industries would help drive growth and be important for the environment. “I am very keen we will do everything we can not just to protect but to enhance biodiversity,” the Labour leader said. “We will not be promoting GM crops. We will not be polluting groundwater.”"
"All over the planet, we are are facing the most urgent time in human history, the most dire situation of all: the effects of the destruction of our earth. Ice-caps are melting, the climate is changing, and species of animals and plants are being threatened and dying out. Yet many of “the powers that be” are still supporting, pushing and funding the destruction of our life-giving earth, through mining, various forms of agriculture and unsustainable energy creation and usage.  The future is bleak. However, some countries are doing it right, banning plastics and making major moves towards sustainability and green energy. And then there’s “Australia”. A place so entrenched in the blood of colonialism that it has been unable to even consider listening to what First Nations people have been saying about care for country, even when it comes to making decisions that will affect our environment.  “The oldest continuing culture on earth”: we hear and see this, time and again. Yet how often do people consider what it really means? Considering that when colonisation first occurred our country was so pristine that white “explorers” even said it looked like a rich man’s garden back in England (check out Bill Gammage’s, Greatest Estate on Earth).  We often hear these references to “the oldest continuing culture on earth” in a romantic way that embraces cultural practice but can distance us from any possible engagement with our knowledge systems, especially in regards to issues like global warming and climate change. Or for that matter, widespread health problems, education or social issues, and governance. Indigenous knowledges have been greatly suppressed as a part of the colonial process in Australia. Our people lived completely sustainably, and in balance with each other and country, for over 60,000 years. We kept our country clean through practices like fire-stick farming, we monitored our species of animals and plants through our totem systems.  We respected other people, other countries, other laws, cultures and even other creation stories. Many of the problems that western colonialism has, we simply did not. What is often forgotten is that we still have access to our culture and even though many languages and cultural practices have been lost, much of our knowledges have been kept. Knowledges that through over 60,000 years of compiling and refining, have the greatest potential to sustain human life on this planet. And yet, even while the planet continues to heat up, people still don’t connect the dots. Many people still completely undervalue Indigenous knowledges, in spite of people like award-winning scientist, broadcaster and environmentalist, Dr David Suzuki urging society and our institutions not to. On his last trip here, Suzuki said that “Australia could learn from its Indigenous peoples”. He went on to say: “We need to have a paradigm shift; to me the paradigm shift is that we have to see the world as Indigenous people see it.” Of course this is something many of our people already know and have always known. Still the urgency of global warming, and the destruction that capitalism and colonialism has caused our planet, continues to be ignored by Australian governments. This is a worldwide human issue impacting on our children’s right to a future.  My understanding of the Murri perspective of humanity means that country is taken care of, in order to sustain life. I believe this is connected to the fact that many different Indigenous groups across the continent and the world have creation stories that relate directly to land and/or waters which ensures that all land is held sacred in its production of life. This relationship between people and land lays the foundations for the relationship between people. We cannot treat land with disrespect without disrespecting ourselves and each other. My father – the late Dr Ross Watson – taught me about how our ontology (what we perceive to be life) and epistemology’s (how we lived out that perception of life) foundations are respect for land, and thus life. So everything we created and even the things we didn’t create had a specific purpose and use that fit into our perception of life, and helped to carry out that perception of life. Anything that caused widespread destruction to our country or people was either never invented or was adapted and managed to ensure that our epistemology remained respectful to land and people, while many other things – like the wheel for example – was just never necessary.  It is my understanding that Murri people lived a life of abundance and autonomy, all the while maintaining a proper relationship with lands and peoples. This is not to propose an overly romanticised view of precolonial life. Of course we had conflict between people, and of course our people knew tough times, but the conflict and toughness was mitigated by our philosophy, logic, ontology and law. When we say “White ‘Australia’ has a black future”, we are saying that Murri culture and law must be considered for there to be a viable future. Knowing our philosophy, logic, ontology and epistemology gives our young people the opportunity to find innovative ways to carry out culture and law with whatever we have, wherever we are, however we can.  This is not something new, but our culture has always been resiliently dynamic in its ability to thrive, even among the depression of colonialism and attempted genocide. We may not now know all of our languages, songs, dances and stories, but many of us have had our knowledges translated and interpreted to us, and through us, our whole lives. Dr Lilla Watson talks about how Murri people are always facing forwards, looking to the future. She teaches me about how dynamic our culture is and why that’s so important. White Australia is often moving towards the future while facing backwards, with a closed mind to anything beyond the limits of the colonial logic. It’s this logic that has allowed us to get so far into the destruction of our planet. Surely we cannot believe that this logic will save our future?  The only possible, sustainable and empowering future we could have would be one where the sovereignty of our people, our knowledges and of our lands and laws are respected, valued, heard and implemented throughout “modern Australian” life. The question is, will white “Australia” be mature and reasonable enough to approach this problem where it began: with colonialism? At the end of the day, if “Australia” wants to survive and combat global warming, First Nations sovereignty and governance is the best chance it has. As my aunty Lilla says: “We need to make sure our future stretches as far ahead of us, as our past does behind us.”"

"Governments around the world are increasingly being challenged in court to do more to combat the threat of climate change, with litigation ranging from a group’s attempt to stop an airport runway in Austria to a Pakistani farmer suing his government over its failure to adapt to rising temperatures, a new study has found.  The lion’s share of the litigation is in the US, but the number of countries with such cases has tripled since 2014. UN Environment and Columbia law school, which undertook the research, found a “proliferation” of cases instigated by citizens and environmental groups demanding action on areas such as sea-level rise, coal-fired power plants and oil drilling. “It’s patently clear we need more concrete action on climate change, including addressing the root causes and helping communities adapt to the consequences,” said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. “The science can stand up in a court of law, and governments need to make sure their responses to the problem do too.” The US has been the staging ground for 654 climate-related cases, almost three times that of the rest of the world combined. Some of these cases have proved pivotal, such as a 2007 case where various states and cities demanded the Environmental Protection Agency regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The supreme court ruled against George W Bush’s administration, leading to the EPA determining that greenhouse gases are a public health threat and opening the way for Barack Obama’s executive action on climate change. Other cases are continuing, such as the 21 children who are represented in a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming that its failure to sufficiently cut emissions violates their constitutional right to life, liberty and property. The Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the case would “upend climate law as we know it” should it be successful. Australia, with 80 cases, and the UK, with 49 cases, are the next largest national sources of climate litigation, although the report notes that legal action is starting to emanate from all corners of the world. The issue of “climate refugees”, where people have had to flee their country due to flood or drought, is gaining traction, following a case where a man from Kiribati sought refuge in New Zealand. In the Netherlands, an environmental group called the Urgenda Foundation joined with several hundred Dutch citizens to sue the government over its decision to lower its greenhouse gas reduction target. The court concluded the case had merit based on the Dutch constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the “no harm” principle of international law. In a separate case, several groups managed to overturn the approval of a third runway at Vienna’s main airport, while in yet another case, a court in Pakistan ruled in favor of Ashgar Leghari, a farmer, over his government’s “delay and lethargy” in implementing its climate change adaption policies. Not all cases have been as successful. A Peruvian man sued a German energy company over the climate impacts suffered in his homeland, with the case ultimately dismissed.  “We haven’t seen any major wins filed in actions against fossil fuel companies but there have been successes in lawsuits against governments,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia. “A lot of this legal action is in the US because America is a litigious society but also because there is such a partisan divide over the fundamental reality of climate change, which doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the world.” Burger said legal action will prove significant in pushing the countries closer to their agreed target of avoiding global warming of 2C or more compared to the era shortly before the advent of heavy industry. The world is currently on course to breach this limit, causing ever more dangerous climate change, even with the emissions reduction pledges agreed in the Paris climate deal. “The role of litigation will be different in each country but we will continue to see an increase in climate lawsuits that make explicit reference to the Paris agreement,” he said. “In the US, I don’t think that any court will hold the government to account over Paris as it’s not binding, but other courts in other countries may give it different weight. “Legal action will be used to stave off the worst aspects of climate change. Litigation has been absolutely essential in instigating action in the US and elsewhere, and it will continue to be so.”"
"Downing Street has defended Theresa May not signing up to a joint declaration by Germany, France and Italy in opposition to Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord by stressing that other countries also chose a different path. A source pointed out that Japan and Canada had not signed up to the letter and said the prime minister’s approach was “consistent as to how we approach dealings with international leaders”.   They said May first wanted to speak to the US president and claimed she was robust in her disappointment during a phone call. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, earlier accused May of a “dereliction of duty to our country and our planet”  for failing to issue a stronger condemnation. He told an election rally in York: “Given the chance to present a united front with our international partners, she has instead opted for silence and subservience to Donald Trump.” A Downing Street spokesperson said Trump had called May to discuss the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement and said the door remained open to future US involvement in the deal. “She [May] said the Paris agreement provides the right global framework for protecting the prosperity and security of future generations, while keeping energy affordable and secure for our citizens and businesses,” the spokesperson said. “The president made clear that the door remains open to future US involvement in the agreement.” They said the pair had also agreed on the importance of continued cooperation on wider energy issues.  The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said BBC Radio’s World at One that May was being “weak and feeble and spineless” for not being willing to condemn the US president. When it was put to him that May has said she expressed disappointment about Trump’s decision, Miliband replied: “Disappointment is when your football team loses a match. It is not when somebody makes a devastating decision like this. America is one of the two largest emitters in the world, along with China. This decision was backed by every country in the world apart from Syria, which is in the middle of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which wanted us to go further. American leadership was so important to this.”"
"Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change means the US joins only two other countries not signed up to the historic accord. The only other UN members not signed up are Nicaragua and Syria, which both chose not to enter into the climate accord in the first place.   Their reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax. Nicaragua declined to sign up because it thought the accord did not go far enough. In November 2015, Paul Oquist, Nicaragua’s lead envoy to the Paris negotiations, told Climate Home: “We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure. We don’t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.”  The Bonn-based UN climate body has requested all countries in a position to do so to submit “intended nationally determined contributions” to international efforts to hold warming to 2C. The following month, Oquist told Democracy Now: “Universal responsibility – everyone is responsible – is a spin on historical responsibility, because everyone didn’t create this problem.”  Nicaragua’s share of global emissions (0.03%) pales beside that of the US (13.19%), yet it came fourth on a list of countries most affected by climate change between 1996 and 2015, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. For its part, Syria has been mired in a civil war since 2011. The government of Bashar al-Assad has been heavily sanctioned by the UN over human rights violations, making it a pariah to much of the international community.  The sanctions would have made it difficult for members of the Syrian government to travel to Paris to attend the discussions, and the ongoing conflict would have made it difficult for it to commit to any limitation of the country’s emissions.  Nevertheless, other countries in the midst of conflict have signed up, including Yemen, as well other countries isolated by the international community, such as North Korea. Syria’s share of global emissions is also low compared with the US, at 0.14%."
"The Coalition government has recommitted to Australia’s emissions targets in the Paris agreement after Donald Trump’s withdrawal but Malcolm Turnbull faces internal division as conservative MPs celebrated the American decision. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was disappointed with Trump’s decision but reiterated the Turnbull government’s full commitment to the Paris deal.  “We reiterate our full commitment to the Paris Accord,” Frydenberg told the ABC. “We believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable.  “I do believe that it is still a very meaningful agreement. You have more than 190 countries that signed on, and in record time, 146 countries have ratified. So even without the US, around 70% of the world’s emissions are covered by that agreement.” But the decision increases pressure on Turnbull ahead of the chief scientist Alan Finkel’s report which will be released at the council of Australian governments (Coag) meeting next Friday. Former Abbott government minister Eric Abetz has suggested a potential Australian withdrawal on the grounds climate policy could increase the cost of electricity and transport in Australia. “I have long said that should countries like the United States, China or India withdraw their support or fail to live up to the non-binding targets, Australia should similarly pull back to allow for an increased focus on supporting families and jobs in Australia,” Abetz said.  “While I will be interested in reading the final [climate] review when it’s complete, because we must make our own policy decisions for our own reasons, the reasoning behind president Trump’s decision may similarly apply in the Australian context.” Abetz said at the very least the Finkel review should be delayed to consider the consequences of the US decision. “I don’t think anybody would be critical in the event that report was delayed so, as part of the review, there could be full consideration as to what the consequences might be for Australia,” he told AAP on Friday. But Turnbull, speaking in Singapore ahead of bilateral meetings, ruled out delaying the Finkel review, as it was commissioned by Coag. He said while he was disappointed by Trump’s decision, it was entirely expected. “The [Paris] commitments that we made, are in Australia’s interest,” Turnbull said.  “We are committed to ensuring that Australians have affordable and reliable energy and that we meet our emission reduction targets.  “There is a massive national and global interest in achieving that and maintaining energy, but you cannot be ideological about it. You have to be hard-headed. Turnbull said the government’s decisions would be driven by economics and engineering. “The momentum towards a lower emissions energy sector is irresistible. It is driven in large part by technology,” he said. Liberal MP and chair of the backbench environment committee, Craig Kelly, who was at the forefront of the campaign which forced Frydenberg to rule out any form of carbon trading, had “champagne on ice” waiting for the US withdrawal.  Early on Friday morning, he posted “THEY’RE OUT” on his Facebook page and welcomed the decision with a video of Whitney Houston singing the Star Spangled Banner. “There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it’s just that mankind hasn’t yet worked it out,” Kelly said. “But if our history tells us anything, we are more likely to discover that new technology by combining free market capitalism with the wealth created by fossil fuels than we are through central planning and government imposed regulations that destroy wealth.” With Turnbull in Singapore for bilateral annual leaders talks, Frydenberg said it was important to have the United States in the agreement as the second largest emitter. But he insisted the Paris Agreement remained meaningful. Asked about Trump’s previous comments that climate change was a Chinese hoax, Frydenberg said there was broad global understanding about the significance of climate change. Frydenberg praised the US economy for having its lowest emissions intensity in more than two decades partly due to gas exploration. “It’s got its lowest emissions intensity in more than 20 years and one of the reasons for that is the shale gas revolution which has seen gas overtake coal as a major energy source,” he said. “But here in Australia, we’re at the lowest emissions intensity on a GDP and per capita basis in 27 years. So Australia is transforming and we are supporting that transition in a way that ensures energy affordability and energy security.” The government has already ruled out any form of carbon trading to appease more conservative MPs in the Coalition party room even though industry groups believe Finkel will recommend a version of emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector as one of the more preferable options. Finkel gave support to such a scheme in his preliminary report late last year. Frydenberg doubled down against any form of emissions intensity scheme following Trump’s decision but predicted there would be big battles within the Coalition this week ahead of Trump’s decision. “It would push out, faster than the system can cope, brown and black coal generators and right now, after we saw the blackout in South Australia, which was a disaster for the people and the businesses of that state, we can’t afford to compromise energy security and energy affordability,” Frydenberg said. “That’s why it’s a dilemma that we face.” Senior Labor frontbencher Penny Wong said it was a deep disappointment that the US withdrew from the agreement which represented the most significant global action to deal with climate change. Wong noted China had continued to express its support for the Paris Agreement overnight but said any agreement needs the United States. “The United States is a global leader; whatever it does, matters,” Wong said.  She called on the prime minister to be absolutely clear with the US administration to continue to press Donald Trump on climate change. Wong said she was disappointed to see members of the Coalition publicly advocating for the US withdraw. The climate movement will grow and grow from this. It will activate a mass movement of the scale rarely seen. Kelly told Guardian Australia that while he celebrated the US decision, he did not believe Australia should withdraw from the agreement yet but should monitor its effects on the economy. He said for the US, the Paris Agreement gave China a huge advantage over the US. “After those negotiations China would have walked away from table laughing at the US because they can increase their emissions to their heart’s content,” Kelly said.  He said his concern was Australian would also be giving up its international competitive advantage of cheaper energy costs. “Look at the Renewable Energy Target, we have simply spent a lot of money with not a lot of result,” Kelly said. He said Australia needed affordable and reliable electricity supplies and “at moment we are getting neither” and the country was simply exporting jobs to China."
"As Politico reported, Trump’s deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, gave him a fake 1970s Time magazine cover warning of a coming ice age. The Photoshopped magazine cover circulated around the internet several years ago, but was debunked in 2013. Four years later, McFarland put the fake document in Trump’s hands, and he reportedly “quickly got lathered up about the media’s hypocrisy … Staff chased down the truth and intervened before Trump tweeted or talked publicly about it”.  This particular myth – that most climate scientists in the 1970s were warning of an impending ice age – is wrong on three separate levels. First and most obviously, a majority of climate science research in the 1970s anticipated global warming, not cooling. Second, there were some climate scientists whose research suggested that we could trigger an ice age – if human sulfur pollution were to quadruple. But that didn’t happen. In addition to blocking sunlight (and hence having a cooling effect), sulfur pollution causes other problems like acid rain. So various governments (including America’s) enacted Clean Air Acts to regulate that pollution (quite like the way we should be responding to carbon pollution’s dangerous impacts). Since then, human sulfur pollution has gone down, while carbon pollution has gone way up. The climate scientists weren’t wrong – the scenario they warned could have triggered an ice age didn’t happen because we took action to prevent it.  Third, although we’ve established climate scientists weren’t wrong in the 1970s, even if they had been, so what? Science advances, and we understand how the climate works today much better than we did 40 years ago, as illustrated in this funny video by Adam Levy: To be blunt, this is a really dumb myth, and it says a lot that about the state of America’s government that the president was suckered into believing it. McFarland, second in command to Michael Flynn before he was ousted by scandal, was a Fox News analyst before Trump hired her. In fact, Fox appears to be where she developed the connections to Trump that led to her appointment in his administration. McFarland hadn’t worked in government since the 1980s, and many observers worried that she was unqualified for this important and influential position. As Media Matters reported: McFarland, who spouted numerous misleading and bizarre comments during her time at Fox, is so unsuited for her deputy national security adviser position that retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, an accomplished and decorated Navy vet, refused Trump’s offer to serve as national security adviser because he didn’t want her on his team. McFarland is now slated to be ousted from the National Security Council and nominated as ambassador to Singapore; she has already been “largely sidelined” at the agency Ironically, Fox News’ Jon Scott interviewed Politico’s Shane Goldmacher about the fake magazine cover story, and noted “The president getting some fake news every once in a while, apparently, from his own staffers.” That fake news of course came from a former Fox News analyst and concerned one of Fox News’ favorite climate myths. In fact, a 2013 study found that Fox News is a major driving force behind climate denial.  Seven Democrats on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology wrote Trump a letter expressing concern that he is frequently being fooled by this sort of fake news. The committee members suggested: If you appoint a qualified [Office of Science and Technology Policy] Director, you will have a reliable source of policy advice for matters related to science and technology, which forms the bedrock of our national security and economic power. Indeed, most key government science and technology positions in the Trump administration remain unfilled. Recently, most members of one of EPA’s major scientific review boards were either fired or resigned in protest, with one saying “I can’t be a prop to bad science.” Scott Pruitt’s main qualification to lead the EPA was his 14 lawsuits against the agency. Rick Perry didn’t even know what the Department of Energy did when Trump nominated him for the job. Trump’s reported pick for chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture isn’t a scientist, and of course is a climate denier. The hits just don’t stop coming. Of course, 61% of American voters thought Donald Trump was unqualified to be president (17% of whom voted for him anyway). We’re now seeing the consequences of an executive branch full of unqualified people who have approximately zero regard for science or facts. As Barack Obama put it, “you get the politicians you deserve.” Apparently we deserve political leaders who are utterly clueless about the most important existential threat the world faces today."
"Under a dual onslaught of global warming and localised urban heating, some of the world’s cities may be as much as 8C (14.4F) warmer by 2100, researchers have warned. Such a temperature spike would have dire consequences for the health of city-dwellers, rob companies and industries of able workers, and put pressure on already strained natural resources such as water.  The projection is based on the worst-case scenario assumption that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise throughout the 21st century. The top quarter of most populated cities, in this scenario, could see temperatures rise 7C or more by century’s end, said a study in the journal Nature Climate Change.  For some nearly 5C of the total would be attributed to average global warming. The rest would be due to the so-called “urban heat island” effect, which occurs when parks, dams and lakes, which have a cooling effect, are replaced by concrete and asphalt – making cities warmer than their surrounds, the researchers said. “The top 5% [of cities by population] could see increases in temperatures of about 8C and larger,” study co-author Francisco Estrada of the Institute for Environmental Studies in the Netherlands said. Estrada and a team used different projections of average planetary warming, combined with the UHI effect and potential harms, to estimate the future costs of warming on cities. The median city, right in the middle of the range, stands to lose between 1.4% and 1.7% of GDP per year by 2050 and between 2.3% and 5.6% by 2100, they conclude. “For the worst-off city, losses could reach up to 10.9% of GDP by 2100,” wrote the team. UHI “significantly” increased city temperatures and economic losses from global warming, they added. This meant that local actions to reduce UHI – such as planting more trees or cooling roofs and pavements – could make a big difference in limiting warming and minimising costs. Cities cover only about 1% of earth’s surface but produce about 80% of gross world product and account for around 78% of energy consumed worldwide, say the researchers. They produce more than 60% of global carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas for fuel. The world’s nations agreed in Paris in 2015 to the goal of limiting average global warming to two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial revolution levels by curbing greenhouse gas levels in the Earth’s atmosphere. For the latest study researchers used data from the world’s 1,692 largest cities for the period 1950 to 2015."
"Donald Trump is poised to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, according to multiple reports, in a move that would profoundly undermine the landmark agreement by nearly 200 countries to curtail global warming. Trump tweeted late on Wednesday that he would announce his final decision at 3pm ET on Thursday in the White House rose garden. It followed a wave of reports that he was about to exit from the deal. The reports follow his refusal to express support for global efforts to combat climate change at a G7 summit with European leaders last week. I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Should the US exit from the Paris agreement, which was negotiated and ratified under Barack Obama, the country would join only Syria and Nicaragua as non-participants. The US had previously committed to a goal of reducing carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025. On Wednesday afternoon during a press call with the Vietnamese prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Trump was asked if he was leaning toward getting out, to which he replied: “You’re going to find out very soon.” Asked whether he has been hearing from CEOs and others trying to persuade him on the climate agreement, Trump said: “I’m hearing from a lot of people, both ways. Both ways.” Shortly before, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he did not know if Trump has already made up his mind after listening to industry leaders and foreign leaders. “He’s had a lot of input and ultimately he’ll make the decision,” he said during an off-camera briefing that lasted only 12 minutes. A sombre Spicer told reporters: “I think the president’s comments on this, that he’ll be making a decision on this in the next few days, stand.” Pressed further, he replied only: “When the president has a decision he’ll make that announcement and he’ll make it clear what the basis of that is.” Asked about entrepreneur Elon Musk’s threat to leave White House advisory councils if the US withdraws from the deal, Spicer said: “Let’s wait and see what the president’s decision is. I don’t want to get ahead of it.” The Trump administration has been divided on the issue, with the EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, and Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon among the conservative hardliners who have been in favor of a US exit from the deal. Axios, which first reported on Trump’s intention to exit the deal on Wednesday, said the details were being ironed out by a team led by Pruitt. Trump has dubbed climate change a hoax, and once tweeted that global warming was a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. The US president nonetheless faced immense pressure during his first foreign trip since taking office to uphold the pact –from world leaders and Pope Francis, who gave Trump his papal encyclical on climate change during their meeting at the Vatican. But the efforts to persuade Trump were “very unsatisfactory”, according to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who observed: “Here we have the situation that six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.” As with many of Trump’s major decisions, news of his pending move leaked through anonymous sources that gave way to a reality TV-style narrative playing out before the public. The competing in-house factions were reportedly at war, with Pruitt and Bannon up against Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s daughter and son-in-law, who despite attempts to paint themselves as moderating influences on the president so far have little to show for it. Some observers interpreted the spectacle as a trial balloon, by which officials were seeking to nudge Trump in either direction based on the reaction in the press. The environmental activist and author Bill McKibben said if reports were true, the president’s planned move amounted to “an incredibly stupid decision” that would isolate the US not simply among its allies but much of the world. “It ranks right up there with the worst decisions in American political history,” said McKibben, a regular Guardian contributor. “There’s not a climate scientist in the world who thinks his arguments make sense.” The US ranks as the world’s second-largest carbon polluter, and initial estimates by universities and thinktanks suggest its withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, raising the global temperature by 0.1-0.3C (0.2-0.5F) by the end of the century. Environmentalists also fear the ripple effect Trump’s decision might have on other major polluters, such as China and India, who have reiterated their commitment to the accord but could be emboldened to walk away in the face of similar action by the US. The US business community has been particularly vocal in the need to address climate change, which could have a devastating impact on the economy and jobs, according to research. One report, published by Citigroup in 2015, estimated at least $44tn in cumulative “lost” GDP over the next five decades stemming from the effects of global warming. Major American companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and Goldman Sachs have in turn outlined ambitious targets in recent years to switch to 100% renewable energy. Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to Obama who oversaw the administration’s agenda on climate, conservation and energy policy, said a move by Trump to withdraw from the Paris accord would amount to the US “effectively stepping away from the table at a time when the global rules of the world are going to be written”. “We have a lot to gain from expanding clean energy and energy efficiency – they are some of the fasting growing sectors of our economy,” Deese stold the Guardian. “Donald Trump can’t cancel the Paris agreement, and he can’t cancel the momentum that is behind it both diplomatically and economically,” he added.  Tillerson, the secretary of state, has urged the US to remain in the accord, which is backed by a majority of the American public. And while other countries have vowed to press on, with or without the US, its absence would leave the enforcement of the deal in a flux. The consequences would be especially profound for coastal cities facing rising sea levels, the protection of endangered species, and areas around the world already suffering from heatwaves and food insecurity. Trump has taken action in recent months to weaken the environmental legacy of the Obama administration by paving the way to overturn rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions and protect American waterways from pollution. During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to “cancel” the Paris accord within his first 100 days of office. But Democratic mayors across the US have vowed to uphold the Paris climate agreement, even if the president withdraws. Responding to reports on Wednesday, the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, called the decision to leave the accord a “dagger aimed straight at the heart” of the president’s native New York. “The Paris Accord was the biggest step forward we’ve taken in many years. It’s unconscionable for the president to step away from it,” De Blasio wrote on Twitter. “But we’ll take matters into our own hands.” At a press call later,De Blasio pledged to sign an executive order affirming the city’s commitment to the accord if Trump pulled the US out of the accord.  During a press conference on Wednesday, Boston’s mayor, Marty Walsh, said that if the White House decided to withdraw, the responsibility to protect the environment would fall to cities. “No matter what the president decides, I want to make it absolutely clear to the White House and our partners worldwide that the city of Boston will not back down.  “We will honor these responsibilities to our children and to our planet and we will do what is right,” Walsh added. “That’s who we are in the city.”  The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, a co-founder of Mayors National Climate Change Agenda, has said repeatedly that if the White House leaves the Paris deal, his city will adopt it independently. If the White House withdraws from the Paris climate accord, we’re going to adopt it in Los Angeles. #CAPIdeas The Mayors National Climate Change Agenda sent a letter to the president in March urging him against rolling back US climate policy, including the Obama-era clean power plan, which Trump has proposed defunding.  In the UK, meanwhile, in a televised debate ahead of the country’s general election next week, leading politicians were critical of any US decision to leave Paris. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said she was disappointed by the expected move.  Additional reporting by Damian Carrington"
"The most important international agreement to tackle climate change is about to be dealt a severe blow – but Theresa May is nowhere to be found. Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement, in which 195 countries signed up to ambitious targets to arrest the rise in global temperatures. Such a decision from the US will heighten the risk of a climate disaster, with all the damaging consequences to food supply, the global economy and our security.  Experts in the UK have made clear that climate change is a grave threat to national security, and Trump’s own defence secretary has issued the same warning for the US. Donald Trump’s actions put us all in greater peril. Yet in the face of this threat, May is silent. We have a prime minister who is weak on the world stage and complicit in Trump’s world-harming act. While our European neighbours are joining with China and other developing countries to confront Trump and strengthen their efforts on climate change, Theresa May hasn’t issued a word of criticism. Whereas France’s new president used his first meeting with Trump to press him to stay in the Paris agreement, our prime minister failed to even mention it during her fawning trip to Washington in January. This is unacceptable. Just as Donald Trump is abrogating America’s responsibility to lead the fight against climate change, Theresa May is evading Britain’s role. Instead of holding hands with Trump at the White House and rolling out the red carpet for him in London, the prime minister must stand up to him and convince him to keep America in the Paris agreement. Instead of the lavish trappings of a state visit, Trump should be greeted with robust British diplomacy. After all, what is the good of a special relationship unless we’re prepared to use it? May’s lack of leadership on this issue is appalling, but perhaps not all that surprising. One of her first acts as prime minister was to abolish the Department of Energy and Climate Change. She’s sold off the Green Investment Bank that we established in coalition, and is now calling for a fracking “revolution”. Nick Timothy, her chief of staff and righthand man, wrongly called the Climate Change Act a “monstrous act of self-harm”. No wonder her policy on climate change is so weak. What’s most disappointing about May’s failure on climate change is that Britain played such a pivotal role in securing international agreement on it in the first place. As the energy and climate change secretary in the coalition government, I led the negotiations for an ambitious EU commitment that paved the way for success at the Paris conference. It was a clear demonstration of the influence Britain can wield as a member of the EU – influence that is particularly crucial in the face of global threats such as climate change. Only through international cooperation will we prevent catastrophe. We now have to face the reality of an American president who ignores the scientific consensus that climate change is real and calls it a Chinese hoax. Clearly reason and evidence won’t change Trump’s mind, so we must bring international pressure to bear instead. If Trump does not face a backlash from the UK and other nations over this, he will take it as a sign that he can ride roughshod over any number of other international agreements in the future. With Donald Trump in the White House, British leadership on the world stage is more important than ever. We should be working with our European allies, not turning them into opponents. We should be redoubling our own efforts to combat climate change, not watering them down. And we should be speaking out loud and clear against Trump’s irresponsibility. If this election is about leadership, it’s clear yet again that Theresa May has been found wanting."
"Donald Trump “believes the climate is changing” partly because of pollution, according to the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. Speaking on the CNN programme State of the Union, due to air on Sunday, Haley was seeking to define the president’s thinking about climate change in the wake of his announcement that the US will leave the Paris climate accord, joining Syria and Nicaragua as one of three non-signatories.   “President Trump believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of that equation,” she said. ‘So that is the fact. That is where we are.” The overwhelming majority of climate scientist believe human activity is the main driver behind the dangerous warming of the planet. Haley continued: “He knows that it’s changing and he knows the US has to be responsible for it and that is what we’re going to do. Just because we got out of a club doesn’t mean we don’t care about the environment.” Trump’s views on climate change have been at issue all week. On Thursday, in a White House briefing to explain the decision to pull out of the Paris agreement, officials refused to confirm or deny whether the president believed that global warming was caused by human activity. Pressed on the issue by reporters, one of them said “can we stay on topic, please”. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said earlier in the week he did not know the president’s views.  “Honestly, I haven’t asked him that,” he said. “I can get back to you.” On Friday, after Trump’s announcement on the Paris accord departure, Spicer was asked the same question. “I have not had the opportunity to specifically talk to the president about that,” he said. Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax, on one occasion in 2012 saying it was a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. Questioned on CNN about the decision to pull out of the Paris accord, Haley said: “We have got a president who is going to look out for the environment. It’s what we do. Its who we are. We are going to continue to be a leader in the environment.  “The rest of the world wanted to tell us how to do it and we’re saying we will do it, but we will do it under our terms.”  She later acknowledged that the US set its own emissions targets under the Paris agreement, which is voluntary and non-binding, but blamed the Obama administration for setting goals that were not attainable.  In the excerpts of the interview released on Saturday, Haley did not explain why the US did not stay inside the accord and amend US targets. "
"Landmarks in cities across the world have been lit up green in support of the Paris climate accord after Donald Trump’s announcement on Thursday that the US would withdraw from the agreement.  In New York, the spire of the One World Trade Centre was illuminated. The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, tweeted: The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, tweeted an image of city hall and promised that the city would ”honour the goals” of the Paris agreement.  City halls in Boston and Washington DC were also lit up in a display of solidarity.  Outside the US, the Montreal mayor, Denis Coderre, tweeted an image of a green city hall, stating: “Cities from the world supports #ParisAgreement”, and in a later tweet: “Cities will make #ParisAccord a reality. No plan B for the planet!!!” Paris city hall was also illuminated in green.  The California governor, Jerry Brown, announced that his state would be a part of the newly established United States Climate Alliance along with New York and Washington.  The three states combined represent more than one-fifth of the US gross domestic product, roughly 68 million people and at least 10% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Officials said they were committed to achieving the US goal of reducing emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels. The Pittsburgh mayor, Bill Peduto, reaffirmed his city’s commitment to the Paris agreement, tweeting: “As the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy & future.”"
"So we do have a new US – for the present. In the jargon of Trumpology, the president has tossed a sop to his climate-change denying chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and disappointed his green daughter, Ivanka. Or at least he is withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord in three years (Bannon) but “renegotiating” it (Ivanka).  The world will not suddenly sink beneath the waves. The US’s impressive record in cleaning up its emissions since 2007 will not go into reverse. Federal subsidies for renewables may diminish, but California and New York, and other states and cities, have said they will not reverse green energy regulations. The switch away from fossil fuels will continue, if only because that is where the market is going. What has changed is something less tangible. Trump’s contempt for internationalism and his explicit “America first” language shows him in full isolationist mode. This is the raw nationalism we saw in the early George W Bush years, and periodically back in American history, notably before the two world wars. It is one with Trump’s Mexican wall, immigration control, trade protection and anti-Nato Russophilia. He is the authentic voice of world-go-to-hell. The perils here are obvious. The US’s leadership in the 20th century was crucial in “policing democracy”. Its power, its money, perhaps above all, its example, have overseen a clear reduction in world poverty and even conflict over the past half century. But we are now in the 21st, and this leadership has become tarnished. America’s military interventions in the Muslim world since 2001 have been obsessional and counter-productive, the agents of anarchy. Neither a bellicose Bush nor a milder Barack Obama was able to correct this. The old maxim – hold close to nurse America for fear of something worse – no longer seems the no-brainer it once did. Just as the US itself is fracturing in response to Trump’s emissions decision, so Nato is fracturing in response to his plain hostility. Relations with Russia are unfreezing, intervention in the Middle East is growing meaningless, China is flexing its global muscles. Were this part of some coherent Trump landscape, it might become a template for a new, multi-polar world. In truth it is emotional and shambolic. But even madmen have their uses. It is never sensible for sovereign states to rely for too long on other states, accountable to other electorates, to rule the world on their behalf. Treaties and alliances grow tired and need review – look at the EU. The Paris accord, a rare example of global collective action, remains in place. Others must now step forward to lead where the US will not, perhaps even China. It is as well to be reminded that no great power is wholly reliable. Burdens of responsibility must sometimes be carried by others."
"A withdrawal by Donald Trump from the Paris climate accord would go down as a hallmark of his presidency. It would be unilateral, reckless and splashy – trademark Trump. The president has said he will announce his decision at 3pm ET (8pm BST) on Thursday.  But while Trump has often stood on a range of issues as a maverick outlier from mainstream Republican politics, on climate change he is at the centre of the party’s orthodoxy. Trump’s disbelief in climate change and imminent decision on whether to support the Paris agreement reflects an area of unusual agreement between the president and elected Republicans, whose track record of climate change denialism is plain and long.  Unmissable behind the elected Republicans stand other interests: the oil, gas and coal industries, which together are some of the most influential donors to Republican candidates. The big-money supporters got a return on their investment last week, when 22 Republican senators whose campaigns have collected more than $10m in oil, gas and coal money since 2012 sent a letter to the president urging him to withdraw from the Paris deal. Trump had been said to be on the fence about the deal. Members of his inner circle, including his daughter, were reported to favor staying in. “We strongly encourage you to make a clean break from the Paris Agreement,” read the letter, drafted by Wyoming’s John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate committee on environment and public works, and Oklahoma’s Jim Inhofe, a longtime climate change denier and senior member of that committee. The letter argued that the Paris deal threatened Trump’s efforts to rescind the clean power plan, an Obama-era set of regulations and guidelines that include emissions caps and other rules deemed onerous by the fossil fuel industries. It was not as if Trump wanted for advisers urging him to withdraw from the Paris deal even before the letter was sent. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Stephen Bannon urged withdrawal, while energy secretary Rick Perry favored renegotiation.  Public opposition to the deal from almost two dozen senators just as the president prepared to make his decision, however, demonstrated the extent to which the opponents of the Paris deal were organized, ready to strike and to offer important political cover if Trump pulls the US out of the historic global deal.  Donations from oil, gas and coal interests to the signatories of the letter are Open Secrets that seemed ready for a new review. A Guardian survey of Federal Elections Commission data organized by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the industries gave a total of $10,694,284 to the 22 senators over the past three election cycles. Visible donations to Republicans from those industries exceeded donations to Democrats in the 2016 election cycle by a ratio of 15-to-1, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And that does not include so-called dark money passed from oil interests such as Koch industries to general slush funds to re-elect Republicans such as the Senate leadership fund. At least $90m in untraceable money has been funneled to Republican candidates from oil, gas and coal interests in the past three election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics.

"The Turnbull government will support the Paris agreement on climate change regardless of whether or not the US president, Donald Trump, pulls out, the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has signalled.  Trump upset world leaders on the weekend by refusing, at the conclusion of the G7 summit in Italy, to declare his support for the UN’s landmark treaty signed in Paris in 2015.  Despite two days of urging from leaders from Europe, Canada and Japan to pledge his support for the agreement, Trump tweeted on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris accord next week!” His position left his counterparts frustrated, with some warning if the US pulled out of the Paris agreement other countries may want to reduce their commitments too. But when asked about Australia’s commitment in the wake of Trump’s tweet, Frydenberg told Guardian Australia the Turnbull government takes its emissions targets seriously “and we’re going on and trying to meet them”. “Issues about domestic climate change policy in the United States is a matter for the Trump administration,” Frydenberg said. He also pointed to a quote from Malcolm Turnbull from November last year, when Turnbull was asked if Australia would remain in the Paris agreement if then president-elect Trump followed through on his threat to cancel the emissions reductions commitments made by Barack Obama in December 2015. Turnbull had said: “When Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through and that is exactly what we are doing.” Turnbull also described the Paris agreement as “a watershed and a turning point” that would deliver international action on climate change. “My government is committed to [the Paris agreement]. We have ratified it,” he had said. In the aftermath of Trump’s election victory, the chairman of the Turnbull government’s backbench committee on the environment and energy, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly, said on Facebook the Paris agreement was now “cactus”. In March this year, Kelly said he stood by that prediction from November given Trump had already signed an executive order to unravel a number of Obama’s regulatory measures to combat climate change, seen as a prelude to the US withdrawing from the Paris deal. The Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement in November. “If a country sought to withdraw from the agreement it takes four years,” Turnbull said at the time."
"The key Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon has warned the Turnbull government he has “real reservations” about allowing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in carbon capture and storage technology. Xenophon told Guardian Australia on Tuesday night the government should, instead of rewriting the rules of its so-called “green” bank, just knuckle down and deliver an emissions intensity trading scheme for Australia’s electricity sector.  Allowing electricity generators to engage in a form of carbon trading, the senator said, would deliver policy certainty, and “deal with the investment drought”. Before the introduction of government legislation amending the CEFC’s investment rules to federal parliament on Wednesday, Labor is also signalling it won’t support the measure. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, responded to the government’s announcement on Tuesday that it would allow the CEFC to invest in carbon capture and storage declaring: “You’ve got to be kidding.” You've got to be kidding.https://t.co/YGLT3q4cq7 The shadow cabinet is yet to deliberate formally on the government proposal but the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, issued a statement on Tuesday night saying the proposal was “nothing more than the latest stunt from a government unable to effectively deal with the energy crisis under its watch”. The Greens are also opposed to the change. If Xenophon’s concerns hold, the government will not, on current indications, have the numbers to get the proposal through the Senate. The government has on numerous occasions flatly ruled out introducing an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector, even though a range of groups champion the policy as an effective mechanism for reducing emissions at the least cost to households and businesses. The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is expected to use his looming review of the national electricity market, which will be handed to the Council of Australian Governments next week, to maintain his implicit endorsement of a trading scheme, while proposing other reform options. After the government confirmed its long-telegraphed intention to overhaul the CEFC’s investment rules on Tuesday, the organisation issued a statement saying amendments to legislation were “a matter for the parliament”. “As a government agency, the CEFC has always complied with the act, and will continue to do so,” the statement said. The CEFC said carbon capture and storage could be used in the power sector and “the industrial sector to capture emissions from chemical processes, as well as fugitive emissions”. “There are some industrial processes for which there are currently very few alternatives to reducing emissions, making CCS an important technology if these sectors are to achieve deep cuts in emissions,” the CEFC’s statement said. The government’s proposal was welcomed by the mining giant BHP. “Energy markets need to be both fuel- and technology-neutral, and not artificially favour one type of technology over another,” a company spokesman said. “Policy should focus on providing clear emissions reduction goals and system stability requirements. It would then be up to industry to determine the most effective and least cost means of achieving these goals. “While we expect further reduction in the cost of generation for new technologies such as solar PV, wind, power storage and CCS, secure and reliable power at the lowest possible cost while remaining consistent with emissions targets is likely to be provided by a mix of technologies.” Energy Networks Australia also argued a technology-neutral approach was important in energy policy. “Australia’s economy is inherently carbon intense and it needs all viable technology options on the table to achieve deep decarbonisation in line with the Paris aspiration of zero net emissions by the second half of the century,” said the ENA’s chief executive, John Bradley. “CCS has the potential to support long-term carbon abatement in major industries with significant carbon emissions, like metal manufacturing, fertilisers and advanced manufacturing,” he said. Bradley said CCS technologies were not “pro-coal”. “They are just one of the potential tools that could help Australia to efficiently achieve carbon abatement at scale, while maintaining energy security and affordability.” But the Climate Council’s chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said diverting renewable energy funds to coal projects would be “costly, will increase emissions, and exacerbate climate change”. “It is truly bizarre to use funds earmarked for clean energy to prop up polluting coal,” McKenzie said. “The CEFC is a highly professional independent body investing in renewable energy and generating a return for taxpayers. Why the government would intervene to put public money into a technology that even the coal industry only minimally invests in beggars belief.”"

"“Where is the fiction about climate change?” Amitav Ghosh asked in these pages last year. It’s a good question: glance at most publishers’ catalogues and you would never know that humanity was facing the greatest challenge of its existence. Laline Paull’s two novels to date have brought humanity and narrative to the changes already under way on Earth – and unlike most environmentally conscious fiction, they’re intended for a mainstream audience. Her Baileys shortlisted 2014 debut The Bees followed the life of a single lowly bee; its anthropomorphised bee characters smiled and wept and shouted in joy, enchanting critics and readers with their richness and warmth. Her second novel, The Ice, focuses on human intrigue in the warming Arctic: in its opening pages, a glacier calves to reveal a body, several years dead, and the novel plays out as an inquest into this death. By embedding a mystery in layers of melting Arctic ice, Paull brings narrative tension to a phenomenon readers typically encounter only in environmental or scientific reporting.  The body, we learn early on, is former Greenpeace chief Tom Harding, who had been persuaded to lend his integrity to a scheme dreamt up by his old friend Sean Cawson, a businessman and the novel’s protagonist. The men bonded over a mutual fascination with the Arctic as students in Oxford’s Lost Explorers’ Society, before growing apart as adults. The plan that reunites them is to build in the Arctic “an inspiring venue in which to promote the reconciliation of business and environmental ethics” – precisely the bifurcation that has divided their friendship. With a habit of leaving little to deduction, The Ice continues: “And here they were, the two of them, actually living out that conflict, at this very second.” As that quote suggests, The Ice tends towards allegory. As characters take the stand at the inquest, they seem to represent various attitudes to conservation, each given an opportunity to have their say. Here’s Sean: “The Arctic is melting … While some people are wringing their hands, treaties fall wildly out of date and business capitalises. So choose denial, or choose – like I did, like my partners and I have actively and responsibly done – to be at the vanguard of those changes and make sure they happen in the most positive way.” Later, a professor of ocean physics, called upon to testify about the changing conditions in the Arctic, asserts that Tom’s death “can itself be attributed … to the reckless endangering of our planet by every industry that ignores the environmental recommendations for how to operate, and to every government that fails to abide by the Paris Agreement.” All this polemic is rather a lot for the characters to carry, and at times the fiction wears thin. Critics praised The Bees for kindling concern for a threatened species through rich storytelling, without grinding any axes. That novel was an exercise in empathy and imagination. By contrast, The Ice is structured as a blame game, its setup going straight to the heart of responsibility for and appropriate responses to climate change. If the primary concern is to spread an environmental message, this is ideal. If the goal is to write a nuanced piece of character-based fiction, it’s less so. And if the environmental message is the novel’s primary concern, it’s somewhat weakened by the circumstances of Tom’s death. Ghosh concluded that literary writers have avoided writing about climate change because they deem it too strange for fiction, that they dread inspiring incredulity with extreme and unpredictable events even as such events become the norm. The Ice is built around an extreme event, and it inspires some incredulity – though not, as Ghosh suggests in his piece, incredulity that such an event could happen; rather that it should dovetail so neatly with the tensions between characters. In the context of the novel, it’s actually rather predictable. This forces the destabilised Arctic to make sense on a human level, which is precisely what it will not do. Nonetheless, the final pages are a triumph. Here, Paull slips into a more nuanced mode, delivering fragmented reports on places and players: we flit between a pub, a plane, a car crash, a shipwreck and news reports. It’s a rousing passage that, in its simultaneity and its resistance to simple causative relationships, brings the novel closer to the complexity and truth of life and of nature. • The Ice is published by Fourth Estate.

"Donald Trump’s intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday, as one report cited “confidants” saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue”.  Trump said in a tweet on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!”  The message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal, which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year. A report from the Axios news outlet, however, cited “three sources with direct knowledge” as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal. In an interview broadcast on CBS’s Face the Nation, meanwhile, defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had “obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard”. He added: “And I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in … and I’m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.” Mattis said that as defense secretary, such negotiations were “not inside my portfolio”, but added: “Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that’s just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.” The White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning, however, the president offered comment of his own, via Twitter, that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report. “It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,” the president wrote. “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names it is very possible that those sources don’t exsist [sic] but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!” A source who had been in contact with people involved in the decision told Reuters that meetings were planned with chief executives of energy companies and big corporations and others about the climate agreement, ahead of Trump’s expected announcement. It was unclear whether those meetings would still take place. In Sicily, Trump, who has called global warming a hoax created by the Chinese and who campaigned on a promise to pull out of the Paris deal, came under concerted pressure from the other leaders to honour the agreement. “The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters. “There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris agreement or not.”"
"The Turnbull government will move to overhaul the rules governing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to allow the so-called “green” bank to invest in carbon capture and storage technology. After telegraphing its intention to overhaul the CEFC’s rules for some months, the government on Tuesday secured party room support for the change.  While the overhaul will be greeted with alarm by environment groups, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the proposed change was a “demonstration of the government’s commitment to a technology neutral, non-ideological approach to national energy policy”. “Removing the prohibition will allow the CEFC to support a wider range of low-emissions technologies and thereby reduce emissions at lowest cost,” Frydenberg said on Tuesday. The government’s move to overhaul the CEFC’s rules comes as industry sources are expecting the looming Finkel review to float a new low-emissions target along the lines John Howard proposed back in 2007. Such a scheme would work in practice as a technology neutral renewable energy target (RET). The final review of the national electricity market by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is due to be handed to the Council of Australian Governments on 9 June. The Turnbull government has boxed itself in by refusing to countenance the scheme the chief scientist, industry and environment groups say would be the best policy option in the national electricity market to reduce emissions at least cost to households and businesses – an emissions intensity trading scheme. Some elements inside the Coalition are implacably imposed to carbon pricing in any manifestation. A technology neutral RET would give the Turnbull government another policy pathway for emissions reduction. The CEFC’s investment function is spelled out under its legislation, which says the organisation should invest in the development, commercialisation and use of clean energy technologies. The CEFC is currently required to invest at least half of its funds in renewable energy technologies, with the remainder left available for low-emission and energy efficiency technologies. The organisation is currently prohibited from investing in carbon capture and storage and nuclear technologies. Labor has already ruled out supporting any legislative change to the CEFC rules. In February, Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said the opposition would not be a party to transforming the CEFC into the coal finance corporation. A key Senate crossbencher, Nick Xenophon, has also expressed concerns about a change that would allow more investment in coal technologies. Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday carbon capture and storage was “proven technology that should be made to work in Australia.” He said the amendment being proposed by the government would only apply to carbon capture and storage, not to other forms of coal technology. But the minister said if anyone proposed a high efficiency, low emission (HELE) coal fired power plant, with carbon capture and storage, “that would absolutely be a project that could be funded.” “There’s nothing wrong with attaching CCS to a HELE plant of a gas fired generator,” Frydenberg said. The move to overhaul the CEFC’s rules came as the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told Tuesday’s party room meeting that government would not adopt emissions trading in its response to the Finkel review. Industry sources have told Guardian Australia Finkel is more than likely to stick with the implicit endorsement he gave to an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector in his preliminary report, which was given to state and federal ministers six months ago. Frydenberg repeated Turnbull’s position on Tuesday, and declined to say whether the government would support a technology neutral RET, if that’s what Finkel recommends next week. But while stepping around specifics, he said the government was of the view that “something does need to change, and we will consider his recommendations.” The Greens expressed outrage on Tuesday about the CEFC proposal. “The Liberals are taking money out of renewables and giving it to coal,” said the party’s climate spokesman, Adam Bandt. “Only the Liberals would think that coal counts as a clean energy source.” Bandt said even “coal loving Donald Trump” had cut funding for carbon capture and storage. The Australian Conservation Foundation had a similar view. “Ordering the CEFC to invest in coal technology is like telling the health department to invest in tobacco,” said the ACF chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy. “This is a reckless move from a government that is captured by big fossil fuel companies. It doesn’t have any kind of plan for energy and climate policy.” “There is no such thing as clean coal. This is a massive blow to CEFC, a fantastic initiative that has been helping to create new jobs and tackle carbon pollution.” But the Minerals Council of Australia welcomed the move. “The Australian coal industry supports the government’s sensible policy which recognises the role of our high quality coal in helping to curb emissions,” said the Greg Evans, the MCA’s executive director, coal. “If the policy intent is all about reducing emissions we should have a technology neutral approach and that means considering the opportunity coal offers when utilising both high efficiency low emission (HELE) and carbon capture and storage (CCS).”"
"It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world’s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity’s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel. The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide “failsafe” protection against “the challenge of natural or man-made disasters”.  But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the world’s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. “It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,” said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault. “A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,” she told the Guardian. Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18C. But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. “It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,” Aschim said. “We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.” The vault’s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. The end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7C above normal on Spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point. “The question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?” said Aschim. The Svalbard archipelago, of which Spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to Ketil Isaksen, from Norway’s Meteorological Institute.  “The Arctic and especially Svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. The climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,” Isaksen told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet. The vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. They have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood. Aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: “We have to find solutions. It is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. We are doing this for the world.” “This is supposed to last for eternity,” said Åsmund Asdal at the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, which operates the seed vault."
"Shell shareholders including the Church of England, European pension funds and Dutch activists will send a signal to the board of the Anglo-Dutch company this week by voting for it to set new climate change goals. The challenge comes from a Dutch group of retail investors, who have tabled a resolution for Shell’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, asking the company to establish carbon emission reduction targets.  “A large group of institutional investors will make their dissatisfaction with the company’s position evident by voting for this resolution,” said Mark van Baal of Follow this. The Church of England is among investors supporting the proposal, along with several European pension funds. “I’m not expecting that it will pass but the resolution is well-worded and we support its intent – it’s something the board should be taking note of,” said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for church commissioners at the C of E. Shell’s board has asked shareholders to vote against the resolution, which to pass would require 75% to vote in favour. Shell argued that unilaterally setting targets would harm the company and that the emissions from the burning of its oil and gas were largely covered by country’s individual climate plans under the Paris accord. Independent European proxy advisory group ECGS recommends investors back the climate resolution, but major advisers Glass Lewis and ISS oppose it. The Guardian understands no major institutional investors intend to support it. A Shell spokesperson said: “We’re pleased the key proxy agencies share the view of Shell’s board of directors that the resolution is not in the best interests of the company, its shareholders or the fight to tackle climate change. “The only realistic way that Shell could reduce its customers’ emissions would be by reducing the volume of products we sell to them. This would simply drive customers to other suppliers, make no real difference to overall emissions, damage our business and undermine our efforts to play an active role in the energy transition.” Separately, the UK-based investment group Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), which represents around 1% of shareholders, has urged investors to reject both the directors’ pay last year and Shell’s future remuneration policy. CEO Ben van Beurden’s total pay was £7m in 2016, up 60% from £4.7m in 2015, which Pirc said was excessive at 453% of his salary. ISS has also raised concerns over the £1.94m payout for a former chief financial officer, Simon Henry, which it said was not in line with practice in the UK. However, overall it backed the remuneration for last year. Pirc said the future pay policy was not without concerns for shareholders because when directors leave they would receive an automatic payout linked to their annual bonus, but on balance it backs supporting the policy in a binding vote. Activists are also expected to use the AGM as an opportunity to pose questions about an Italian investigation into an allegedly corrupt oil deal by Shell in Nigeria.
