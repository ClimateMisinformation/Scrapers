"Can we really feed nine billion people? That’s the estimated global population in the year 2050. It should be possible, but things are looking tricky – especially when we also factor in the climatic instability caused by global warming. These are some of the current threats to food security and what we could do about them. Demands for water for human use and to grow crops are increasing, but changing weather patterns because of global warming mean we can’t rely on enough rain falling where we need it. So how can crops still thrive in a warmer world? Back in the 1990s, a simple experiment was devised to test how grapes were affected by signals from their roots in dry soil. Vines were grown with their roots split. They were given plentiful water through one half of their roots, but the others were not watered. The effect was astounding: the fruit yield was the same but  only 70% of the water was used. If plants reduce their water loss they can’t take up as much carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and thus growth. However it seems plants direct the resources they do have to their fruit and seeds, in order to protect the next generation. This works well for us humans: as fruits and seeds are frequently the edible parts of the plant, “partial root drying” often sustains crop yields. Pathogens – anything which causes disease, such as a virus, bacterium or fungi – have always been a feature of agriculture and there are a number of current causes for concern. For example, a wheat rust fungus that current varieties have no resistance to is spreading from Africa to the Middle East. Bananas are also an important staple crop for hundreds of millions of people in Africa, but a new variety of the fungus that causes Panama disease has devastated plantations of previously-resistant varieties and is spreading from Southeast Asia. Crops often already have resistance mechanisms that could stop a new pathogen in its tracks. What they lack is the information that they are under attack and should turn their defences on.  Plants use “R proteins” to detect invading pathogens and trigger their defence responses in a way analogous to our antibodies. An R protein from another variety of the same species or sometimes even from another plant species resistant to the pathogen can be copied into a vulnerable crop by genetic engineering, where it will identify the pathogen and activate defences against it. In the long run, it may be possible to defeat evolving pathogens by equipping crops with a barrage of different R proteins so that evading one way of detecting them is not enough. Water used for irrigation isn’t pure H2O and often it contains minerals including sodium and calcium salts. When a crop takes up the water these substances are left behind in the soil, just as mineral impurities in tap water cause your kettle to fur up. Salts accumulated in soil now affect crop yields in many parts of the world. Most plants exist in symbiotic relationships with fungi. In some cases, crop species treated with fungi from plant species from extreme environments have become tolerant of those environments. For example, rice inoculated with fungi from plants from a salty coastal area became salt tolerant, and tomato plants receiving fungi from plants growing in the warm, geothermic soils in Yellowstone National Park could then withstand root temperatures of 50℃. Crops depend on fertilisers to get the bumper yields required to feed the current seven billion people and their livestock. Nitrogen, one of the three main “macronutrients” plants need, is generally taken from the atmosphere and converted into usable ammonia fertiliser by reacting it with hydrogen at high temperatures. This is known as the Haber-Bosch process. The industrial process was a vital part of the Green Revolution in the mid 20th century, which boosted agricultural production across the world. The chemists responsible, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, have been said to have saved more human lives than any other individuals, although their process was developed for explosive manufacture in Germany during the First World War. Scientists sometimes accidentally cause harm while attempting to do good, but this is a spectacular case of the opposite. However, the process requires temperatures of up to 500°C and pressures equivalent to those 3km below the surface of the ocean. This means large factories, carbon emissions, and more global warming. Additionally, excess fertiliser can cause ecologically destructive algal blooms and chemical fertilisers adversely affect soil microorganisms. The Green Revolution wasn’t actually green. So how to wean ourselves off fertiliser? The most important of our staple crops are cereals such as wheat, rice and maize, which originated as domesticated grasses. Together they contribute more than 60% of global calorie intake. These crops are annual species, growing from seed to produce the next generation in a single season before dying. Because of this, fields have to be ploughed and reseeded each year and cereal root systems never penetrate deeply into the soil. This is why they need fertiliser.  However, not all grasses are annuals. Many prairie grasses are “perennials” that don’t die after producing seed and are productive even without additional fertiliser. Their roots grow deeper and deeper each year and can tap nutrients and water far beneath the soil surface.  What if we could make perennial versions of these key crops? It would be a much more environmentally-friendly way to grow food. Some think it could be achieved within two decades, but bringing all of the characteristics we want together in time may well require genetic modification."
"In August 2016 the 13-deck, 1,000-passenger Crystal Serenity set sail from Alaska to become the first cruise liner to attempt the Arctic’s fabled “north-west passage” that runs across the top of North America from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Until recently the passage was too clogged with ice for all but the sturdiest of ships.  This voyage, only possible thanks to climate change, highlights just one impact of melting Arctic sea ice. As the ice melts further new opportunities will arise to fish, to drill for oil and gas, or to sail through the once-frozen ocean. Inevitably, this activity will create competition with traditional Arctic communities, and risks severe damage to the environment. This is a vast, fragile region that plays a huge role in everything from climate cycles to marine food webs and reflecting sunlight back into space. So who is supposed to protect the Arctic? The 4m or so people who live north of the Arctic Circle can’t regulate the whole area themselves. There are important questions here about whether coastal Arctic states alone should be able to permit or refuse fishing, or oil and gas extraction. Is there an international regime in place to regulate such activities in the interests of everyone? The short answer is that there is an international treaty that governs all activities in the Arctic Ocean. The treaty gives much (but not all) of the formal decision making power to coastal states such as Iceland, Russia and Canada. These nations may choose to cooperate (and sometimes are required to cooperate) through regional organisations such as the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum for Arctic governments and peoples, or treaties. The treaty in question is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Signed in 1982, UNCLOS came into force in 1994. However the treaty only applies to the states that have agreed to be bound by it and that doesn’t include the US. UNCLOS is supported by a network of other treaties though, and by the rules of customary international law, which are binding on all states. These treaties and laws provide a set of consistent, but quite general rules about using the oceans. For example, they set out the basic principles to be taken into account in fishing regulation, or when trying to stop pollution from shipping. It is, however, left largely to individual countries to decide how to interpret these principles and apply the rules, and this in turn is influenced by domestic politics.  This means the industrial fishing lobby, indigenous people, environmental NGOs and other interest groups are all very important. International law, after all, does not have the same checks as national law and its domestic application is generally only scrutinised where the interests of another state have been harmed. The system is not quite the free for all that this description might suggest. There are also other international treaties that apply in the Arctic. These provide more detail and guidance on the action states can take, but do not cover every possible activity. The problem is that some of these rules are designed to apply globally and so do not provide detailed measures specific to Arctic conditions. For example, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) doesn’t take account of the specific needs of shipping in areas subject to heavy ice. Its global provisions have, however, been supplemented by the Polar Code to help protect fragile polar environments.  More specific regional agreements also exist such as one on cooperative search and rescue. And some agreements, focus on specific needs of certain parts of the Arctic, like the Barents Sea fisheries agreement. Governments, NGOs, industry bodies and others can all influence the development of these laws. For instance, every member state in MARPOL, the shipping pollution treaty, can influence the development of new measures. Guatemala has as great a right to influence marine pollution law as Russia. In theory it makes little difference if those measures are, like the Polar Code, focused on the Arctic or Antarctic, or designed to be global measures.  The Arctic Council gives certain indigenous peoples the opportunity to influence the development of the law quite directly through their position as permanent participants. These permanent participants are in a strong position then to influence any agreements, such as the Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement, which was developed under the Council. Besides these direct routes to influencing the law, industry and other interest groups will lobby their governments to adopt particular measures at home and in international meetings. There are also indirect opportunities for bodies, seemingly unconnected with the Arctic to regulate activities there. For example, the EU is one of the largest importers of fish caught in or near Arctic waters. It could then shape fishing efforts in the Arctic by restricting imports of particular fish, or of fish caught using particular methods. Its market share may be large enough to have a regulating effect on Arctic fisheries. Although there is a coherent legal regime in place, it is quite patchy and much needs to be done to strengthen the law. New laws could be developed by Arctic states acting alone or collectively, but there is also scope for new laws to be adopted at the global level. At the same time, there is a multitude of opportunities for states, industry, NGOs and individuals to influence the law in the Arctic, particularly through political channels."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat temperature rise does a doubling of atmospheric CO2 lead to? Overall, the IPCC says anywhere from about 2 – 6°C, i.e. they don’t know.
Recently the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) posted an essay by Dr. Wolfgang Burkel, who concludes that doubling atmospheric CO2 will lead only to a 0.58°C of warming at the Earth’s surface.
What follows is a translation and summary of his essay.
Dr. Burkel’s calculation method looks at the energy balance directly at the Earth’s surface. Evaporative cooling of additional water vapor is so powerful that only 0.58°C of warming is enough for compensating a doubling of CO2 concentration.
============================
Anthropogeníc Greenhouse Effect Too Weak For A Climate Catastrophe!
By Wolfgang Burkel
The greenhouse effect of CO2 is expressed by the formula: dF = 5.75ln(C/Co).

Figure 1: Logarithmic climate sensitivity of CO2.
Figure 1 shows that a doubling of CO2 concentration delivers an additional radiative forcing of 3.7 W/m², which in turn leads to an atmospheric warming of about 1°C, which is accepted by almost all scientists. The IPCC provides a figure of 1.2°C; Lüdecke and Link [2] calculate 1.1°C. Other sources provide similar values.
The problems begin when the results are carried over to the Earth’s surface. Suddenly the values diverge immensely. Even within the IPCC itself there is no agreement. See the following chart:

Figure 2: CO2 effect according to the IPCC AR4 2007.
First of all one sees that the values in the table appear as guesses, and are thus alien to any scientific method. The reason for this are the varying estimates of ‘positive feedbacks’, which are built into the politically dominated models. But logic does not support a positive feedback. How should a small warming of the atmosphere lead to a large warming at the Earth’s surface?
Why does one calculate a change in global temperature by taking a detour through the atmosphere? The result is useless because there is no consensus on what it means for the Earth’s surface.

Figure 3: Energy budget at the Earth’s surface and change through the greenhouse effect (in parentheses): Evaporation 84 W/m² (+4); Radiation 45 W/m² (-4) and convection 17 W/m² (+0). Absorbed from the sun 140 W/m² (+/- 0). Earth’s surface temperature: 15°C (+0.58°C).
Figure 3 shows the heat flux as part of the energy budget. What happens in the atmosphere or at the outer edge is insignificant for the energy balance. The energy at the Earth’s surface eventually finds its way out into outer space.
There’s a consensus on the magnitudes of the energy flux: evaporation is 84 W/m², radiation is 45 W/m² and convection is 17 W/m². A change in one is compensated by the others. Anthropogenic greenhouse effect reduces the energy flux from radiation. But then the temperature of the Earth’s surface rises until a new equilibrium gets established.
For calculating the warming, the dependence of the three above-mentioned transport mechanisms on temperature is used.
Evaporation
Evaporation of water removes heat from the Earth’s surface and transports it to the upper atmosphere, where it gets dumped as the vapor condenses. For the stability of the climate, this is of great importance because the evaporation heat is strongly dependent on the Earth’s surface temperature. With an average of 84 W/m², evaporation provides almost 60% of the heat transport from the Earth’s surface towards the upper atmosphere. We know that precipitation on Earth has increased over the last 100 years, and thus transports more heat back to the upper atmosphere, away from the Earth’s surface.
A warming of 1°C increases heat transport due to evaporation back to the upper atmosphere by 7.5%. At 84 W/m², that translates to 6.3 W/m² of additional cooling effect for the Earth’s surface. As we see, evaporation acts as a powerful brake against changes in climate.

Radiation
About 70% of the long-wave radiation from the Earth’s surface is absorbed by the greenhouse gases. Direct radiation from the Earth’s surface into space is about 45 W/m². This value is reduced somewhat by the higher anthropogenic greenhouse effect. A doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration results in a radiation reduction of 4 W/m² (as mentioned earlier).
But radiation intensity is proportional to the 4th power of the absolute temperature. A warming of 1°C translates to 1.4%, or 0.63W/m².
There’s also a feedback from additional water vapour in the air. Using Figure 5 below, water vapor at its current concentration delivers a maximum 8 W/m² of radiative forcing.

Figure 5:  The effect of greenhouse gases on thermal radiiation.
And with 7.5% more water vapor, this yields an additional radiative forcing of 0.6 W/m². Note that Figure 5 shows that effect of various greenhouse gases greatly depends on the spectrum wavelength.
Figure 5 shows that the effect of CO2 as a greenhouse gas is limited to a narrow long-wave range in the neighborhood of 14 microns, and is for the most part saturated.
Also additional water vapor has only a marginal impact.
Convection
As the Earth’s surface temperature rises, warm air travels up and transports heat to the upper atmosphere. Convection provides only about 12% of this outward heat transfer, and thus we will neglect it here.
Tallying it all up
Summary of changes in energy flux resulting from 1°C of warming:
Evaporation: +7.5% = 6.3 W/m²
Convection: (negligible)
Radiation: +1.4% = 0.63 W/m²
Feedback through water vapor: 0.6 W/m²
A warming of 1°C of results in an additional cooling effect of a total of 6.33W/m² because of mechanisms that transport heat away from the Earth’s surface and towards the upper atmosphere.
And we already know that doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration leads to a radiative forcing of only 3.7 W/m², see Figure 6:

Figure 6: Warming as a function of CO2 concentration. Doubling CO2 concentration leads to a radiative warming of 3.7W/m². A 1°C warming leads to a tarnsport mechansim effect of 6.3W/m².
Using Figure 6, the exact value for climate warming is 0.58°C.
How does this figure compare to the current discussion? This figure is in agreement with Lindzen and Choi of MIT [3]. These two scientists quantified the climate sensitivity at 0.5°C using satellite data, i.e. real observations and not dubious computer simulations.
Hermann Harde [4] found a climate sensitivity of 0.62°C using spectroscopic examinations and model calculations.
Conclusion:
The minimal effect of CO2 on climate is not surprising. This is confirmed by both theory and by actual observations and measurements.

"Brazil is experiencing corruption scandals, political turmoil, and its worst recession in decades. Yet for all the chaos in centres of political and financial power, the country’s challenges are perhaps most acute in remote corners of the Amazon. There, a swathe of newly-elected local leaders, empowered by Brazil’s decentralised governance, are struggling to safeguard the health of their citizens as long-term problems are exacerbated by recent drastic public spending cuts. The “deep” Amazon is now surprisingly urbanised yet its cities are largely invisible in academic and political debates. In the 21st century, it is generally taken for granted that towns and cities are connected by roads. However, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas almost a million people live in dozens of roadless cities of 3,000 to 70,000 residents. These settlements are wholly reliant on rivers. As an extreme example, take Ipixuna, one of the most remote towns in Brazil. Located on a major Amazonian tributary, Ipixuna is an incredible 2,820km by boat from the state capital, Manaus. During the dry season barges transporting fuels and non-perishable foods from Manaus can take more than a month to arrive. Like most Amazonian cities without roads, Ipixuna is extremely poor, socially unequal and has a very limited urban infrastructure.  These cities are increasingly vulnerable due to a combination of under-development and climate change. In Amazonia, people are being hit by increasingly frequent and severe floods and droughts. For instance, residents of Caapiranga, a roadless town much closer to Manaus, told us that river levels reached both record highs and lows in 2015. Much of the town was flooded in May yet by October Caapiranga was cut-off by low water levels. Remote Amazonas cities are guardians of almost one million square kilometers of rainforest. Yet despite global interest in developing the green economy, tourism is still unheard of even in a place like Ipixuna with 98% of its surrounding forest intact and a rich indigenous culture. That Ipixuna lags behind wealthier parts of Brazil is unsurprising, but it’s more of a shock to discover that its Human Development Index (HDI) is equivalent to that of Uganda. All Brazilians are guaranteed healthcare as a constitutional right, delivered through a universal and free health system. However, preventable problems like diarrhoea or malnutrition mean Amazonas’s life expectancy and infant mortality are among Brazil’s worst. Chronic staff shortages are exacerbated in roadless areas as health teams often travel days by boat to reach rural communities.  Tackling these problems requires investment in basic sanitation. Access to clean water is essential for preventing waterborne diseases, yet in the majority of municipalities in Amazonas, household water is untreated. In Ipixuna, for example, only 3% of urban households have adequate sanitation. Environmental health is often not taken seriously by local government: “The neighbour built his pit-toilet at the side of my kitchen,” said one Ipixuna resident we interviewed. “When it rains a lot, it overflows. My small children play outside so I have complained many times to the council, but nothing was done.” These places and people are invisible to policy-makers. After all the Amazonas state government in Manaus can be days away, never mind the national capital in Brasilia. The local political elite are often the descendants of former rubber barons or similar. Many health bureaucrats are nepotistic or political appointments, and rarely have any specialist healthcare background. Most roadless municipalities lack a team of permanent doctors and instead rely on short-term hires that may spread their time between multiple places.  As the remoteness of these cities makes public auditing and financial scrutiny more complicated, the region breeds a sense of impunity. Three mayors were recently arrested on corruption charges, while 30 municipalities are being investigated for embezzlement. For example, $R15 million (US$4.7m) was recently stolen from the health and education budgets in Pauini, a roadless municipality of 19,000 people ten days by boat from Manaus. To improve healthcare in these places, authorities could start by investing time and energy in primary care through Brazil’s existing Family Health Strategy, which promotes prevention, recovery and rehabilitation. This can prevent more serious conditions requiring costly air-evacuation for hospital treatment, which is already under threat. Mayors should also engage with changing health threats, including emerging chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, and the “old” diseases like malaria, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis. Where is the outcry about ill-health and neglect in Amazonia’s forgotten cities? Until now, interest in Amazonian governance – nationally or internationally – has been dominated by environmental debates. There have been rural investments in sustainable development reserves but a shortage of new ideas to solve urban problems. Each new mayor has the opportunity to create a political and institutional environment conducive to improving the living conditions of citizens, ensuring the basic right to health. These long-neglected cities in the Amazon rainforest, however charming, deserve better."
"The world’s biggest fossil fuel companies must take action on climate change or their directors could face being voted out of their jobs, the head of one of the world’s leading asset managers has warned. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Ron O’Hanley, the chief executive of State Street, said his firm could consider taking the radical step of voting against the reappointment of entire company boards if they were not taking sufficient action to deal with the climate crisis. While it would be “very dangerous” to vote out directors without reason, he said State Street could resort to the measure if it judged company managers were not reacting to the risks climate change posed to their business model or engaging with the transition away from oil, gas and coal. With fossil fuel companies under increasing pressure to tackle the climate emergency, O’Hanley’s remarks could signal a new attitude by asset managers, who are also under growing pressure to behave responsibly. State Street is a Boston-based money manager that oversees stocks, bonds and other financial assets worth $2.2tn (£1.8tn) for pension schemes, university endowments and insurance companies. It is the third largest manager in the world behind BlackRock and Vanguard. Together they are known as the big three. State Street handles investments worth at least $38.3bn in publicly listed fossil fuel companies, according to an analysis for the Guardian by InfluenceMap. Its stakes afford it a say on company directors, as well shareholder decisions on improving emissions disclosures and ensuring companies are aligned with the Paris agreement. The State Street boss pointed to its “aggressive” historical voting record on issues such as gender diversity on boards, and suggested climate change could become a priority, but refused to give a defined timescale. Large asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard have faced criticism for routinely voting against efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures, appointing board directors to deal with climate-related business risk and publishing substantive emissions data. State Street’s record is mixed, although O’Hanley’s comments could signal an escalation in the firm’s approach. “If we conclude that a company’s board is not taking into account these risks then we will either vote all the board out or we’ll use our vote against the board or we’ll use it against individuals on the board that we think should be acting and aren’t,” he said. “So it could be against the company chairman, against the head of the risk committee, but that is our strongest tool, our vote. And it’s a powerful tool because although it only takes a majority for someone to be voted in, typically if a significant minority has voted against a particular individual on the board that’s generally taken as a lack of confidence and that will cause the person to leave, so these votes are important. It’s a high responsibility and we understand that.“ Large asset managers, who do not own companies but exercise shareholder powers on behalf of clients, are uniquely positioned to hold the boards of oil and gas companies to account on the climate crisis and ensure a green energy transition. O’Hanley told the Guardian that State Street preferred to discuss politically sensitive corporate governance issues such as the climate crisis, background checks on gun purchases in the US and board diversity in private with companies at first, opting to use its voting power as a last resort to demand action. He added: “Our work doesn’t revolve just around the vote. I mean at this moment, now, the entire team is out engaging with our various portfolio companies. They do this all day every day and they’re, on a company-by-company basis, developing a perspective on whether or not the board has this. “But I think it’s very dangerous to just say that every oil and gas company ought to have its board voted out. I mean … Put it this way, some of the best technology that’s going to get us through this is actually coming from oil and gas companies, right, if you look at what some of them are doing on renewables. “Carbon capture, the leading carbon capture technology at the moment is Occidental [Petroleum]. Without Occidental, society wouldn’t be as far along as it is on carbon capture. It’s not as easy as saying let’s just vote the whole lot out.” Negative emissions technology such as carbon capture has been put forward by the oil and gas industry as a solution to the climate crisis, but there is widespread scepticism about its long-term viability. Pushed on when State Street would start using its vote more aggressively, O’Hanley said: “We engage as investment analysts do with each of the companies, determine where they are in dealing with this risk and overseeing this risk. And if our conclusion is they’re not then we will take a vote, but we don’t have a quota of votes. “It could be very much in the next season, it could be in 15 years we’re voting out people.” The asset management veteran also agreed that the industry must do more to improve disclosures around green and sustainable investing. Asked why State Street offered some fossil-fuel-free investment funds that had clear exposure to the fossil fuel industry, O’Hanley said his company was working hard to improve information about so-called environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) investing, the acronym used for green investing. “One person’s ESG isn’t another person’s ESG. Part of this comes down to definitions and again, we would completely agree with you that there needs to be some kind of measurement here. We’re working quite hard on that. We’re working with some of the largest index providers in the world and you will see us announcing a few tools in a very short time frame that will help address that very problem that you’re stating,” O’Hanley said."
"A Labour government will aim to end the sale of cars with internal combustion engines by 2030, as part of its plans to tackle the climate emergency. The party is to begin talks with the car industry and trade unions to explore the policies needed to achieve the goal. It says it wants to help an “under siege” industry switch to electric car production.  It comes as measures to phase out the internal combustion engine gathering pace across Europe. Earlier this month, Denmark called for a plan to phase out diesel and petrol cars and allow a ban on their sale by 2030. It was backed by 10 other EU countries. Labour has already pledged to provide £3bn to invest in electric car models and technology. It will exempt new investment in plant and machinery from business rates. Another £2bn will go towards the construction of three battery plants. The internal combustion engine policy comes after Labour’s annual conference last month voted for the UK to have a net-zero carbon target by 2030 – a target that senior party figures deem impossible to achieve. The measure is unlikely to make it into Labour’s next manifesto, but it is setting out an ambitious plan to combat the climate emergency. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “The automotive sector is one of the UK’s industrial success stories. However, the sector is under siege from Brexit uncertainty and the Tory party’s lack of ambition on electrification. “At the same time, we need to accelerate the shift away from fossil-powered cars if we’re to tackle the climate emergency. If we want our automotive sector to flourish, we need a government who is not afraid to intervene. “It’s vital that we work alongside unions to create a plan for a just transition for workers employed in the automotive sector.”"
"Air miles schemes should be axed as they encourage jet-setters to take extra flights in a bid to maintain “privileged traveller status”, according to a report commissioned by the government’s climate change advisers. An “escalating Air Miles Levy” should also be introduced to rein in the number of trips taken by frequent flyers without penalising those taking an annual holiday, with the income raised to be invested into low-carbon aviation technology.  The recommendations, contained in a report commissioned by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), are aimed at restricting the 15% of the UK population it said were responsible for taking 70% of flights. By comparison, half the country does not fly at all in a given year. “The norm of unlimited flying being acceptable needs to be challenged and, as a very highly polluting luxury, it is suitable to taxation,” the report read. It adds that those who pollute most “could easily afford to pay more”. It is estimated there are hundreds of frequent flyer schemes operating worldwide and so the ban would likely affect millions of customers. “Introducing restrictions to ‘all-you-can-fly’ passes and loyalty schemes which offer air miles would remove incentives to excessive or stimulated flying,” the report states. Another policy suggestion calls on aviation companies to advertise their emissions in an easy-to-understand manner, for example as a proportion of an average annual household’s output, so that customers could make informed decisions. The report, by Dr Richard Carmichael of Imperial College London, goes beyond aviation policies to consider a range of other lifestyle changes the public must make to tackle the climate crisis. These include reduce meat and diary consumption, trading cars for bikes, and swapping gas boilers at home for electric alternatives. Surface transport accounts for the biggest proportion of a household’s carbon footprint at 34%, followed by diet (30%), home heating (21%) and aviation (12%). Regulations should be introduced to require all schools to offer pupils at least one plant-based meal option and food packaging should display a “traffic light” system indicating its carbon footprint. Domestic travel recommendations include dropping prices on intercity rail services to reduce demand for cars and planes, and re-opening disused rail lines. The report also recommends VAT on the installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems be removed. The UK is the world’s first major economy to legally commit to becoming carbon-neutral by 2050."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis summer in Western Europe has been a cool and wet one. People are now wondering about all those model projections calling for blast-furnace summers accompanied by killer droughts, which the media have been warning us about year after year.
Not to worry, says meteorologist Mario Slongo, former weather expert for DRS 1; they are surely coming. He adds that the cool, wet weather we are experiencing is completely normal. Yes, with man-made climate change, all you need is faith. Just believe it.
The Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung interviews meteorologist Mario Slongo on the greenhouse effect, climate cycles and misconceptions.
If Slongo confirms anything in the interview, it is that AGW and man-made climate change are indeed religious belief. The NZZ asks: “Have extreme weather conditions generally increased?” Slongo answers (my emphasis):
Yes, the tendency for weather patterns that favor storms has increased, even if this cannot be confirmed statistically. But many other factors impact our weather. For example, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pressure fluctuation between the Azore’s High and Iceland Low. This pressure difference is continuously changing and will soon bring dry and soon very wet weather.”
Firstly, you can’t claim something surely exists if you can’t observe it. There’s a reason why it cannot be “statistically confirmed”…like maybe because it isn’t there in the first place! Models are not reality, Mr Slongo. They are digital fantasy.
Secondly, the climate models, on which our duped, drugged-up-on-green policymakers have based so many political decisions, should have taken the NAO (and all the other factors) into account before basing all the nutty climate projections for Europe solely on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Modellers would have saved themselves lots of embarrassment.

German summers defy model projections – cooling instead of warming
In another story, reader Josef Kowatsch now shows us that German summers have not only gotten wetter, but have also gotten cooler thus completely contradicting the “unquestionable” forecasts made by the “sophisticated” models of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
Here’s the chart Mr. Kowatsch sent me by e-mail, one that the press refuses to acknowledge:

Summer temperatures JJA in Germany over the last 15 years. Temperatures have been falling over the last decade. Chart based on data from the DWD German Weather Service.
The linear trend for the summer over the last 15 years is constant at 17.4 °C. After this summer it will decline slightly, as the polynomial curve continues downwards after 2011.
In the vocabulary of climate science, one thing is becoming very clear: “accelerating” means “disappearing”.

"Four Tasmanians aged in their late 70s are among a swag of climate activists charged over a protest in Launceston. About 100 people attended the Extinction Rebellion protest in Launceston on Friday and police say most were well-behaved, but nine refused to move on when the demonstration’s permitted time ran out.  The group of nine was arrested and each person was charged with failing to comply with a police officer’s directions. They included two 77-year-old men, two 77-year-old women, a 33-year-old women and another three men aged 63, 64, 65 and 69. Extinction Rebellion has been leading a week-long series of protests in major cities to raise awareness about climate change as part of a campaign to force Australian governments to declare a climate emergency. Their activities have included locking themselves to concrete objects and fences and glueing themselves to roads. In Melbourne on Saturday, hundreds of activists stripped down to their underwear or less and marched through the city for the Extinction Rebellion “nudie parade”, which organisers said symbolised the world’s vulnerability and the need for leaders to take greater action to address the climate crisis. Many participants wrote messages on their bodies, from “respect existence, respect resistance” to “business as usual kills”. On Friday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, resumed his attack on Extinction Rebellion activists, branding them “radicals” and “outliers”. “They do their cause more harm than good,” he told Nine Network on Friday. “They are, frankly, just thumbing their nose at Australians who want to work, run their businesses [and] don’t want to be disrupted by these people.” Dutton again raised the prospect of charging protesters acting without permits for the cost of the police response. “When you are acting outside of the law, which these people are doing, you are diverting valuable police resources,” he said. “I think there should be a price to pay for that,” he said. On Thursday, Labor members from inner-Brisbane unanimously passed a resolution condemning the mass arrests of climate activists and describing the Queensland government’s proposed crackdown as “eerily reminiscent” of the state’s authoritarian Bjelke-Petersen era. The Tasmanian protesters will appear at the Launceston magistrates court at a later date."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce again German Professor Hans-Joachim (John) Schellnhuber is calling for limiting democracy and transfering policy-making power to a wiser, elite group of scientists.
Dr. Peter Heller here examines the answers given by Schellnhuber in a recent interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) and then tells us why Schellnhuber’s power-grab will fail.
===============================
Schellnhuber and Ruling the World
 by Peter Heller
Any fan of Hollywood films following the climate debate knows the objectives of mad scientists: They try to rule the world. With his performance in the FAZ in the run-up to the recent UN-Summit on Sustainability in Rio, Prof. Dr. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber can be ranked along with the likes of Dr. Strangelove and Dr. No:
The role of climate science remains to put the problem-facts on the table and to identify options for appropriate solutions. The role of politics is then to mobilize the will of the citizens with the aim of implementing decisions that are based on science.”
This demonstrates an odd understanding of democracy. Up to now the “will of the citizens” has always arose from the interests of people and were implemented by electing a goverment that abided to that will. But Schellnhuber wants to turn this on its head. According to Schellnhuber, politics should now tell the citizens what interests they are to have so that measures that follow those prescribed by science will end up getting implemented.
He leaves no doubt about which targets he is pursuing:
What is certain is that we do not only need relative objectives, but also absolute guardrails. And that means for example, as before, 450 ppm of CO2 is to be the maximum if global warming is to be limited to two degrees Celsius. Within these absolute orientation guidelines, the Green Economy can unfold as it likes. I have nothing against economic growth, as long as it does not break through the planetary guardrails.”
Hence, in the future a small group of scientists are to determine which products and ideas we are to use, produce, consume or implement, and which we are not to. A network established and led by Schellnhuber:
As scientists, this time we can deliver our views directly to the centre and convey our message to the official part of the Summit. Just before Rio+20, there’s going to be a ‘Nobel Dialogue’ with about ten Nobel laureates and leading global experts for sustainability. This circle was created through the ‘Nobel Cause’ which we formed in Potsdam in 2007. In order to give science an unmistakable voice of the highest credibility. At Rio 2012 this voice will speak through a memorandum which will be introduced to the round-tables of government leaders and ministers by the representatives of our circle, thus achieving a whole new quality of discourse between scientists and decision-makers.”
Schellnhuber’s idea of rule has a new quality: the dictator acts behind the scenes and no longer provides the possibilities. Instead, he prescribes the limits for development. Governments are not only to act at the executive level, but are also to act as PR and marketing agents for selling these limits to the broader public. The rule of mad scientists thus gets established by the ruled, who then regulate themselves with enthusiasm.
This strategy differs totally from one used by Lex Luthor, or green kobolds. Can it be successful?
Schellnhuber’s approach entails the level of man-made rules, which serve as the framework for social processes. These rules, written and unwritten, impact the interaction between people and their surroundings, from basic law, to civil code, and extending to municipal regulations for importing anything, such as dental braces from a Romanian manufacturer. They form a network of regulation that cover and run our lives. They are often are not helpful, but without them not much would likely function. Therefore, one may ask: aren’t legistlative committees the power that form our society?
Not by any means.

This is because the political level functions only within the higher and superior level of economics. People break or bend laws mostly when it makes economic sense. If politics obstructs the free economy, the former always fails and the latter emerges as the winner. Over the long-term, laws can be successful only if they take the decisive forces of trade into account instead or working against them. Sectors such as prostitution, pornography, arms, narcotics and gambling are combatted based on moral notions – in all cultures, societal systems and states by using a variety of regulations, control mechanisms and outright bans. However, they still remain enduring and profitable.
Many apostles of sustanability in Club Schellnhuber have recognized the primacy of economics. They believe that people can be swayed by ethical arguments to behave irrationally with respect to economy, and be convinced to even forego the benefits of burning crude oil, natural gas, and coal.
But calls to do this are ineffective and fail time after time. Economics are also subject to a superior force: biology. The “economic human” in all of us gets disabled only when our natural, evolutionary drives take over. Ultimately the desire for material prosperity is an expression of these drives: greed. It is an instinct important for survival in the competition for resources among species. Aggression, fear, and natural sex drive are other factors. People who are controlled by these emotions make bad business transactions.
That’s the reason why fear plays such a large role in the climate debate, and has a much larger effect than moral platitudes. Fear brings people out onto the street against new infrastructure projects, nuclear and coal power plants. So it is no surprise that generating fear is at the top of the alarmists’ agenda.
But such propaganda can be successful only over the short-term. That is because there is an ultimate ruler of human civilzation: technology.
It can for example control our biological instincts in a variety of ways. Just think of the trickery employed by an ad to get the customer to make a purchase. Think of psycho-phramceuticals and designer drugs. Foremost they act to free us from fear because they protect people better and better from all dangers.
Relevant in the climate debate is the increasing invulnerability with respect to destructive natural phenomena. When people live in stone houses, are protected by dikes, stock food, and maintain a stable supply of potable water, warnings of the risks of a climate catastrophe lose their effect. Just how dangerous can droughts be when gene-improved plants made to resist droughts are used in agriculture?
Also relevant in the climate debate is the increased access to the plentiful reserves and deposits of carbon-based fossil fuels. It is not desperation and shortage that drive the oil and gas industry to drill offshore at extreme depths or to do fracking. It is technical progress that transforms inaccessible resources into marketable reserves. Technology does not break through barriers because it is necessary; it does so because it is possible. Possibility is the mother of invention.
The physical laws of the universe make up the framework for biological evolution on Earth. On the basis of these natural laws, technical systems are created, which can fulfill far more tasks far more efficiently than what is possible by life forms that are mercilessly trimmed by effective reproduction. Today technology sets down the framework conditions for human societies – not nature. It determines the relevance of human biological instincts. It determines how to run business and how it is to be conducted. It also determines how human societies are to organize themselves. Civilization is a consequence of technology, and not its source. It began with fire, ancient empires with agriculture, and alphabet. The Middle Ages brought on wind mills and water wheels. The printing of books led to enlightenment, the steam engine led to the abolishment of slavery. Today the Internet is a threat to the world’s rulers. It’s always been progress in the necessary fields of health and nutrition, energy, mobility and communcation which have led to breakthroughs.
The primacy of technology over biology, economics and politics closes Schellnhuber’s path to grabbing power. He can go on whispering his ideas to governments, but here he is dealing precisely with the group of people who have the least possibility to configure anything. Emissions trading, carbon taxes, emission limits and subsidies for green energies will remain ineffective tools because they involve only the lower levels of the law. This is now obvious after more than 20 years of climate policy – global CO2 emissions have steadily climbed. Any time someone attempts to use legislation to override the principles of economic processes, biological factors and technical innovation, they fail. You can sometimes slow things down, but you will never stop them. Except for some frictional losses, there will be no detectable effects in the end.  Ultimately, technology will push away Schellnhuber’s guardrails far beyond the horizons. Whether the notions of climate and environmental catastrophe, species extinction and resource shortages are justified or not, the coming generations will only laugh at the irrelevance of these end-of-world fantasies.
If he is truly trying to achieve global rule, then the Professor from Potsdam has probably seen too many Hollywood films in which mad scientists tried to do just that. But Schellnhuber has even failed to understand the films, as every villain worked at the top and employed technical innovation instead of authoring papers and roadmaps for governments. Schellnhuber is not only giving his employers the wrong recommendations, he is not even delivering anything useful for a credible Hollywood script.
Remark: Although I’ve been following the described above world-model for quite some time, the concrete idea for this text was provided by an especially interesting and informative presentation by Prof. Adrian Bowyer, who revealed to me and other members of the audience his plan for ruling the world as a “mad scientist” by using self duplicating 3D printers.

" As Extinction Rebellion protesters bring Whitehall to a halt, one of their three demands is for the UK government to cede control of climate policy to a citizens’ assembly. They are not alone: Camden council in London is already experimenting with a similar approach. And Camden’s move comes as councils across the country grapple with how to work with residents to make bold decisions and tackle the climate crisis. At least 11 councils are now using citizens’ assemblies to drive climate action, including Devon, Dudley, Cambridge and Test Valley.  But will it work? Analysis by Friends of the Earth says Camden is already the best-performing London borough on the climate crisis, and one of the best local authorities in England and Wales. This week the Labour-run council unanimously accepted the 17-point action plan drawn up by a citizens’ assembly. As well as easy goals such as encouraging local people to eat low-carbon food and “make CO2 reduction fun”, it includes bold proposals such as making all new homes zero-carbon, piloting a community energy scheme and making all council properties fossil-free. But citizens’ assemblies are fraught with danger for councils if they blunder in without thinking through what they are unleashing. Allow the assembly to charge towards the revolutionary end of the climate emergency and it will either raise expectations that can never be fulfilled or alienate other local people by presenting them with intolerable options. Exert too much control and it will stifle creativity and lose credibility. So far, Camden has got several things right – but the hard part is ahead. Working with public participation charity Involve, the council assembled 50 residents over the summer, randomly selected to reflect the borough’s demographic profile. Crucially, people could not volunteer, so the assembly could not be dominated by activists or political groups. Their job was to recommend action to be taken by residents, community groups, businesses and the council to tackle the climate crisis. The event was organised by council staff but overseen by an expert advisory panel, who ensured citizens had the information they needed. Camden has already set a goal of being carbon neutral by 2030 and has a strong culture of community consultation, so officers and councillors may have felt more confident than other places about letting the public lead.  Of course, the assembly was not forced to make the tough choices that will face councillors down the line, such as deciding the trade-off between an energy scheme and a library. The aim was to ensure the decision-making processes were rigorous and thoughtful enough to weed out the impossible while keeping the ambitious. For the moment, then, Camden has a credible set of goals, at least a few motivated residents, lively debate and cross-party support for action. But over the coming months the council will have to channel this enthusiasm into deciding what will appear in its climate action plan next year.  This part of the process will live or die by the quality of the engagement with local people. The council will have to grapple with everything from the level of disruption that council tenants will tolerate to make their homes fossil fuel free to whether action on climate breakdown seems like a distraction from social problems such as the borough’s shocking level of knife crime. And what council tax increase will local people be willing to pay? The way forward is obviously to thread climate change policies through every area of work. Closing roads will make streets safer and air cleaner for children. Putting more green spaces on residential streets will encourage people to drive less and walk more. Electric vehicle charging points will reduce air and noise pollution. Camden and the other councils experimenting with citizens’ assemblies should be applauded for thinking big, ceding some political power and taking risks. As central government procrastinates, local government needs to take the lead. • Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst "

Troposphere and Sea Surface Temperature: 18 Years With No Trend 
Guest post by Frank Bosse
There’s a heated debate going on concerning the trend of non-rising global temperatures CRU (HadCRUT4) for the last 16 years.
In 2011, a paper authored by Ben Santer and colleagues described that at least a 17-year trend is needed to identify the human impact on the mean temperature of the troposphere. The paper’s summary:
Our results show that temperature records of at least 17 years in length are required for identifying human effects on global-mean tropospheric temperature.”
This mainly referred to the Temperature Lower Troposphere (TLT):

Source: woodfortrees.org.
This brings us to the issue of auto-correlation, principally how long and how often must the temperature be measured before a significant trend can be established with a sufficient level of confidence. Is the trend positive (and not random) and can it be traced back to a real warming? If it can, then the trend is said to be significant. In statistics we can say that a 95% confidence interval means that the trend must be 95% real trend, and only 5% random.
There are statistical tests available to show whether the measurements are strongly dependent on each other or not. The dependency of a measured value on the previous value is called auto-correlation.
In the paper named above, the limit is 17 years. But to be sure, we want to look at the past 18 years, i.e. the months from September 1994 until August 2012, which means 216 measurements. We calculate a 6-month mean value and look to see whether the trend is significant at the 95% confidence level. If that is the case, then both limit values of the trend increase must be positive.  Is this the case?

No!
The mean trend (black) is in fact positive, but it is not significant. The lower (blue) is negative. Thus it is shown when considering auto-correlation that the condition of Santer in his paper hasn’t existed since September, 1994. The temperature of the troposphere has not significantly risen over the last 18 years.
And there’s more. We examine the temperature of the sea surface since 1995, see here:

Source: woodfortrees.org.
We presume that the temperature will persist at its (high) August 2012 level until December because of an announced El Nino (one that will not show up, but we don’t want to be accused of cherry-picking). Here the trend is 0.067 °C per decade, but it is not significantly positive at the 95% confidence level when one uses the annual mean values. Also the temperatures of the entire sea surface have not risen significantly over the last 18 years.
What does it all mean? Does man no longer have an impact on the temperatures of the troposphere and sea surface temperature? With certainty man does have an impact, as he has been emitting CO2. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere since 1995 has risen from 359 ppm to 397 ppm. According to IPCC models, tropospheric and sea surface temperatures should have increased significantly, but they haven’t. Here natural variability, e.g. ENSO, has also played a role. So can CO2 sensitivity be as much as assumed? 3.2°K per doubling of CO2 concentration?
Two contributions from the recent past contradict this: one comes from an examination of the radiation budget when Pinatubo erupted in 1991: a value of 1.4°K, the other comes from an evaluation of the global temperatures and the heat content of the upper 2000 m of water in the ocean (OHC): 1.7°K.
What is the most probable? 3.2°K CO2 climate sensitivity as estimated by the IPCC or 1.6K?
The fulfillment of the famous Santer Postulate for the temperatures of the troposphere and sea surface temperature speaks for the latter estimate. This leads us to the final assumption made in Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s book “Die kalte Sonne”: The man-made share of warming likely is only half as much as what is assumed by the IPCC.
==============================
Note: That the warming is only half-caused by man is also claimed by German climate scientist Mojib Latif, who repeatedly attacked Vahrenholt and Lüning – just because they agree with his claim!

"There are few more pressing 21st-century issues than the threat to the world’s natural environment. Yet how can we halt the loss of wildlife across the Earth? How can we balance economic development and population growth against ecological concerns? In The Moth Snowstorm, one of Britain’s leading environmental writers, the journalist Michael McCarthy, presents a timely reminder of the state of the destruction of the natural world.  The Moth Snowstorm has just been published in the US – and it is worth remembering the impact Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring had on its release back in 1962. Carson’s book opened our eyes to the damage that agrochemicals such as DDT, dieldrin and aldrin were inflicting on wildlife populations. In the US, public outrage following Carson’s work directly influenced the banning of DDT in 1972. In Britain, nature writing has seen a dramatic surge in interest in recent years – Nielsen Bookscan indicates that sales figures in the category “animal and wildlife” rose from 426,630 books in 2012 to 663,575 books in 2015.  Poignant memoir often now serves to ground tales of the natural world. Recent successes such as Helen Macdonald’s H is for Hawk, James Rebanks’ The Shepherd’s Life and Amy Liptrot’s The Outrun have all offered vital and often visceral insights into the author’s personal lives and battles.  In The Moth Snowstorm, McCarthy gives an equally affecting private backdrop to individualise his tale. He dedicates the book to the memory of his mother Norah and frames the work around his mother’s mental breakdown in the early 1950s when McCarthy and his brother John were young boys. At the time, McCarthy found solace in nature. He still does.  But the wildlife population of Britain has halved in his lifetime, he tells us: “This was the great thinning”. We need such statistics to see the extent of ecological destruction wrought through the second half of the 20th century. Yet as Homo sapiens – “Earth’s problem child” – we so often seem to sit apparently impotent and useless in our response. McCarthy’s love of his home turf of the Dee estuary, near Liverpool, is detailed and contrasted against the example of the far vaster tidal flats of the Yellow Sea at Saemangeum in South Korea, once home to millions of migrant birds, now a “deadscape” of unused, reclaimed land measuring 40,000ha enclosed in a wall 33km long.  McCarthy peers spellbound at the satellite photo on Google Maps – at the “thin white line in the sea” of the wall. The entire estuary has gone. “Extinguished. Rubbed out. The whole thing”. The emotive thump of those three short, stepped sentences – one word, two words, three words long – is typical of McCarthy’s powerfully effective style. To have experienced the actual occurrence of a moth snowstorm in Britain, you need to be at least 50 years old or so – for the term refers to the effect whereby, as McCarthy writes: The headlight beams of a speeding car on a muggy summer’s night in the countryside, turn[ed] the moths into snowflakes [that] plastered the headlights and the windscreen until driving became impossible, and you had to stop the car to wipe the glass surfaces clean. For those who have known such sights, it is a poignant and vibrant memory of the abundance of insect life that once filled the night. But moments like those are now gone. Blizzards of insects are a thing of the past. So how can these rose-tinted instances of nostalgia serve us? McCarthy’s answer is simple. We must learn to recognise such losses to our wildlife populations yet see too that “our bond with nature” is unbreakable. McCarthy’s own memoir of loss, emotional torpor and eventual recovery exemplifies the deep peace we can all experience by seeking joy and wonder in the natural world. His tale is told with heart-rending honesty. Only our “belief in nature’s worth” is going to save the world’s green places and its wildlife. We must learn to recognise our “ancient bond with the natural world”.  We must remember to celebrate that eternal tie by observing and glorifying those natural phenomena that seem most wonderful to us as individuals – be they the spectacle of a clump of snowdrops, the inscape of magnolia or bluebell flowers, or the sight of a mad March hare. This is the vital message of The Moth Snowstorm. McCarthy’s words ring out as a rallying cry which is not only a delight to hear but one we should all seek to follow. Books really can change the world. Here’s hoping that McCarthy’s The Moth Snowstorm, like Carson’s Silent Spring, is one such work that truly starts to make the world’s human population shift the way we see, experience and act towards the remaining wildlife that we share this planet with."

EIKE is having an impact! German foundation report bemoans the founding of EIKE in 2007. One of the “biggest setbacks for climate policy”
By Dr. Holger Thuss, EIKE
This is curious: In the recently issued Foundation Report 2011/12 (here) of the ‘Federal Association of German Foundations’ on the topic of ‘Sustainability Mission: How Foundations Protect The Climate’, we find a chart on page 16 and 17 showing the progress and ‘political setbacks’ in so-called climate protection. For example the founding of ‘Greenpeace’ in the upper, lighter part of the chart is shown as progress and as a ‘catalyst for society’. (Google view here).

EIKE is designated as a setback for climate policy by Green foundations.
On the other hand, in the lower, dark-gray shaded area of the chart, one finds the setbacks and catastrophes: ‘long lasting pesticides’, the completely made up ‘acid rain’, the Bhopal accident, the ozone hole and many others . For the recent past, forest fires in Russia, various floods and all the failed UN summits are given. Also ClimateGate, which exposed the political intrigue of so-called climate scientists, is also shown in the gray area of setbacks.
And there is one single organisation that gets mentioned (in the light gray box) in the dark side of the chart along with all the political follies and catastrophes, real or made up. it is the:

European Institute for Climate and Energy
On page 118 the cooperation between EIKE and the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation for Liberty in 2009 is also mentioned: The Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation for Liberty is close to the German Free Democrat Party (FDP) and is ‘clearly positioned’ the report writes with a menacing tone. The report also suggests that EIKE is tied to the ‘energy-intensive industries.’ That’s an allegation that is not true. A list of German foundations with multi-million dollar budgets that are close to political parties on the same page suggests that the support from the Friedrich Naumann Foundation involves large sums of money – a classic propaganda trick by professional Green propagandists! This diverts attention away from the billions of euros that other foundations are swimming in (see below) in order to implement their public re-education programs.
Also the choice of words and footnotes show that the report’s authors rely on the fighters for Good and Truth who happen to rely on large corporations or their foundations for assistance. But only when it is absolutely necessary, of course.
‘Partner of cooperation’ for this green piece of propaganda, by the way, were the German Federal Foundation for the Environment (DBU), BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, the Robert Bosch Foundation and the Baden Württemberg Foundation. All these foundations can thank their existence on the industries which they are calling to be abolished. Even the DBU received an endowment of 1.3 billion euros, which came partly from the sale of the state-owned Salzgitter AG. The Baden-Württemberg Foundation has an endowment of €2.4 billion.
What’s especially baffling is why the foundation of a renowned automobile company is involved in a campaign related to the “Great Transformation“, which promotes the abolishment of individual mobility. In doing so, BMW is happily sawing the limb on which the company is sitting on.

"Oslo’s city government has issued an ambitious “climate budget” with the intent of halving its carbon emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, and becoming completely carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, the city plans to limit access for cars with new tolls and fewer parking spaces, power the bus fleet with renewable energy, increase cycle use and eliminate heating with fossil fuels in homes and offices.  The move comes at a time when cities are taking on a more important role in addressing the issue of climate change. Globally, cities are thought to be responsible for roughly 75% of human-sourced carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, because urban populations still depend largely on fossil fuels to generate energy. Since CO₂ is the chief greenhouse gas, cities are considered to be key drivers of global climate change. Yet cities are also uniquely well-placed to address this issue; most cities have their own planning systems, which can be used to manage the local economy and the urban landscape (that is, land-cover and land-use), in order to regulate energy use.  Until relatively recently, policies to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions were administered at a national level, to ensure compliance with international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement. But over the last decade, cities have started to play a bigger role in global efforts to tackle climate change.  This is evident in initiatives such as the Global Compact of Mayors, of which Oslo is a member. The compact – founded by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2014 – is a coalition of cities and local governments that are voluntarily taking action to combat climate change and move toward a more resilient, low-carbon society.  To come up with effective policies for reducing emissions, cities first need a way to inventory their energy use. To that end, the compact has created a protocol that classifies energy use into six main sectors: stationary (for example, building construction and use); transportation; waste; industrial processes and product use; agriculture, forestry, and other land use and any other emissions occurring outside the boundary as a result of city activities.  These categories account for the greenhouse gas emissions associated with burning coal, gas, oil and so on. But they also take stock of the gases that are taken out of the atmosphere by plantations and forests, for example.  Completing a greenhouse gas inventory using the protocol can guide urban policies to reflect the character of a city. For example, cities in cold climates use more gas and electricity to heat buildings in winter, while low-density cities generally dedicate more energy to transportation, and cities with a strong industrial base expend energy on manufacturing. Becoming carbon neutral means reducing or even eliminating fossil fuel use, reducing landfill waste and offsetting any remaining emissions. Typically, the strategies involve incorporating aspects of technology (such as renewable energy generation), design (for instance, making cities more compact) and behaviour (for example, shifting commuters from private to public modes of transport).  In the case of Oslo, its population of about 650,000 people emits roughly 1.34m tonnes of CO₂ per year, with much of this energy expended to meet building and transportation needs. While the plan to reduce emissions to zero is very ambitious, it’s worth keeping in mind that Norway already generates the majority of its electricity using hydropower.  This gives Oslo options that other cities may not have. For example, adding to the electric car fleet is a common policy in many cities concerned about air quality and greenhouse emissions. But if the electricity is produced by fossil fuels, then electric cars simply shift the creation of greenhouse gases from moving transport to stationary charging points.  Likewise, most of Oslo’s homes are heated with electricity generated from hydropower, and by burning wood pellets, which are also considered to be a renewable fuel. Here, the challenge is to make homes more efficient, and to ensure that more fuel for direct and indirect heating comes from renewable sources.  There is much to be learned from Oslo’s progress; in particular, it highlights the need for tailored policies and plans, to address the unique emission profile of each city. Yet the city will still need to overcome significant barriers, to become carbon neutral by 2030. In particular, it will need to offset any residual emissions through forestation, or by actively capturing carbon at the source.  Yet Oslo’s carbon budget raises the stakes for other cities which are working to combat climate change. The greenhouse gas protocol provides a consistent, transparent and internationally recognised approach for cities to measure and report emissions, allowing for credible comparison – and a little healthy competition – between urban areas across the globe."
"Looking deep into outer space begs an obvious question. Are we alone? Does intelligent life exist elsewhere? It is a question that has preoccupied mankind ever since we became capable of rational thought. But space exploration could also hold clues to questions that have only struck us in recent decades, with the gradual awareness that carbon dioxide emissions are changing our own planet’s climate. A situation that, if unabated, could lead to an “extinction level” event. This awareness coincided with the discovery of the first planet – or “exoplanet” – outside our own solar system. And we have now discovered thousands more. Such exoplanets are incredibly diverse, but as many as two billion of them, within our galaxy, may be similar in size to Earth, and orbiting a star similar to our sun. The study of these exoplanets has moved from an era of simple detection to one of detailed characterisation. For some, we even have information about their atmospheric temperatures, compositions, cloudiness and wind speeds. For now, these techniques are constrained to a sub-class of exoplanets termed “hot Jupiters”, large, Jupiter-sized planets, orbiting very close to their parent stars. Combining these observations with adapted Earth climate models has begun to provide information on subjects including the planets’ unexpected size, and the varying efficiency of how their atmospheric winds redistribute heat.  Fascinating as these puzzles are, however, the natural focus for me is to look towards smaller, more Earth-like planets. I have always been interested in combining the study of exoplanet climatology with that of Earth climate science, which draws me back to the question of life on another world. To keep things simple, we define a planet as being potentially life-harbouring in a very simple, Earth-centric way. Does it have a temperature range where liquid water, so fundamental to life here on Earth, could exist? This defines the “habitable zone”, a region around a star where the light received by the planet is neither so strong that it leads to total evaporation, nor so weak that it would lead to freezing of any water.  Of course, the details of how much water might be present and the actual planetary temperatures for a given amount of starlight are complex. We know in our own Solar system that the Earth, Venus and Mars are not extremely dissimilar in size, or in the amount of light they receive from the sun.  However, Venus is completely desiccated and very hot, whereas the water content of Mars is believed to be frozen at the poles.  Additionally, the earliest evidence of life on Earth dates from about three billion years ago, during the Archean period. During this time, the sun was much smaller and fainter than it is today, as sun-like stars expand over time.  The sun will continue to expand, and in a few billion years this is likely to lead to the total evaporation of the water from Earth. So if we are to predict whether complex life might be present on an exoplanet, we must understand the reasons why Venus, Earth and Mars diverged in their evolution, how the Earth stayed “habitable” during the evolution of life, and when it might become uninhabitable.  Of course, life itself affects the environment around it, and there is significant evidence that life itself increased the “habitability” of Earth. This leads us to the next element in the search for intelligent life: a biosignature, a substance which provides evidence that life does, or did once, exist. We know that our atmosphere is not in chemical balance, largely due to chemical emissions from life forms. Potentially, by measuring the balance of the gases in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets, just as we are currently doing for hot Jupiters, we may find a similar imbalance – and a potential signature of extra-terrestrial life. A potentially habitable Earth-like planet has been detected around the sun’s nearest neighbour, a cool, small star called Proxima Centauri. But we don’t yet really understand how its climate will differ from Earth’s given that it is exposed to the radiation from such a cool star. It also seems that photosynthesis, critical to life on Earth, is not likely to work there.  And all of this brings us straight back down to Earth. Currently, despite the fact that a vast number of potentially habitable Earth-like planets exist in our galaxy we know of life existing in only one place: right here.  We now need to to understand in more detail the multitude of various climates that planets can support, and how they evolve over time and with changing conditions.  One of the biggest challenges facing us on our own planet is the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, causing an increase in the variability of our weather systems. As our climate evolves and changes, we must adapt. And this adaptation can only be aided by the lessons learned from forcing our theories, tools and brains to cope with the diversity of climates presented by the exoplanets."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been a long time since I’ve heard such high-grade rubbish. At least not since Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth. Here’s an audio readers really need to listen to.
Download and listen to the full recording of a press conference»
Here we have three scientists doing their darnedest to whip up public fear and panic. Do they realize how they’ve just set themselves up to be classic, textbook science charlatans for future generations to look back at? Can’t they see what laughing stocks they’ve made themselves into? I’m sure we will be playing excerpts of that conference, again and again, for years to come.
I guess they’ve all forgotten the dust bowl of the 1930s, a time when things were a lot worse in North America, and that these things are natural weather occurrences.
Years ago I remember my dad telling us how one winter morning in Vermont in the 1930s he woke up and saw that the snow on the ground was red. Dust had blown all the way to the Northeast. That’s how bad it was. That was when CO2 was below 350 ppm. Forests, etc. weren’t tinder dry back then?

According to the 3 quacks in the audio, the weather problems can be solved simply by stopping CO2 emissions. Boy, what geniuses. It’s that simple and elegant, is it?
And notice how they’re playing the public health card now, their latest mind-job scheme I wrote about awhile back.
https://notrickszone.com/2012/07/04/prepare-for-climate-change-related-public-health-scare-new-paper-exposes-the-warmists-next-mind-games/
This press conference is nothing but an irresponsible state-sponsored public mind-job, all aimed to fan the flames of public hysteria. I’m now convinced these three men are complete bozos and need to be discharged from their duties immediately.
Next month it’ll be hurricanes. And given their current level of hysteria, I can assure you they’re going to make the first hurricane into the end of the world. Is this surreal, or what?

"Donald Trump’s presidency has ushered in an era of unprecedented polarisation between Republican and Democrat lawmakers when it comes to voting on measures to tackle the climate crisis, while the fossil fuel industry now almost entirely favours Republicans in campaign contributions. The two main US political parties regularly voted along the same lines on clean air and clean water provisions in the 1970s but started to diverge in the 1990s. They now occupy opposite ends of the spectrum, according to data collated by the nonpartisan group the League of Conservation Voters (LCV). Amid Trump’s zeal for environmental deregulation and an unfolding climate crisis that is now more divisive than abortion for many Americans, this polarisation is at record levels. Since Trump’s election, Democrats across Congress have voted for pro-environment legislation 92% of the time on average, compared with 5% for Republicans, according to an analysis by LCV. It said 2017 was a particularly extreme year, with Republicans in the Senate voting for environmental protections just 1% of the time. Forty-six Republican senators voted against environmental protections at every single opportunity. “The average scores between parties used to be much closer with a lot of variation depending on regionalism,” said Sara Chieffo, vice-president of government affairs at LCV, which uses a panel of about 20 conservation organisations to score key votes on issues such as global heating, fossil fuel production on public lands and wildlife conservation. “Now it’s hyper-partisan. From 2010 it really accelerated and now we see that the difference has really ballooned.” As recently as George HW Bush’s presidency, Republicans in Congress were voting for environmental protections about one-third of the time on average. That support rapidly ebbed and has virtually vanished under Trump. Meanwhile, Democrats, steered by a base that increasingly sees the climate crisis as an urgent priority, have become far more pro-environment in their voting. The divide has been exacerbated by funding from the fossil fuel industry, which now firmly backs Republicans. Data collected by the transparency group OpenSecrets shows donations from oil and gas interests were split relatively evenly between the parties until the 2000s. By the 2018 election cycle, 87% of industry contributions went to Republicans, with the proportion in the 2020 cycle, which is yet to be completed, reaching a record 89%. Republican lawmakers once led environmental protection in the establishment of national parks and then landmark clean air and water laws in the 1970s, before the Ronald Reagan presidency began a fundamental shift, according to Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard University. “This was linked to a change in Republican thinking, inspired by Reagan, to see the federal government as ‘the problem’ and to roll back federal regulations in a range of domains,” Oreskes said. “Republican leaders in the US do not merely prefer market-based solutions, they refuse even to acknowledge problems that cannot be solved by markets. Climate change is the case in point.” Environmental groups have pointed to the influence of major energy companies, which knew about the dangers of the climate crisis for decades only to fund groups that spread misinformation and denial of the problem, while backing those who helped stymie action. This has helped create an unusual level of denial about the climate science among Republicans, compared with leading political parties in other democracies. “Behind closed doors politicians will tell you they believe in climate change but they are terrified of saying that because they will get primary challenged for their position,” Chieffo said. Polling has shown that younger Republicans are more willing to accept climate science, with many worrying about the climate crisis and the party’s unwillingness to address it. “The Republican party has refused to accept the severity of most environmental issues, including climate change,” said Benji Backer, the president of the American Conservation Coalition, a group of conservatives who support action on the climate crisis. “Instead of being for different environmental policies, many in the GOP have solely become anti-every policy.” Backer said Democrats and environmental groups were also to blame for the divide by supporting policies that “unnecessarily inflate the size of the US government, don’t follow the science and are focused on non-environmental issues”. The Green New Deal, a resolution passed by progressive Democrats that calls for the rapid elimination of planet-warming gases as well as a jobs guarantee, has drawn particular ire from Republicans. Chieffo said the division in Washington was in contrast to the growing public appetite for action on the climate crisis, as well as policies in ostensibly conservative states such as Idaho and South Carolina to bolster renewable energy. “I think we are going to start seeing a greater diversity in voting and a move to sensibility,” she said. “We may well have hit rock bottom. But it’s really too soon to tell.”"
"Formula One racing has been the subject of a massive takeover by US cable tycoon John Malone, driven by the desire to add subscribers to his channels and diversify his holdings. Malone paid US$4.4 billion for a 35% stake, with the remaining interest held by race teams.  One of the new owner’s first tasks is to modernise the sport. To a certain extent, such matters take care of themselves in motor racing. Innovation is constant as different teams compete to take advantage of new rules, aerodynamics, materials and techniques. Formula One is regularly dominated by manufacturers that take their latest cars as close to the margin as possible in terms of performance. But there are two other ways in which the competition needs an upgrade. First, it has an ageing audience, in part due to the previous regime’s distaste for marketing the sport to youth. TV ratings are down everywhere other than the US, which is showing renewed interest. Second, its environmental status remains a problem. In the words of one academic overview of sustainability in sports, motor racing faces “increasing pressure to reduce resource consumption and to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner”. This is hardly a surprise, but in my research on “greenwashed sports” I found some evidence supporting both sides of the debate about race cars and carbon footprints. Formula One is heavily reliant on fossil fuels to build the cars and the circuits, while a race causes lots of local pollution and involves a “major transformation of the landscape wherever it is held”. Back in 2007, each race car emitted around 1.5kg of CO₂ for every kilometre it drove, about nine times that of a family car (more recent data is hard to find). You might expect fast cars to burn lots of fuel of course, and these emissions have been reduced in the years since.  But the racing itself is responsible for just 0.3% of the sport’s carbon emissions, which mostly derive from raw materials, manufacturing, and electricity usage, especially via wind tunnels and computing. In addition, Formula One teams fly 160,000 km a year to test cars and compete. Against that, boosters claim the sport provides regular road cars with a “high-speed research and development laboratory”, as competition between manufacturers spurs advanced engineering and ever-greater fuel efficiency. These innovations are then passed on to everyday business and domestic motoring, supposedly diminishing the carbon footprint of normal traffic. These supposed benefits are often highlighted in conventional press reporting. Some even argue that cyclists are “miles behind Formula 1 in the environmental race” due to the massive impact of travel on events such as the Tour de France, weighed against motor sport’s “cutting-edge technology”. That said, some senior figures in the sport are horrified by changes to emissions regulations that have reduced the noise pollution that some think adds to the atmosphere. Fans complained in unprecedented numbers about the quieter engines that came in 2014 with a mandatory shift from 2.4 litre V8s to 1.6 litre V6 turbo-power units. And regulations in favour of greener practices, such as kinetic energy recovery from braking and thermal energy recovery from emissions, were long delayed because of lobbying by corporate teams. But the McLaren Racing team became a carbon-neutral company in 2011, partly through offsets to counter the amount of flying required, but largely through emissions controls. It recycles two-thirds of its waste, sends nothing to landfill, and has an energy-efficient headquarters at its McLaren Technology Centre, a “smart” building that is warmed by a thermal buffer, cooled by a lake, and roofed with recycled tyres. And in 2014, Formula E for electric vehicles appeared, funded by established racing firms and Leonardo DiCaprio and staffed by escapees from Formula One sickened by its opposition to significant action against climate change. Environmental activists have been largely ineffective in their opposition to the sport, despite mounting some very solid arguments. Greenpeace, one of few environmental organisations large enough to battle Formula One worldwide, has tried to disrupt Grand Prix events through a now-familiar tactic: people dressed up in bright colours climbing onto buildings owned by others. But such practices are not contra the sport itself, nor are they even focused on its environmental record – in fact, Greenpeace has said very positive things about Formula One, and its former executive director is a fan. Rather, they represent a kind of secondary boycott strategy directed at particular event sponsors. Thankfully, major sponsors of Formula One include companies that want to expand sales while cutting carbon emissions, such as Unilever, GSK, and SAP. They have lobbied hard for teams to adapt to ecological reality in the interests of a mutual desire for a social license to operate. The likely outcome is that Formula One will expand its reach under its new owner Malone. Teams will seek efficiency gains for competitive rather than ecological reasons. Activists will complain, if not as noisily as the cars that irk them. And the real carbon footprint of the sport – its air miles – will remain a sideshow."
"Avoiding dangerous global heating will require governments around the world to impose stringent taxes on fossil-fuel usage that will mean a 43% jump in household energy bills over the next decade, the International Monetary Fund has said. The Washington-based Fund said the battle against climate change could only be won if the average carbon tax levied by its member states increased from $2 (£1.63) a ton (907kg) to $75 a ton. The IMF said governments worried about a political backlash against big increases in the cost of heating homes and motoring, and should use the extra revenue raised from the tax to compensate consumers. “To limit global warming to 2C or less – the level deemed safe by science – large emitting countries need to take ambitious action,” IMF economists said. “For example, they should introduce a carbon tax set to rise quickly to $75 a ton in 2030. This would mean household electric bills would go up by 43% cumulatively over the next decade on average – more in countries that still rely heavily on coal in electricity generation, less elsewhere. Gasoline would cost 14% more on average.” Calculations by the IMF’s economists show that a $75-a-ton carbon tax would also lead – once inflation has been taken into account – to an average 214% increase in the cost of coal and a 68% increase in natural gas. For the UK, the increases would be 157% for coal, 51% for natural gas, 43% for electricity and 8% for petrol. Details of the IMF’s call for a much higher carbon tax came in a chapter from the organisation’s biannual fiscal monitor released before its publication next week. “Without substantial mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures are projected to rise by around 4C above preindustrial levels by 2100 (they have already increased by 1C since 1900),” the IMF said. “Global warming causes major damage to the global economy and the natural world and engenders risk of catastrophic and irreversible outcomes such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events (already more frequent) leading to loss of life and the possibility of much higher warming scenarios.” The IMF said it was calling for a substantially higher carbon tax because the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounted for almost two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions and was the most immediately practical to control. But the authors of the fiscal monitor said that without compensation to offset the impact on business and consumers, there was likely to be strong political resistance. The French president Emmanuel Macron’s attempt to cut France’s CO2 emissions through higher fuel prices prompted nationwide protests from the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement. A blog post by the authors to accompany the chapter from the fiscal monitor said global heating was a clear and present threat. Actions to date had fallen short of what was required, and finance ministers needed to play a pivotal role in dealing with the problem. “A better future is possible. Governments will need to increase the price of carbon emissions to give people and firms incentives to reduce energy use and shift to clean energy sources. Carbon taxes are the most powerful and efficient tools, but only if they are implemented in a fair and growth-friendly way. “To make carbon taxes politically feasible and economically efficient, governments need to choose how to use the new revenue. Options include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, increasing investment in green energy or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.” The IMF economists said governments could target financial help directly at workers and communities disproportionately affected by the carbon tax instead of paying a flat-rate dividend to everybody. Restricting compensation to the poorest 40% of households would leave three-quarters of the revenue from the carbon tax for investment in green energy, innovation or to fund the UN’s anti-poverty 2030 sustainable development goals. While about 50 countries currently have a carbon pricing scheme in some form, the IMF said the global average carbon price of $2 a ton was far below what the planet needed. It said other countries could learn from Sweden, which has a carbon tax of $127 per ton and has managed to reduce emissions 25% since 1995, while the economy has expanded by 75%."
"Ten years ago in the United Arab Emirates, a new settlement was started from scratch, with the aim of becoming “the world’s most sustainable city”. Masdar City was designed to be zero-carbon and zero-waste, home to a population of 40,000 people, with an additional 50,000 commuters, in an area of six square kilometres. Today, it’s playing a crucial role in the development of sustainable design and technology.  Around the world, access to a reliable and plentiful energy supply is becoming increasingly critical. Urban populations continue to grow and demand even more energy. At the same time, vital resources such as water are becoming increasingly scarce, and rising levels of CO₂ and a warming global climate are adding to the stress on the Earth’s system.  All of this means that Masdar’s function as a test bed for innovations in fuel efficiency and renewable energy is more important than ever before. As part of a recent study, my colleagues and I took a closer look at the new technology on show in Masdar. Here’s what we found.  The streets and buildings of Masdar City are specially designed to be energy efficient. In line with traditional Arab design, Masdar City’s shaded paths and narrow streets are designed to create a pleasant space for walking in the region’s hot climate. Its buildings are only five stories high, lining narrow streets with rooftops covered with solar panels, while street-level “solar canopies” provide shade for pedestrians.  The entire city is oriented north-east to south-west, to benefit from cool winds at night and to minimise the incoming heat during the day. The main buildings – the Siemens Building, the IRENA Building and the Incubator Building – are highly insulated and energy efficient, with three quarters of their hot water produced using solar energy. They also have angled facades to minimise the amount of glare and heat from the sun. For transport, the city currently uses 13 “personal rapid transit” (PRT) carts, or driverless pods. These ferry commuters from a car park at the city’s outer edge to the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, which uses Masdar as a “living laboratory” to conduct research on sustainable urban development.  There are also a number of electric vehicles available for public use, which run on a 16kWh lithium-ion battery with a maximum speed of 130km per hour. These can be recharged at charging stations throughout the city. Electric buses also provide access for residential areas.  Masdar City is home to some of the most advanced solar energy technology in the world. Perhaps the most ambitious project is SHAMS 1, a stand-alone 2.5km², 100MW Concentrated Solar Power plant. This plant was built about 100km from Masdar, at an estimated cost of US$600m (£453m). It is one of the largest of its type in the world, and displaces 175,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually – equivalent to the emissions of 29,000 UK homes.  The SHAMS 1 plant generates electricity from the sun’s heat. But Masdar City is also supplied by another 0.2km², 10MW solar plant, which uses photovoltaic technology to turn the sun’s light into energy. What’s more, there’s a 1MW photovoltaic panel on the roof of the Masdar Institute, while the solar panels atop the Masdar headquarters generate 340,000kWh per year – enough to power 94 average UK homes. Other initiatives include a solar cooling project to lower the temperature inside buildings, and a geo-thermal cooling project, which involved digging two wells reaching 2.5km deep, one for drawing hot water, and one for re-injecting the water after the heat has been extracted. A 45m-high wind tower in Masdar City takes inspiration from traditional Arab technology. It produces a cooling effect, by directing hot air up and out of its surrounding area, as well as bringing cooler air from above down to the surface. Also, a 100kW thermal power plant is being established, which will convert solar energy into thermal energy through a set of reflective mirrors. Power usage in Masdar City is monitored through one management system, and portrayed through a series of screens inside the buildings. There are no light switches or taps in the city – all of these features are controlled by motion sensors, to prevent waste.  Despite Masdar’s many successes, there is still room for improvement. It needs to establish more permanent residents who can contribute to its growth and development. What’s more, further work is required on transportation, as technology in electric cars has advanced rapidly, and has in some ways superseded the pods.  And while Masdar City has enabled the development of state-of-the-art, energy-saving buildings and exciting new technologies in a hostile, arid environment, not all of the solutions on show would work for other cities. For one thing, it’s costly: the Abu Dhabi government has committed US$15 billion (£11.3 billion) to the project. What’s more, while Masdar City started with an empty site, established cities have to work around existing infrastructure.  Even so, as the global climate changes, warmer summers are expected to become more likely, so any case studies which show how buildings can be modified to mitigate the heat will be useful. In this way, and many more, Masdar City will continue to provide other cities around the world with inspiration to help them become more robust, resilient and sustainable in the face of global challenges."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHorst von Buttlar writes at the online Financial Times Deutschland a piece called: Wind Energy: The Dirty Secret of the Energy Transformation.
In the aftermath of Fukushima and Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth, Germany rushed madly, in a state of collective hysteria, to alternative energies, ignoring all warnings that it would cost a bundle and wouldn’t work. Now with the big bills rolling in, the country is beginning to show some signs of returning to a little sanity.
Von Buttlar in the Financial Times begins his piece:
Slowly it is beginning to dawn:  The energy transformation is not only stalling, but it is also is exposing the well-hidden secret that it has long been a huge redistribution program from the bottom up.”
He writes that it’s about large landowners and farmers parking Ferraris between their tractors, or a famous law firm investing an 8-digit sum in a solar park with the state guaranteeing a handsome profit. It’s about a Bavarian farmer with hundreds of solar panels on his barn’s roof laughing his way to the bank: “That’s 20,000 euros per month.”
The German socialist and green parties used to be about protecting the little guy, making sure that their money and assets don’t get transferred from the bottom to the top. Today, however, they’re making sure that it does get transferred to the top! It just happens many Greens and socialist honchos are at the top reaping the benefits of political sellout.
Slowly but surely, it is all coming out. Von Buttlar writes:
… a few days ago the Consumer Protection Agency complained about high electricity costs: In 2007 every household paid on average 35 euros for alternative energies. Beginning in 2013, when the share in the costs rises from 3.5 cents to 5 cents, that number will jump to 185 euros.”
Von Buttlar reminds us that many Germans still accept this and view it as a “good cause” – a position he calls naive.
We should at least be honest – these are times when armies of corporate representatives and “advisers” from Enercon, Repower, or the numerous obscure solar companies are invading the countryside. It is not about a lofty objective or a good cause. That’s the story that gets told at town meetings. No, it’s about money. More precisely said: it’s about lots of money for a very few – money that is being divided up between plant operators, investors, leasing companies and manufacturers. 16.4 billion euros was the energy feed-in allocation in 2011. In the coming year it is going to be 20 billion.”

This is the reality that I hope my friends in Vermont are going to wake the hell up to – soon. The whole thing is a financial scam. And it is not going to have a bit of impact on the weather.

Not only is it going to cost you lots of money, but, as you are now painfully witnessing in Vermont, it is wreaking environmental damage of catastrophic dimensions. Your mountains and landscape are being devoured by industry. How do you like the face of climate protection now?

Citizens are not only going to be paying a lot more for power, but they are paying an awful environmental price right now. Site for 1 of 21 turbines now being installed on Lowell Mountain in Vermont. Photo source: Mountain Talk
Rich landowners, says von Buttlar, are leasing their land to windpark operators for 2000 to 10,000 euros an acre. Farmers can now kick back and do nothing but watch the money roll in.
The alternative energy situation in Germany has skidded so much out of control that even one of the fathers of the environmental movement has switched sides. Enoch zu Guttenberg, symphony conductor and co-founder of leading environmental activist group BUND, left the group in protest in May. Von Buttlar writes:
‘BUND appears to have sold out’, and he no longer wanted to crane his hands ‘near every money barrel,’ that corrupts. ‘Unfortunately we are no longer talking about the responsible future of energy management in Germany,’ zu Guttenberg writes. “We are talking about making a really fast buck’.”
Hopefully Germany’s disastrous energy model will act to deter others from following on the same path, which clearly Vermont has already embarked on in a radical way. Von Buttlar concludes his Financial Times article:
The next time you see a wind turbine, don’t think about whether it is attractive or ugly, or whether it is clean or polluting. Just think: Great! Now there’s sombody that has gotten seriously rich!“
And also ask: At who’s expense?

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that climate models have been around for quite some time, we can assess their performance and whether it is a wise idea to rely on them.
So far they appear to be much worse than random guessing. In fact it seems that climate models almost have a perfect record at making completely erroneous predictions. At least that’s the case with climate models of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPIM)  in Hamburg.
Yesterday Germany’s number 1 (in circulation) daily Bild here reported on this year’s once again lousy summer weather in Germany. Bild asked meteorologist Dominik Jung about summertime trends as a whole. Here’s what Bild writes (my emphasis):
Jung has discovered a trend: ‘One could say that the summers over the last 10 years have continuously gotten wetter! In 2007 there was 40% more rain than the normal mean, 2010 there was 15% more.’ Jung says: ‘In 2011 there was even 35% more rain than normal.’
Also the current summer is well on its way to being too wet. June got 15% more rain than normal.”
But Max Planck Institute models predicted the exact opposite!
So according to observations, summers in Germany have gotten wetter over the last 10 years. What did the climate models predict? A little digging turned up some interesting results.
Here’s what Focus wrote in 2009:
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg developed an especially high-resolution model. To the highest detail the model shows how climate change can impact Germany up to the year 2100. The MPIM climatologists summarized the results in a study published already in 2006. Their computer divided up the entire country into a 10 by 10 kilometer grid. Every 50 seconds it determines how the data inside them changes. Out comes values for temperature, pressure, wind and precipitation.
Clear climate trends are generated from the computer results. According to the model, winter months in all of Germany will become warmer. Depending on CO2 emissions, temperatures will rise regionally by up to 4°C, in the Alps even up to 5°C.

During the summertime, the rainfall amounts in the south, southwest and northeast of Germany can fall by up to one third, which will exacerbate droughts and increase forest fires. Along the North Sea and Baltic Sea coastlines, tourism will profit.”
When the models were made, The MPIM was under the direction of Prof. Hartmut Graßl, an alarmist who is now connected with the Münchener Re Reinsurer, which is making a bundle on the climate scare.
Now we suppose that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) will have to correct the flawed Max Planck modelers. Germany’s recent cold and brutal winters led the PIK to slap together a “refined” model that suddenly projected global warming would lead to cold and snowy German winters instead. So I suppose we can soon expect the PIK to roll out another “refined” model calling for wetter summers.
Compensation for damages?
What about all the companies and investors who bankrolled on scorching hot, dry summers? Can they demand compensation for damages incurred from faulty forecasts? Earlier this year we installed a 12-kW solar system on our home, and we were looking forward to months of sunshine and a rapid ROI – based on MPIM computer forecasts, of course! Doesn’t look like that is going to happen, at least not this summer.

7-day forecast for Oldenburg Germany.
And I can forget getting any compensation for damages from the crystal-balling climate gypsies up in Hamburg. In fact, it looks like I’m going to have to turn on the furnace – in f—— July!

"Extinction Rebellion activists have called on the BBC to “tell the full truth” about the climate crisis as they protested outside its headquarters in central London. Camped outside the main entrance of New Broadcasting House on Friday morning, the protesters held a banner stating: “BBC, your silence is deadly”, and chanted”: “Whose BBC? Our BBC”, and: “BBC, can’t you see, this is an emergency”. Police officers stood between the dozens of demonstrators and the entrance. Several appeared to be glued to the ground near the doors. The group called on the BBC “to meet its crucial moral duty to tell the full truth on the climate and ecological emergency”. The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens’ assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: “A just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.” Matthew Taylor Over a tannoy, Extinction Rebellion activists broadcast a number of mock bulletins in the style of those that could be aired if the UK was flooded. “Make your food stocks last, ration your supply,” a man warned, before a siren rang out. “With immediate effect … martial law has been declared. The strategic climate defence committee has suspended all transport until further notice.” BBC staff reported being unable to enter the building, and the financial journalist Paul Lewis tweeted that Extinction Rebellion had locked him out of the BBC. A BBC spokeswoman told Reuters she could not comment on security matters. On Thursday, a protester climbed on top of a plane at London City airport. Extinction Rebellion is using two weeks of civil disobedience to pressure governments to do more to combat greenhouse gas emissions. The Metropolitan police have made more than 1,100 arrests since the protests began earlier this week."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe binding UN international treaty on limiting greenhouse gases and forcing “sustainable” living is dead.

Is anyone listening any more? UN briefing to, um, hardly anyone.
The world has once again been rescued (for the time being) from the real menace: radical environmentalism. We’ve done it. We’ve succeeded in dumping a load of sand into the machinery of the environmental movement.
But it doesn’t mean we can all go home and relax. They will of course be back, sooner rather than later.
It’s almost as if many countries woke up over the last months and realized this sustainability scheme just wasn’t going to work. Hardly any country was able to afford it. High costs – no benefiits. Most countries hung in there hoping to receive billions in free handouts.

According to CO2 Handel here, the German press agency, DPA, today writes:
The summit on sustainable energy development was actually over before it even started on Wednesday. That’s the impression many of the conference attendees have. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who weeks ago cancelled her visit, hardly regrets her decision.”
Even Barack Obama stayed away, avoiding it like the plague. No sense in coming to Brazil and being associated with yet another huge flop. According to the DPA:
‘It is an unusual mood. The atmosphere is completely deflated. State and national leaders can just forget about the text,’ said one delegation member who already on Tuesday evening wondered about the exhausted atmosphere in the ‘Riocentro’, of the gigantic conference centre in the Rios area of Barra da Tijuca.”
And that was already 12 hours before UN-General Secretary Ban Ki Moon spoke on Wednesday. German Greenpeace activist leader Martin Kaiser lamented: “The summit was was over before it even started.”
The DPA adds:
Tactics exaggerations, blocking, and forging alliances, are part of every summit drama. But somehow one had the feeling Rio+20 began already with the final act. WWF expert Alois Vedder fears: ‘The sustainability summit in Rio threatens to turn into a event for pure show’.”

"As nations around the world struggle to halt the Earth’s rising temperature, China has made the transition to low-carbon transport a priority. As part of the effort to develop low-emission vehicles, national electric car manufacturers have enjoyed significant support from the Chinese government. Yet their sales are dwarfed by those of a pint-sized competitor: the low-speed electric vehicle.  Despite the name, low-speed electric vehicles (LSEVs) aren’t actually that slow. With a top speed of 60km/h, they’re fast enough for getting around big and heavily congested cities. Most models are compact, resembling three-wheeled utility vehicles or golf buggies –a practical solution for the dire lack parking spaces that have become a significant problem as more and more people take up driving in China.  But perhaps the biggest draw of the LSEV is its cost efficiency, with an average price tag of £4,000. What’s more, all owners of these vehicles in China will now get a license plate, regardless of the brand or the size of their vehicle.  This is remarkable, because until recently, most LSEVs did not even have a license plate – indeed, until October 2016, there were no rules governing the manufacture or use of LSEVs whatsoever. But now, the government has announced its intention to oversee the sector, and these vehicles are set to play a major role in China’s rapid urbanisation.  China’s new urbanisation plan foresees the migration of 100m people to third and fourth tier cities by 2020, so affordable transport is imperative. By gaining oversight on the growth and development of LSEVs, the Chinese government has acquired a new tool for reshaping the urban environment.  In particular, China has a reputation for car-centred cities, which suffer from heavy traffic and pollution. While the best option would be to direct people onto public transport, LSEVs can play a major role in cleaning up Chinese cities, by offering a more compact, low-emission alternative for aspiring car owners. But the LSEV is not the only urban “low-tech” transport option in China. There are also about 300m electric scooters of different shapes and makes. In fact, electric two-wheelers are currently the most popular alternative fuel vehicles in the history of motorisation in China.  Yet for a long time, e-bikes have been a thorn in the side of city authorities, which favour high-tech mobility solutions to make their cities look more modern. Indeed, stricter rules have been imposed in Beijing and Shenzhen, among other cities, in a controversial effort to curb their use.  Whether e-bikes could eventually become extinct is hard to say. Our own research into low-carbon mobility innovation in China suggests that e-bikes and LSEVs will continue to co-exist and compete with each other for some decades to come. Yet the Chinese government’s decision to give LSEVs formal legal status will definitely give their manufacturers a fresh edge in the low-tech mobility game.  Yet previous attempts to regulate China’s EV businesses have – to put it mildly – got out of hand: in August this year, it was reported that 90% of EV manufacturers could be put out of business by tough new rules. In other words, though regulation will raise standards, it will also favour a few big producers and stifle competition.  Even so, China currently boasts the largest number of privately-owned LSEVs of any country in the world, as well as the largest number of LSEVs used for car-sharing. And the Chinese government is keen to build on this success.  There is already a growing global interest in smaller LSEVs, including foldable EVs in European cities and 3D printable EVs in Japan. But so far, many international cities have been reluctant to adopt them on large scale. As a result, LSEVs have remained a marginal “neighborhood EV”.  By controlling this booming sector, the Chinese government will be able to raise standards. This will not only benefit consumers and boost sales internally, but also help manufacturers to reach into new markets in European cities, such as Milan in Italy.  Tapping into international markets will give manufacturers more capital to reinvest in upgrading LSEV technology and adding new features. As a result, these vehicles will become even more appealing, and better able to compete with cars and conventional EVs for both individual consumers, and contracts for city-wide car-sharing schemes. As some scholars like to say, “as China goes, so goes the world”. More modestly speaking, many countries around the world are likely to follow China’s lead, when it comes to urban development. The Chinese government’s decision to oversee the production of LSEVs shows that China is serious about steering the development of low-carbon mobility, not just at home but all around the world."
"Occasionally in science there are theories that refuse to die despite the overwhelming evidence against them. The “aquatic ape hypothesis” is one of these, now championed by Sir David Attenborough in his recent BBC Radio 4 series The Waterside Ape.  The hypothesis suggests that everything from walking upright to our lack of hair, from holding our breath to eating shellfish could be because an aquatic phase in our ancestry. Since the theory was first suggested more than 55 years ago, huge advances have been made in the study of human evolution and our story is much more interesting and complicated than suggested by the catch-all aquatic ape hypothesis. In 1960, marine biologist Alister Hardy published an article in New Scientist, titled: Was man more aquatic in the past? He re-told the familiar tale of the evolution of land animals from ancient fish, and then considered the return of various groups of reptiles, birds and mammals to an aquatic existence: ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, crocodiles, sea-snakes, penguins, whales, dolphins and porpoises, manatees and dugongs, and seals – as well as polar bears, otters and water voles, who hunt in water. Then he suggested that many of the unique characteristics of humans and their ancestors, marking them out as different from the other apes, could be explained as adaptations to spending time in water. Hardy put forward all sorts of features which could be explained as “aquatic adaptations”: our swimming ability – and our enjoyment of it; loss of body hair, as well as an arrangement of body hair that he supposed may have reduced resistance in the water; curvy bodies; and the layer of fat under our skin. He even suggested that our ability to walk upright may have developed through wading, with the water helping to support body weight.  For Hardy, this aquatic phase would have occupied the gap in the fossil record that then existed – between around 4m and 7m years ago. He sensibly concluded his paper saying that this was all only speculation – a “hypothesis to be discussed and tested against further lines of evidence”. In the 50-odd years since the presentation of this hypothesis, it has enjoyed a certain fame – or perhaps notoriety. The writer Elaine Morgan championed it in her book The Aquatic Ape, and developed the hypothesis further, marshalling a seemingly impressive range of characteristics to support it, including breath control and diet. It seems such a tantalising and romantic idea – but a closer look at the evidence reveals it to be little more than that. All the suggested anatomical and physiological adaptations can be explained by other hypotheses, which fit much better with what we actually know about the ecology of ancient hominins. Hairlessness, for instance, is only a feature of fully aquatic mammals such as whales and dolphins. Semi-aquatic mammals such as otters and water voles are extremely furry. Sexual selection and adaptations to heat loss better explain our pattern of body hair. Sexual selection may also explain our body fat distribution, which differs between the sexes. Voluntary breath control is more likely to be related to speech than to diving.  The diet of many of our ancestors certainly included marine resources – where people lived on the shores of lakes or the sea. But this was a relatively late development in human evolution, and humans can also survive and thrive on food obtained entirely on land. Compared with other animals, we are not actually that good at swimming, and our skin leaks as well, letting in water so that our fingers become prune-like after a long bath.  What about walking on two legs? That’s something all apes do a bit of – while wading in water, certainly, but also while reaching for fruit, performing aggressive displays or simply moving around in trees. If we evolved from ancestors who already stood up in trees, we don’t need an extraordinary explanation for why we ended up standing on the ground rather than running around on all fours. Since Hardy and Morgan’s hypothesis was advanced, many of the gaps in the human fossil record have been filled, with at least 13 new species found since 1987. We have also made great strides in reconstructing the environment in which our ancestors lived. And we know that species as far as part in time as Sahelanthropus tchadensis 7m years ago and Homo erectus 2m years ago all lived in forested or open woodland environments. While some of these woods included wetland, this was just part of the mosaic of habitats that our ancestors learned to survive in, and there is absolutely no trace of a hominin ancestor as aquatic as that described by Hardy and Morgan.  We also have evidence our ancestors had to survive periods of extremely dry climate with little or no aquatic resources. Coping with these highly variable, patchwork environments required behavioural flexibility and co-operation, and our large brains and ultra-social nature likely emerged as a result. This flexibility ultimately led to the invention of culture and technology. Recent proponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis have pointed to much later watery adaptations, including early archaeological sites where humans have been shown to be exploiting coastal resources. But these don’t have much to say about the origins of bipedalism, more than 6m years before – they just demonstrate the behavioural flexibility of later hominins. The original idea, and certainly Elaine Morgan’s elaboration of it, became an umbrella hypothesis or a “Theory of Everything”; both far too extravagant and too simple an explanation. It attempts to provide a single rationale for a huge range of adaptations - which we know arose at different times in the course of human evolution. Traits such as habitual bipedalism, big brains and language didn’t all appear at once – instead, their emergence is spread over millions of years. It’s nonsense to lump them all together as if they require a single explanation. Despite the evidence stacked up against the theory, it is strangely tenacious. It has become very elastic, and its proponents will seize hold of any mentions of water, fish or shellfish in human evolution, and any archaeological sites found near coasts, rivers and lakes as supporting evidence. But we must always build our hypotheses on, and test them against, the hard evidence: the fossils, comparative anatomy and physiology, and genetics. In that test, the aquatic ape has failed – again and again.  It is a great shame the BBC recently indulged this implausible theory as it distracts from the emerging story of human evolution that is both more complex and more interesting. Because at the end of the day science is about evidence, not wishful thinking. Scientist supporters of the waterside ape hypothesis have responded to this article here."
"Millions of people marched against climate crisis over the past two weeks, in some of the largest demonstrations of the millennium. Most people cheered the students who led the rallies – call them the Greta Generation. But now we’ll start to find out if all their earnest protest actually matters. Perhaps the first real test will come on 15 October, when the board of the EU’s European Investment Bank – the largest public bank in the world – meets to decide whether the time has finally come to stop expanding the fossil fuel sector. This should be a no-brainer decision: the bank’s staff has put forward a cogent proposal, supported by campaigners across the continent, that would end loans to new fossil fuel projects by 2020. That plan fits with the facts: when the world’s climate scientists declared last autumn that we would need to have fundamentally transformed our energy sector within a decade, it was clear that the first job was to stop building any new infrastructure. The first rule of holes is, when you’re in one, stop digging. In this case that means no more digging for gas pipelines or ports or anything else that will help lock in carbon emissions for decades to come. In the past week of Guardian reporting we’ve learned that the biggest oil companies plan to increase production as much as 35% in the next decade. It’s going to be hard enough to phase out the vast existing fossil fuel infrastructure in the years ahead: adding new projects at this point is insane. And if the EIB does act, it will send a strong signal to markets and to other lenders. For almost a decade now, observers have understood that restricting the flow of money to the fossil fuel industry is a key part of the climate fight. That’s why endowments and portfolios worth more than $11tn have begun divesting their fossil fuel stocks; last month the University of California system became the latest big player to join in, scrubbing its $80bn endowment and pension fund of fossil fuel stocks. Heck, even a major American utility announced that it was divesting its pension fund because it could see where the future lay. This kind of effort is beginning to actually pinch – Shell said last year that divestment had become a material risk to its business. Lending to this industry undercuts those efforts. Ending that lending would also strengthen the growing movement to stop private banks underwriting climate destruction. The big money-centre banks, the kind that lend to governments and businesses, have stepped up their financial support for the fossil fuel industry in the years since the Paris climate agreement, but a growing citizen movement is calling them to account: last week in the US activists closed down branches of Chase Bank, the largest oil and gas lender. The EIB would also be doing a service to everyone who will be hurt financially as the fossil fuel industry founders. As the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, began warning some years ago, there are massive “stranded assets” represented by oil and gas reserves that can’t be burned if we are to meet our climate targets. This “carbon bubble” hangs over our markets like the housing bubble of a decade ago: if the EIB backs away from new fossil fuel lending, it will help with the slow deflation of that bubble, lessening pressure on the system. But the biggest reason for the EIB to take this step is simple: it responds to the cries of both young people and scientists. Researchers have looked on in anguish for many years now, as their warnings have gone largely unheeded – the results so far this year include the hottest month ever recorded on our planet, giant fires across the northern latitudes and a hurricane that stalled over the Bahamas producing what meteorologists called “the longest siege of violent, destructive weather ever observed” on our planet. The iron law of climate crisis is that those who have done the least get hurt the most, but it’s now reaching the stage where even the affluent are at risk: across California last week hundreds of thousands were without power because the state’s largest utility company shut off supplies for fear of sparking forest fires in this hot and arid autumn. Young people have looked at this data and drawn the obvious conclusion: that we must do far more than we are doing at present. They’ve done the work to understand the crisis that shadows their lives, and they’ve asked adults to join in the fight for a livable future. They’ve also said – loud and clear – that they don’t want to be patted on the head and thanked for providing an inspiring moment. They want action. Action is what the EIB can provide. Obviously there will be pressure from the oil and gas industry to keep handing over public money: that’s evident in the gas industry loopholes that have fractured the boldness of the initial proposals. What had the potential to be an unmistakable signal to the world that the end of the fossil fuel age was in sight could end up a more muddled message if the EIB bends to industry pressure. Anyone who believes in physics and chemistry knows that the time for change is here – indeed, it’s past due. The fifteenth of October is a crucial day in the most important fight the planet has ever faced, and a sign of whether Europe’s governments, particularly those of Germany and Italy, who insiders report have been strongly against a fossil-free EIB policy, will respond with open hearts to the outpouring of hope we have seen in the past weeks. • Bill McKibben is the founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and author of Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?"

The climate of the last 10,000 years has not been as stable as leading IPCC scientists assume. Over the last 10 years there has been a flurry of papers from studies conducted all over the world (Figure 1) and they reveal cyclic fluctuations of the climate on a 1000-year scale. The climate changes are synchronous with solar activity, which indicates that the sun is the main driver behind climate change. The same can be said about the climate over the last 1000 years, and for the recent warming of the 20th century.

Figure 1: Overview of literature on solar activity and global millennial cycles. Black dot indicates the location of Matthew Schmidt’s area of studay of his recent publication.
The newest publication appeared in the journal Paleoceanography in July, 2012. A team of scientists led by Matthew Schmidt of Texas A&M University studied a sediment core taken 200 meters below the sea surface in the Florida Strait. The core covers the last 10,0000 years of climate (see black dot in Figure 1). The Gulf Stream passes through this narrow strait on its way north, thus making it an important connecting link between the tropics and the high Atlantic latitudes.
It’s been long known that the climate history of the Florida Strait is closely coupled with the climate development of the high Atlantic latitudes. As temperatures in the North Atlantic plummeted during the Little Ice Age, the Florida region became much drier.
Matthew Schmidt and his team focused on the first half of the post Ice Age period, from 9000 to 6000 years before today. Did climate patterns similar to those during the Little Ice Age exist back then as well? To answer that question the scientists reconstructed the temperature development over the 3000 year period using an array of techniques.
The result was not surprising
Also during the early post Ice Age times dry periods over the Florida region occurred with regularity. When the climate cooled in the North Atlantic, along with other regions of the world, the rains failed over the Florida Strait region. In the Pacific, the El Nino-events become more frequent (Figure 2). Solar activity also set the beat in other parts of the world, as confirmed by the results of studies by Gerard Bond.

There was one exception. The authors found a dry Florida period at the 8200 year mark (gray bar, Figure 2). Here they interpreted regional deviations and the effects of system-internal cycles.
Overall, Schmidt and his colleagues determined that solar activity fluctuations also played a very important role on the global atmospheric circulation system during the early post Ice Age time. Here there are clearly recognizable solar-driven climatic cycles on a millennial scale.

Figure 2: Climate development during the early post Ice Age was synchronous with solar activity (exception: cool phase 8200 years ago, marked with a gray bar). Phases of low solar activity led to cold temperatures in the North Atlantic and dry conditions over the Florida region (blue dashed lines). In periods of high solar activity (red dashed lines), Florida was wetter. Schmidt et al. (2012)
The American scientists also performed a frequency analysis of the climatic fluctuations and found the characteristic cycles with periods of 1500, 90 and 60 years (Figure 3). Schmidt and his colleagues interpreted the 1500 year cycle as those that Gerard Bond described earlier. The data set also contained the 60-year cycle, which likely mirrored the Atlantic Decadal Cycle.

Figure 3: Frequency analysis of the oxygen isotope cycles of the sediment core for the period 9100 to 6200 years before today. From Schmidt et al. (2012).
The study by Matthew Schmidt and his colleagues is yet another important piece to the puzzle in understanding the sun as a major factor in driving climate. Are the media going to report on this? Don’t hold your breath.

"Josh Frydenberg has rejected the International Monetary Fund’s warning that Australia will fail to meet its Paris agreement emissions reduction target even with a carbon price of US$75 a ton. The IMF made the observation in a report on mitigating climate change which concluded that a carbon tax is still a more cost-effective solution than “feebate” models, which impose fees on activities with above-average emissions and subsidise those with below-average emissions. Frydenberg, the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader, told reporters in Canberra on Friday the government is “confident we will meet and beat our targets and as you know at the election we laid out our $3.5bn climate solutions package with a range of methods”. Angus Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction, said the IMF report “does not take into account” the government’s emissions reduction fund, which pays polluters to cut greenhouse gases by 328mt by 2030. The fund has been criticised for rapidly diminishing returns and widespread exemptions to limits on emissions elsewhere in the economy. Despite the Morrison government claiming that Australia will meet its Paris target of 26% to 28% emissions reduction by 2030 “in a canter”, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen for five years since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. In a separate report the IMF warned that companies cannot afford to ignore environmental and social goals because they have a “material impact on corporate performance”, in part because of investor pressure and potential “large losses from climate change”. The paper implicitly rejects the view expressed by senior Coalition figures that business should not speak up on social issues, interpreted as an attack on one of Australia’s biggest resources companies, BHP, for its efforts to reduce emissions. The first IMF paper found that if G20 countries imposed uniform carbon prices of $25, $50, and $75 a ton emissions would fall by 19%, 29%, and 35% respectively for the group. Although a $25 price would be “more than enough” for some countries – such as China, India and Russia – to meet their targets, even with a $75 a ton price Australia and Canada would fail owing to differences in the stringency of targets and the price responsiveness of emissions. Retail energy prices in Australia would rise by 75% with a carbon price of $75 a ton owing to its heavy reliance on coal-fired power generation, it said. The report suggests a combination of regulation and “feebate” policies in Australia would only cut emissions by two-thirds the amount a $50 carbon price would, and would add 50% to mitigation costs. The report suggests in Australia a $50 carbon price would raise about 1% of GDP in revenue and suggests returning revenue to taxpayers. “To make carbon taxes politically feasible and economically efficient, governments need to choose how to use the new revenue,” it said. “Options include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, increasing investment in green energy, or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.” Taylor said the “point of a carbon tax is to raise the price of energy so people consume less”. “Labor’s carbon tax did exactly that, and that’s why we abolished it.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australia Institute’s climate director, Richie Merzian, said the IMF report showed “carbon prices work” and would have little impact on the economy. “In just two years under the Clean Energy Future carbon price, Australia reduced emissions by 2%, grew the economy by 5% and added 200,000 jobs,” he said. “If there is one clear message for the Australian government, it is get your act together. Australia’s emissions are increasing, not falling, because there is no credible climate and energy policy.” In its sustainable finance report, the IMF argued that integrating environmental, social and governance factors into firms’ business models will “help mitigate risks” such as financial stability risks via exposure of banks and insurers and large losses from climate change. It identified both “physical risks” from damage to property, land and infrastructure from catastrophic weather-related events and broader climate trends, and “transition risks” from changes in the price of stranded assets and broader economic disruption because of evolving climate policy, technology, and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower-carbon economy. “Environmental, social, and governance issues can have a material impact on firms’ performance and on the stability of the financial system more broadly,” it said. In September the heads of Australia’s two major airlines – Alan Joyce of Qantas and Virgin Australia’s Paul Scurrah – rejected government calls to stay out of social and environmental issues, citing the strong business case to attract employees and customers with a social conscience."
"Lobsters are famously cooked alive, dumped straight into a pan of boiling water. This means the global lobster trade involves live animals being shipped around the world, which adds a risk not present with canned tuna or frozen cod – what if they escape and form invasive lobster colonies? This process is already underway thanks to Europe’s taste for cheap, industrially-fished American lobster. Superficially, there are few differences between the European (Homarus gammarus) and American (Homarus americanus) species – even expert crustacean biologists can have difficulty telling them apart. However, Sweden recently pushed for American lobsters to be regarded by the EU as a pest species and potentially invasive. This would mean a ban on the import of live animals, a significant economic activity with US$200m worth of live lobster (around 13,000 metric tonnes) imported into the EU each year. Not all of these lobsters make it onto a dinner plate. It is likely that some unwanted or sickly animals in quayside restaurants have been released into the sea, and there have been reports of guilt-ridden passengers on cruise ships throwing non-native lobsters overboard rather than eating them.  We may not know exactly how all these invasive lobsters are escaping restaurants and fish farms, but we do know that they’re making their way into the wild somehow. Swedish researchers lay out the scale of the problem in a recent risk assessment. In 2014, they report, 26 American lobsters were captured in just one area, Gullmar Fjord near Gothenburg on the country’s west coast. Another 29 were captured in Norwegian waters between 1999 and 2015, and 26 in UK waters between 1988 and 2011. Given the difficulty of telling the two species apart, is it likely that the real numbers are significantly higher. Most worryingly of all is the fact that four of the females caught in Swedish waters were bearing eggs and critically one of them was carrying eggs that had been fertilised by a European lobster. Previous research has demonstrated that hybrid eggs can be viable and the resulting adults can be fertile. The risk assessment goes on to suggest that American lobsters carry diseases such as Gaffkemia (a lethal bacterial blood disease that can wipe out lobsters kept in holding facilities) and may carry unwanted parasites that could potentially have significant effects on European lobster or more generally European marine habitats.  In the UK, the American lobster is already subject to some controls. If imported live they must be kept at least one mile from the sea and they are not by law allowed to be released into the wild. Despite the latter, there have been releases of non-native crustaceans by well-meaning religious groups seeking to save the animals from a garlicky death. In June 2014, following an ancient tradition called fang sheng, Buddhists bought 200 lobsters and crabs from fishmongers in Brighton that had been imported from North America and released them.   A group of US political representatives, led by Senator Edward Markey, have written to the EU director general for environment on “behalf of the hardworking men and women of the Massachusetts lobster industry”. They cast aspersions on the science of some of Sweden’s top marine biologists and refer to the repeated detection of American lobsters in EU waters over the years as “sporadic”.  Markey and colleagues are correct that there is not yet definitive proof of American lobsters being established in EU waters, nor that their offspring might be viable competitors. However, it only needs a few animals to become successfully established, or one to transmit a novel disease to which non-natives are not resistant, for there to be a significant and irreversible impact.   Most ecologists and conservationists view invasive species as a bad thing (not all agree though) and one of the most significant global threats to biodiversity.  There are strong, relevant precedents. The signal crayfish, a freshwater lobster from North America, was introduced to Scandinavia in the 1960s. It has since spread to the UK. Unfortunately, they were carriers of a devastating crayfish plague which the European species have no resistance to. In the other direction, the common and familiar shore crab of the UK has spread to North America, South Africa, Australia and South America and has been listed among the world’s 100 worst invasive species. Where we have a chance to prevent the spread of invasive species we should tread very carefully – however tasty they may be."
"Dozens of protesters, including a 77-year-old rabbi, have been arrested while blocking traffic in London’s financial district, as Extinction Rebellion switched its focus towards companies funding and profiting from the climate emergency. Hundreds of demonstrators walked into the roundabout outside the Bank of England in the City and sat down in the road early on Monday morning. In a statement, the group said: “Extinction Rebellion this morning are disrupting the system bankrolling the environmental crisis. “The day of disruption, which will target financial institutions, seeks to highlight the far greater disruption faced by those living in the environments systematically being destroyed by UK-backed companies. “The ecological damage is global, and it is hitting the global south now.” Protesters said they were switching their focus to the financial institutions “funding environmental destruction”. The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens’ assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: “A just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.” Matthew Taylor Jeffrey Newman, emeritus rabbi of Finchley Reform Synagogue, knelt down in the middle of Lombard Street, opposite the Bank of England, after leading a Shacharit festival morning service. He was carried away by police, who at one point appeared to drop him on the floor, after he refused to go with them voluntarily. As he waited to be taken, Newman, a long-time environmental campaigner, said: “We are in a period of enormous catastrophic breakdown, and if it takes an arrest to try to find ways of helping to galvanise public opinion then it is certainly worth being arrested. “The other side of what I want to say is that Extinction Rebellion is this: it is activism, but underneath it’s also about rebuilding, about showing that a society can function better when people collaborate.” Interrupted before he could finish, Newman told officers surrounding him that he disagreed with what they were doing and did not accept their grounds for his arrest. “It’s not OK!” he shouted at the arresting officer before he was taken away. Another protester, Chay Harwood, 23, from Bristol, said: “We are here in the financial district because we know for a fact that these companies and institutions have a vested interest in deforestation and the decimation of people’s lives and livelihoods, not only in the Amazon but in the global south in general.” Shortly before 3.30pm, the Metropolitan police announced that 1,405 people had been arrested in connection with the Extinction Rebellion protests since last Monday. Of those, 76 had been charged, with offences including failing to comply with a condition under section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, criminal damage and obstruction of a highway. The protest outside the major finance institutions bankrolling big oil comes after the Guardian’s polluters investigation, which found that the world’s three largest money managers had a combined $300bn fossil fuel investment portfolio, using money from people’s private savings and pension contributions. The Guardian found that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which together oversee assets worth more than China’s entire GDP, had continued to grow billion-dollar stakes in some of the most carbon-intensive companies even after the Paris agreement, which set out the urgent need to drastically scale back fossil fuel expansion. The two largest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard, have also routinely opposed motions at fossil fuel companies that would have forced directors to take more action on climate change. On Monday morning, the Metropolitan police announced there had been 1,336 arrests linked to the protests since they began last week. The rate of arrests appeared to have slowed over the weekend as the group focused instead on mass actions involving members of the general public. Near the Bank of England, Andrew Medhurst, a former City trader turned full-time activist, said the financial industry needed to realise that some of the projects it was financing were “essentially leading us to destruction”. “We have no more time left in terms of taking action,” he said. “We haven’t got 12 years. We should have started yesterday. We have to decarbonise our economies, so for the banks to be lending money to fossil fuel companies – it’s just barmy. It doesn’t make sense. “It basically means there’s a disconnect between those emotional family connections [between City workers] and their future children and grandchildren, and making money, which is morally repugnant.” Emily Grossman, an expert in molecular biology and genetics and a member of Scientists for XR, said she was protesting outside the big finance houses to shine a light on the central role they played in the climate emergency. The group now has more than 700 prominent scientists signed up to support non-violent direct action around the escalating ecological emergency. Grossman said the big banks in the City were a key target, having lent hundreds of billions of pounds to fossil fuel projects in the past year. She said: “They are the ones who are pushing ahead with these huge investments … they are using our own money – in terms of pensions and investments – to drive us all towards climate catastrophe … They are threatening the lives of our children and grandchildren for the sake of their profits.”"
" Conservative MPs are almost five times as likely to vote against climate action as legislators from other parties, a Guardian analysis of 16 indicative parliamentary divisions over the past decade has revealed. The Tories also registered many more donations, shares, salaries, gifts and tickets to sporting events from fossil fuel companies, petrostates, aviation companies and climate sceptics, according to declarations made in the parliamentary record of MPs’ interests between 2008 and 2019. The Guardian, in collaboration with the investigative environmental journalism group DeSmog UK, rated MPs from 0% to 100% based on 16 parliamentary votes since 2008. The selection sought to cover a range of measures that would affect the UK’s carbon emissions, with an emphasis on votes where MPs were willing to break ranks and put the climate before their party. The analysis shows that although most politicians publicly express support for ambitious long-term climate targets, when it comes to short-term measures to reduce the UK’s carbon footprint, those in power are less likely to make this a priority. The scores are not intended to be a definitive evaluation of an MP’s green credentials – both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrat parties complained they had been hard done by. But experts said the scores were an important tool for voters to make a choice through a climate prism with a potential general election looming. The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear. The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become."" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.  Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent. Boris Johnson was among several dozen MPs, mostly Conservatives, who recorded the worst possible score of zero. Although the prime minister has at various times said it was important to cut emissions, records show he voted five times against bills or amendments that could have had a positive climate impact. He was also among 10 ministers who received donations or gifts from oil companies, airports, petrostates, climate sceptics or thinktanks identified as spreading information against climate action. The average voting score of Johnson’s cabinet was 17%, compared with the Labour shadow cabinet score of 90%. The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, scored 92%. Labour MPs were far less likely than Conservatives to receive gifts or money related to fossil fuel interests. This is partly because they are in opposition and tend to rely more on donations from trade unions. One of the MPs most consistently opposed to measures to tackle climate change was Sammy Wilson, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) politician who notoriously organised a “Climate Fools’ Day” parliamentary event in 2010 that gathered sceptic MPs. The MP who received legitimate donations from the widest range of denialist and fossil fuel sources was the former international trade secretary Liam Fox. For the emissions-related votes, Conservative MPs averaged 17%, while non-Conservatives scored 80% on average. This breaks down as Labour 86%, Liberal Democrats 51%, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru 100%, Change UK 59% and the DUP 62%. Sinn Féin had no score because its MPs boycott parliament. The average MP’s score was 50%. Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, scored 50%, largely because Lib Dem MPs were often whipped to vote alongside the Conservatives during the 2010-15 coalition government. Her party’s overall voting average fell from 59% to 51% after the recent admission of former Tory Brexit rebels – inclusions the party said were unfair. A Lib Dem spokeswoman said a different selection of votes would have resulted in a higher scores for their MPs. The Guardian approached all the main political parties about the scores, explaining the methodology and how they were intended as a tool for the electorate. Their initial response was sharply divided. While Labour broadly welcomed the study, the Lib Dems questioned the methodology. A Conservative spokesperson said the findings were “complete nonsense”. “Addressing climate change is a top priority for the Conservative party, which is why in June we became the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming by 2050. Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking world-leading action on climate change. We have reduced emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.” A press officer for Corbyn said it was a “very valuable project for voters”. A Labour spokesperson added: “We’re proud that Labour has a long history of leading the way on the environment, as this analysis clearly shows. I would hope that no concerned MP feels compelled to ever again vote against legislation that will tackle climate change.” The Lib Dems said the party was proud of its record. “In government we presided over the largest increase in renewable generation ever seen in the UK’s history,” a party spokesperson said. “Since 2015 the Tories have consistently undermined the UK’s progress on tackling the climate emergency, as have Labour through their tacit support of Brexit. Liberal Democrats demand better. We are the only national party serious about tackling the climate emergency and we have radical plan to cut emissions to net zero by 2045 at the very latest.” Before seeing the results, Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem head of the Commons science and technology committee – who scored 62% – said: “It’s a good thing this is being done by the Guardian. MPs are leaders and we need to be held to account.” The Green party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas – who has consistently been a leader on environment issues – registered 92%. It was not 100% because she voted to keep nuclear power subsidies relatively low. Lucas and many environmentalists argued the subsidies would be better spent on cheaper, safer forms of renewable energy. The analysis, which covers 16 votes since the 2008 Climate Change Act, shows politicians of all stripes are less likely to vote for climate action when their party is in government and, with notable exceptions, follow the party whip. The top-scoring Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith (67%), often voted against his own party in favour of measures that would help to stabilise the climate. The second-lowest-scoring Labour MP, Graham Stringer (57%), is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a UK-based organisation that denies the urgency of the climate crisis, and was one of only two MPs who voted against the 2014 conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that humans bore most responsibility for climate change. Lucas said MPs should rethink their priorities. “The climate emergency is a global crisis, more important in the long term than Brexit, but it doesn’t attract the same commitment and that’s simply not good enough,” she said. “MPs need to wake up to what people want: tougher action, more ambitious targets and a real sense of urgency.” The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said parties should maintain a consensus about the scale of the challenge but should battle over the measures needed to achieve the UK’s goals. “The climate emergency will be on the ballot paper at the next general election,” he said. “Parties need to fight it out on who really gets it, is willing to match rhetoric with action and grasps the overwhelming need to act now rather than later.” Analysts said that in the past, voter apathy had persuaded MPs they would not be judged on this issue. “The problem is with the silent majority of MPs,” said Rebecca Willis, a research associate at Lancaster University, who has studied parliamentary attitudes on global heating. “Very few politicians in the UK deny the science of climate – but there are not many that are very active on climate issues, either. The vast majority sit in between: they say the right things when required, but they don’t champion the issue or spend time on it. They don’t perceive that it’s a priority for voters.” Dave Timms of Friends of the Earth said: “There is still a broad consensus for the overall target, but when it comes to making the hard choices needed to achieve that target, climate action is at a standstill.” Additional reporting by Lucy Campbell, Nur Pirbhai, Christine Parry and Hanako Lowry"
"The next week or so could determine the future of the rhino. Delegates from 183 nations are heading to Johannesburg, South Africa, for the CITES conference (CoP17) on the international wildlife trade.  It’s fitting that the conference should take place in a South Africa that already finds itself at the centre of the latest big rhino conservation struggle. Earlier this year, private game ranchers successfully overturned a government moratorium on the domestic trade in rhino horn. International trade has been banned since 1977 and the domestic trade is banned even in those Asian countries which drive demand. South Africa has become an outlier. Faced with pressure from the game ranching industry, environment minister, Edna Molewa, has suggested that South Africa will be pro-trade in elephant ivory and rhino horn. Swaziland, the small country sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, complicated matters by tabling a resolution to the conference that calls for a limited sale of existing rhino horn stocks to East Asian markets. It wants to reinvest the funds into conserving its existing rhinos. However, this move would set a dangerous precedent, and South African game ranchers will be watching (and supporting) the resolution for other reasons.  A battle is raging not simply between ranchers and activists, but also within the conservation community. After all, poaching is still increasing despite the international trade ban, and extra conservation actions, including de-horning rhinos and spy-cams embedded in their horns, have yet to produce demonstrable benefits. With populations unable to sustain any further losses, some conservationists have become desperate enough to promote legal trade as the rhino’s last chance.  The argument is simple: legalise the trade, and the value of rhino horn will decrease until poachers no longer consider it worth the risk. At present, a kilogram of rhino horn is worth US$65,000 on the black market, more than gold, diamonds or cocaine. But, while making rhino horn less valuable may sound like a good idea, the implications of a legal international trade are not straightforward. Legalisation may increase demand, as it would become “acceptable” and marketable. The difficulty of differentiating between legally sourced and poached rhino horn means mean some rhino would still be killed illegally.  Legalising the trade also further encourages game ranchers to farm rhino (they already do): like cattle or sheep. A serious question needs to be asked: do we want rhino to become a domesticated farm animal rather than a wild animal? The rhino trade’s moral impact on people is a key issue, but often gets overlooked. Demand is principally from East Asia, with Vietnam and China currently the main markets. Rhino horn is mostly ingested in the misguided belief that it has unique medicinal properties, and legalising trade would encourage false marketing of health benefits.  In many cases consumers are vulnerable people, who are desperate and seek hope, or an aspirational (and wealthy) but misguided middle-class. The latter are motivated by the prestige of owning, gifting, or consuming a rare commodity with “mystique”. The motive for the majority of South African rhino ranchers is obvious: if the trade is legalised they can make money. Some have even speculated on this by buying and farming rhino in the hope they’ll get rich once the ban is lifted. But for now, how do they make money from rhino? Ecotourism and trophy hunting will bring in some revenue, but this is dwarfed by the potential income from rhino horn. Owners also have the expensive, time-consuming and dangerous task of protecting their rhino from poachers. For private rhino owners, a legal international trade would be ideal. However, despite growing pressure, this is unlikely to happen as legalisation requires two-thirds of CITES parties (120 or so countries) to vote in favour. For now, South Africa must be content with the recently opened domestic trade. So why would anyone in South Africa want to buy rhino horn domestically, when the primary consumer market is in Asia and illegal? The answer, and the reason why ranchers are keen to keep the market open, is that this trade is an opportunity to bring wealthy Asian consumers to South Africa. The medical tourism fallacy – where people from other parts of the world come to South Africa to take powdered horn for “health reasons” – would continue to promote the falsehood that rhino horn cures the incurable. This helps neither people nor rhino. CITES legislation is insufficient in itself, and effective enforcement is vital. The Vietnamese prime minister, under the threat of potential international trade sanctions, recently called for a crackdown on the illegal wildlife trade. In the long-term, however, we need to reduce demand. This means tackling ignorance about the illegal trade, and ensuring people are aware of the perilous situation rhinos are in. A better appreciation of the natural world, and its importance to our ecosystem and welfare, means more will take responsibility to protect it. Promoting trade in an endangered species goes in the opposite direction, and it is very difficult to reverse. Note to the conference: the rhino horn trade is a big risk – if it goes wrong we hasten rhino species towards extinction. "

There’s been a lot of bed-wetting going on about “increasing” extreme weather events like droughts, floods, heat, tornadoes and dry periods.
All because of climate change? Not so, says the German Weather Service DWD (surprisingly)!
Precipitation over much of Europe over 2011 was 80% or less than normal levels.
The DWD posted 2 days ago an unusually level-headed, sober expert report on what’s behind the dry period that Europe has been experiencing over the last 2 year and half.
Their findings are a real cold water deluge on all the alarmist claims we’ve been hearing in the media over the last weeks.
The DWD’s conclusion: “There’s no long-term significant trend. The suspect is a two-year La Niña impact in connection with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation”. Hat-tip: Meteorologist K.E. Puls.
What follows is a translation of their German summary (my emphasis):

Summary
The dry period of winter 2011/12 and spring 2012 was as a whole not so strongly pronounced like in the spring and autumn of a year earlier (for the previous year, see Trachte et al. 2012), but it can be ranked as local and extreme. Wide areas of Europe were impacted, and to different extents and at different time periods. Over the Iberian Peninsula, this period of drought began in December 2011 and then spread to Western, Central and Southern Europe by March. Heavy precipitation in Western Europe then ended the period of low precipitation. However, ground moisture in April and May remained generally very low, thus causing the hydrological drought to extend over the entire spring of 2012. Over the long-term, since the beginning of the 20th century, there is no significant general trend to more dryness in Europe. However, there are indications that in certain smaller regions dryness and periods of strong precipitation have tended to become more extreme over the last 35 years, foremost the Iberian Peninsula during the winter.
The main meteorological cause of the drought, as is the case for last spring and in fall 2011, is the widespread and stronger high pressure influence in these regions. After examining the corresponding data and some new investigations of the literature, there’s a strong suspicion that a two-year long La Niña (i.e. two La Niña-events in row) were the main cause in all these cases – in connection with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation.”
The text speaks for itself. We are dealing with natural causes. Moreover the authors add:
Record drought for 2012 hardly took place. For example in Uccle (Belgium), where the data-sets begin in the 19th century, even during the dry March-2012 the monthly precipitation amount and the number of days of precipitation was considerably higher than the record low of 1993. In Germany, the spring of 2012 was the 6th driest since the beginning of the 20th century.”
The DWD presents other long-term (non)trends:

Data-sets from region’s middle for individual seasons (See Fig. 9 for winter and spring) do not show any clear trend for any region. Instead we see more or less pronounced year-to-year variability.”

Good to see there are a few meteorologists left at the German National Weather Service who are still sober and have not yet become all drugged up with the global warming cult religion. I wonder if they’ll be allowed to issue reports in the future.

All Stocker had for arguments was: 1) insisting Mann’s phony hockey stick was still valid 2) claiming there’s scientific consensus, and 3) we can trust the models! All three of course have long been proven to be false. 
Their science is that bad, folks. I never would have believed it. Using an old discredited science, the IPCC is really looking like a bizarre end-of-world comedy act. 
It’s clear why IPCC scientists don’t like debating – and prefer insisting that we just believe them. 
There are other nuances I found entertaining, and I’ll try to bring these up today, time permitting.

******************************************

Paul Ryan, the Perfect Anti-Gore
By S.  Fred Singer

Vice-president  hopeful Paul D. Ryan is the polar opposite to former VP Al Gore.  Instead  of promoting fears, the candidate is a pretty solid skeptic when it comes to  catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW).  Romney is obviously comfortable with that stance and is using Ryan to reposition himself on the issue of global warming and energy.
If Romney-Ryan are elected, the global warming problems may suddenly disappear.  As a start, the new Congress will likely pass legislation that specifically instructs the EPA not to control any of the greenhouse gases that have a global distribution — and,  like CO2, are certainly not pollution in any normal, ordinary  sense.
In  an otherwise critical NYT op-ed (Aug 13), Reagan’s former WH budget chief David Srockman calls Ryan “the most articulate and intellectually imposing Republican  of…”

"In a climate conscious era, we’re forever being asked to “turn the lights off” or “drive less!” or “recycle more!”. These familiar messages put the onus on individuals – that is, you and me – to change our behaviour, reduce our impact, and be greener. But what are the limits to these behavioural tweaks? Do they actually make any difference? While they may help a little, to substantially reduce our carbon emissions or be truly more sustainable, we’ll also need a greater focus on “the system”. The problem is that little actions typically only make a little difference. While there are rare examples of small gestures from individual people leading to big changes – think of Rosa Parks’ decision about where to sit on the bus – unfortunately for the do-gooders out there, many people recycle, but it’s a lot more difficult to spark a recycling revolution. And so, it’s understandable if the Tesco approach to greening the planet (“every little helps!”) doesn’t feel like it’ll achieve the deep cuts in greenhouses gases needed to avoid dangerous climate change – because it probably won’t. If, for example, you eat a Western diet, cutting down on meat can reduce your carbon footprint: vegetarian diets produce about 20-30% fewer greenhouse gases than their meat-eating equivalents. Problem solved? Unfortunately not.  For most people living in Europe, your diet makes up say 10% of your carbon footprint, so that 30% greenhouse gas saving sums to about a less impressive 3% cut in your total carbon emissions. While that may be an important and achievable 3% reduction, we’re going to have to do more than that – especially if these changes in our behaviour have unforeseen consequences. Imagine if providing recycling bins actually increased waste. That’s what they found in the bathrooms at the University of Washington. Researchers measured how many paper hand towels people used and threw away under two scenarios, one where there was a recycling bin available, and one where there wasn’t. They found – perhaps surprisingly – that where people could recycle, they wasted more.  This is an example of a “rebound effect”, where a behavioural change (for example, encouraging recycling) has unforeseen side-effects which reduce the hoped-for benefits. In this case, where there were recycling bins, people felt it was OK to use more paper – it was, after all, being recycled. And this isn’t an isolated example. We recently analysed the impacts of efforts to reduce food waste in the UK, and found a worryingly similar pattern. Food waste is a huge problem. UK households waste about a third of their food and this waste produces a lot of carbon – eliminating household food waste would be equivalent to taking one in four cars off the road. Recognising this, there are a growing number of initiatives to reduce food waste, by reducing confusion about best before dates, encouraging people to plan their meals, or by redistributing it to the hungry.  I wholeheartedly support these initiatives (we even served food waste at my wedding), but their benefits are tempered by rebound effects. When people waste less food, they also save money from the food they didn’t have to buy (and waste). This extra money doesn’t disappear. Instead, it’s spent on other things: be that travel, furniture, or Pokémon Go. And it turns out that when we take into account this rebound spending, it reduces the benefits in terms of greenhouse gases by as much as 60%. What this tells us is that even the best intentions are constrained by the unsustainable socioeconomic system that we all live in. To dramatically reduce greenhouse gases we still need people to take the little actions, by wasting less or using public transport – but we also need to push for systemic change: we need to decarbonise the whole economy, so that when rebounds occur, they work with us, not against us.  So, what should we do? Our food waste example provides a few clues. We analysed the environmental impact of food waste across the whole supply chain and found that because the UK imports half of its food, the impacts in other parts of the world are disproportionately important – in fact, almost two-thirds of the UK’s food-related greenhouse gas emissions occur abroad. To fix the UK’s food system, we first need to see it as a system – there are huge opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fostering sustainable farming practices, not just in the UK, but also in the developing world. To make this happen, we need to work with the levers which move the system – petition to make government policy more outward looking, or boycott and shame companies whose products are associated with deforestation or other greenhouse gas-releasing practices. Admittedly, trying to move the system is more daunting than behavioural change at home, and ultimately, we still need to do both. It’s important to organise political sit-ins and boycotts, and make politicians aware if you disagree with the disbanding of the Department of Climate Change or government support for fracking, for example – but also don’t forget to turn off the lights when you’re done."
"The climate crimes of big tech are legion. This summer the Amazon burned. Why? In part because of the policies of the new anti-environmental, anti-human-rights president, Jair Bolsonaro. How did Bolsonaro rise to prominence and then the presidency? YouTube, and certain of its algorithms that push people toward more extreme content, played a large part. As the New York Times reported in August, not long ago Bolsonaro was “a marginal figure in national politics – but a star in YouTube’s far-right community in Brazil, where the platform has become more widely watched than all but one TV channel”. Members of the nation’s newly empowered far right – from grassroots organisers to federal lawmakers – say their movement would not have risen so far, so fast, without YouTube’s recommendation engine. YouTube’s search and recommendation system appears to have systematically diverted users to far right and conspiracy channels in Brazil. Some of YouTube’s algorithms have been connected to the rise of racism, white supremacism and mass shootings. It appears its prime agenda is profit – and extremist content keeps viewers hooked, and hooked viewers bring in revenue.  Google, the owner of YouTube, also appears to help push some users toward more extreme content, and it then collects all our data and sells it. Some of that data is used to target you and me for shopping, but politics is now a kind of shopping in which the targeting and manipulation of voters via personal data is like the manipulation of potential customers, as we learned from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica’s role in Brexit and the climate catastrophe that was the election of Donald Trump. (It’s worth noting that everything that the Putin regime is charged with doing in the 2016 US election amounts to exploiting new vulnerabilities created by new technologies.) This erosion of privacy that Edward Snowden warned us about in 2013 when it was the US National Security Agency eroding it, is being violated far more thoroughly by Facebook and Google aggregating data from everything we do and everyone we know. Snowden warned us that privacy is a crucial part of democracy, a sort of fortress each of us owns – or owned – behind which we are free to think, associate and act without governmental intrusion. The many ways in which everything we do is now monitored and the data is aggregated will be – and in many places is being – used to limit the freedoms of ordinary people. And ordinary people have been, all along, what drives the climate movement’s effort to save the planet from the worst effects of the climate crisis. What the climate emergency demands of us and what capitalism does to us are at war with each other, and big tech is a ruthless new version of robber-baron capitalism, with new tools and powers for the same old agenda of consolidating power at the top. While Silicon Valley’s remake of so many parts of our lives could have been elegantly environmental and empowering for ordinary people, mostly it’s been profit-driven. Citizens have used emerging technologies for justice and equality at least since the activists of Tiananmen Square in 1989 used fax machines and the 1999 shutdown of the World Trade Organisation in Seattle was organised by email, but the liberatory ideals of those who use a technology are often at odds with those who shape and control it. Liberation movements use Facebook, for example, but Facebook has also found itself party to genocide and the corruption of elections. If you look at the current clashes in Hong Kong or the dire situation in China overall, the new surveillance capacities, including facial recognition, have strengthened the hand – or rather the eyes – of a Big Brother government, making resistance more dangerous and privacy more elusive. China is now exporting its facial-recognition technology, threatening the rest of us with losing what those inside China have already lost. The ethos behind what big tech offers is usually a libertarian idea of isolation and individualism sweetened with convenience. Take transportation: the ability of big data to understand complex dynamics could have been used – and is, by some minor operators – to make public transit better. But what have Silicon Valley’s titans offered us? Driverless cars for the future, and “rideshare” cars in the present that have undermined the living wages of the taxi industry and flooded cities around the world with more fossil-fuel-burning engines. Elon Musk’s Tesla cars and battery systems may be the one climate-positive to emerge from Silicon Valley proper, but they’re outliers, and Teslas are still private cars. At the very moment when we needed people to get out of their cars, Lyft and Uber have developed a model to get people back into them. Transit expert Bruce Schaller concluded last year that transportation network companies (TNCs) “compete mainly with public transportation, walking and biking, drawing customers from these non-auto modes based on speed of travel, convenience and comfort. About 60% of TNC users in large, dense cities would have taken public transportation, walked, biked or not made the trip if TNCs had not been available.” He also concluded, “TNCs have added 5.7 billion miles of driving annually in the Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC metro areas.” In the San Francisco Bay Area, many of the Lyft and Uber drivers live in poorer regions and drive long distances in order to chauffer the more affluent around in increasingly car-clogged metropolises. The dystopia that is Silicon Valley, as it annexes more and more of the Bay Area, shows that the tech overlords have little interest in a better world, as opposed to a more profitable one for themselves. Big tech itself uses more and more electricity for server farms and networks managing more and more of our activities. A decade or so ago you might have watched a DVD and all the juice involved was on your DVD player and TV monitor; now we stream our entertainment. A recent report concluded that the share of digital technologies in global greenhouse gas emissions has increased by half since 2013, from 2.5% to 3.7% of global emissions. The explosion of video uses (Skype, streaming, etc) and the increased consumption of short-lifespan digital equipment are the main drivers of this inflation. More than that, these technologies that keep us glued to our devices and their corporate-managed content keep us apart from each other. Human beings are at their best when they live and act as citizens (a word I use without reference to citizenship status). This means decentralised power, democracy as equality and participation, and information systems that are accountable, transparent and reliable. It depends on us being able to experience ourselves and each other as members of the public. I have long believed that means, in part, having unmediated contact with each other in public spaces, on coexisting with strangers and a diversity of human beings.  Human beings are at their worst when they are consumers, locked into the miserable pursuit of satisfaction through the isolation of individual consumption – particularly when that shopping and consuming is done online (and when, as with Instagram, we learn to turn ourselves into commodities). Though many have used technology to further democracy and participation, big tech doesn’t want us to be citizens. It wants us to be consumers. To address the climate crisis we need to be citizens – free, powerful, with our private lives private and our public lives vivid, energised and safe. If we do what the climate requires of us we will decentralise energy production, breaking up the fossil fuel companies and oligarchies and building solar and wind and other renewable technologies that use resources that belong to no one and everyone. The beautiful underlying metaphor here is that decentralising literal power – as the juice that runs our machines – can and should mean decentralising social and political power. But big tech has been about consolidation of power, and it has created a new billionaire class that advocates in its own self-interest and against those of the deep future and the broad majority. It has chosen to be the problem rather than the solution. • Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist. Her most recent book is Whose Story Is This? Old Conflicts, New Chapters"
"The International Criminal Court is not known for prosecuting people responsible for huge oil slicks, chopping down protected rainforests or contaminating pristine land. But these people may now one day find themselves on trial in The Hague. The move was announced by chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in a recent policy document that contains a new and welcome focus on the prosecution of individuals for human atrocities that are committed by destroying the environment in which we live and on which we depend.  The document doesn’t change the law applied by the court. There is no new crime of ecocide for instance. Instead, it sets out the types of cases that the court will now select and prioritise for prosecution. These will include the illegal exploitation of natural resources, cases of environmental destruction, and “land grabbing”, where investors buy up vast areas of poor countries. The International Criminal Court, or ICC, has already shown a willingness to apply its laws to situations involving environmental destruction. Between 2009 and 2010, then-prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo successfully obtained arrest warrants from the court against the president of Sudan, Omar Al-Bashir, for acts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Among other acts, these alleged crimes involved the contamination of wells and water pumps in Darfur to target and destroy certain groups of people. Al-Bashir’s trial has not yet commenced as he continues to evade arrest. But this is not the first time the world has witnessed genocide through environmental means. In the early 1990s, for example, Saddam Hussein diverted the giant Tigris and Euphrates rivers in order to drain the Mesopotamian marshes in southern Iraq, a place widely regarded as the location of the Garden of Eden. Hussein wanted to destroy the community of Marsh Arabs that lived there, in reprisal for attempting an uprising against him. While the ICC cannot prosecute cases that took place before it was established in 2002, this type of environment-based genocide may well be the focus of future prosecutions. There is nothing to stop the court from holding individuals such as CEOs responsible for international crimes. Making entire corporations criminally accountable is a more controversial prospect, however, and would represent a paradigm shift in international law.  But the new emphasis on environment-based crimes needs such a shift. Imagine: the ICC investigating corporate officers and corrupt state officials who might conspire to kill or evict groups of indigenous people from their native land in order to exploit natural resources such as oil, timber and minerals. We could indeed see businessmen or politicians joining the warlords in the dock. A focus on these issues at the highest levels of international justice would make it clear that nobody can hide behind the corporate veil, operate with impunity in the fog of war or commit gross human rights abuses in the name of “development” and progress. The growth of crops for palm oil, for example, is frequently linked to gross and systematic human rights abuses that could breach international criminal law. Making someone criminally responsible under international law for these acts could act as a catalyst for the entire industry to clean up its act. We may nonetheless have to temper our expectations. It’s easy enough to think of previous conflicts that have resulted in serious environmental damage: the use of Agent Orange, along with cloud seeding to cause heavy rain to “make mud, not war”, during the conflict in Vietnam in the early 1970s; the 800 oil-rig fires set by Iraq in the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War; the pollution of the Danube as a result of damage to oil refineries and chemical plants in Kosovo during the 1999 NATO air strikes. But all these took place before the court was established in 2002 and thus are beyond its remit.  But what of those conflicts that have taken place since the ICC was set up in 2002? In Lebanon the 2006 bombing of the Jiyeh Power Station resulted in one of the largest ever oil spills in the Mediterranean Sea. In the 2008-2009 conflict in the Gaza Strip in Palestine toxic materials seriously contaminated the soil and water supplies. Both conflicts resulted in damage that may indeed breach the ICC’s definition of an environmental war crime. However, such situations remain outside the court’s jurisdiction as relevant states had not ratified the ICC’s statute at the time. While the court’s new policy is welcome, it is not a silver bullet. People convicted may be responsible for causing harm to thousands of victims and irreparable environmental damage. Putting someone in jail won’t “unharm” their victims, regrow the forest or clean up the oil slick.  This is why we should look at compensation as well as punishment. Compensation-based models of liability may be more help for both human victims and the environment – and more of a deterrent to potential perpetrators. One example of this in practice comes from Iraq where, following the oil fires during the 1991 Gulf War, the UN Security Council established a Compensation Commission. The commission was funded by the sale of Iraqi oil and gave money to victims of the attacks and financed environmental reparations. It’s great that environmental crimes are now being considered at the highest level of global justice. But the ICC alone isn’t enough. A thorough approach also requires individuals and corporate bodies to become financially liable for the consequences of environment-based atrocities."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSurely most readers here can remember the furious reaction of environmentalists, media, and alarmist scientists when George W. Bush refused to sign on to the Kyoto Treaty in 2001. He was immediately labelled the dumbest man on the planet when it came to climate science for that refusal. Later, a good part of Al Gore’s AIT was aimed at ridiculing him and marginalizing skeptics as flat-earthers. The Earth was warming and the consensus was overwhelming, they told us.

George W. Bush told us there was no scientific consensus way back in 2000. (Photo by Shawn Clark of Lazyeights Photography, GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later, Wikipedia)
So we ask: just who are the real flat-earthers today?
The online UAE Khaleej Times has written a piece on the global warming stop reported by The Times, quoting a George W. Bush comment made in a presidential debate in the year 2000.
‘Some of the scientists, I believe, haven’t they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming? There’s a lot of differing opinions and before we react I think it’s best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what’s taking place.’

Twelve years later, his statement actually seems quite true.  While recent scientific studies have been warning people that the Arctic is melting at record-breaking speed, a new report by the UK Met office dampens the predictions of environmental doom by claiming that global warming, in fact, stopped 16 years ago.”
The Khaleej Times also writes that 2010 being declared the hottest year is “a claim that is quite obviously refuted by the findings of the report”. Moreover, the Khaleej Times states what is today becoming increasingly obvious and it is what George Bush tried to tell us 12 years ago: there is no agreement on global warming science. The consensus is dead. In fact, it was never alive. The Khaleej Times writes (my emphasis):
…global warming is a sphere that has witnessed very little action by the international community. And that’s partially because there’s little agreement over the scope and seriousness of the phenomenon that we are facing.“
When it comes to global warming science, the Khaleej Times concedes: George Bush was right. Gore, the media and “climate scientists” were dead wrong.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: See debate video in German: http://www.swissecs.ch/de/live-blog/3. All Stocker had for arguments was: 1) insisting Mann’s phony hockey stick was still valid 2) claiming there’s scientific consensus, and 3) we can trust the models! Their science is that bad, folks. I never would have believed it. The IPCC is really looking like a comedy act. 
One of the main features at this year’s Swiss Climate and Energy Summit (Bern Switzerland, 12-14 September) was a debate between IPCC leading climate scientist Prof. Thomas Stocker and renewable energy expert and chemist Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt.
Needless to say the atmosphere was electrified, with an audience of almost 400. Unfortunately there still is no video of this debate, but the online Berner Zeitung daily (BZ) of Bern wrote up a report, and yes, they too had to concede that skeptic Vahrenholt won the debate.
The BZ called Vahrenholt “rhetorically tough” and wrote he needed “only 10 seconds to warm up his argumentation machinery”.
In the article, the BZ comes across as being no fan of Vahrenholt, calling his arguments “luring” and claiming he bases his skepticism on a “mind construction which laymen have difficulty detaching themselves from”. Vahrenholt’s findings shows that the sun is at least as responsible as, if not more, than CO2 for the global warming of the last decades and that solar activity will provide us with extra decades for revamping our energy supply.
The BZ writes that Vahrenholt believes “leading scientists of the UN IPCC colossally exaggerated the dimensions of the warming in their prognoses. And with them, they have legitimised a political hysteria, which has led to a grotesque wave of subsidies.” The BZ quotes Vahrenholt:
‘We need more sense of proportion,’ and not the madness we find in countries like Germany, which ‘gets as much sunshine as Alaska’ and hyper-subsidizes photovoltaic plantations.”

The BZ writes that Vahrenholt got loud applause.
Meanwhile, warmist Thomas Stocker found it difficult to maintain his cool, calling Vahrenholt’s science “audacious” and that the stagnant global temperatures over the last (15) years “is normal for climatic warming phases.”
Clearly Vahrenholt had Stocker on the defensive. The BZ writes:
Stocker also made it clear that progress in climate science always raises new questions.”
Indeed this is true. So how can the science be settled and why do the warmist scientists go to such extremes to avoid having to face them?
The applause for Stocker, the BZ writes, was quiet.
The outcome aside, we at least have to give Stocker credit for showing up to debate in public.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew CO2 report! Expect the mainstream media to begin their chorus of impending doom and gloom now that the latest annual global CO2 report has been released.
Warmist energy and climate website CO2-Handel reports here that once again global CO2 emissions have increased, reaching a record level in 2012!  Yet CO2 Handel forgets to tell us that global temperature hasn’t risen in almost 15 years:

Atmospheric CO2 has been rising for years, but global temps are going in the opposite direction! Source: woodfortrees.org (Straight lines drawn in by hand by NTZ).
According to an annual report prepared by the EU Commission and Dutch PBL research organization, man pumped another 34 billion tons of CO2 into the Earth’s atmosphere.  The report was made public in Italy yesterday.

The report says China now produces as much CO2 per capita as Europe. Globally, CO2 emissions in 2011 were 3% higher, despite Europe and USA cutting their emissions 3% and 2% respectively (due in large part to the relatively warm winter and the global economic crisis).

Emissions in China, however, surged 9% primarily due to growing steel and cement production. India’s emissions jumped 6%. And because these countries are a long way from being optimally developed, even greater CO2 emissions there and in the other developing countries are inevitable. Don’t expect CO2 to be curbed anytime soon.
CO2 Handel also writes:
But the experts see a shimmer of hope: The share of renewable energy foremost sun, wind and biomass in energy production has quadrupled between 1992 and 2011.”
But at what cost, and has it stopped CO2 emissions?
And looking at the above temperature chart, why would anyone even want to curb CO2 emissions? The sooner we get to 500 ppm, the better. At that point, today’s developing countries will have reached a standard of living that is humane.
Final note: A few readers may claim I’m cherry-picking with the start-point of the chart. Look at it as you wish. The fact remains that temperature has ignored CO2 15 years.  I’ll leave it up to them to find the “missing heat”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWarmist site CO2 Handel here presents an interview with Germany’s Minister of Research and Education, Annette Schavan, on the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), which will fly up to 15 km altitude and take extensive measurements of the lower stratosphere.
The aircraft’s instruments will allow measurement of complex atmospheric relationships. So much for understanding the atmosphere and having properly modeled it.
In the interview, Frau Schavan goes on why this is important and what they hope to accomplish with HALO. Let’s skip her blah blah blah and get to the part of the interview that made my eyebows go off my head. She is asked the question: “So, what about climate change? Time and again we keep hearing doubt about the warnings being exaggerated.”
Schavan responds:
The discussion is not about if all climate simulations are really going to turn out like this, or like that. It’s about us not losing any more time. We have to act to curb climate change, we have to start projects to learn more about it.”
Those are the comments of Germany’s Minister of Education and Research…the John Holdren of Germany. Reliable forecasts are not important? Who cares whether the science is right or wrong, let’s just act like it is? Let’s just embark on the path to economic suicide? This is the new standard of stupid.
So obviously the issue was never about science. It’s about hurrying up with their little coup.

"The benefits of spending time outdoors are well known. Whether travelling for an hour to reach open countryside or simply walking five minutes to a nearby urban park, being in and around nature makes us happier and healthier. Across entire societies, better access to parks and gardens reduces crime and helps people get on with one another. Increasing the amount of nature and green space that people experience in their everyday lives should, therefore, result in noticeable improvements to public health and well-being. It could offer many billions in savings on social care and visits to the doctor. More and more cities are looking for ways to increase the number of parks and open areas so that we can all benefit. However, we still don’t really know what works best and why. Most research has focused solely on creating more green spaces and making them easily accessible, on the grounds that people will spend more time there and reap the benefits. And there is some intriguing evidence that nature reserves or other areas with more diverse wildlife provide even more benefits above and beyond a typical park or garden. But creating more parks is expensive – even simply maintaining the current ones is hard enough – let alone managing them to encourage more wildlife in our cities. Getting people to visit parks more often and for longer is difficult. Then there is the complex task of establishing whether either approach has worked; gathering crucial evidence to justify continued investment is practically impossible for an average parks department in an average city. Perhaps worrying about the finer points of what makes the “ideal” green space stops us from following other solutions, as there are a variety of cheaper alternatives that are easier to implement and which might have the potential to do more or less the same amount of “good” for people. For instance, if most of the benefits of an outdoor space come from providing the opportunity for people to socialise, play games and take in the sunshine, then do we need “real” nature at all? Synthetic nature is everywhere, particularly during the summer. Pop-up “parks” transform city streets into public green spaces by closing them to traffic and laying down AstroTurf. City beaches, such as those in Sheffield or Brixton in south London, import sand so families can play, relax and spend time out of doors. Piping birdsong into service stations leaves customers feeling happier. And the Pokémon Go phenomenon encourages gamers off the sofa to track down fantasy animals in the outdoor world. Evidence suggests that this synthetic nature can also be good for human well-being, as well as helping people live more active lives. Indeed, it appears to be possible to “trick” the human body into thinking that it is exposed to nature, such as when people exhibit higher pain tolerance while watching videos of mountains, waterfalls and colourful flowers, or nature videos and pictures of plants reducing stress levels in hospital waiting rooms or among blood donors. We’ve still a lot to learn here though as other research has suggested, that videos of nature are no better than brick walls when it comes to stress reduction. Perhaps we do get greater benefits in “real” natural spaces, with a diversity of real wildlife, natural habitats and landscapes. There is also growing evidence that it is the animals, plants, and micro-organisms that we come into contact with that contribute to our health, rather than simply observing greenery. Natural green spaces also do many other jobs. Trees reduce air pollution and moderate the temperature by providing shade. And soil protects against flooding as even heavy rainfall can only seep through relatively slowly helping to prevent drainage systems overloading. In contrast, providing a thin veneer of nature over stone could be counterproductive. While natural grass and trees can reduce urban temperatures during the summer, artificial grass actually makes it hotter. But fake nature is still better than no nature. Where real trees and grass are absent or difficult to provide, we should embrace the synthetic and enjoy the fake plastic turf before winter drives us all indoors."
"At the Habitat III conference in Quito, the foundation of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile called for a “children-first” approach when designing the world’s roads with pedestrians in mind. But there is another group that urgently needs consideration too: the over-70s. One of the key concerns for people as they age is mobility. Though certainly many are happy to drive – and do so safely – or make use of public transport, there is still the issue of being physically mobile. Roads were built to facilitate getting masses of people from A to B quickly and conveniently, and yet the way that pathways are managed at present is not the most helpful for all who use them. In the UK, people over the age of 70 make up 11.8% of the population, and account for around 8% of pedestrian activity. Older people also count for a staggering 42.8% of all pedestrian fatalities: 191 deaths from 446 in total. That means almost half the pedestrians killed on roads come from just over 11% of the population.  Quite evidently there are simple things that can be done. Older people report feeling unsafe walking near busy and fast traffic so road speeds could be slowed, and more space made to walk away from fast vehicles. The upkeep of pavements could also be improved, to stop people from falling, and make sure they are accessible to those with poor balance or eyesight and at different times of the year; in the winter months main roads are gritted for vehicles but pavements for pedestrians are not.  A look at police data, collected at the scene of road collisions in Britain, shows that failure to judge vehicle speed is a significant factor in older people’s road collisions as pedestrians. This correlates with data in Australia, France, the Netherlands and several other countries. Generally, older pedestrians look less at traffic and accept significantly smaller gaps in traffic when crossing the road than younger pedestrians.   In the UK, there five types of crossing, each slightly different from the other: zebra, pelican, puffin, toucan and pegasus. The most common is the Pelican crossing, which is a traffic lighted crossing point with green and red phases for drivers and pedestrians. Government guidelines suggest that the time for the pedestrians’ green phase should be set at a walking speed of between one to 1.22 metres (around 4ft) per second – a speed found almost universally across the world. Despite this, the green phase for UK pedestrians is generally around four seconds, with a further six seconds of flashing green, giving people ten seconds to cross the road. My research has identified that this simply isn’t long enough. I found that 88% of people over 70 couldn’t cross the road given a time of 1.22 metres a second. For women, the statistic is even more stark: 94% couldn’t cross in this time. Those in poor health and, interestingly, those with lower socio-economic backgrounds walked much slower, making it harder for them to cross the road in time. Previous research has found similar results, suggesting that older people’s average speeds are between 0.7 and 0.9 metres a second. What may be regarded as a trivial issue by some can actually be hugely detrimental to the lives of older people: anxiety over crossing times can stop older people going out, making them housebound, increasing sedentary behaviour, loneliness and isolation. There has been some recognition of the plight of pedestrians across the world. New York City, through its Safer Streets for Seniors campaign, is evaluating the pedestrian environment in light of older people’s road safety. The state of Victoria, Australia, recently pledged to increase the length of the pedestrian phase on some of its crossings. And yet more can be done globally. Countries like the UK have an opportunity to show off their age-friendly credentials and create an environment that is more accessible for the world’s ageing society.  As the population of older people increases, it is vital that this issue is resolved well before then. Lobbying from groups wanting to increase crossing times has already begun, while some improvements are being made with the introduction of puffin crossings.  Walking is not only beneficial for health but also enables connections. As the world ages, it is vital that we help older generations continue to enjoy their lives – and ensuring accessibility and safety for pedestrians is a crucial part of this."
"Can climate change explain the conflict in Syria? Prince Charles once famously listed drought as a root cause of the war. Similar arguments have been made by other campaigners like UN climate envoy Mary Robinson, celebrities such as singer Charlotte Church, and even politicians like Bernie Sanders (who claimed “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism”).  Their views are supported by academic research on Syria and elsewhere. But now a new study in the journal PNAS suggests that the link between climate change and armed conflict is overhyped. This matters because once an entirely preventable conflict is described as a “climate war” it risks being perceived as “natural”. But though the climate may be changing, these conflicts aren’t inevitable. Calling Syria a climate war, for instance, means ignoring longer-term historical tensions across the region, and lets the humans involved off the hook. In their study Nina von Uexkull and colleagues examined the “conflict potential” of the sort of droughts that will become increasingly common under global warming, particularly in already arid and semi-arid areas. The researchers effectively combine three sets of data to look for any links: conflict event data for Asia and Africa over the past 25 years, ethnic settlement data (because ethnicity is often a key cause of conflict), and remote sensing data on what peasants and farmers grow on their agricultural land. Our well-meaning celebrities and politicians would perhaps be surprised to hear that Uexkull and colleagues found the impact of drought on conflict was generally “limited”. Drought does explain some of the variation in whether or not conflicts kick off, but the “substantive effect is modest” compared with ethnic political exclusion, proximity to pre-existing violence or various country-specific risk factors. Having said that, drought does make sustained conflict a lot more likely among groups of people in the least developed countries who depend on agriculture. These people are already very poor and are, as Uexkull and co put it, “particularly vulnerable to natural forces”. As with other climate change impacts, drought-driven conflict will most affect the already poor and vulnerable. Now, why should these findings not surprise us? First, we already know how resilient many communities can be when faced with climate change. Some rely on ancestral knowledge of how to adapt their agricultural practices to droughts, or they introduce new drought-resistant crops. Some have strong political backers in government, and are able live on hand-outs, while others are able to diversify their incomes. So, what this study by Uexkull and colleagues confirms is that most communities are in fact quite climate resilient. It generally takes a lot more than a dry spell to kick off a war. This should give us some hope that more intense weather events, such as severe droughts, do not automatically lead to more conflict or even civil war among those affected. Second, we already know that the most vulnerable communities, especially smallholding peasants in the poorest countries, are the least resilient to external shocks. These shocks can take the form of rapid political change, fluctuations in global commodity prices or – as discussed – severe droughts and other weather events. Global warming isn’t the first big shock to peasants around the world, and it won’t be the last. The very foundation of Britain’s industrial revolution – starting in the 17th century – was the enclosure of agricultural land, forcing millions of peasants into the cities to find often inhumane work in the sweatshops of Manchester and the other big industrial cities of northern England. The same process is still ongoing today, though the attention has shifted to sub-Saharan Africa, India, Latin America and other so-called “developing countries”. “Development” for peasants often means dispossession, land-grabbing or being exposed to the perils of global free trade. The very existence of the popular Fairtrade label suggests that free trade is not fair enough. Yet, even Fairtrade often cannot sustain small, vulnerable farmers’ livelihoods. My point? Climate change is merely the latest external shock to the livelihoods of poor communities who live off the land. That doesn’t justify it, of course. But it does mean that those worse affected have, to some extent, seen and dealt with this sort of problem before. So, of course, climate change will increase the likelihood of armed conflict among communities that already have very little. Of course, it is important, as Uexkulla and colleagues argue, to ensure poor communities who depend on agriculture are able to adapt to a warmer world. But let us not use climate change as a way to naturalise terrible conflicts such as the war in Syria. And let us not forget the disastrous history of how “development” has often treated peasant and smallholder farmers who feed the rest of the world."

"Environmental protests are now frequently reported in the media, and the green movement is, at last, getting the attention it deserves. But most of the focus is on the activities of groups, such as Extinction Rebellion, which are not strongly rooted in working-class organisations and communities. This is a problem because, if we want to build the broad-based support necessary for a radical transition to sustainability, we must recognise and build on all strands of environmentalism, especially that of the working class.  As a working-class woman who became an environmental justice academic, I have campaigned, researched and written extensively on “environmental classism” – the problem of mainstream environmental policymakers, practitioners, activists and academics often failing to understand and support working-class people. This leads to inequitable environmental burdens and alienation from mainstream environmentalism. Working-class people have, for centuries, been the most active and courageous environmentalists and this is often not recognised. The majority of the working-class people I interviewed for my new book said they were put off engaging with mainstream environmental organisations because of negative experiences.  In spite of this, many had organised their own local environmental campaigns, including to address pollution, preserve green space and resist toxic developments. Their activities rarely reach the media unless they are particularly creative or dramatic. One interviewee described how during a campaign to end a fly infestation caused by food waste being stored outside in their neighbourhood, a few activists “chased [the mayor of the city] around … dressed as a fly, which was interesting” and resulted in news coverage of the issue.  Some interviewees had also engaged in individual campaigns, such as one woman who had the water supplied to her house tested for pollutants. “I refused to pay the water bill, so they took me to court,” she said. The judge ordered her to pay, but also ordered for the water to be tested and it was found to be polluted. “They say they can’t do nothing about it. So what I do, rather than not pay the water at all, I pay what I think it is worth, for the flush of the toilet, and that’s what they’re going to have.” These largely unrecorded events are part of a hidden history of working-class environmentalism, which has been responsible for many successful campaigns. Mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Peak District in 1932 was a working-class struggle for the right to roam versus the rights of the wealthy to have exclusive use of moorlands for grouse shooting. It had a far-reaching impact, and helped secure walkers’ rights in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act in 2000. There is also the “environmental justice” movement, which originated in the United States during the 1980s, when working-class ethnic minority communities protested about hazardous industries being disproportionately located in their neighbourhoods. Around the world, environmental justice movements have since prevented the siting of toxic facilities in many working-class communities and there are similar struggles happening all over the country right now. These local battles can remain hidden because the people involved usually do not have the professional friends – in the media, in government and in academia – who could help draw attention to their work. This contributes to the illusion that environmentalism is the domain of middle-class people. We should also not overlook the massive trade union contribution to environmentalism through the struggle for health and safety in the workplace. Environmental standards are often developed only when illnesses among workers become too glaringly obvious to ignore. Although we assume that substances being used are safe, this is often not the case, as a 2017 Lancet  report on pollution and health revealed.   Even if not actually killed by those whose vested interests were threatened, drawing attention to the ecological damage or human toxicity of production has often meant the loss of a job and livelihood for trade unionists. The bravery of these working-class environmental heroes overshadows that of many middle-class environmentalists. There are numerous studies on byssinosis, silicosis, asbestosis and other conditions that show how concern for environmental health at work has had an impact on wider society and ecology. In 1899 the UK Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL) led a campaign against the use of lead in the manufacture of pottery, which was causing blindness, convulsions and death among the mostly female workforce, as well as affecting their unborn children. As a result of their work, we no longer use lead-glazed plates and cups. For almost 50 years, trade unions internationally have been calling for a “just transition” to sustainability. These struggles demonstrate that working-class people have been, and continue to be, environmental leaders. We are both metaphorically and literally at the coal-face of environmental deterioration because we tend to work in the most hazardous environments, live in the unhealthiest neighbourhoods, and are the least able to find individual solutions such as changing jobs and homes. With a greater direct experience of environmental degradation, we have a strong vested interest in achieving sustainability. The Green New Deal policies advocated by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the US and the Labour party in the UK build on this understanding, putting the labour movement at the forefront of a green transformation. Working-class environmentalism is alive and kicking. Let’s recognise and support that to create the broad-based green transition we so desperately need. • Dr Karen Bell is a senior lecturer in human geography and environmental justice at the University of West of England, Bristol.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe mainstream media, and I’m sure many within Fritz Vahrenholt’s own party, have been expending huge effort to keep his message and his sceptic book Die kalte Sonne bottled up. That effort has failed. Vahrenholt is getting his message out.
Vahrenholt’s message along with the ever growing hopelessness for success we were told to expect from renewable energies is making a profound energy policy realignment inevitable. Already it’s beginning today in the UK, Germany, Spain, and Holland – to name a few. Mandatory feed-in tariffs are being massively scaled back.
This morning I was pleased to find that East Midlands MEP Roger Helmer took the time to leave a reader comment, which I now gladly present here as a post. Here’s what Roger wrote concerning Vahrenholt and UK energy policy:
He’s spoken several times in Brussels — the EU’s Heart of Darkness.  It’s a delicious irony that he has a long track record as a German green activist and a leading player in renewable energy.
Meantime here in the UK, the United Kingdom Independence Party (currently running third in the opinion polls) is preparing to launch (Sept 21st) a new Energy Policy Statement, becoming the first significant UK party explicitly to reject climate alarmism, to oppose renewables, and to propose a rational energy policy based on nuclear, gas and coal.
At Helmer’s website here he writes:

The EU is wrong on its policies on climate change and energy which are driving up energy bills, harming our industries, pushing businesses and jobs and investment offshore and forcing millions into fuel poverty. The EU ‘renewable’ energy rules will double electricity bills by 2020 and render our industries uncompetitive. Wind farms are an inefficient, inconsistent and punishingly expensive blight on our landscape which need backing up with conventional generation anyway. UKIP would scrap wind turbine subsidies and adopt a sensible energy strategy using a range of energy sources including nuclear and shale gas and coal, to free us from dependence on foreign oil and gas. By embracing gas and nuclear we could deliver the EU’s emissions targets (if you care about such things) more quickly and cheaply than the current plan, without the use of a single wind turbine!”
Climate ‘science’ does not even remotely resemble real science
One thing that needs to be viewed as a huge red flag by all citizens is the overall condescending attitude permeating through the IPCC climate science community. It’s an attitude that has nothing to do with science. Science does not progress by insisting you have the right answer from the outset, and that you are always right. It is not about stubbornly clinging to the first theory that emerges just because it’s yours or your friends find it fashionable. Science has nothing to do with excluding, altering, and filtering data you don’t agree with. And it certainly has nothing to do with shutting down open debate and the expression of alternative ideas. Sadly, all of the above ills are very deeply embedded in the corrupt culture of the IPCC “science” community.
Indeed it is high time to reject climate alarmism.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt have sifted through recent scientific literature looking for evidence that global sea level rise has accelerated over the last 3 decades.
Their result: “The scientific facts speak very clearly against it. It is only a question of time before the idea disappears from the public discussion.”
Lüning and Vahrenholt examined recently published papers on the subject and they present their findings (translated in English and condensed by P Gosselin).
================================
Case studies from around the world: no evidence of accelerating sea level rise over the last 30 years
by Sebastian Lüning, Fritz Vahrenholt
1. GPS-monitored global tide gauges
In 2009 Guy Wöppelmann et al examined what effects vertical land movement had on the sea level data from tide gauges and published their results in the Geophysical Research Letters. The scientists evaluated globally 227 stations whose elevation was monitored by GPS. 160 of these stations were located at a distance maximum 15 km from the coast. By measuring the vertical movement of the tide gauges, they were able to apply a correction. From this they calculated a mean global sea level rise of 1.61 mm/year over the last century. Figure 1 shows that sea level rise has remained constant since 1940 – no acceleration over the last 70 years!

Figure 1: Sea level development for that last 100 years for northern Europe (top) and northwest America (bottom) based on tide gauges. No acceleration since 1940. Source: Wöppelmann et al. (2009).
2. Arctic Ocean shows no acceleration

2. Another important paper appeared in June, 2012 in the Geophysical Research Letters. A team lead by Olivier Henry of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Toulouse, France, examined 62 tide gauges along the coast of Norway to Russia over the last 62 years. The study yielded some surprising results. Beginning in 1950 Arctic sea level remained relatively stable (Figure 2). Sea level then began to rise in 1980 and reached a high point in 1990, which has yet to be surpassed. From 1995 to 2009 the authors calculated a mean sea level rise rate of 4 mm/year.
What is especially fascinating is that sea level at this region was in sync with the Arctic Oscillation (AO), see Figures 2 and 3. There’s been a decoupling only for the last 10 years, which is too short a time period to draw any sound conclusions. One thing is certain: The AO will also impact sea level behaviour there in the future.
Not only does temperature impact sea levels globally, but so do natural oceanic cycles. Ocean cycles can lower or raise sea levels, and accelerate or slow them down. An overall acceleration in sea level rise in the Arctic Ocean due to melting ice over the last 30 years cannot be detected.

Figure 2: From 1950 to 2000 sea level changes are predominantly in sync with the Arctic Oscillation (black curve). Figure from Henry et al (2012).
 

Figure 3: Arctic Oscillation Index (Source: Wikipedia).
3. New Zealand
Now let’s go to the other side of the globe – New Zealand, where only a few tide gauges go back to 1900. John Hannah and Robert Bell of the University of Otago and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research respectively published a paper in January 2012 in the Journal of Geophysical Research. The new curves show that sea level rise has been steady since 1940 (Figure 4). The development in New Zealand is similar to the global situation. The long-term New Zealand trend is 1.7 mm sea level rise per year.

Figure 4: Sea level development from four New Zealand coastal tide gauges. Here there’s been no acceleration in sea level rise over the last 70 years. Figure from Hannah & Bell (2012).
Particularly interesting in the Hannah and Bell study is that New Zealand sea level rise is characterized by decadal cycles. Sea level rose and dropped in sync with the Pacific ocean cycles (Southern Oscillation Index, SOI and others), see Figure 5. Also see report from the NIPCC.

In January, 2012, an international team led by Roland Gehrels of the University of Plymouth published a new study in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters examining the sea level history of Tasmania. Using cores taken from salt marshes, they reconstructed sea level development for the last 6000 years. Especially interesting are the last 200 years.
Sea level rose between 1900 and 1950 at a rate of 4.2 mm per year (Figure 6), but slowed down considerably in the second half of the 20th century to an average of only 0.7 mm per year – similar to southern New Zealand. No sea level rise acceleration is detectable in the Australian New Zealand region over the last decades. In fact, just the opposite is true. Sea level rise slowed down in the second half of the century.

Figure 6: Sea level rise around Tasmania over the last 200 years. Sea level rise slowed down during the second half of the 20th century. Source of diagram: Gehrels et al. (2012).
5. Tarawa Atoll
Simon Donner of the University of British Columbia closely examined sea level development for the last 20 years for the Japanese atoll Tarawa and published his findings in the journal Eos in April 2012. Now hold on to your seat: tide gauges show that the sea level around Tarawa did not rise at all during this period (Figure 7)!
Moreover, the sea level fluctuations depicted by the curve are mainly due to the El Nino effect. In 1998 sea level dropped a full 45 cm as the transition was made from a powerful El Nino to a La Nina. Also see articles by Mark Lynas and Roger Pielke Sr.

6. Bay of Biscay
In May, 2012, a study by Eduardo Leorri of East Carolina University appeared in the Quaternary Science Reviews. Examining sediment cores, the scientists studied sea level development of the Bay of Biscay for the period going back 10,000 years. As Figure 8 shows, sea level rise slowed down 7000 years ago.

Figure 8: Sea level rise in the Bay of Biscay. Diagram source: Leorri et al. (2012).
Leorri and his team compared the results to coastal tide gauge readings from the region for the last 200 years. From 1800 to 1900 (Figure 9), sea level was stagnant. Then it began to rise around 1900. But no unusual acceleration can be detected over the last 30 years.

7. Tony Brown, sea level of the last 2000 years.
A comprehensive presentation of pre-industrial sea level development was made by Tony Brown, who published his results at Judith Curry’s blog (blog article, detailed pdf-version). Readers should refer to pages 23-26, where Brown brings up some interesting points on sea level rise over the last 2000 years. Referring to the work of Aslak Grinsted of the University of Lapland from 2010 in the Journal Climate Dynamics, it is discussed whether the sea level of today has reached the levels of the Medieval Warm Period.
In any case, natural and anthropogenic causes have to be considered and properly attributed. Like the Hockey Stick episode, sea level development can in no way be considered as a monotone and non-eventful phenomenon. It too has varied naturally over the centuries, and the natural factors will continue to play a major role.

Figure 10: Sea level development model of the last 2000 years. The bold black curve starting in 1700 is a geological reconstruction by Jevrejeva et al. (2006). Modified as to Grinsted et al. (2010).
In May, 2012 at WUWT, Paul Homewood led an interesting discussion on whether sea level rise accelerated during the recent decades when compared to the 20th century. He concludes that satellite measurements may be flawed.
In summary, our global sea level journey produced some good results, some very remarkable results, depending on your point of view. Signs of an accelerating sea level over the last 30 years could not be found in any of the studies.
It doesn’t look good for the acceleration fans.

"The film Deepwater Horizon, starring Mark Wahlberg, captures the chaos and drama that ensued after the massive fireball that engulfed the oil rig of the same name in 2011, which killed 11 people and injured many others. The film dramatises the gruesome ordeal which saw more than 100 crew members battle to survive the inferno of sweltering heat and mayhem.  But the scientific frenzy that followed in the ensuing months was almost as dramatic. And now, just over six years on, there is still much that science has yet to uncover about the spill in the hope of preparing us for the next big one.  Where, for instance, did all the oil actually end up? And what did all the chemicals dumped in the ocean to break up the oil do to the marine life that survived the spill? These questions and more remain unanswered. The Deepwater Horizon disaster stands in the record books as the largest oil spill in US history. Following the blowout on April 20, 2010, 4.1m barrels (0.7m tonnes) of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of almost three months. Only the 1979 Ixtoc-I oil spill, also in the Gulf of Mexico, ranks in the same league.  It was a particularly complex and challenging spill to deal with and study, for several reasons. The exploratory well below Deepwater Horizon was itself an extraordinary engineering feat, the deepest the oil and gas industry had ever drilled in the ocean. The spill occurred about 1.5km below the sea surface, again, the deepest in history. And, because it occurred in such deep water, a good chunk of the oil didn’t rise to the surface as in a usual spill – instead, an unprecedented “oil plume” formed below the surface and lingered there for months.  Rarely has a human-made disaster ever stopped the clock on the research programmes of so many scientists in a nation. Scientists from universities and government-funded agencies all over the US put their work on hold in order to turn their attention to Deepwater Horizon. More than 400 scientific peer-reviewed papers have now been published on the spill, and they’ve revealed a lot of important information.  Within weeks of the spill occurring scientists reported the formation of a massive plume of crude oil a kilometre below the surface that stretched for about 30km and was 300 metres high. It was difficult to track, but nonetheless was intensively studied as researchers realised they had a unique opportunity. Within this oil cloud, scientists also showed that certain types of oil-degrading bacteria had bloomed and that these microbes played a fundamental role in degrading the oil in the deep as well as on sea surface oil slicks of the Gulf.  Research also demonstrated that the oil caused lasting damage to Gulf coast marshes, and that it affected the spawning habitat of Bluefin tuna along the south-east coast of North America. After the spill, scientists noticed huge quantities of lightly-coloured mucus-like particles or blobs on the sea surface in and around the spill site. These “blobs” could be barely big enough to see, or large enough to fit in your hand. Nothing of this magnitude had been observed before, although there is evidence that similar particles had also formed during the Ixtoc-I spill.  It turned out this was caused by oil sticking to “marine snow” – small specs of dead plankton, bacteria, the mucus they produce, and so on, that clump together near the surface and then fall through the ocean just as real snow falls through the sky. As this “marine oil snow” sank through the water, it took with it a large proportion of the oil from the sea surface and eventually settled on the seabed. Just over six years later, scientists are still trying to understand the full extent of Deepwater Horizon’s impacts on the seabed, beaches and marshes of the Gulf of Mexico. This is actually not a great length of time for science to fully understand a massive and complex spill like this, so its no wonder that some things still remain a mystery.  We know that a lot of the oil from the leaky well that reached the surface made it to the Gulf coast, for instance, and caused acute damage to coastal ecosystems. But we do not know where the deepwater oil plume ended up or what its impact was. Likewise we still don’t know the longer-term impact of the expansive surface oil slicks in the Gulf. We also need to better understand the impacts of the chemicals that were used to disperse the oil after the spill. Around 7m litres of a dispersant called Corexit was sprayed into the sea by planes or ships. However, given oil dispersant is essentially strong household soap, these chemicals posed a problem for coral and other marine organisms in the Gulf, including the same oil-degrading bacteria that are so critical in the natural bio-degradation process after the spill. Research shows the dispersant used was probably counter-productive.  There is still much to be learnt about what Corexit and other dispersants do to marine life in the longer term. This is important as dispersants are a first line of response to combat oil spills at sea. Research on the spill is likely to continue for the next few decades. With many oil and gas reservoirs coming to the end of their lives the industry is expanding into the Arctic and other challenging environments, and exploring ever-deeper ocean waters. Another spill like Deepwater Horizon cannot be discounted. What science has already uncovered, and what it will do in years to come, is crucial and should help to better prepare us to deal with the next big one."

"“Too much dirt,” says Justine about the difficulties of cooking with charcoal for her household of five. She’s a mother and market trader in the town of Sogakope in south-east Ghana, and referring to the soot that is produced because charcoal doesn’t burn completely. The reason she still uses it? “Cheap,” she shrugs.   Justine’s neighbour Janet is also complaining. She cooks with firewood but it produces too much smoke. It is a typical problem in a country where most cooking involves burning fuels like these. Women do most of the cooking and collect the fuel, and they are becoming more and more aware of the dangers of air pollution in the home.  As many as three billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia still primarily use fuels like these for cooking, and 4m die every year from indoor air pollution. It is the fourth highest cause of death after HIV/AIDS, lack of clean water and tuberculosis. That’s more than malaria, by the way. To address these dangers and also the increasing costs and carbon emissions from such fuels, since 2010 I have been involved in research to develop and test an alternative: hydrogen gas produced by solar powered electrolysis.  The vision is that countries would supplement or even replace central power plants that burn gas, coal or nuclear fuels by installing solar farms that collect the sun’s energy with arrays of photovoltaic panels. Some of the electricity would be diverted to large electrolysers that would produce hydrogen by passing electric current through water.   You then distribute the hydrogen to households for cooking. This could be by pipeline in a similar way to how countries like the UK receive natural gas at present. Or it could be through storage containers – compressed gas canisters or ideally low-pressure metal hydride tanks. Households would then use modified gas stoves adapted to safely burn the gas.  Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. It has no carbon emissions and offers important improvements in health and quality of life. It also reduces deforestation for firewood and charcoal. Basically, you are cooking with water.  We looked at how such a system would work in three countries where most cooking is done with fossil fuels: Ghana, Jamaica and Indonesia. Most Ghanaians cook with firewood, coal and animal dung, while a small percentage use LPG. Indoor air pollution is a particularly murderous problem, especially for poorer people. When households get wealthier, they swap charcoal and firewood for LPG.  In Jamaica, most households cook with LPG but have to endure high costs from importing it into the country. In Indonesia, most cooking is done by firewood, followed by LPG and kerosene. Energy poverty is a major social issue, with the poor forced to use both pollutant energy sources and inefficient traditional cooking devices. In each country we envisioned a system where a small solar farm distributed electrolytic hydrogen to rural communities of 20 households. We were able to show that you could achieve very significant reductions in CO₂ emissions. Jamaica is now trialling a small-scale system using compressed hydrogen gas cylinders while there have been discussions about doing something similar in African countries.  The main drawback at present is the capital cost, particularly if you use metal hydride storage. It has the advantage of being safer than distributing hydrogen under high pressure, but is prohibitively expensive at present. By my calculations, the cost per household for this system in Ghana is £2,171 a year for everything including distribution, the stove, solar power and electrolysis. Setting up such a system would clearly require substantial state or organisational support. Use compressed hydrogen and it comes down to £404 a year – hence the Jamaican trial. The good news is that costs should fall in the coming years as demand for hydrogen storage increases – witness the fall in the price of solar panels in the past decade. If the global shift towards a hydrogen economy becomes a reality, metal hydride technology will surely move in the same direction. The cost of electrolytic hydrogen is already projected to keep falling year after year, for example.  It may be between ten and 20 years before cooking systems like these can become a reality on a large scale, but the potential is clear enough: if we can overcome the cost issues, there is a viable way of tackling an age-old killer and making a big difference to the environment. Justine and Janet just need to hang on."
"“We call it hedonistic sustainability,” says Jacob Simonsen of the decision to put an artificial ski slope on the roof of the £485m Amager Resource Centre (Arc), Copenhagen’s cutting-edge new waste-to-energy power plant. “It’s not just good for the environment, it’s good for life.” Skiing is just one of the activities that Simonsen, Arc’s chief executive, and Bjarke Ingels, its lead architect, hope will enhance the latest jewel in Copenhagen’s sustainability crown. The incinerator building also incorporates hiking and running trails, a street fitness gym and the world’s highest outdoor climbing wall, an 85-metre “natural mountain” complete with overhangs that rises the full height of the main structure.  It’s all part of Copenhagen’s plan to be net carbon-neutral by 2025. Even now, after a summer that saw wildfires ravage the Arctic Circle and ice sheets in Greenland suffer near-record levels of melt, the goal seems ambitious. In 2009, when the project was formulated, it was positively revolutionary. “A green, smart, carbon-neutral city,” declared the cover of the climate action plan, before detailing the scale of the challenge: 100 new wind turbines; a 20% reduction in both heat and commercial electricity consumption; 75% of all journeys to be by bike, on foot, or by public transport; the biogas-ification of all organic waste; 60,000 sq metres of new solar panels; and 100% of the city’s heating requirements to be met by renewables. Radical and far-reaching, the scheme dared to rethink the very infrastructure underpinning the city. There’s still not a climate project anywhere else in the world that comes close. And, so far, it’s working. CO2 emissions have been reduced by 42% since 2005, and while challenges around mobility and energy consumption remain (new technologies such as better batteries and carbon capture are being implemented), the city says it is on track to achieve its ultimate goal. More significant still is that Copenhagen has achieved this while continuing to grow in traditional economic terms. Even as some commentators insist that nothing short of a total rethink of free-market economics and corporate structures is required to stave off global catastrophe, the Danish capital’s carbon transformation has happened alongside a 25% growth in its economy over two decades. Copenhagen’s experience will be a model for other world cities. The sentiment that lies behind Arc’s conception as a multi-use public good – “hedonistic sustainability” – is echoed by Bo Asmus Kjeldgaard, former mayor of Copenhagen for the environment and the man originally tasked, back in 2010, with making the plan a reality. “We combined life quality with sustainability and called it ‘liveability’,” says Kjeldgaard, now CEO of his own climate adaptation company, Greenovation. “We succeeded in building a good narrative around this, one that everybody could believe in.” The idea was first floated in the late 1990s, when the newly elected Kjeldgaard had a vision of Copenhagen as the environmental capital of Europe. His enthusiasm ran into political intransigence, however, and despite some success, a lack of budget meant most of his work became “just another branding exercise – it was greenwashing”. But after stints as mayor of family and the labour market, and children and young people, he ended up back at environment in 2010 with renewed determination and, crucially, a broader mandate from the city council. “I said: ‘This time, we have to do it right,’” he recalls, “so we made detailed, concrete plans for every area, set the carbon target, and demanded the money and the manpower to make it a reality.” He brought on board more than 200 stakeholders, from businesses to academia to citizen representatives, and helped them develop 22 specific business plans and 65 separate projects. So far the plan appears on track: there has been a 15% reduction in heat consumption, 66% of all trips in the city are now by bike, on foot or public transport, and 51% of heat and power comes from renewables. The onus placed on ordinary Copenhageners to walk and cycle more, pay higher taxes (especially on cars) and put up with the inconvenience of infrastructure construction has generally been met with understanding and good grace. And while some people remain critical of the fact that Copenhagen airport is not factored into the CO2 calculations – it lies beyond the city’s boundaries – and grumble about precise definitions and formulae, dissent has been rare. This relative lack of nimbyism and carping about change can, says Frank Jensen, the city’s lord mayor, be traced to longstanding political traditions. “Caring for the environment and taking responsibility for society in general has been an integral part of the upbringing of many Danes,” he says. “Moreover, there is a general awareness that climate change now calls for immediate, ambitious and collective action.” A 2018 survey by Concito, a thinktank, found that such action was a top priority for voters. Jensen is keen to stress the cooperative nature of the plan and says “our visions have to be grounded in the everyday lives of people to be politically feasible”. Indeed, involving so many stakeholders, and allowing them to actively help shape both the ends and the means, has been key to the plan’s success so far and the continued goodwill it enjoys. “It’s so important to note that we [the authorities] cannot do this alone,” says Jørgen Abildgaard, Copenhagen’s executive climate programme director. Many businesses around the world have typically been reluctant to embrace sustainability when a dip in profits or inconvenience might be the result, but not in Copenhagen. Martin Manthorpe, director of strategy, business development and public affairs at NCC, one of Scandinavia’s largest construction and industrial groups, was brought in early on by Abildgaard to represent industry on the municipality’s climate panel, and to facilitate discussions with the wider business community. He thinks there are several reasons why. “The Danes have a trading mindset, meaning ‘What will I have to sell tomorrow?’ is just as important as ‘What am I producing today?’” he says. “Also, many big Danish companies are still ultimately family-owned, so the culture leans more towards long-term thinking.” It is, he says, natural for business to be concerned with issues around sustainability and be willing to endure short-term pain: “To do responsible, long-term business, you need to see yourself as part of the larger puzzle that is called ‘society’.” Furthermore, in Denmark climate change denial is given extremely short shrift. “We believe in the science,” says Anders Haugaard, a local entrepreneur. “Why wouldn’t you? We’re told sustainability brings only benefits and we’ve got no reason to be suspicious.” “No one would dare argue against the environment,” says his friend Claus Nielsen, a furniture maker and designer. “We’re such a rich country – change should be easy for us.” Nielsen talks about how enlightened his kids are – “my 11-year-old daughter is now a flexitarian” – and says that nowadays he mainly buys organic; Haugaard doesn’t see a problem with getting rid of petrol cars (the whole country is aiming to be fossil fuel-free by 2050). Above all, there’s a belief that sustainability need not make the city poorer: that innovation and “green growth” can be lucrative in and of themselves. “In Copenhagen, green transformation goes hand-in-hand with job creation, a growing economy and a better quality of life,” says Jensen. “We have also shown that it’s possible to combine this transition with economic growth and market opportunities for businesses, and I think that other countries can learn from our example.” Besides, as Jensen notes, there is little alternative, and even less time: “National states have failed to take enough responsibility, but cities have the power and will to create concrete solutions. We need to start accelerating their implementation – we need to act now.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Mann recently spewed another one of his patented fraudulent statements, the latest on storm frequency.
Well, here’s Dr. Stan Goldenberg from the Hurricane Centre in Florida in 2008. Recall that we haven’t seen much hurricane activity since!

At the 7.40 mark:
I do not know of any scientist yet, at the Hurricane Center, at the Hurricane Research Division, who believes that the recent activity is from AGW. They just don’t because they know the data.”
And here’s what Goldenberg said on opportunist scientists who claimed there was a connection, and the reaction at the Hurricane Center (8:17): “It was ludicrous! They were shocked at this. Nobody who really knew this data could believe it!”
Goldenberg ended his presentation with: “No trend anywhere that Hurricanes will increase with higher temperatures.”
This is a video Dr. Mann needs to go back and watch – just so that he realizes what a complete oddball he is on the subject. More proof that the alarmists are nothing but kooks and crackpots.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I thought I’d bring up one or two of the highlights of the Bern Debate between Fritz Vahrenholt and IPCC author Thomas Stocker. One highlight is Stocker getting all huffy and puffy about Vahrenholt calling Mann’s hockey stick a “Fälschung” (fake).

Bern Debate now on Youtube!
At the 4:50 mark Vahrenholt presents the infamous Michael Mann hockey stick graph and says “this graphic has been shown to be false, and was even in part faked”.
Then at the 14:50 mark, when asked why he went from being a warmist to a skeptic, Vahrenholt said he found too many things that didn’t fit and was surprised to discover that Mann’s stick was phony. Examining the science more closely, he found that many things just didn’t add up.
Having called Mann’s hockey stick a fake no less than three times in total, Stocker became indignant and accused Vahrenholt of provocation.
First off, there’s something I first have to get off my chest. Mr. Vahrenholt naturally has provoked in claiming three times that the climate curve by Michael Mann was fraudulent. That’s an accusation I vehemently reject. It’s an accusation that you cannot prove.”
At the 22:00 minute mark Vahrenholt got his chance and proved the stick was fake, summing up what Mann did in just a few sentences.
The fact of the matter is that the numerical models, the calculation operations which the IPCC relies on, are not able to reproduce the fluctuations of the past. We are talking about fluctuations on the order of plus or minus 0.5 degrees C. That’s not just something you can just leave off the table. The models are not able to completely depict reality. That’s the problem with the IPCC. The IPCC and its models cannot depict the clouds. And clouds have an awesome impact as you can imagine on the radiation and warming development of the Earth. And so that’s why it is somewhat interesting that you put yourself so massively behind Michael Mann, as he is cited in the Al Gore film where the curve is shown. This curve, has been forbidden to be shown by an English court without being accompanied by commentary because for the last 50 years he [Mann] noticed that his models with his tree rings are so wrong that he simply left them out. In his original curve they showed a cooling, and so that’s why he left them out! You can see in the e-mails how someone said “we have to hide the decline”, and others said ‘that’s a wonderful trick – let’s just tack on the thermometer record over the tree rings and no one will notice!’ So I find it interesting that you back Michael Mann. I know that Michael Mann later on had the Medieval Warm Period reappear.”

Vahrenholt then reminded Stocker there are numerous temperature reconstructions from all over the world and they all show cyclic temperature developments over the past thousand years.
Needless to say, the hockey stick was not brought up again during the debate.
At this point Stocker was out of arguments and countered (strangely) that he tallied up all the references in Vahrenholt’s book and found that 37.3% of them did not cite peer-reviewed literature, and therefore he found Vahrenholt audacious in challenging the IPCC reports.
Vahrenholt responded by explaining the difference between a book designed to communicate a message to the general public and a scientific assessment for policymakers:
That tells me what level you people operate at [laughter]. That’s a book that attempts to reach the people, a book that tries to convey the complex science. Of course I’ll also quote Der Spiegel; of course I’ll quote the NZZ when I want to explain how the debate stands in Switzerland. It is not a scientific body of literature that contains only scientific quotes. But of the 900 references, 600 are of original scientific sources. For the book to be interesting, it is necessary to quote Gerhard Schröder, and we quote Herr Schellnhuber, who said in 2007 – you can see it in Youtube – that in 35 years the Himalayan glaciers will be gone. You can go back and read it. Of course it is not a scientific source, but it is allowed.”
Now that’s killing two birds (Stocker and Schellnhuber) with one stone.
I expect a few members audience by now have picked up a copy of Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s book, Die kalte Sonne, and that we’ll soon have a few more skeptics on our side.
The moderator also seemed to be skeptical as well, expressing doubt about the models and asking Stocker if the science indeed perhaps involves some hysteria.

In Germany the media has been dead silent on the news that warming has stopped. There’s a simple reason for that: In Europe, good news is bad news.
Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt have published their take on the official HadCRUT confirmation that there’s been no warming since even before Michael Mann’s infamous hockey stick fabrication was first released.
=================================
New HadCRUT data confirm: global temperature has not risen in 16 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translation/editing: Pierre Gosselin)
In the IPCC climate models, there’s only one direction projected for the future development of global temperature, namely a steady and strong increase. Also Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) shared this conviction and declared just last year in November 2011 in the Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung:
“Global warming is galloping ahead unhindered. The temperature is increasing at a rate of between 0.16 and 0.18 °C per decade.”
However, the quality of projections have to be tested using the hard data of reality. One of the most important datasets comes from the Hadley Centre of the British Met Office in cooperation with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia. While the Hadley Centre is responsible for the sea surface temperatures, the CRU takes care of the land temperatures. Together they form the so-called HadCRUT dataset.
Recently the newest HadCRUT numbers were released; they extended up to August 2012. It turns out that everything that had been suspected was confirmed: The global temperature hasn’t risen in 16 years (see Figure below). This is a completely unexpected development when one considers how all the boldly confident forecasts from the IPCC predicted more warming.
The release of the new HadCRUT figures occurred almost in absolute silence, without any media buzz whatsoever. With some hesitation the British Daily Mail took up the topic and reported on the extension of the unhoped for temperature plateau. The report also questioned Phil Jones, the current Director of the Climate Research Unit. He confirmed the plateau and even considered it possible that it will extend even more, but only if the an El Nino does not form in the Pacific over the coming months. An El Nino would cause global temperatures to spike upwards for a short time. On the deviation between the the IPCC models and measured temperatures, Jones says:
We don’t fully understand how to input things like changes in the oceans, and because we don’t fully understand it you could say that natural variability is  now working to suppress the warming. We don’t know what natural variability is doing.”
In 2009. Phil Jones had informed a colleague by e-mail that he would be concerned about the quality of the IPCC climate models if the stop in warming continued beyond 15 years. That e-mail was made public by the Climategate scandal, when an unknown hacker had breached the servers of the Climate Research Unit. The 15-year period named in that e-mail has in the meantime been surpassed. One really has got to wonder that Jones has suddenly extended his personal threshold of pain to 20 years, and now claims that phases of no warming 15-16 years long had always been expected.

Climate scientist Judith Curry, Director of Earth and Climate Sciences at Georgia Tech University, takes a more sober view. In the same Daily Mail article she says:
The new data confirms the existence of a pause in global warming. […] Climate models are very complex, but they are  imperfect and incomplete. Natural variability  [the impact of factors such  as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun] has  been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the  greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that  our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change  needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental  importance.”

Also Stefan Rahmstorf now appears to be worried and is desperately hoping for a trend change. Finally for 2013 he sees a new temperature record in the making; one that will hopefully break the old 1998 record. In the magazine Spektrum der Wissenschaft (also see New Scientist) Rahmstorf wrote in September 2012:

In the meantime the solar cycle is again on the rebound, and it is only a question of time before the next El Niño episode kicks in. The US NOAA has even forecast that this will occur this fall. Both of these factors together with the continuing rising greenhouse gases make it indeed probable that already 2013 could be a record year. Maybe this will mute the unscientific voices who again and again falsely claim that global warming is over.”
However, clicking on Rahmstorf’s El Nino link brings his readers back to sobriety. The acute NOAA El Nino warning has since been withdrawn and now more or less “neutral conditions” are being forecast for the northern winter of 2012/2013 in the tropical Pacific (click on the “weekly ENSO-Update”; see Lubos Motl at his “the reference frame“ blog).
It’s also interesting that Rahmstorf suddenly is now increasingly emphasizing the sun, though the sun matters more for the long-term over years to decades. Speaking of solar activity, things with the upcoming solar maximum in the Spring of 2013 don’t appear to be cooperating either. The value will be considerably below the past cycles, which will tend to have more of a cooling effect than one of warming. Moreover some experts are already warning that the solar maximum of the current cycle may already be behind us(see our blog article: “Have we already missed the maximum of the current solar cycle? Asymmetry of the sun signals an extended period of low activity“). It’s quite possible that hard times lie ahead for climate science…

If the skeptics ever needed the stamp of success for their efforts to curb the climate agenda, this is it.
Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, a prominent warmist scientist and politician in Germany, appeared on ZDF television and provided his assessment of today’s international climate policy. If any among us think that climate policy is a major threat to democracy and freedom, well then you can all take heart. Though the battle is far from over, skeptics are clearly winning the debate, despite being out-funded a million to one. Von Weizsäcker confirms it’s a mess.
Solar Server, an internet portal for solar energy reports on von Weizsäcker’s comments in an interview with ZDF German public television.
In an interview with ZDF news portal heute.de, scientist and politician Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker describes the bleak picture of international climate policy. ‘Climate protection is considered a disturbance in the noise of growth,’ says von Weizsäcker in the interview. At the international level, he sees no common thread on how the policy of climate protection is to be moved forward.”
‘People don’t want any climate protection, they want economic growth, driven by over-exploitation,’ he says.”
In plain language: The warmists are in utter disarray and exasperated. The movement is in panic mode.
Von Weizäcker: penalize efficiency to save energy!

Solarserver.de reports that von Weizäcker frets that “massive Europe-bashing is being carried out”. Solarserver.de quotes von Weizäcker:
We’ve got to make climate protection really profitable and finally implement energy efficiency techniques, which have been sitting in the drawer already a long time.”
Really? And so what must be done? Weizäcker proposes an economic idea that only a nutty professor could possibly concoct:
Every year, energy and raw materials have to be made more expensive – to the same extent that efficiency increases.”
Boy, now that’s a great incentive if I ever heard one – punish people for being more efficient! Clearly von Weizäcker’s loony ideas would also lead to energy starvation for the poor in developing countries. Poor countries can ill-afford today’s prices of energy and natural resources, let alone even higher prices. They need much cheaper sources. Solarserver.de writes:
He citicizes that world events are decided by mainly Brazilians, Indians and Americans – in the countries where climate issues are ranked very low.”
No word on whether or not von Weizäcker hopped into a chauffeured limousine to ferry him to a private jet waiting on the tarmac after the interview. Just another blowhard, pampered European aristocrat who can’t find anything to be happy about.

"The British government recently gave the green light for Heathrow airport’s third runway. It was heralded by its supporters as a vital boost for jobs and growth – and proof that the UK was “open for business”. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, referred to the decision as “truly momentous” while for the prime minister, Theresa May, the planned expansion is “vital for the economic future of the whole of the UK”.  The decision has already been vociferously opposed by environmental campaigners. Simply stated, flying is a significant source of air pollution, and a carbon-intensive means of moving people around, despite technological developments and modifications. Airport expansions puts, as Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas describes it, “a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate change commitments”.  The decision to approve airport expansion is indeed “truly momentous” – because it shows just how far governments, but also trade unions, businesses and many individuals, are willing to go in denying that climate change and related ecological crises require us to significantly change the way we live. In fact, as a policy move, it arguably epitomises the phenomena of “hypernormalisation”, as described in Adam Curtis’s new documentary of the same name.  HyperNormalisation was commissioned by the BBC and released as an iplayer exclusive on October 16 2016 – you can watch it here. Curtis is a fascinating filmmaker. He weaves archive footage of events over the past half-century into provocative historical narratives. His commentary is informed by sociological theory, political economy and much more besides.  HyperNormalisation is no exception. It clocks in at just under three hours and takes in numerous people, places and events. Curtis’s overarching claim is that those in power have been increasingly incapable of dealing with a sequence of global issues with any meaningful plan. They are devoid of any vision beyond the maintenance of the status quo. He uses the term hypernormalisation to explain the prevailing response of politicians to this state of affairs, and the effect it has on the wider population. Alexei Yurchak coined the term in his 2006 book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation. He uses it to describe Soviet life in the 1970s, when the population was pushed to maintain the façade of a socialist utopia to the point that it was impossible to see beyond this system, despite everyone knowing it was an illusion.  This manically heightened state of fake normality – and collective investment in it – is “hypernormalisation”. Curtis uses the term more loosely. He argues that it can be used to make sense of the maintenance of a simplified, reassuring and fake version of the world in the face of unprecedented global challenges that incumbent governments and power alliances do not have the competence or inclination to address. Climate change and environmental disasters do not loom large in the HyperNormalisation film, but they are, for me, an extension of the phenomenon – precisely the kind of challenge we might expect to be “hypernormalised”.   The decision to approve Heathrow’s third runway is a government policy manifestation of hypernormalisation. Those in power simply do not have the capacity or willingness for leadership on climate change as an issue that demands societal transformation. The alternative, if we apply Curtis’s logic, is to strive to maintain a narrative in which these issues do not appear to really matter. Everything, we are told instead, is going to be fine.  Instead of dealing with the real issues at hand, we will instead be admitted to the fantasy land of accelerated mobility and consumption. In this alternate reality, the “environmental future” must not impinge on May’s “economic future”.   But of course events are unfolding in the world outside the hypernormal narrative of business as usual: the well-documented forces unleashed by the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, the ongoing extinction and displacement of countless species, warming and acidifying oceans, deforestation and arctic melting.  These forces are the product of industrial society and capitalism, now exacerbated by the demands of a globalised consumerism. We know that the practices and pastimes that make up these societies, including frequent and long-haul flying, are unsustainable. Every government leader in the world knows this. But the psychological and social processes we engage in to avoid confronting the implications of climate change are now well documented in the social sciences – as individual and collective forms of denial.  It is even claimed that the closer a threatening event, the more manically we defend existing worldviews and associated ways of life. There is no reason to assume that these dynamics are any less prevalent in our leaders and decision-makers in business, government and trade unions. These dynamics of denial and displacement are precisely those that reflect and maintain a state of hypernormalisation. So airport expansion can be heralded unequivocally as “momentous”, “correct” and “bold” in the same week that global concentrations of CO2 pass 400 parts per million. It is a policy move which simply does not make sense … unless we are operating in an atmosphere of hypernormalisation.  Defending it on behalf of our “economic future” is a grotesquely comic perpetuation of that fakery. If it goes ahead, it is likely that history will judge the expansion of Heathrow as an act of collusive madness, a desperate attempt to add another coat to the painted theatre set of the hypernormal."
"It remains one of history’s best-known naval tragedies – and mysteries. The loss of all 129 men of the 1845 Royal Navy expedition led by Captain Sir John Franklin to navigate a north-west passage through the Arctic remains an enigma. The only informative document to be recovered from the expedition was a single page that reported initial good progress through 1845 to 1847, but then the desertion of the ships in 1848 by which point nine officers – including Sir John Franklin – and 15 other ranks were reported to have died.  Franklin’s two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, became trapped in ice off King William Island in 1846, where it is known that Franklin died in June the following year. But what happened to the rest of the crew? We know that they deserted their ships in 1848 – after two winters trapped in the pack ice – and all eventually perished over the next two or three years. Three permafrost preserved bodies were found in graves at the expedition’s winter quarters of 1845/46 on Beechey Island in the northern Arctic. Forensic examination suggests that their deaths may have been caused by tuberculosis.  Skeletal remains of some other members of the crew have been found further south on King William Island and adjacent parts of the Canadian mainland. Their deaths occurred after desertion of the ships and were probably due to starvation and exposure. Some of the remains show evidence that cannibalism occurred in the last desperate throes of the expedition.  However, both of the expedition’s ships have now been discovered – HMS Erebus in September 2014 by Parks Canada, and most recently the “pristine” HMS Terror in September 2016 by the Arctic Research Foundation. Their locations and contents may provide new insights into the fate of the crew. Early historians supposed that scurvy had caused widespread incapacity, while more recent research proposed that the men were poisoned by lead from the solder that sealed their canned provisions.  Scurvy did occur in Arctic crews but research by Simon Mays of Historic England concluded that samples of the crew’s skeletal remains show little clear evidence of the disease. Levels of lead in the remains of some of the crew are high relative to today, but it is debatable whether those levels would reflect incapacitating lead poisoning. The difficulty is the lack of normative data for levels of lead in the British population from which the crew was recruited in the 19th century. That population ingested high levels of lead from water pipes, pewter cooking utensils and drinking vessels, lead-based medical treatments and many other sources. In general, levels of lead in their bodies would have been high anyway. The supposed roles of scurvy and lead poisoning in the disaster would be answered if the expedition’s medical records had survived – but they have eluded discovery, as have all the formal logs and journals. So our team at the University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences and the College of Science and Engineering proposed that the medical records of those in the Royal Naval ships sent in search of Franklin and his crew might serve as a proxy for the health problems encountered by the expedition. Those ships were similarly equipped and provisioned to Franklin’s vessels and met similar conditions. Consequently, the illnesses and deaths that occurred on them might reflect those of the lost crew. After examining the illnesses seen in almost 1,500 medical cases across nine search crews, we concluded that Franklin’s men would have suffered similar common infections, gastro-intestinal disorders and injuries. They also will have suffered exposure, and some deaths might have occurred from respiratory, cardiovascular and tubercular conditions. Scurvy was evident but was not so prevalent as to affect the operational efficiency of the crews: if the same pattern occurred in Franklin’s men then it would not have been significant, which would support Mays’ findings. The search crews had similar canned provisions to Franklin’s men but their medical records showed no evidence of lead poisoning despite the relatively high exposure to lead that was inevitable on ships of that time. Unless a unique source of lead was present on Franklin’s ships, there is no clear evidence that lead poisoning played a part in the disaster. This conclusion supports the outcome of our earlier published reappraisal of the evidence for lead poisoning. What then was the most likely fate of the crews, and particularly the officers who had a disproportionately higher death rate? Based on the evidence from the search ships, we proposed that the deaths of Franklin’s officers were probably due to non-medical factors such as accidents and injuries sustained when officers took on the dangerous task of hunting for wild game to supplement provisions, and continued the attempt, on foot over difficult terrain in a harsh climate, to discover the route of a north-west passage. Ironically, the expedition’s success in reaching a remote part of the Arctic resulted in entrapment that precluded escape or rescue. The discovery of the Erebus and Terror many miles from their initial desertion might confirm that they were re-manned and navigated to their new locations. It would be further evidence that a majority of the crew were in sufficient health to operate the ships, and counters popular portrayals of a sickly rabble staggering to their deaths in 1848. Such an end did come but David Woodman’s thoughtful analysis suggests that it was not until 1850 or 1851. Initial exploration of the Erebus has retrieved items including the ship’s bell, bearing the date of the expedition’s departure “1845”, cannon, ceramic plates, buttons from tunics and a sword handle. The Terror appears much more intact but her discovery is too recent for an attempt to have been made to recover any contents, although the bell has been seen lying on the deck. We understand from our colleagues in Parks Canada that if any written records were stored on board the ships then they may remain legible and provide first-hand evidence of the events leading to disaster.  If any medical records have survived they will show whether health factors led to the failure of the expedition and put an end to further speculation, including our own. Whether they are ever recovered, however, remains to be seen. It is likely that the ships’ significant records would have been taken with the officers when deserting the ships so the reality is that they may now be irretrievably lost. Like all good mysteries, the Franklin saga may continue to withhold answers."
"When a county council in the north of England refused to grant planning permission for a shale gas site back in June 2015, it was hailed as a victory for anti-fracking campaigners and concerned locals. The UK secretary of state for communities and local government, Sajid Javid, has now overruled this decision. Fracking will go ahead in Lancashire after all. The planning authority’s initial position clearly reflected a high level of public concern over the local impacts of the proposed fracking site. But the government’s move sends a clear message: councils who refuse applications not only face the challenge of an appeal, but also the potentially huge cost of defending their decisions in court. This could have big implications for local decision making and everyone affected by proposed fracking sites. However, in the long run, this overruling may actually harm the UK shale industry.  My research shows that there is already an extreme deficit of trust in the UK planning system. People view planning authorities and local councils as being under significant policy pressure to allow shale gas exploration. This perception is not unfounded. The government has not only declared its explicit support for shale gas and fracking, but has also actively changed the law on subsurface trespass to facilitate underground drilling.  There’s now a strict time limit, 16 weeks, for fracking-related planning applications. Given that many planning authorities won’t have much experience of dealing with oil and gas developments, this deadline may prevent detailed consideration of local impacts. Such decisions must also be made in accordance with the UK’s national planning framework which explicitly emphasises the economic importance of mineral extraction. But how can fracking decisions be seen as legitimate if local decisions and local concerns are simply vetoed? The overrule is all the more surprising given that last year new wind farm planning guidance stressed that locals should have the final say.  Yes, in the short term it has enabled the development of at least one new exploration site. Yet if people don’t regard the Lancashire decision as legitimate and see this instead as a case of central government imposing on locals, then opposition is likely to increase. The perception of independence is crucial here, along with the ability of planning authorities to assess fracking risks for themselves. My research found people simply don’t trust planning decisions if it seems central government or energy companies have had too much influence. Lancashire council’s initial refusal back in 2015 was a landmark in this sense, as it gave substantial weight to local concerns about noise or unsightly construction. It showed that councils and the planning system were concerned about local impacts and were independent enough to stick up for their residents if they felt fracking wouldn’t improve the area.  But the government’s move to approve fracking in Lancashire anyway shows that any attempts by councils to make independent decisions which counter Westminster policy are likely to be overturned. Without this independence, the public will neither trust the planning authority to make these judgements nor accept the decisions they do make. So why did the government take this action? After all, parliament has made a deliberate choice to leave fracking decisions to local planning authorities. In England and Wales, major developments such as power plants, motorways or airports can be designated as: “Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects” which means they bypass local councils and planning decisions are automatically made by the secretary of state.  There has been some debate over whether fracking should fit in this category. However the decision not to categorise shale gas exploration and fracking as an NSIP, made in a 2012 consultation on infrastructure, implies a commitment to local decision-making and local concerns. Yet what has happened in practice doesn’t reflect this. A system where the communities secretary decides all appeals relating to fracking – and, based on the existing precedents, dismisses the local reasons for refusal – looks set to undermine any residual trust that is placed the current planning system. The government’s decision looks set to exacerbate public concern regarding fracking. If people don’t trust the planning system to take account of and address local concerns, independent of national politics, its legitimacy is diminished. Given local opposition to fracking can be very effective, this may not be the landmark advance for the UK shale gas industry that it first appears."
"The pre-industrial atmosphere contained more particles, and so brighter clouds, than we previously thought. This is the latest finding of the CLOUD experiment, a collaboration between around 80 scientists at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva. It changes our understanding of what was in the atmosphere before humans began adding pollution – and what it might be like again in the future. Most cloud droplets need tiny airborne particles to act as “seeds” for their formation and growth. If a cloud has more of these seeds, and therefore more droplets, it will appear brighter and reflect away more sunlight from the Earth’s surface. This in turn can cool the climate. Therefore understanding the number and size of particles in the atmosphere is vital to predicting not only how bright and reflective the planet’s clouds are, but what global temperatures will be. Today, around half of these particles come from natural sources. That includes dust from the ground, volcanoes, wildfires that make soot, or sea spray that evaporates midair leaving behind tiny specs of salt in the atmosphere. Many airborne particles also result from us burning fossil fuels. This produces soot, but also sulphur dioxide gas which is made into sulphuric acid in the atmosphere. As well as causing acid rain, sulphuric acid molecules can stick together and grow into particles. Other molecules like ammonia often help glue the sulphuric acid molecules together, and overall this process forms around half of the cloud seeding particles in today’s atmosphere. The CLOUD experiment at CERN also recently discovered that gases emitted by trees can stick together to make new seeds for clouds in the atmosphere – without needing any help from other pollutants as was previously thought. Scientists had thought that the cloud seeds needed sulphuric acid (often mixed with other compounds) or iodine molecules to stick together to initiate the process. In our new follow-up study, published in PNAS, we worked with other CLOUD scientists to simulate this process in the atmosphere. Our work suggests that even today trees produce a large fraction of cloud seeds over the cleanest forested parts of the world.  Simulations of the atmosphere before fossil fuel burning started in earnest and the industrial revolution began (in climate science defined as the year 1750) predict fewer particles than are present today. With fewer particles the cleaner clouds would have reflected less of the sun’s energy and, perhaps counter-intuitively, they would have looked a bit greyer. The ability of the gases from trees (terpenes) to make particles was first proposed back in 1960 to explain blue hazes seen over forests in remote areas. Many lab experiments have since confirmed terpenes can help form new particles, but until recently it was thought that other pollutants like sulphuric acid were required. Much of the more recent progress in this area is thanks to the CLOUD experiment: a stainless steel cylinder, about three metres in diameter and three metres high. Gases are injected into the cylinder, where they react much as they would in the atmosphere and then stick together to make particles. State-of-the-art instruments count the gas molecules and particles in the chamber. We study how the number of new particles formed every second changes when we increase the amount of the sticky gases in the cylinder. In today’s atmosphere, there is so much sulphuric acid around that it is difficult to measure how much anything else contributes to forming new particles, and so to the clouds. However our new simulation using the CLOUD results shows that terpenes were very important in the cleaner atmosphere of a few hundred years ago. Computer modelling suggests that estimates of particle concentrations in the cleaner pre-industrial atmosphere should be increased, while our estimates of today’s concentrations are mostly unchanged. It’s hard to make accurate predictions at this early stage as not all of the complicated chemical processes are understood. However, the new results may be important because more particles in the atmosphere mean more reflective clouds and a cooler climate. Over the past century, cooling due to increasing numbers of particles in the atmosphere has offset, or masked, some of the warming due to increasing carbon dioxide levels. Our simulations suggest that this extra cooling might not have been as strong as previously thought. There have recently been concerns that as we collectively improve air quality across the world, by emitting fewer particles into the atmosphere, we will also be reducing the capacity of particles to act as cloud seeds and have a cooling effect. While our simulations remain quite uncertain, the potential importance of this new process suggests that as we reduce pollution from combustion and other sources, natural compounds could once again become more important. By helping to replace cloud seeds from air pollution, trees may be able to help us limit global temperature rises."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy here (EIKE) sums up the bad news in Germany’s energy industry, all brought on by failed green energy policies. What a mess! And things are set to get a lot worse.
Bad news have been rolling in from all fronts over the last months and weeks. The green energy generals are now in their bunkers with trembling hands. Oh the agony when reality turns out to be the opposite of what the models projected. Countries contemplating Germany’s green, centrally planned energy path really need to rethink!

EIKE writes an overview of headlines from the last 14 days (translated and condensed):
On the bankruptcy of solar company Sovello, 1000 employees are getting a pink slip. Earlier, RWE announced 2400 would lose their jobs. That mans the number of layoffs at RWE is now up to a whopping 10,400. Former RWE boss not long ago was high as a kite on green. The Handelsblatt quotes:
In my eyes, the energy revolution is a fascinating event. Of course it’s a challenge – like putting a man on the moon…RWE is forging ahead with the energy revolution at full throttle.”
Siemens and its boss Peter Löscher were also recently big proponents of the green energy revolution in Germany. But now, according to the Berliner Morgenpost, up to 10,000 employees are about to get the boot:
Large projects like power plants and railcars have eluded the company. Its customers are cutting back investments.
But there are also self-made problems: The management completely underestimated the difficulties of hooking up offshore windparks in the North Sea. Because Siemens is behind schedule, the Munich-based company threw 500 million euros into the wind by the end of June….”
Stern magazine writes that wind generator builder Vestas is cutting 1400 jobs.
The crisis-hampered Danish wind generator builder Vestas wants to cut another 1400 jobs by the end of the year in order to save 250 million euros.”
Vestas competitor Nordex is also struggling in the highly subsidized wind energy sector, too:
Der Aktionär Online writes that Nordex:
Share price is hovering just above its low for the past years. Because of price pressure, Nordex for the first half of the year has posted another loss.”
The Finanical Times on Solarworld:
For Solarworld things look even gloomier. After millions in write-offs and deep red figures over the first 6 months, Chairman Frank Asbeck again expects another operating loss this year. Share prices collapsed on Monday, falling 11.5 percent to €1.17.

An attempt to divert attention by demanding trade barriers against Chinese manufacturers will achieve little, as they would simply retaliate.
Die Welt writes on the now proposed tariffs on Chinese imports:
“Anti-dumping lawsuits by European manufacturers are not particularly welcome by Peking. The consequences could be devastating. Now even the Chancellor may intervene.”
And if Climadonna Merkel does intervene, then things are sure to get much worse.
Bild“ writes on rising energy costs:
“Living is getting more and more expensive! Gas is up 80 percent, and heating costs have tripled, rentals have jumped 23%…the big cost drivers are mainly the costs of utilities: Since 1999 electricity has jumped 80%, natural gas has doubled, heating costs, depending on the type – has doubled or tripled.”
And that’s just for starters: green politicians are getting worried about the energy situation Die Welt summarizes
Instead of getting off this false path called the green energy revolution and turning back the subsidies and getting back onto a sensible path, the disastrous subsidies are to be piled on even more.
..according to the law, gas turbines are to deliver energy only when there are not enough renewable energy sources available. And that is not often the case. Having a power plant there only to jump in as a reserve is simply unprofitable…such a capacity mechanism is however requested by Bavaria and Baden Wurttemberg. Bavaria has up to 5 such gas plants planned.”
And so on it goes…until it crashes back down to Earth.
There are some good news, unfortunately only abroad: Handelsblatt wrote enviously: The Energy Revolution Is Elsewhere.
“…the newly discovered oil and shale gas reserves now give the USA a cheap supply of energy. That is attracting companies…Natural gas production in the USA is climbing towards a record high. Oil production in July reached the highest level since 1999. According to a March report by Citigroup, the ‘reindustrialization’ of the USA could produce another 3.6 million jobs by 2020 and boost GDP growth by up to 3%…The outlook for cheap energy will give a number of industrial sectors a competitive advantage, among them steel and aluminium manufacturers, automotive, chemicals and fertilizer companies and…with respect to the shale gas boom, gas prices in the USA will be much more competitive than in the Middle East because there are no political risks.“
Read the complete report here:
All that’s left is to add is that gas prices in the USA have fallen 80% over the last months. Here in Europe, they’re going up.
These are the news from only the past 14 days. Indeed things are going to get a lot worse, no matter how much we choose to smile about it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith every passing year we get without global warming, CO2 loses more and more of its credibility as the cause for climate change. So what to do? Move on to another issue that will do just as well. Blame it on soot from automobiles and industry, and push for lots of regulation.

Black soot is responsible for 50% of Arctic warming.
Influential German environmental group Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) is now demanding a greater focus on soot when it comes to climate regulation. NABU writes:
The dangers of soot particles and other air pollutants have not been strong enough issues in politics up to now. NABU Director Leif Miller: ‘Up to 50 percent of the warming in the Arctic can be traced back to the influence of soot particles. Thus these particles play a role in climate change that is just as important as greenhouse gas CO2,’ Miller added.”
When listening to Miller when it comes to the scale of potential regulation, soot, which comes from the burning of fossil fuels, becomes just as attractive as CO2. Defining soot as a problem would pave the way for the massive regulation of a broad swath of our society. Soot would do just fine.
In Central Europe transportation is the main source. Together with other pollutants, soot particles make up the group of ‘short-life climate drivers’. They force climate change similarly as much as CO2, but remain in the atmosphere much shorter. Their reduction would impact the climate much more quickly than a reduction of CO2.”
NABU transportation expert Dietmar Oeliger adds: “By combating a climate driver that has an immediate impact, we would gain valuable time in reaching our climate targets”.

This sounds like it’s straight out of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s book “Die kalte Sonne”, who also advocate measures for cleaning up soot in developing countries as a far more economical way of slowing down Arctic warming. BUND writes:
The German government must pass a binding reductions target by 2020. All diesel soot sources must be outfitted with modern exhaust cleaning systems such as particle filters. In addition, it is also necessary to fundamentally think about alternative mobility strategies where the internal combustion engine plays a significantly lesser role than today.”
Together with environmental groups BUND, Deutsche Umwelthilfe and the Ecological Transportation Club of Germany (VCD), NABU has been pushing for stronger public awareness with its campaign: “Soot-free for the Climate”.
So even if CO2 turns out to have only a minimal or moderate effect on climate, it will still be necessary to massively regulate soot (fosselin fuels) in the relatively spic-and-span western industrial countries. Of course developing countries will be given a free pass here.
Whatever the outcome, it is nice to see that climate-factors other than CO2 are now being taken seriously by environmentalists.
And once the sun and oceans are considered, CO2 practically disappears from the warming equation. But with soot accounting for 50%, don’t expect the environmentalists to concede solar and oceanic cycles are playing a major role. Something has to be left for CO2.
All the blame has to be kept on fossil fuels.

"Large-scale urban agriculture is on the rise globally, with more and more farms appearing in our cities. A far cry from allotments and community gardens, urban farms occupy much bigger spaces; they can employ people, regenerate huge neighbourhoods and give residents access to fresh produce on their doorsteps.  The practice has been popular in North America for many years, with many huge rooftop farms surrounding New York City. Brooklyn Grange, for instance, produces close to 23,000kg of organic vegetables each year, and the world’s largest urban farm recently opened in Chicago.  Yet investment is also opening up elsewhere, particularly in the UK, with several urban farms planned across the country over the next few years – from Greater Manchester to London, and beyond. These spaces come in all shapes and sizes. Some have animals – for petting or for slaughter – while others train farmers or apprentices. Many are increasingly using hydroponics and other forms of technology to grow food more efficiently.  A good example of this is Farm Urban in Liverpool, which is using leftover land (including the University of Liverpool Student Union’s rooftop) for aquaponics: a man-made, symbiotic system where plants and aquatic animals such as fish can nourish each other. Those adopting a highly technical approach appear to be more sustainable than other types of urban farms. One can often find forward-thinking individuals at the helm of the projects, using their skills to gain financial support from major businesses. For instance, The Biospheric Studio in Manchester uses hydroponics to grow mushrooms for five star restaurants, which are willing to pay for the trendy local food label.  Although urban farming is on the rise and we are witnessing more investment, as yet there is little evidence on its value and impact. Our book on Informal Urban Agriculture shows there is a need for more evaluation in this area. In reality, these spaces do little to improve food security among city dwellers, as they produce far less than traditional rural farms. Many attempts to bring in revenue through box schemes – where urban farms sell packages of produce to locals – often face barriers due to the lack of product.  Polytunnels (a tunnel-like structure under a cover, which acts like a greenhouse) and other tools can be used to increase yield. But these only go so far toward tackling the problem. Many urban farms in the UK are also suffering financially and have resorted to charging visitors, or continuously applying for grants from government and charity to sustain their work. There is also the issue of vandalism, which is prevalent with all forms of urban agriculture but particularly this larger version. Early in 2016, an urban farm in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester was vandalised, resulting in the killing and injuring of several animals.  This happened several years earlier too, with birds decapitated and other livestock injured. Expensive CCTV systems and other security measures have been put in place to deter suspects. But this does not always prevent crime and – with expensive equipment and money often kept on site – thieves are increasingly targeting urban farms.  However, sites which have existed for a long period often report that there is more vandalism in the first years of a project, but once there is buy-in from the community this soon dips.    Despite these barriers, our 2016 study into the state of urban farming showed that huge positives can come out of these spaces. For example, urban farms often act as a social incubator, bringing together communities and connecting cultures. Many also impact significantly on health and well-being, allowing city-dwellers to access fresh food and sometimes even supplement diets.  We found that those connected to The Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens were strongest. They gained value from the networking with other such sites across the UK.  A few in this extensive network have existed for over 30 years, and are still going due to the excellent support from both locals and the wider network. Ultimately, the idea of urban farming is not to replace traditional rural farms, but rather to complement and add value. To push forward with urban farming, there’s a need to build on what works – in particular, to learn from urban farms in the US, which are expanding and are on a different scale entirely to anywhere else.  Global and national initiatives mean we’re likely to see more of these urban farms appearing across the world – improving city dwellers lifestyles, impacting positively on the local economy and regenerating neglected spaces, such as new farm Woodbank in Stockport, Greater Manchester, run by The Kindling Trust. The capacity of urban farms to tackle major issues such as poverty and reducing food miles should not be underestimated, and with more ambitious projects starting up every day, it might not be long until you see one appearing in your neighbourhood."
"The soft creamy flesh of a ripe avocado makes an attractive and healthy addition to many of our shopping baskets. Smashed, crushed or sliced on toast for a celebrity chef breakfast, it is a fruit which is savoured across the world.   But it seems that avocados may not be as green as they look. And their trendy status may be environmentally unsustainable. Their popularity has led to profitable opportunities for farmers, leading to major environmental concerns about production causing deforestation in Mexico, a nation that produces 30% of the 4.7m tonnes harvested globally.   What was once an exotic ingredient for many now makes regular appearances in  culinary (and political) lives.  The European Union imports some 440,000 tonnes of avocados each year. And while the food production industry is keeping up with demand, we rarely stop to consider the environmental impacts of trendy food, distracted as we are by the new experiences and health benefits it delivers. The rise of the avocado has displaced forests because of increased production, with the incentive of increased profit leading to an environmental impact. Similar patterns are seen for soy beans and maize where production and trade is dependent on specific global regions.   These pressure points in the global food system remind us of the wider problems associated with the year-round supply we demand from food retailers who need the semi-tropical regions of the world to provide them. The environmental impact caused by our appetites is an issue which also has been highlighted by other “luxury” goods such as chocolate and coffee, where fair trade principles have changed the way we purchase foods. Many of these issues concern the ingredients we need to create food tastes and experience.   Consider garlic, another essential ingredient of guacamole. World production of the bulb has risen from 4m to 24m tonnes per year since the 1960s. Around 80% is produced in China.   The huge demand for high value crops that provide specific tastes such as garlic and chilli (which has also seen exponential growth in global production) have also resulted in the emergence of crop smugglers who now sustain a multi-million Euro illegal – and largely unseen – industry. It all makes life very complicated for anyone who wants to eat a healthy diet and keep up with food fashion with a clear conscience. For while certifications associated with biodiversity and sustainability are established for fish, coffee and chocolate, they are either rare or entirely non-existent for many of the herbs, spices and ingredients we use in low volumes that are high value and strong in taste.  Many of the larger volume crops such as cereals, sugar and many fruits now have a legacy of assurance and traceability where sustainability is assessed along their supply chains. It started with Birdseye’s “in pursuit of the sustainable pea” report, one of the first food brands to look at these wider values.   Programmes of assessing the sustainability of food production have been established for decades now with organisations such as the UK’s LEAF and the international Global GAP. But it seems strange that we should focus solely on the environmental certification of fish, meat and food staples and not worry about the high value ingredients we use because we use them at low volumes.   So what are the solutions? First, consumer awareness is key, and guidance on using understandable measures of sustainability is an important part of becoming responsible consumers.  Second, urban and “vertical” farming, where crops are grown in stacked layers in controlled environments, have an important role to play. They allow restaurants and other consumers to source herbs, garlic and leaf vegetables from local growers who can competitively supply high value products in low volumes. We are currently working with restaurants to measure the impact of sourcing these ingredients locally.   Of course, there are limits to locality, and to my knowledge, avocados have not yet been successfully grown on a commercial scale in Sheffield. If they were, they would certainly not be sustainable. But we are making progress in certificating foods so that we do not have to stop eating these products but actively engage to support sustainable development of their markets – this is well described in the Rainforest Alliance’s high impact Follow the Frog campaign.  In the 18th century, botanical collectors grew tropical fruits in heated greenhouses across the UK. Our current system of access to avocados and other semi-tropical foods will only improve on this energy intensive production if responsible production that does not destroy the environment is proven. Food suppliers must qualify their sustainability values and they have many challenges. I think we are getting much better at communicating these credentials so that we have confidence in what we eat from the global supply chain."

"For us humans, getting involved in an aggressive conflict can be costly, not only because of the risk of injury and stress, but also because it can damage precious social relationships between friends – and the same goes for monkeys and apes.  Just like humans, they also form selective long-term, reciprocal bonds that share many parallels with human friendship. And in the primate world, aggression can also be detrimental to these relationships because it decreases tolerance and the rate of friendly interactions. Like human families, for monkeys and apes, the day-to-day business of living in a group inevitably brings quarrels. Disputes could be over who gets the shady spot to rest in, who’s in charge, who to groom, who to mate with, who to huddle up with in the cold or where to feed. Life can be harsh. But luckily, primates have a whole arsenal of strategies up their sleeves to forestall, or mitigate the costs of, aggression.  These range from formal submission and calming tensions before they escalate, to mediation and policing interventions during a conflict. But if aggression is unavoidable and a fight occurs, opponents have another option. Because just like humans, primates can also repair their relationship through reconciliation – to help reestablish friendly contact. Reconciliatory behaviour was first recognised by Frans de Waal in the 1970’s in a seminal study of post-conflict behaviour in chimpanzees. On the surface, reconciliation boils down to friendly contact between opponents soon after a fight but it also seems to do more than just end the conflict.  Studies have found that reconciliation has emotional consequences in primates, reducing indicators of distress and anxiety – such as elevated heart rate and scratching – back to baseline levels.  Post-conflict anxiety levels in primates have also been found to be related to the quality of the relationship between the former opponents. Among humans, this makes perfect sense, if you argue with a close friend, you’re much more stressed than if you’ve argued with a passing acquaintance.  Researchers have also found that reconciliation reduces the likelihood of renewed aggression. But perhaps most importantly, reconciliation appears to restore tolerance and cooperation between friends.  Friendships improve health and increase survival and reproductive success in many species, such as dolphins, horses, birds and primates, so it’s not surprising that mechanisms have evolved to alleviate damage to a relationship caused by aggression.  The fact that reconciliation is common to many social species shows how deep-rooted our own tendency is for peace-making. But it would seem that some techniques are actually learned rather than innately acquired. In an innovative experiment some years ago, de Waal showed that the reconciliatory behaviour of quarrelsome, juvenile rhesus macaques, could be increased threefold after a few months of co-housing with more easygoing, peacemaking stumptail macaques.  So conciliatory tendency seems to be a social skill that is acquired through juvenile experience, rather than an innate behaviour. And a study just published in the International Journal of Primatology by one of my PhD students, supports this view.  Indeed, adult chimpanzees often reconcile using grooming and specific reconciliatory behaviours that are not seen in other contexts – such as the mouth-to-mouth kiss. So if reconciliation was an innate behaviour, we’d expect to find that juvenile chimpanzees mimicked that of the adults – but in our research we did not find this to be the case. Instead, after a fracas, young chimpanzees reconciled the best way they knew how – through play. They also lacked the reconciliatory finesse of their elders.  And while it’s well known that adult chimpanzees are more likely to reconcile with their more valuable friends than non-friends, the young chimpanzees didn’t seem to make this discrimination yet, suggesting they’ve still got a lot to learn.  I remember observing Japanese macaques as a student, under a 35°C sun, high humidity and oddly enough sweaty knees (who knew knees could sweat). I watched one young female monkey trundle up a slope and jump out from between some bushes, straight into the lap of sleepy Kusha. Surprised, Kusha threatened and lunged at Ai who cowered submissively before running off to a safe distance about four metres away.  I looked on as, after only a few seconds, Kusha walked up to Ai sat down next to her and started to groom her for half a minute. Relaxed, Ai laid down and let Kusha groom her side. Then they swapped over and Kusha laid down while Ai groomed her leg. Throughout the whole encounter they exchanged friendly lip-smacks – these are rapid opening and closing of the lips – signalling their friendly intentions to each other. When it comes to us humans, while we probably don’t fancy grooming every person we’ve fallen out with – or kissing them – it’s clear that when it comes to arguments peacemaking is the preferred option for both species. So next time you fall out with your co-worker maybe try as the primates do and work on that conflict resolution – a bit of lip smacking, a bit of a back scratch and hopefully you’ll be friends again in no time."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAll the talk since yesterday is about the new Jan Esper et al paper: Orbital forcing of tree-ring data published by  Nature Climate Change. Press release here.

The main focus of the paper is the modest long-term 0.3°C cooling per thousand years that has taken place over the last 2000 years, likely due to Earth’s orbital factors. Unfortunately the authors did not go into the cause of the wide and obvious temperature variations occuring over the period. The press release quotes the authors:
We found that previous estimates of historical temperatures during the Roman era and the Middle Ages were too low,” says Esper. “Such findings are also significant with regard to climate policy, as they will influence the way today’s climate changes are seen in context of historical warm periods.”
That sure blows out of the water Al Gore’s AIT con-job claim that the Medieval Warm Period was a just minor negligible event, doesn’t it?
Yet, it’s a pity Esper et al did not go into why temperatures 1000 years ago were as high as today’s and why temperatures of the past varied so widely.
There are some fascinating points about the curve that others will surely look into:
1. 20th century rise is not unusual
The abrupt temperature rise near the end of the 20th century is not unusual. Similar or even greater rises occurred around 1500AD, 1150AD, 700AD, 300AD and 100BC.

2. No correlation with CO2
Recall that CO2 was more or less steady at 280 ppm before starting its sharp climb 150 years ago. Yet, the smoothed temperature curves over a range of almost 2°C and the annual measurements range over 6°C! This completely contradicts the old storyline that climate had been more or less stable before man started emitting CO2. Clearly an array of powerful natural factors are at play here.
3. Natural cycles are clearly visible
The 1000-year solar cycle is clearly visible, and strongly suggests that there’s much more to solar forcing than total solar irradiation. There has to be a solar amplification mechanism, such as the one put forth by Svensmark, which, by the way, is gaining support from a growing body of scientific evidence. Of course there are some quacks who may suggest cyclic volcansim.
4. IPCC under-estimated natural trends
The press release states: “Our results suggest that the large-scale climate reconstruction shown by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) likely underestimate this long-term cooling trend over the past few millennia.” That also can be interpreted as: The IPCC likely over-estimates the short-term warming of CO2.
Looking at the 2000-year chart above, it certainly wouldn’t take a rocket climate scientist to reach that conclusion.
The CO2 global warming theory has just lost another leg.

"Scott Morrison has identified the United Nations as the multilateral institution responsible for pursuing “negative globalism” – a Trump-like concept the prime minister flagged in a recent foreign policy speech – because the UN wants Australia to increase its ambition on emissions reduction. But while Morrison gave the UN a blast in parliament on Monday for allegedly ratcheting Australia up, it was actually the current government that agreed to an increase in ambition as part of the Paris framework which Tony Abbott signed Australia onto, and Malcolm Turnbull later ratified. During the May election campaign, Morrison told Australian voters the Coalition supported the Paris agreement and would conform with its obligations. As the Climate Change Authority has noted, Australia made a specific commitment under the Paris agreement to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, and Australia will also need to submit a more ambitious post-2030 goal in 2025 as part of the agreement’s “review, refine and ratchet” mechanism. Post-election, as recently as June, Australian officials confirmed the Morrison government was committed to that process. Officials told the European Union – which was querying Australia’s progress in emissions reduction ahead of a meeting in Bonn – that Australia would conduct domestic policy review and refine cycles aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. Separately to the Paris commitments, Morrison voluntarily signed on to a communique during this year’s Pacific Islands Forum in August saying that all parties to the Paris agreement would “formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020”. “This may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050,” the PIF communique said. Morrison began to edge away from those two commitments during his recent trip to the US. The prime minister told parliament on Monday there were “those overseas” who thought Australia’s 2030 target “should be higher” but the government did not agree with that “and neither do the Australian people” because they had returned the Coalition to power in the May election. “The Australian people … supported the re-election of our government … on the basis of us going forward with a commitment to 26% reduction of emissions,” the prime minister said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison declared an increase in ambition had been sought “in some correspondence” by the UN – presumably referring to correspondence from the UN secretary general in July asking countries, including Australia, to outline their latest emissions reduction plans. Guterres, ahead of the special UN climate summit in September that Morrison declined to attend despite being in America at the time, asked leaders to flag commitments for 2030 and their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Last week, the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, ducked questions about what “negative globalism” meant in the context of Australia’s participation in international climate negotiations, and sidestepped questions about Australia’s emissions reduction strategy for 2050. Asked what Morrison’s commitment at the Pacific Islands Forum meant, Taylor said the government was focused currently on the Paris commitments, not the next cycle. “Our immediate focus is on the 2030 Paris obligation. Our focus right now is on achieving the 2030 targets.” Before Morrison’s comments in the House on Monday, Alex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, defended the government’s climate change record, declaring the Coalition was responding to the “substantial threat” facing the region. But Hawke said that some in the media acted “more as advocates and protesters” rather than on reporting – echoing a similar critique from Morrison last month. The prime minister said people expressed “prejudiced” views about Australia’s climate policy, and he added: “Now where do they get their information from? Who knows, maybe they read it.” Hawke said Monday: “I accept fully that I think it is the fault of the Australian government that we have not done enough to promote what Australia is doing on climate change in the Pacific, and I think you will see more from this government speaking directly to ... the Australian public about what it is we are doing.” He also said the Australian government was doing “more than anyone else” on climate change. “The tenor of our discussion with our partner countries is very positive about climate change and I think we are all aware in 2019, as we are all aware about the threat of populism, the threats of protectionism .... we are also aware of the inadequacies I think of the international press sometimes on some of these issues,” Hawke said."
"In many ways, zebra appear very like horses (or ponies, given their size). Yet underlying differences in behaviour have meant that while horses and donkeys have been successfully domesticated, the zebra remains predominantly wild. So how did the zebra avoid the load bearing, farm working, fence jumping fate of its cousins? And which animal ended up with the better deal? Because of their obvious similarity to horses – and for novelty value – attempts have been made by humans to ride and race zebra. The 2005 movie, Racing Stripes, was the story of a young zebra who wanted to compete in horse races – although the filmmakers were forced to use a horse stand-in for some scenes (the tail gives it away).  The manes and tails of zebra are in fact more similar to those of asses (donkeys) and reflect the evolutionary history of the genus Equus. Although horses, assess and zebra all evolved from a common ancestor (Hyracotherium) which lived in Europe and North America around 55m years ago, divergence meant that the zebra and donkey are more closely related to each other than either is to the horse. The North American equids (members of the horse family) disappeared about 8-10,000 years ago, and in Europe and Asia, Palaeolithic man extensively hunted the herds of wild horses on the open plains. A combination of climatic change, forestation and human predation pushed the animals eastwards to the semi-deserts of central Asia.  The wild ancestor of today’s domestic horses (Equus ferus) was first domesticated in the western Eurasian Steppe, an area where the earliest archaeological evidence for domesticated horses was found. Recent research also shows the domestic herds were repeatedly restocked with wild horses as they spread across Eurasia.  Horses were initially kept as a food animal, but their full potential as a means of transport, communication and warfare resulted in them being of increasing importance in the development of human civilisation. In Mongolia, the land of the horse, the legendary 13th-century warlord Genghis Khan used the animal to establish a domain that extended from Hungary to Korea, and from Siberia to Tibet: an Asian empire won on horseback.  So, if horses were so important to human civilisation, why not the zebra? Humans originated in Africa so it seems strange that they missed exploiting such a potentially useful animal living on the same continent.  Unlike the Equids of Eurasia, however, the zebra population of Africa was relatively secure and particularly well adapted to its environment. All equids are herbivorous prey species with a well developed “flight or fight” response. But to survive in an environment where there is an abundance of large predators including lions, cheetahs and hyenas, the zebra evolved into a particularly alert, responsive animal that flees in the face of danger but also possesses a powerful response if captured.  The kick of a zebra can break a lion’s jaw. They can be savage biters and possess a “ducking” reflex that helps them avoid being caught by lasso. Familiarity with human hunter gatherers may also have fostered a strong avoidance response in the zebra. All of this means that zebra are not really “people friendly” and as a species they do not fit the criteria for domestication. According to the English explorer and polymath Francis Galton (a relative of Charles Darwin), these requirements include displaying a desire for comfort, being easy to tend, being useful and showing a fondness for man.  Galton uses the zebra as an example of an unmanageable species, stating that the Dutch Boers repeatedly tried to break zebra to harness. Although they had some success, the wild, mulish nature of the animals would frequently break out and thwart their efforts.  Although it appears possible to tame individual zebra, this species was not a good candidate for domestication. In addition to the intractable nature of the zebra and its strong survival instinct, the fact that this species is “lion fodder” may also have made them appear less attractive “partners” to early humans.  Domestication and selective breeding will undoubtedly have changed both the physical and behavioural characteristics of the horse, which during the early stages would probably have been smaller, wilder and more similar to the zebra than today’s horse.  And while horses may work harder, live in more urbanised environments and do the bidding of their owners, they also lead safer, more comfortable lives. Domestication saved the horse from extinction. In fact, as a survival strategy, domestication has certainly worked for the global horse population, which numbers 60m. By contrast, zebra numbers are probably now fewer than 800,000, with humans posing the greatest threat to their survival. Faced with these facts, which would you rather be?"
"Climate protesters on Saturday intensified efforts to disrupt life in London, and targeted sites including Billingsgate fish market and Shell’s headquarters. They said police took at least 28 of their supporters into custody. That number means that more than 1,200 Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested in London since their protests, over the government’s “failure” to act over climate change, were launched last Monday. And those detained include Belgian Princess Esméralda who was taken into a police van for questioning and held for about five hours after she joined a sit-in at Trafalgar Square on Thursday. “The more people from all sections of society protest, the greater the impact will be,” the 63-year-old said. Other protests launched on Saturday included one by more than 50 healthcare professionals – wearing scrubs and singing the Extinction Rebellion anthem – who gathered outside Shell’s headquarters before they marched to Parliament Square. “We are meeting outside Shell because they are one of the biggest companies involved in the oil and energy industry, and they have real power to decarbonise that industry,” said Alex Turner, 36, a paediatric and emergency doctor from Bristol. “We are protesting illegal levels of air pollution.”  Julia Simons, 23, a final-year medical student at Cambridge University, said: “Our government has the responsibility to explain [climate science] to its citizens, to understand that if they don’t act radically, that future which I’ve been studying for won’t exist.” Hundreds of protesters remained camped in Trafalgar Square, where police were continuing efforts to remove them and the roadblock they had set up in Westminster. Similar protests took place in many other countries. Dutch police arrested 130 activists in Amsterdam after they blocked a bridge in the centre of the city. Some protesters slumped on hammocks hung from pillars supporting the bridge to prevent boats from passing underneath. In France, hundreds of activists blocked a route to the national assembly in Paris for several hours but were later dispersed by police. In Brussels, demonstrators occupied the gardens of the royal palace while in Melbourne protesters said they would hold a “spring rebellion” of civil disobedience this week including blocking traffic. At the same time, a petition calling for non-violent protest to be maintained to ensure action is taken to tackle climate change has been signed by more than 300 scientists and environmentalists. “We have an obligation that extends beyond merely describing and understanding the natural world to taking an active part in helping to protect it,” the petition states. “The scientific community has already tried all conventional methods to draw attention to the crisis. We believe continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful and non-violent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law. We believe it is our moral duty to act now, and we urge other scientists to join us in helping to protect humanity’s only home.” A former Paralympic cyclist accused of climbing on to the top of a British Airways plane and gluing himself to it appeared in court on Saturday – and denied causing a public nuisance. James Brown, 55, who is visually impaired, is alleged to have climbed on the aircraft at London City airport on Thursday during the Extinction Rebellion protests. He appeared at Westminster magistrates court where a not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf by his solicitor Raj Chada. District judge John Zani granted Brown conditional bail, prohibiting him from going within one mile of any airport in the UK. Brown – who participated in five Paralympic Games and won two gold medals and a bronze – told reporters he was “relieved” to be out of custody. “I am not denying what I did, but I was compelled to do what I did because of my concerns for the future of my children,” he added. The protest at Billingsgate, the UK’s largest inland fish market, by Extinction Rebellion’s animal rebellion chapter began early on Saturday when protesters blocked the entrance. One demonstrator locked herself to the gate. Police initially tried to prevent the protesters from reaching the market but relented after negotiations, the group said. “At London’s Billingsgate market, thousands of fish, stolen daily from their ocean homes, lie dead or dying,” said Kerri Waters, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion. “Many will have suffocated slowly when pulled aboard fishing vessels, while thousands of others remain alive as they’re transported by lorry to the market, where they’ll be gutted or boiled alive.”"
"The fashion for wild animal skins and furs drove a hunting boom in the Amazon basin through the 20th century. A mass industry sprung up almost overnight and the hides of otters, jaguars or alligator-like caimans were soon being shipped round the world to be turned into coats, hats or accessories. The Amazon rainforest, and the animals that live there, are still feeling the impact today. We’ve just used a gold mine of previously unanalysed historical documents and unpublished shipping records to properly quantify, for the first time, the scale of this skin trade. Our study, conducted by a team of researchers from Brazil, New Zealand, the US and the UK and published in the journal Science Advances, reveals that some species are far more vulnerable than others, and points out implications for future management of Amazonian forests and forest wildlife. We documented the widespread decimation of large aquatic vertebrates, such as giant river otter, black caiman and manatee populations by commercial hunters, thanks to large amounts of obscure hide export data unearthed by the study. In contrast, terrestrial animals including collared peccaries (related to pigs), brocket deer and even jaguars were much more resilient to hunting pressure, even during the heyday of the luxury fur trade in the 1930s-1940s and again in the 1960s. We estimate that, between 1904 and 1969, at least 23m animals representing 20 species of mammals and reptiles were killed for hide exports in the western Brazilian Amazon. These figures represent only those hides that were formally recorded in port landing records. They can therefore severely underestimate the total impact of hunting on wild populations, since many animals were fatally wounded but not retrieved by hunters, many skins rot and were discarded on their way to market, and a large portion of the harvest went undeclared to avoid taxes.  Eleven animal species were hunted most heavily: giant river otter, neotropical otter, black caiman, capybara, and manatees are all aquatic or semi-aquatic, in that they spend most of their lives in and around water. Giant otters, for example, were targeted as their dense fur could be turned into luxurious coats.  Jaguar, ocelots and margays (both small cats), collared and white-lipped peccary and red brocket deer all live on land and were also all among the most hunted animals.  Between 1930 and 1970, hide exports from these species represented some US$500m in trade in the four westermost states of the Brazilian Amazon.  Commercial animal hunting took off in the Amazon after the collapse of international rubber prices in 1912, when plantation rubber from Malaysia made wild rubber commercially not viable. Initially, red brocket deer hides were the most popular export, though the trade soon became more intense and other animals were targeted, too.  Things peaked during World War II, as the US sought wild rubber from the Amazon to make up for the capture of those same Malaysian plantations by the Japanese. Up to 80,000 people moved into the region to take up wild rubber tapping, and many developed a lucrative sideline as hunters. The 1960s saw a second peak of Amazonian animal hide exports as exotic furs became valued in the clothing and fashion industry. Even though Brazil officially banned hunting in 1967, loopholes permitting the sale of warehoused stockpiles of hides meant illegal hunting and hide exports continued until the ratification of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1975. Demand for exotic furs continued through the 1980s, and it was only with the 1992 Rio Earth Summit that international opinion finally turned against the use of wild animal furs in fashion. We wanted to understand how resilient different animal populations were in the face of such intense commercial hunting. To do this, we looked at the number of certain species exported during peak harvest periods around World War II and again in the 1960s. We reasoned that, in those boom times, supply would fall only when numbers in the wild were beginning to be seriously affected.  One key finding is that aquatic species succumbed to the steepest declines. Mammals and reptiles that live along major Amazonian rivers and their tributaries, like giant river otters, black caiman or manatees, all suffered population collapse and local extinctions. Ecologists sometimes talk of “empty forests”, where large animals have all died off. Here, we describe “empty rivers”.  The Amazon forest remained far from empty, however, as land mammals fared much better. Most, including jaguar, deer and collared peccaries, were more resilient to intense hunting pressure, showing little or no decline in peak harvest numbers despite constant or increasing demand.  There’s a simple explanation for this: physical access. Floodplains and rivers make up just 12% of the surface area of the Amazon, and hunters travelled along rivers just like everyone else. Otters and manatees had a hard time avoiding humans, particularly in the dry season. Jaguars, meanwhile, could disperse into extensive upland forest areas. Often extremely remote and far from humans, these forests acted as refuges where large game populations were not exploited and animals were able to absorb the losses of those that had wandered too close to humans. Ecologists call this phenomenon “source-sink dynamics” or refuge-harvestable area. In fact, of the six terrestrial species that we assessed, only the white-lipped peccary showed significant population decline. As they travel in very large herds and are more susceptible to mass slaughter, these social animals will require special attention and conservation strategies.  Inaccessibility and source-sink dynamics contributed to the resilience of most terrestrial animal species during the Amazon’s hunting heyday. The same spatial processes underpin indigenous and other forest peoples’ hunting strategies to this day. However, the refuge areas that maintain animal populations despite continued hunting are under threat. Vast patches of forest are being chopped down or fragmented into smaller chunks, and roads, farms and dams are creeping ever further into the wilderness. In order to ensure wildlife conservation and food security for forest peoples in the Amazon, forests and river systems must remain interconnected beyond the limits of strictly protected conservation areas. Indigenous territories and sustainable use reserves are an important part of any global conservation strategy. If road encroachment and forest fragmentation continue, even highly resilient terrestrial animals would see their populations collapse. And no one wants to see more “empty forests”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI often have to listen to German greenies lecture the rest of the world about “responsible behavior” and “climate protection”. But when they are asked to make a contribution, they say no.
Per capita, Germans are close to no. 1 worldwide when it comes to flying. And hearing them constantly pontificate about protecting the climate, you’d think they’d be the first to offset their flight CO2 when flying. A recent radio report reveals that although Germans like to preach, they sure don’t care much about practicing it.
Show projects and talking about it are enough.
Rainer Hoffmann here steers our attention to a DRadio report about German fliers voluntarily paying a little extra on the price of an airline ticket to offset the CO2 emissions produced by the flight. German radio interviewed green journalist Phillip Schnee.
When booking an airline ticket online, some websites tell you how much CO2 your flying will cause. Then you can check a box if you wish to offset some of that CO2. Checking the box means you’ll have to pay a little extra (3 to 15 euros) for your flight. Now you’d think many Germans would be checking that little box if they were truly concerned and sure about manmade climate change.
Well, it turns out that they are not that concerned about it at all. The DRadio moderator asks Phillip Schnee how many people actually volunteer to offset some of the CO2 their flights produce (4:32). Schnee tells us the answer:

“At the biggest provider, at atmosfair.de, every year 100,000 flights are compensated. […] The experts from atmosfair estimate that less than 1% of the flights are compensated, and at less than one percent, they believe that the amount is so small that it is not really measurable.”
At the 1:00 minute mark, the moderator asks Schnee if the voluntary donations really offset the flight CO2 emissions? Schnee answers:
No, not really. […] You have to view it as a donation, and it’s better than doing nothing. The best thing one can do is to not fly.”
So the next time you’re in Europe and someone starts preaching about your environmental responsibilities, just nod in agreement, smile, say it’s a lovely story, and flash a little wink. Works every time.
The choice is really very clear, do you spend 10 euros for an offset that does nothing for the climate, or do you donate the money to a really worthy cause?

"Summer might be more than six weeks away but out-of-control bushfires have already torn across parts of eastern Australia in recent days, killing two people, destroying homes and threatening more lives. By Wednesday afternoon up to 30 homes were feared lost or badly damaged by bushfires burning in northern New South Wales. About 40 fires burned across the state. This did not surprise meteorologists and fire agencies. Record-breaking heat and windy conditions were forecast for parts of NSW and Queensland this week, prompting severe fire danger ratings. We’re often told the Australian bushfire season is starting earlier. This year it began in September on the eastern seaboard. Last year and in 2013 significant spring fires hit NSW and in 2015 they affected much of the nation’s southeast. But what lies behind this phenomenon? We examined seasonal fire weather history for 44 years at 39 weather stations to find the answer. This analysis is the most comprehensive ever conducted in Australia. It confirms the strength of the relationship between climate drivers such as El Niño, climate change and the Australian bushfire season. It also demonstrates that a few milder bushfire seasons do not mean climate change isn’t happening. The prerequisites for a severe bushfire season are high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds that coincide with long periods of low rainfall. These weather ingredients are used to calculate an area’s fire danger rating, using the forest fire danger index. The index produces a score reflecting the severity of fire weather on a given day, where zero represents minimal anger, 50 represents conditions where a fire ban may be issued, and 100 is potentially catastrophic. Loss of human lives and property most often occurs on days when the index is high in a particular area. But strong seasonal fire weather doesn’t always translate to high-impact fires. Other factors include terrain, vegetation, ignition and the weather on the day. We analysed the strength of the worst fire weather conditions to understand the relative severity of fire weather during different seasons and years, in relation to various climate drivers. In Australia the year-to-year changes in climate conditions are largely driven by three factors: the El Niño southern oscillation, the Indian ocean dipole, and the southern annular mode. Each of these involves either changes to sea surface temperatures, wind movements, or both. They can all can affect temperature and rainfall patterns across the southern hemisphere, including Australia. Our research confirmed that across the continent over more than four decades, climate drivers have affected Australia’s variable fire weather. Of these drivers, the El Niño southern oscillation is the most influential. Weather during an El Niño phase is typically hot and dry, leading to worse seasonal bushfire conditions. The positive phase of the Indian ocean dipole often coincides with El Niño and exacerbates its effects. This phase generally results in lower than average rainfall across southern Australia. But when these two climate modes are in a negative phase, our research confirms that Australia often experiences more rain and milder bushfire conditions. The modes evolve over many months and their effects on fire weather persist for several seasons. Their state during winter and spring is a strong indicator for the rest of the fire season for much of Australia. The southern annular mode refers to the north-south movement of strong westerly winds in parts of the southern hemisphere. When the mode is in a prolonged negative phase, fire weather conditions in Australia are worse, particularly in NSW. This effect is pronounced in winter and spring and means less rainfall and strong westerly winds. The 2019 winter saw a persistent negative southern annular mode, as did the 2013 and 2018 winter and spring seasons. There was a strong El Niño event and positive Indian ocean dipole in 2015. Australia’s bushfire season started earlier than usual in each of those years. The converse is also true. In 2011 a strong La Niña (the opposite of an El Niño) resulted in milder bushfire seasons, as did the negative Indian ocean dipole of 2016. Long-term climate change in Australia is an undeniable reality. The State of the Climate 2018 report for Australia notes strong land surface temperature increases and a 10%-20% decline in cool season rainfall across southern Australia since the 1970s. These changes are closely associated with increasing human greenhouse gas emissions, as well as natural variability. The changed conditions have led to an average increase in severe seasonal bushfire weather across Australia, especially in southern parts of the continent. The increased severity affects all seasons but in particular spring, which means that, on average, the bushfire season is starting earlier. Our research has made clear that climate modes bring large and rapid swings to the fire weather, while human-induced climate change gradually increases background fire weather conditions. The trend generally means an earlier start to the bushfire seasons than in the past. Climate change is definitely playing a role in producing the earlier start to bushfire seasons and overall more extreme seasons, particularly in southeastern Australia. However, the natural variations in climate modes continue to play a key role, meaning we should not expect every bushfire season to be worse than the last as a result of climate change. Similarly, a few milder bushfire seasons among a string of record high seasons do not mean that climate change should be dismissed.

"The adder, Vipera berus, was one of the first venomous snakes formally named by Linnaeus in 1758. It is the most northerly occurring snake, and one of the most widely distributed species, found everywhere from the UK to Sakhalin island, Russia. It is also the only venomous snake in Great Britain. Despite this, centuries of bad press for the adder, ranging from folklore to Shakespeare, have left its mark.  You may be forgiven for thinking that adders are becoming a serious problem in the UK after several high-profile headlines this summer. While not as sensationalist as those relating to false widow spiders, there certainly seems to have been a spike in the number of adder bites, perhaps encouraged by periods of hot weather as late as September. Given that this may be a more regular feature as climate change takes hold, should we be worried about the abundance of the adder?  The answer is yes, but not because of an increase, rather because the adder is in widespread decline, particularly in the UK. Despite being described as of “least concern” in the IUCN red list of threatened species, recent reports from the Netherlands, the UK and other parts of western Europe show drastic regional drops in numbers.  The fall in adder numbers is frequently attributed to the same suite of factors: disappearance of their habitats, increasing isolation and a decrease in the quality of the remaining habitat resulting from over-zealous management, an increase in disturbance from recreation on prime adder habitats, and deliberate persecution. But it’s not just that: a lack of attention to species that continue to be widespread but are declining in number is a wider conservation problem, not least because the occasional encounter with a charismatic animal tends to leave a lasting impression, making it appear more common than it really is. Adders have had some level of protection in the UK for 15 years: their trade was banned in England and Wales in 1981, while additional amendments in 1991 – and 2004 in Scotland – stopped intentional killing and injuring of them. European legislation also covers the adder, and yet they have continued to decline to the point that they are now extinct in some counties, such as Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire, and only found in small isolated pockets of suitable habitat in others. Even populations which are hanging on are smaller than they were 12 years ago. Somehow, management that is benefiting other reptiles is not working for the adder. While it may be tempting to attribute the decline to poor public image, it is more likely that the adder is much more fussy about its requirements than other species. They are a species on the edge in more ways than one, preferring to occupy the boundaries between scrub – which they use for cover – and more open heathland or chalk grassland, which offers foraging and basking opportunities. They prefer mid-successional vegetation stages that, if left to their own devices, would gradually turn into woodland and therefore require active management to keep them at the right stage. In short, a lot needs to be right if a habitat is to play host to a healthy adder population.  Moreover, access to a suitable place to sit out winter frosts is essential, and destruction of such shelters can rapidly eliminate an existing population. Meanwhile, many areas which formerly did, or could, support adder populations are managed with other species in mind, using practices which are directly or indirectly detrimental to adders. Increasingly regular burning of moorland for grouse management is one obvious example, but even the maintenance of a short and open sward to favour orchids can be counterproductive for adders. But apart from the handful of experts and enthusiasts engaged in keeping the adder alive, does anyone else care? UK conservation bodies are currently constructing a national “Red List” and the adder is likely to be listed as at least “vulnerable” to extinction. This, along with other forthcoming reports, may finally make the adder a priority species, one that needs to be considered when designating protected areas and in designing their management plans.  For those less than enamoured by the thought of an adder in their midst, bear in mind that an adder bite can be treated effectively by using anti-venom. Ultimately, we all need to cultivate a more informed attitude to risk. The last recorded human death in the UK from an adder bite was in 1975, and between 2004 to 2010, there were only 510 snake bite enquiries to the UK national poisons information service.  Interestingly, bites by the adder accounted for only 52% of these cases, with bites by exotic species presumably being kept as captive animals accounting for the largest proportion of the remaining bites. On the other hand, an NHS report on the number of people bitten by dogs shows that in 2009-2010 alone, dog bites were responsible for 5,914 hospital admissions in England, with at least 21 fatalities during the last 10 years. Now who’s the snake in the grass?"
"Here we go again. The latest wave of shouty headlines about outsized monster invaders is rolling in. The latest crop – fantastically – are the “billions of super fleas with giant penises” invading British homes. These monsters are giants, said The Mirror – “far bigger than normal fleas”. And, according to The Express, they “have mutated to have large manhoods and are now immune to poisons”. The Sun went even further, suggesting that their penises were all “erect”. Save yourselves! Hysteria around arthropods (insects, spiders and their allies) is common fodder for newspapers – it’s been barely a month since a completely different swarm of “giant cannibal spiders” was “invading British bedrooms”. Pholcids, the spiders in question, are not only utterly harmless but are in fact beneficial because they eat other less harmless insects. Such headlines pour oil on an unhelpful fire of general fear and aversion towards arthropods. This fear is unnecessary and avoidable. An awesome experiment involving Doctor Who in 2011 demonstrated that there is nothing innate or evolutionary about this fear – and it most likely persists through cultural reinforcement. So if we don’t teach our kids to be afraid of bugs, they won’t grow up afraid of bugs. And that means they won’t miss out on a whole world of awesome. At least with fleas there is something to be genuinely concerned about – they are, after all, obligate bloodsuckers and can be vectors for several important diseases including bubonic plague. But we have been living and dealing with fleas for centuries. Caution is sensible; blind panic is not.  But what’s all the fuss about these fleas and their penises? A flea’s penis, however giant, is quite the wrong end of a flea to get worried about.  Let’s try and unpick this story a little. To begin with, fleas are not “invading” – they are already found everywhere except the Arctic. Fleas typically follow cycles with adult populations booming in summer and generally dying away in winter. They thrive in damp, humid conditions but cannot develop below about 13°C, meaning winter usually halts their activity.   However, there has been a succession of increasingly wet summers and mild winters, which provides good conditions for flea breeding. So fleas may be proliferating in the balmy weather. Some veterinary organisations and charities have reported increases in cases. And these reports appear to have been cherry-picked by tabloids in an effort to create panic. But Natalie Bungay of the British Pest Control Association said: “There have certainly not been any reports of any anomalies in flea reports whether it be the size of them or frequency of them.” Neither is there any truth in the claim that these insects are resistant to current pesticides. While fleas may have become resistant to many older insecticides, there is no conclusive evidence of any resistance to more modern chemical treatments. Concerns about what looks like resistance are mostly down to failure to follow, or stick to, product directions.  There is also no obvious evidence that fleas are getting any bigger. Neither, disappointingly, are their penises.   However, it has to be said: there is at least truth in the rumour of “giant-penised fleas”. Fleas do have extraordinarily long penises. Being in possession of a 3.3mm appendage may not sound like much, but it is up to 2.5 times the flea’s own body length – on an average man that’d be a four-metre member. But this was the case anyway – there is no new breed of particularly monstrously hung mutants, just the regular well-endowed ones. The penis size of the flea is a record for insects, although not for animals generally as is sometimes claimed. That honour goes to the barnacle (eight times its body length, which would be 14 metres on a human in case you are wondering). But flea genitalia are hardly a clear and present threat. On the contrary – what flea penises are is fascinating. They have been described as “the most elaborate genital organ in the animal kingdom”. The penis is an immensely long wispy ribbon-like structure, kept coiled up inside the abdomen when not in use. It is so thin that it is “only faintly discernible”, even under a microscope, and cannot enter the female by itself. It must be supported by extra structures called “penis rods” which, along with external claspers, help to manoeuvre the whole apparatus into place for mating to occur. The precise function of the penis rods is not entirely clear – one end is shaped “like a cobra’s hood”, so they may act to scoop out rivals’ sperm. Alternatively they may help to transfer the sperm to the female – one author observed sperm with tails “wound around the penis rods like spaghetti on a fork”. Nobody really knows. Such a delicate, fragile organ is hardly something to strike terror into the  hearts of the nation, so why all the tabloid hate?  Maybe they were thinking of Strepsipteran penises, or possibly bedbug penises. Those are a whole different, rather stabbier ball game: genuinely the stuff of nightmares. Look them up if you dare. Or maybe bushcricket genitals, some of which resemble bear traps and handcuffs.  The mechanical details of how males and females mate is enormously important in determining whether – and which – DNA is passed on. It’s therefore somewhat central to the process of evolution. Genitals are used as anchors, hooks, locks and keys, turnstiles, advertisements, titillators, manhole-covers, crowbars, weapons, mazes and many more – and with such a bewildering array of functions they are some of the fastest-evolving structures in nature. Insect genitals, particularly, are a smorgasbord of delightful weirdness. Male damselflies have shovel-shaped penises for removing rivals’ sperm. Some male spiders snap off one of their two detachable penises inside their mate, both to deter future lovers and to prolong sex while they run away. Female barklice’s vaginas are shaped like a prehensile penis and literally reach into the male to grab his sperm. The point being: insect genitals are compelling enough already, without the need to invent reasons to be scared or disgusted by them “invading our bedrooms”. So fleas may be enjoying a bit of a comeback in some warm, wet weather. But they are not invading, and neither are they mutants with giant penises. Fleas, in general, have impressive members – but the flea class of 2016 has no particular claim to endowment over previous alumni."
"The Greens have intensified efforts ahead of the return of federal parliament next week to lobby moderate Liberals to break ranks and vote for a motion declaring a climate emergency. With parliament set to resume on Monday, the lower house Greens MP Adam Bandt has written to all parliamentarians in the House urging them to support the climate emergency motion, which would be seconded by independent Zali Steggall, and has the support of most of the crossbench.  “Every member of parliament is capable of supporting this motion,” Bandt says in the letter. “It does not condemn the government … nor does it express support for any particular policy position. “It simply acknowledges the science and calls on the government to take urgent action. This motion is a statement that individual members of parliament recognise the seriousness of the challenge we face. “Once the declaration has been made, having recognised across the political spectrum that this is a challenge we all face together, the debate can begin in earnest about the best way to deal with the emergency. “Given that members of the Coalition have a free vote, I expect that government MPs will feel free to vote for the motion. On this issue, every individual parliamentarian has a duty to act.” Labor has discussed the proposal with the Greens but is yet to decide whether or not to back the motion, and the opposition has been publicly at odds over future emission reduction targets in the past week. During the last parliamentary sitting in September, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, told Guardian Australia it was abundantly clear there is a climate emergency. “I’ve said so in the parliament on a number of occasions.” But Butler said there was also little to no prospect of the Greens-led motion getting up in the current parliament, because Liberals would not break ranks. Liberals would need to vote in favour of the motion for it to have any prospect of success. In that context, Butler said he was “not sure it is realistic to have a debate”. At the time the proposed motion was unveiled, the former Liberal leader John Hewson urged Scott Morrison to give his MPs a conscience vote. Hewson argued if it had been acceptable for Tony Abbott to declare a budget emergency in the run-up to the 2013 election, Liberals in 2019 should have no issue with adopting the language in the Greens motion, because declaring a climate emergency in Australia “almost goes without saying”. An e-petition circulating calling on the House to immediately act and declare a climate emergency in Australia, and introduce legislation that will with immediacy and haste reduce the causes of anthropogenic climate change, has now reached 312,779 signatures – which is a record for Australian parliamentary petitions. The British parliament declared a climate emergency in May, endorsing a parliamentary motion moved by the Labour party. Conservative MPs in the UK were told to not oppose the Labour motion. A number of Australian councils have also declared a climate emergency. The Australian Medical Association has formally declared climate change a health emergency, pointing to “clear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future”. Several Liberal MPs have signed on to a crossbench-led climate action committee, as the parliament’s independents attempt to take partisan politics out of the nation’s climate policies. Tim Wilson, Dave Sharma, Jason Falinski, Katie Allen, Angie Bell and Trent Zimmerman are among the Liberal MPs to sign up to the Parliamentary Friends of Climate Action group, along with Labor’s Ged Kearney and Josh Burns as well as Adam Bandt from the Greens and Andrew Wilkie."
"Hurricane Matthew, the Atlantic’s first Category 5 storm in almost a decade, slammed into Haiti on October 4. Strong winds left a path of death and destruction through the island, with at least 1,000 people already confirmed dead and more than 2m of the island’s 10m population affected. Now there are warnings of famine and cholera. Haitians, however, are no strangers to disaster. A 2010 earthquake left at least 100,000 dead and a subsequent cholera outbreak affected many more. Flooding in 2004 also killed thousands. And those are just the major events that make it into the global media. For most people in Haiti, so-called “natural disasters” are a recurrent theme in their lives. In the US, however, it’s a different story. Hurricane Matthew reached Florida two days later and ran along the coast to North and South Carolina, killing at least 33. Though the storm slowed as it made its way across the Caribbean, the difference in death numbers is not coincidental: natural disasters remain disproportionately a hazard of the poor. Globally, the number of deaths from disasters is falling. However, they still have the most debilitating effects in developing countries, where population growth, the burgeoning of shanty towns and land degradation all add to the risk.  Disaster statistics in the developed world tell a completely different story, in which the number of fatalities proportional to the total population has declined dramatically in recent decades. There, building and zoning codes are typically well-enforced, structures are retrofitted to withstand hazards, emergency services are better equipped, and early warning systems have become increasingly sophisticated. All this has reduced human losses, even if the cost in material terms increased at least eightfold in the last four decades of the 20th century. Natural disasters have come to mean two very different types of events depending on where you are in the world. British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli famously spoke of “two nations” who are “as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets”. Disraeli was talking about Victorian Britain, but the same might be said about the “two worlds” that have come to separate people in the developed and developing countries in terms of wealth, life expectancy and exposure to risk. For one, disaster is now principally about economic loss, and for the other it remains primarily about loss of life. The root of this separation lies in the way disasters are perceived. In the developed world, disasters are viewed as abnormal events, a temporary disruption  in everyday lives and where a return to “normality” is confidently expected. On October 9, for instance, two days after the storm peaked in Florida, the state’s governor announced the national guard would help schools reopen as quickly as possible.  In the developing world, disasters are seen as normal everyday events that people have had to learn to live with. So normal, in fact, that society and culture are partly the product of adapting to their frequent occurrence.  This fault line also extends to the nature of the state. The developed world is governed by strong states that “nationalise” disasters, disempower their citizens and absolve them of responsibility for their own personal safety. The state in developing countries, however, is fundamentally weaker without the institutional and infrastructural capacity to provide for the needs of its citizens. As a result, communities are stronger, made more self-reliant through neglect and default. Trust is at the local level, expressed in terms of families, friends and neighbourhoods.  For the inhabitants of one world, disasters have become primarily a state affair; for the inhabitants of the other, they are a community concern. In the developed world, disaster mitigation is primarily a matter of science and technology and the numerical modelling of risk. However, for those in the developing world, disaster preparedness is generally about people: educating, training and organising them; relying on them to take care of themselves, because the state does not possess the resources for technological solutions. Developed countries are increasingly concerned with protecting property and sensitive structures like costly skyscrapers or nuclear power plants. Disaster is largely calculated in property damage – “Hurricane Matthew economic damage nears $6 billion”. While the material damage inflicted on developing countries can be immense in relative terms, disaster is still measured in lost lives. Governments remain primarily concerned with saving people. Priorities, therefore, are often at odds: Western advice is frequently regarded as impractical or irrelevant by many in developing countries.  Moreover, much Western-funded reconstruction and aid is tied to a set of externally imposed guidelines frequently espousing neoliberal values that can make matters worse by channelling scarce resources into inappropriate projects. This “development aggression” leaves people more exposed to risk by ignoring community needs and treating local people mainly as passive recipients or as a profit-making resource. As a result of differences in both what disasters mean and the way to tackle them, the communitarian and organisational skills of people in developing countries are often unfairly dismissed and ignored. The emphasis on low-cost, low-tech solutions that stress living with risk and encouraging self-reliance is regarded by professionals in developed countries as a response to the absence of state services rather than as the bedrock of what makes communities resilient.  Such attitudes make for an uncertain future as climate change and population growth affect both the magnitude and frequency of extreme events. Disraeli’s two “nations” have become “two worlds”. As disasters like Hurricane Matthew become more commonplace, all of us may be forced to rely less on state services and costly defences and more on ourselves and our neighbours."
"Did Kumbuka, the silverback gorilla who escaped from his enclosure at London Zoo, go on a King Kong type rampage through the city? No. Was he even seen out of his enclosure by a member of the public? No. Yet looking at some of the coverage the day after his little sojourn into the back quarters of his enclosure, you’d think he had grabbed one of the Kardashian sisters and climbed to the top of The Shard with her. I know dramatic headlines sell stories, but some perspective is needed about what happened.  The gorilla reportedly got into a non-public but secure area of his enclosure where he should not have been, perhaps after a door was left open. And London Zoo, being very responsible, put into action its animal escape procedure – despite the risk to public being minimal. No doubt the zoo thought it better to be safe than sorry, especially after the Harambe case at Cincinnati Zoo which saw the gorilla shot dead after a boy fell into his enclosure. Back in the 1990s I was research coordinator at Edinburgh Zoo and never once, in the four years I worked there, was there a lockdown due to an animal escape. Of course animals will and do occasionally escape from zoos, but these are rare events. There are a few million animals housed in the world’s 10,000 zoos with each institution having a hundred or so enclosures on average. Now we need to multiply this by 365 days in a year and we come out with a number of 3.65m zoo enclosure days in a year. I think it is unreasonable not expect a few escapes given the scale of animal keeping by zoos. After all, good zoo enclosures are designed to let animals express as much natural behaviour as possible – they’re not meant to be maximum security prisons. Zoo animals in well-designed enclosures should be supplied with all of the creature comforts they need, so why leave? Modern zoo enclosures are designed to promote animal well-being, not to punish their occupants – despite what some in the anti-zoo movement might say. I am not arguing here that zoos are Utopia, but rather that they can provide a good quality of life for their occupants. The functions of the modern zoo are, as I always tell my students: conservation, education, research and leisure – all underpinned by good animal welfare.  Animals kept in poor conditions will often not have the behavioural skills necessary to survive even if they were released back into the wild, and so will be of limited conservation value. Poorly-treated animals won’t behave like their wild counterparts (or even those in good zoos), and so will have limited education value. There is no education value in a gorilla that spends its days displaying abnormal behaviour. In terms of research, most animals in poor conditions would only be of interest in determining how much their environment impacts on their on well-being – so, again, of limited value.  Zoos across much of the world are also increasingly savvy about animal welfare and aware of the effect poorly-kept animals have on the bottom line. Gone are the days when people laughed at chimpanzee tea parties. Animal species are declining globally due to human activities, and the great apes, despite their genetic, physical and behavioural similarity to us are declining especially rapidly. Kumbuka, for instance, is a western lowland gorilla, a subspecies with the wonderful scientific name Gorilla gorilla gorilla which is found in west-central Africa. They’re the most common gorilla subspecies and they’re still listed as critically endangered. So while all sensible zoos would agree that the best place to conserve gorillas is in the wild, sometimes this is simply not possible due to political and economic instability in certain regions of the world.  Captive-bred animals are an insurance population. Insurance, such as car insurance, is one of those things we pay for hoping that we never need to use it. But there is an important difference here – zoos, by showing the wonder of animals close-up, can encourage people to behave more sustainably and to reduce the risk of needing to cash in this insurance.  To take just one example: many zoos now have education programmes to encourage visitors only to buy food made with sustainably-sourced palm oil. Palm oil production is one of the biggest threats to the gorilla’s cousin the orangutan. So yes, London Zoo’s gorilla briefly escaped into a staff-only enclosure. It made for lots of great headlines. But, like the animals they keep, good zoos should be encouraged not beaten for the occasional mishap."
"Theobroma, the genus to which cacao, or “cocoa” as we know it, belongs, translates from the Latin as “food of the gods”. Ask any serious chocoholic and they would agree that this is an apt name to be used in relation to the sweet treat that many worldwide enjoy. Much to the dismay of said chocolate lovers, there has been a decline in the availability of cocoa recently, putting the global chocolate supply at risk. The trees on which cocoa pods grow have suffered due to a combination of factors, including crop failure, disease and ageing plantations, which has led to price fluctuations and a shortfall in supply. Global demand for the ingredient has been growing meanwhile, leading industry experts to warn there could be a chocolate deficit of 1m tonnes by 2020.  What to do? Use of a substitute ingredient would work, but they are very rarely accepted happily by consumers. The industry is still seeking an alternative, however, as experts confirm that chocolate as it is known and loved now could turn into a much sweeter confectionery. But rather than bulking bars up with sweet nougat or raisins in place of cocoa butter – the key component currently used – there is another way. Cocoa butter is the pure butter extracted from cocoa beans and is one of the unique natural fats highly demanded by the food industry, as well as for use in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. It is currently the only commercially available natural fat which is rich in saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids. There are some alternatives available based on lauric and myristic acid – but these have both been shown to increase blood cholesterol.  The price of cocoa butter is one of the highest among all tropical fats and oils and, according to International Cocoa Organisation, its cost more than doubled between 2005 and 2015. Finding an alternative that will satisfy the world’s sweet tooth is not an easy task, but we may just have found the answer: wild mango. Wild mango is something of a “Cinderella” species, the potential of which is as yet unrealised. The fruit is a mainstay in the lives of rural Bangladeshis in the hill forest areas of the country, where it is extensively used in pickles and chutneys, for food and for medicines. However, it is not farmed in any formal sense and remains a wild species, sporadically collected throughout the year.  Our research has found that this fruit could provide an alternative to the much coveted cocoa butter, plucking it from the branches of obscurity into mainstream production. The analyses we conducted showed that wild mango butter, made from the fruit’s stone, has a very similar chemical, physical and thermal profile to cocoa butter – as well as several superior properties. It has a higher solid triglyceride content, for example, which means it can be used to improve soft cocoa butters, and make a temperature resistant hard chocolate. It has the added advantage of being a fruit with a large kernel – typically 40-50% of its body mass – meaning it has a  proportionately high fat content: 9-14%.  Additionally, the colour of the mango butter is same as cocoa butter – and the melting point is also very close, which is of great importance for maintaining chocolate production processes and reducing some of the cost. Though, unfortunately, our funding did not allow us to make a bar of scrumptious chocolate with the mango alternative, the science is all there – and cultivating the wild mango may have extra benefits for society and the environment too. Wild mango can be found growing in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Myanmar, China, Thailand and Cambodia. However, the species is declining at an alarming rate due to logging, shifting cultivation and very few conservation efforts. There is an enormous potential for the development of a wild mango  enterprise, which the food and cosmetic industries could make use of together."
"Rarely has a project to bring a city together been as divisive as London’s Garden Bridge. Conceived by British actress Joanna Lumley and championed by the city’s previous mayor, Boris Johnson, the Garden Bridge is billed as “a stunning new public garden and a vital new pedestrian crossing, spanning the River Thames from the South Bank to Temple station on the north bank”. But opposition to the project was fierce from the beginning, and it continues to intensify as public funds are put at stake.  The development of the Garden Bridge cuts to the core of current debates about the provision, cost and role of green spaces in our cities. Green spaces are central to “liveability”; they provide health and well-being benefits, aid urban climate control, promote biodiversity and can have significant impacts on property prices. Parks also have a clear role as places for social interaction, recreation and environmental education.  Given these benefits, it might seem like any investment in green space should be welcomed. With plans for hundreds of trees and thousands of plants, supporters of the Garden Bridge say it will be both beautiful and functional – an extraordinary place to relax, observe or “race across”.  But campaigners raise several objections. For one thing, they say the project lacks transparency and questions have been raised regarding the fairness of the design competition and procurement process, as well as the influence exerted by celebrities and prominent architects.  Critics have also argued that the proposed location is already well serviced by bridges (albeit not “garden” ones), with Waterloo Bridge fewer than 400 metres from the site. What’s more, there are other locations – east of Greenwich, for instance – which would benefit more from a cross-Thames connection, while cheaper alternatives would reclaim existing infrastructure, in the style of New York’s famous High Line – for example, Allies and Morrison’s proposal for a garden on Blackfriars Bridge.  As local authorities confront austerity budgets, funding for parks and gardens is often one of the first things to be cut. As a result, many local governments are seeking to establish alternative sources of income – such as the privately-owned playground Go Ape in Battersea Park, south London. This prompts the question: can we justify developing new green spaces, when the costs of maintaining existing ones is already overwhelming? The Garden Bridge is expected to cost £185m, the bulk of which is to come from £125m worth of private donation, with a further £60m of public funding from Transport for London and the Department for Transport.  London Mayor Sadiq Khan has given assurances that no more public money will be dedicated to the scheme. But with somewhere between £56m and £75m worth of private donations still to be sourced, there are concerns that further requests for funding will be put to the government.  In response to concerns over the costs of the project, Khan ordered an inquiry into whether the bridge offers good value for money. But cancelling the project would not come cheap, either: a recent investigation by the National Audit Office (NAO) found that roughly £22.5m worth of public funding could be lost, if the project doesn’t proceed.  The question of who should pay for the bridge has a lot to do with ownership. The Garden Bridge will by administered by a trust, rather than a public authority, so the government will have little control over how the taxpayer’s money is spent. It also means that the bridge will not be a truly public space. Instead, the trust will have the power to close the bridge for private events throughout the year, and dictate how the bridge is used – so far, the list of unacceptable activities include cycling, playing an instrument and flying a kite.  Even so, the Garden Bridge would deliver some of the key benefits of green spaces – and it’s not necessarily as bad a design as some campaigners believe. The project could generate financial, political and social buy-in for a new, green public space, just like London’s Olympic Park did. We cannot ignore such landmark developments – and in fact, we may need them if we are to keep maintaining and expanding green public spaces in our cities.  But there is a difference between developing spaces that people can freely enjoy, and designing quasi-private spaces that limit the activities, times and numbers of people allowed in. Historically, public parks have been welcoming and open to all, without imposing major limitations on how people interact with them: we should aim to maintain the ethos of accessibility, functionality and diversity for our green spaces."

Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne website presents a video showing British European Parliamentarian Roger Helmer delivering a statement before the European Parliament in Strasbourg on July 5, slamming Europe’s climate religion and energy policy.

Don’t ask me where all the other EU deadbeat parliamentarians are. Probably on their month-long taxpayer-funded summer holidays! That aside, there’s so much here in Helmer’s statement that needs to be quoted. For example:
More and more scientists are rejecting the alarmist case. […] The world is awash with natural gas. […] We are forcing households and pensioners into fuel poverty. We have chosen to impoverish our children and grandchildren. Future generations will look back at this period with horror and despair, and colleagues they will never forgive us.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you ask renowned IPCC scientists what the mean global temperature is today, they tell you it’s 14.5°C.
And if you ask them what it was 20 years ago, you would expect the answer to be about 14°C. Surprisingly, their literature from 20 years ago tell us unanimously that in 1990 the global temperature was 15.5°C, one degree Celsius more than today. Look at their own charts below!
The charts that follow are from a compliation made by Rainer Hoffmann of Solarkritik.de.
CHARTS FROM 1990
1991: Here is a German government chart, based on Schönwiese. Global temperature in 1991: 15.5°C

1988: Der Spiegel reported a global mean temperature of 15.5°C:

1992: Christian-Dietrich Schönwiese in his book Klima Im Wandel on pages 72 and 73: Global temperature computed from satellite measurements was 15.5°C.

 
Rainer Hoffmann presents other sources from the early 1990s confirming the 15.5°C mean global temperature 20 years ago. Back then 15.5°C appeared to be the consensus among the scientific community.

Now 20 years later in 2012. The IPCC scientists are telling us that the current mean global temperature is 14.5°C. One degree celsius less. Why the downgrade?
In 2012 IPCC honchos Hans-Joachim Schellhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf in their recent 7th edition book Der Klimawandel (see the next chart below) cite Hadley, saying today the global average temperature is 14.5°C. That’s a whole degree less!

Mojib Latif on March, 20, 2012 at his presentation in Hamburg confirmed the current global mean temperature of 14.5°C.

The IPCC’s 4th Assessment report of 2007 also used the 14.5° figure for the mean global temperature.

Source: http://www.bmbf.de/pub/IPCC2007.pdf
At that rate of colling, 15.5° in 1990 to 14.5° in 2010, we’ll be deep into an ice age by the end of the century.
How can we be having global warming when the temperature went from 15.5°C in the early 1990s to only 14.5°C today? Are climate scientists just throwing out numbers?
How much are 14.5 – 15.5? The answer is -1.0. But the IPCC is telling us it’s +0.5.
These numbers prove that there’s something arbitrary, fishy and fraudulent about the climate data being fed to the public today. It means nobody really has a clue what the global temperature really is.

Windparks are paid even power that doesn’t get delivered. (Photo by: Philip May.  GNU-Lizenz für freie Dokumentation,)
But what happens when the sun shines and the wind blows too much, and the power companies don’t need the power?
Answer: the power companies ask the green producers to stop production. But now comes the hitch: If the power companies don’t need the power, German law still requires the power companies to pay green producers for the energy that they would have produced had they not been asked to shut down. Therefore solar panel and windfarm operators get money whether they produce or not. No risks!
One example, according to leading German daily Bild here, is a windfarm operated by Green Party activist Reinhard Christiansen (58). The “Bürgerwindpark” (People’s Windpark), which was built 12 years ago for €8.5 million, at times produces more energy than E.ON power company actually needs, and thus often gets asked to shut down. However, E.ON must pay for the ungenerated power.
The result? Consumers have to pay for the electricity that never gets delivered, let alone consumed! So far Christiansen has hauled in 2.5 million euros ($3 million) for “phantom electric power”.
Bild quotes Christiansen:
We can sell a lot more power than what the power company is able to accept.“

Adding:
The ‘People’s Windpark’ pulled in 2.5 million euros for compensation for power that could have been generated but could not be used because of a lack of grid capacity.”
Bild writes that this is no isolated incident and that Germany’s Feed-In Act has led to a flurry of bizarre incidences where millions get paid out for “phantom electric power”.
In 2010, 10.2 million euros were paid out, and the trend is exploding upwards. Bild quotes a confidential internal government document:
For a midsize windpark, amounts in the neighborhood of well over 100 million euros can be reached quickly.“
Bild concludes:
In the end the crazy thing is that it’s again the consumers who wind up paying for power that never gets used.”
In Germany, it is not uncommon for the mayor and city officials to get in on the profiteering, often pushing windfarm projects through against the stiff resistance of local citizens. It’s a business fraught with corruption and shady deals. Welcome to Germany’s Energiewende (energy transformation) where a few are laughing their way to the bank, and the rest are being taken to the cleaners.

"Joel Fitzgibbon has copped a blast in the left and right caucus meetings for declaring Labor should adopt the Coalition’s Paris emissions reduction target rather than pursue ambitious cuts to carbon pollution. The internal unrest came as the shadow cabinet was expected to sign off on Monday night on a shift in Labor’s attitude to the controversial “big stick” policy of the Morrison government.  Labor opposed the government’s policy in the last parliament to create a “big stick” power breaking up big energy companies if they engaged in price gouging. But it is now, assuming shadow cabinet and caucus approval, expected to allow the legislation to pass, having received assurances it will not be used as a backdoor means of privatising state-owned assets. Fitzgibbon, the shadow resources minister, who suffered a significant swing against him in his coalmining seat in the Hunter Valley in the May election, used a speech to the Sydney Institute last week to argue the ALP should offer “a political and policy settlement” on climate policy “to make 28% the target by 2030”. The unanticipated foray from the senior New South Wales rightwinger prompted internal uproar, and the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, promptly declared Labor would not adopt Tony Abbott’s suboptimal target. “The government’s target, which was developed by Tony Abbott with no expert advice, is fundamentally inconsistent with the Paris agreement,” Butler told Guardian Australia. “It would lead to global warming of more than 3C and, for that reason, Labor cannot support that target”. With parliament resuming on Monday after a spring break, the left and the right caucuses met separately in the evening ahead of Labor’s regular caucus gathering on Tuesday morning. Guardian Australia understands that in the left caucus, more than 10 MPs spoke forcefully against Fitzgibbon’s intervention, including the senior frontbenchers Tanya Plibersek and Catherine King. Butler, a South Australian leftwinger, and key Albanese backer, did not speak at the meeting but attended and received unanimous support for his position. In the right caucus, Fitzgibbon also faced criticism from within his own group, with colleagues concerned that his contribution at the Sydney Institute had been unhelpful to both Labor and to the leader, Anthony Albanese. While the majority of contributions during the right caucus discussion were sharply negative about the Fitzgibbon proposal, according to people present – with colleagues pointing out that not everybody in the faction represented a coalmining electorate – there was, however, in-principle support for having a debate about the climate policies Labor took to the 2019 election. There was concern in the right that internal discussion about Labor’s climate policies before the last election had been largely restricted to the shadow cabinet rather than a more freewheeling conversation in caucus. Fitzgibbon, according to people at the meeting, launched a robust defence of his position both on the policy substance and on the politics of climate change. He contended at the Sydney Institute that ambitious climate policies had cost Labor both leaders and elections, and told colleagues on Monday night that trying to front a position where emissions were reduced to zero by mid-century would be politically fraught. Assuming an about face on the “big stick” is ticked by shadow cabinet on Monday night, that will hand the Morrison government a significant win. It was faced with the risk of amendments during parliamentary debate that would have split the Liberals and the Nationals. The Centre Alliance was proposing to amend the legislation to impose a divestiture power across the economy, not just to the energy sector. While Nationals might have viewed that favourably, it would have prompted a revolt among Liberals already concerned that the proposal offends the pro-market principles of the government."
"The Greens’ hopes of flying a hot air balloon over Parliament House to protest global heating have been deflated by a last-minute restriction on flights due to security concerns. Despite blocking the balloon plan, parliament’s presiding officers have approved an Extinction Rebellion protest at the authorised assembly area in front of parliament from 14 to 18 October, the Senate president, Scott Ryan, has revealed. Last week the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wrote to members hoping to raise $10,000 for a hot air balloon to provide extra lift to the party’s efforts to get parliament to declare a climate emergency when it returns on Monday. The Greens had obtained approval from the National Capital Authority to use the East Lawn at Parkes and Federation Mall for use in climate emergency protests and also claim to have consulted the Australian Federal Police about use of the balloon. On Saturday Airservices Australia issued a notice to airmen after a decision by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority restricting all flights within a 0.25 nautical mile radius of parliament between Saturday 12 October and Monday 28 October, covering the entire sitting fortnight. Di Natale questioned whether the government had pressured Casa to shut down the airspace over parliament to thwart the Greens’ climate protest, suggesting that would represent a “serious abuse of power”. Ryan told Guardian Australia as a “general rule” hot air balloons do not fly over parliament, but the Department of Parliamentary Services needed to consider the question after the Greens floated the idea as a novel form of protest. “Flying of hot air balloons over Parliament House presents a safety and security risk to people and the Parliament House building,” Ryan said. “Following consultation with the AFP, on behalf of the Presiding Officers, made an application for a temporary restriction of airspace which prevents aircraft flying over and immediately around Parliament House without prior approval.” A spokesman for Casa told Guardian Australia: “Casa responded to a request by security agencies for temporary restricted airspace at Parliament House, Canberra. “The request was assessed under normal processes. CASA does not comment on security matters.” A Greens spokesman said balloon flights over Canberra this week will go ahead despite the “unprecedented decision to block air traffic over Parliament House to coincide with our protest action”. The Greens dispute that hot air balloons are not usually allowed over parliament. The lower house Greens MP Adam Bandt has written to all parliamentarians in the House urging them to support the climate emergency motion, which would be seconded by the independent Zali Steggall, and has the support of most of the crossbench. Labor has discussed the proposal with the Greens but is yet to decide whether or not to back the motion. Although the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has previously said it is abundantly clear there is a climate emergency, he has also warned there is little to no prospect of the Greens-led motion getting up in the current parliament, because Liberals will not break ranks. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Several Liberal MPs have signed on to a crossbench-led climate action committee to take partisan politics out of the nation’s climate policies. The Parliamentary Friends of Climate Action group, chaired by Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie and the independent Helen Haines, counts the Liberals Tim Wilson, Dave Sharma, Jason Falinski, Katie Allen, Angie Bell and Trent Zimmerman among its members. On Sunday the Liberal senator Amanda Stoker defended her colleagues’ decision to participate but rejected the idea of declaring a “climate emergency”, suggesting nobody knows what it means. Stoker told Sky News she would “give the benefit of the doubt” to her colleagues, suggesting the Morrison government had found the “middle ground” on climate action. “That is to say: we will meet our Paris targets. That pushes the boundaries of someone like me … That, to me, counts as an awful lot of climate action. “Hopefully that’s how they see it too: they’re a part of it because they want to be showing how we’re awfully active in that climate action space already.” Despite the Morrison government claiming that Australia will meet its Paris target of 26% to 28% emissions reduction by 2030 “in a canter”, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen for five years since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. On Friday the International Monetary Fund warned that even with a carbon price of $75 Australia will not meet its Paris targets."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have a very informative exchange going on the topic of polar bears, initiated by Ed Caryl’s earlier post here.
Zoologist Susan Crockford, Phd., responds to Authur C. Smith III’s comment here on polar bear behavior.
==============================================
Arthur,
Thanks so much for your detailed response. I am always fascinated to hear first-hand accounts of animal behavior, as I expect is true for other readers of this blog.
It is good to hear that your experience with observing interactions between polar bears and grizzlies fits with what I have read in the scientific literature. It also fits my model (visual model, not mathematical model!) of how polar bears evolved, from either newly-evolved grizzlies or the common ancestor of both (see http://rhythmsoflife.ca).
While I realize that the most recent genetic study (the Hailer et al. 2012 one) suggests the latter (polar bears evolved from a common polar/grizzly ancestor), I contend we probably don’t yet have the definitive answer, especially since Hailer et al propose extensive hybridization between female grizzlies and male polar bears to explain their genetic results – which as you and I have both noted, goes against the behavioral evidence.
I would like to reiterate that both polar bears and grizzlies mate in the spring/early summer. However, the socializing that you describe is happening in the late summer/early fall – in other words, after the mating season. Male tundra grizzlies are known to range over enormous distances and recently, have wandered, over the spring sea ice, up onto the western Canadian Arctic islands. Therefore, it appears that recent hybridization events have occurred in polar bear territory, not grizzly territory.
In other words, modern grizzlies are going to the sea ice in the spring to mate with polar bears rather than polar bears going on land to mate with grizzlies.
I take issue with this statement: ‘For better or for worse, for natural or man-made, the arctic ice is melting: climate shifts are part of a cycle that has happened repeatedly in the past and will continue so without regard to whether or not humans’ sensibilities are offended. Our failings of argument and denial are providing cover for the refusal and lack of accountability concerning the truth of polar bear ecology: polar bears are social animals, coming to land. Land is necessary for their survival. In our rush to cash out the Arctic, polar bears are to be written off as a casualty of climate change.’ [my emphasis]
First – I suggest this be the last time you use the word ‘denial’ or ‘denier’ in a discussion of this issue. I would find it supremely offensive, as I know many others do. There are many valid and rational scientific questions about many aspects of the catastrophic global warming storyline that have yet to be answered. These questions deserve to be heard in a respectful manner and addressed.
Second – You insist that ‘land is necessary for polar bear survival.’ I can see why you might conclude that but you should recognize that it is biased by your limited experience. As valuable and interesting as your observations are, they have been restricted to bears on land (or very close to it). Despite what you have seen with your own eyes, evidence from scientific studies does not support that statement.
The Wrangell Island polar bears you mention are part of the ‘Chukchi/Bering Sea’ subpopulation (which is shared almost equally between Russia and the US in terms of geographic territory). This subpopulation has been tentatively estimated to number about 2,000 individuals, although no survey has yet been done (Aars et al. 2006; Obbard et al. 2010 – these are the Polar Bear Specialist Group meeting reports, available here: http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/).
If we accept that number as reasonably correct (which it very well may not be), the ‘nearly 600 polar bears’ that you say came ashore and thrived for four months on Wrangell Island eating walrus would be about 30% of the total subpopulation. Even if another 10-30% of the regional population was scattered along the Russian shoreline and northwestern tip of Alaska, that still puts a significant proportion of all bears out on the sea ice during the late summer/early fall – about 40-50% not on land (even more if the population estimate is too low). This suggests that polar bears do not require land in summer but rather, some bears prefer it.
In fact, over most of their range, most polar bears remain on the sea ice year-round, or at most spend only short periods on land.
Working in the southern Beaufort Sea area, which includes all of the north coast of Alaska except the western tip near the Bering Strait, Schliebe et al. (2008:1005, 1st paragraph) found that between 2000 and 2005, an average of 3.7% of all polar bears of that region spent time on land between mid-September and the end of October (estimated total population at that time was 1,526 bears). That’s about 57 bears on shore out of 1526 total. Which again suggests your insistence that polar bears require land is unsupported.
So what about pregnant females that den over the winter, you might ask? It is clear that some pregnant females that spend September/October on the sea ice do indeed come to land to make their winter dens. However, ‘some’ is not all, as you seem to suggest.

Studies indicate that aside from Hudson Bay and Svalbard (where virtually all bears do indeed appear to den on land), around 50% of bears den on the sea ice. For example, according to the study done by Fischbach and colleagues (2007) in the southern Beaufort Sea, approximately 37-60% of females den offshore, on the ice. Which means 37-60% of females are not using land.
Amstrup and Gardner (1994:8) have stated that ‘Contrary to previous hypotheses (Stirling and Andriashek 1992), substantial polar bear denning occurs in the Beaufort Sea region of northern Alaska and adjacent Canada. Bears that den on pack ice are subject to risks not encountered by bears that den on land. Unstable, moving ice caused early abandonment of dens and, apparently, loss of cubs. However, the persistence of pack-ice denning indicated that those risks are not overwhelming.’
It is worth noting that according to the field work conducted by Steve Ferguson and colleagues (2000) in the Canadian Arctic, polar bears utilize so-called ‘thick’ first year ice (1.2-2.0 m) for over-wintering activities, including denning. Over in the Barents Sea, north of Norway, bears are also known to den on first year ice (Mauritzen et al. 2001).
[What surprises me is that despite this known use of offshore sea ice for denning by pregnant females, the report supplied in support for the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species (Bergen et al. 2007:6) modelled only future changes to terrestrial denning habitat. It did not address offshore sea ice denning habitat at all.]
I conclude that there is no evidence from modern polar studies to support your statement that ‘land is necessary for polar bear survival’ or that ‘land is a requisite component of polar bear ecology.’
Moreover, I caution you against concluding, based on the papers by Edwards, Hailer and others, that ‘polar bears have existed and survived through ice free periods.’ Ice-free for a month or so during the summer does not mean ice-free year round. There is no evidence I know of that suggests the Arctic was ice-free in winter at any time during the mid to late Pleistocene (the Melles et al. evidence is for summer conditions on land, which tells us nothing about winter sea ice).
So, as far as I can see, there is no evidence to suggest that ‘land is necessary for polar bear survival’ nor for the idea that polar bears were required to live a terrestrial existence during interglacial periods.
Best regards,
Susan Crockford, Ph.D. (Zoology)

They were more concerned with providing a fictional security fix against the fantasy threat of climate change than they were against the real threat of terrorism.
Fox News writes:
The raging debate on Capitol Hill over the Libya consulate attack has put a spotlight on the State Department’s security spending, with some questioning whether money spent on electric cars and green-embassy programs could have been  put to better use.
Federal contract records show the department in May spent $108,000 on Chevy Volt charging stations for the American Embassy in Vienna. It apparently was part of a broader program to make diplomatic posts more energy efficient, and the upgrades and electric cars were on full display at a gala a few days after that contract was signed.
But Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., is scrutinizing the spending in light of concerns that the State Department turned down requests for more security in eastern Libya in the run-up to the Sept. 11 attack that killed four Americans.
“There’s something wrong,” Kelly told FoxNews.com.
Though it’s unclear how easily the department could have freed up money from  its green-energy program to beef up security, Kelly claimed officials would have  “great flexibility” over how the budget is spent…. Read more…”
Unbelievable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe demonization of the outdoor barbecue has begun – expect it to be banned soon in our lifetime.
I like visiting the German alarmist websites. Among my favorites is klimaretter “climate rescuers”, a leading alarmist site run by a gaggle of tree-hugging, panic-spreading kooks who insist the end is near. They’re aligned with Joe Romm, Bill McKibben and other nutjobs. Stefan Rahmstorf donates money to them.
Today their entertainment did not disappoint me. Climate-rescuer contributor Georg Etscheit shares his experience and exasperation over a barbecue birthday party he was invited to by his barbecue-fan dentist – too much smoke, environmental destruction and fat!
For the environmentally and climatically obsessed Georg, all that the charcoal-burning and meat-eating is a “pyromaniacal ritual” that is intolerable and has to stop.
First he frets that in the future climate change will surely bring us many more days that will be ideal for having more environmentally destructive barbecues.
Next, he describes the set-up his meat-eating dentist had:
In his yard behind his dental practice, he had a pavilion set up for guests and his barbecue equipment was placed near it. The first thing that caught my eye was this voluminous casket-like appliance of US-American origin, a metal box with a huge cover for the charcoal. There’s an overheat feature that is supposed to be good for handling an entire pig. And such an animal was indeed lying on that casket, red, oozing and carved – a wretched picture. And I was supposed to eat that soon?”
But the cruelty that the poor pig frying on the grill had to endure was the least of his worries. Next he describes the dentist’s grill in more detail:
My barbecue-enthusiast dentist of course owned a luxurious barbecue grill, the kind you can buy at every home-center. Such a luxury grill-monster on wheels can easily cost several thousand euros. Sizzling on the grill, producing huge clouds of smoke, was an abundance of sausage and spare ribs. Then I noticed he also had a smaller spherical grill with a dozen grilled chickens going as well.”

Georg then complains about the all the smoke and grease, advising barbecue guests that it’s best to wear old clothing to barbecues because…
Smelly clouds of smoke are produced by the burning spare ribs and charred chicken, which are also drenched with artificial smoke-aroma barbecue sauces, all accompanied by mayonnaise-soaked egg, potato and pasta salads, which all surely leave fat and grease everywhere.”
How yukky! By now I can imagine poor Georg sitting as far away as possible, in some corner all by himself. He adds:
I don’t want to go further into detail. But for me it is clear that there is little to be desired from such pyromaniacal male rituals from the early times of the homo sapien sapiens. From a culinary perspective, invitations to barbecues are almost always a catastrophe, also health-wise because charred fat and meat in addition to the synthetically produced sauces and marinades are known to be extremely carcinogenic and very difficult to digest without huge quantities of pure alcohol.”
Well, alcohol does help. Next he describes the environmental and climatic impacts of barbecues:
Ecologically and from a climate perspective, barbecues are nothing but a disaster. Just the enormous quantities of meat at barbecues is completely unacceptable. Then there’s the charcoal, which is ecologically okay only if you look at it only on the surface. About two thirds of the 300,000 tons of charcoal burned in Germany every year by barbecue fans comes from the South American rain-forests. Most of the raw wood for this must be illegally cut.”
Again the rainforests. Georg then says that barbecues will take the planet to a tipping point:
Barbecue fans contribute to the destruction of the rain forests in three ways, and thus to climate change: First because of the soy production needed for producing huge amounts of meat. Secondly through the chopping of trees for producing charcoal. Moreover, this takes away an important source of fuel for the local people, who then in turn have to cut even more trees down. Now that rising temperatures are leading to a classic vicious circle whereby the number of summer evenings with”super barbecue weather” are rising, which in turn drives up demand for more charcoal, which leads to more deforestation  and so on.”
Has he never gone camping in the forest? I think Georg just needs more getting used to barbecues. Everybody invite Georg to your next barbecue: etscheit@gute-geschichten.de. I’m having one on August 25, and Georg you are invited to come.

"Your article (Revealed: the 20 firms behind a third of all global carbon emissions, 10 October) highlights the biggest polluters and contributors to the climate crisis over the last half-century – the “uncooperative crusties” of capitalism. It is these companies that are standing in the way of progress. But we shouldn’t just look at the carbon they have pumped into the atmosphere, but also the money – our money, in banks and pension funds – that they have invested and the power that huge amount of capital gives them. They can choose to either transform their businesses into something positive for the planet or to extend the shelf life of a carbon-based business model well past its best-before date. This week, the Treasury select committee asked me, ShareAction and the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association what investors can do about the oil and gas industry. My answer was that we need to use more than just persuasion. Our money can shape the strategies of these companies directly. Savvy investors should back those that respond to change, not the ones who deny the urgency.  At this week’s Extinction Rebellion protests I spoke at the event called The Future is Here. It was inspiring to meet so many people thinking about how they can use their resources to deliver net zero. The future is now for the large energy companies, and it is time to make our money matter in the fight against a climate emergency.Bruce DavisFounder and joint managing director, Abundance Investment • It is right that the world’s oil firms have been called out (Secretive assets: Most reserves are held by state-owned firms, 10 October). Environmental groups and activists have been pointing this out for more than 20 years, and the response from governments has usually been a shrug. Now that, thankfully, climate activism has become mainstream and the big polluters have been outed, we must welcome them into the fold and make it politically easier for them to adjust their activities. It could be a time of exciting cooperation and inventiveness. And let us not forget that each one of us must take responsibility for our use of fossil fuels; put flying at the back of the queue as the transport of last resort. Train travel within Europe is fast and comfortable. People will soon adjust. We just have to.Val Mainwood Wivenhoe, Colchester • George Monbiot places primary responsibility for global warming with petrochem firms, and classes the middle classes of the west as gullible victims of the machinations of the oil producers (Polluters drove the climate crisis, yet it’s us they blame, Journal, 10 October). Walmart could be held responsible for more CO2 emissions than any of the petrochem firms cited. Think global supply chains, packaging, and billions of short car trips to the supermarket – not to mention the fuel pumps at the car park exit. It’s just that crunching the numbers is complicated and contestable. It’s easier to do the numbers on oil firms. In the nasty cocaine trade, who is really at fault? The Colombian farmer who produces it (“petrochem”), the cartel which manages the whole chain (“Walmart”), or the westerner who snorts it (“gullible victim”)? To me, listing the top petrochem firms as the primary drivers of global warming looks like listing the 20 biggest farmers in the foothills as the primary drivers of the drug trade. Of course the parallel is not perfect, but the logic holds. If every middle-class westerner with a weekend habit makes do with a cup of tea instead, the cocaine trade stops. So, ditch your car; scrap your boiler; cut off the power. Yeah, right. Peter AndersonBarwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire • Your articles covering the top 20 global polluters were excellent. As well as exposing the massive contribution the 20 make to the destruction of our planet, they also highlight the absurd levels of income of their CEOs. The income of half of them is undisclosed, but the other half are paid a total about $130m a year. So let’s be clear: these companies are not just helping bring about extinction, they’re also fuelling gross inequality. The rebellion against them must be on both fronts. Jol Miskin Sheffield • I broadly agree with George Monbiot. Consumerism, encouraged by the present economic system, and especially by the fossil fuel companies, has led humanity to face the “first great extinction”. But while I also agree that “In such a system, individual choices are lost in the noise”, this should not allow individuals to think that their actions make no difference. There are numerous ways in which each of us can, and do, contribute to the battle against climate change. Don’t invest in fossil fuel companies. Don’t drive. Don’t fly. Reduce, re-use, refurbish, recycle everything. March, lobby, demonstrate, talk to people.Rose HarvieDumbarton • It’s all very well outing the top 20 firms behind the world’s carbon emissions, but are the Extinction Rebellion people prepared to go without their central heating, gas stoves and electric lights? When do they suggest we switch it all off?Angela SingerCambridge • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Google has made “substantial” contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington despite its insistence that it supports political action on the climate crisis. Among hundreds of groups the company has listed on its website as beneficiaries of its political giving are more than a dozen organisations that have campaigned against climate legislation, questioned the need for action, or actively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections. The list includes the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a conservative policy group that was instrumental in convincing the Trump administration to abandon the Paris agreement and has criticised the White House for not dismantling more environmental rules. The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear. The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become."" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.  Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent. Google said it was disappointed by the US decision to abandon the global climate deal, but has continued to support CEI. Google is also listed as a sponsor for an upcoming annual meeting of the State Policy Network (SPN), an umbrella organisation that supports conservative groups including the Heartland Institute, a radical anti-science group that has chided the teenage activist Greta Thunberg for “climate delusion hysterics”. SPN members recently created a “climate pledge” website that falsely states “our natural environment is getting better” and “there is no climate crisis”. Google has defended its contributions, saying that its “collaboration” with organisations such as CEI “does not mean we endorse the organisations’ entire agenda”. It donates to such groups, people close to the company say, to try to influence conservative lawmakers, and – most importantly – to help finance the deregulatory agenda the groups espouse. A spokesperson for Google said it sponsored organisations from across the political spectrum that advocate for “strong technology policies”. “We’re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,” the spokesperson said. Amazon has, like Google, also sponsored a CEI gala, according to a programme for the event reported in the New York Times. CEI has opposed regulation of the internet and enforcement of antitrust rules, and has defended Google against some Republicans’ claims that the search engine has an anti-conservative bias. But environmental activists and other critics say that, for a company that purports to support global action on climate change, such tradeoffs are not acceptable. “You don’t get a pass on it. It ought to be disqualifying to support what is primarily a phoney climate denying front group. It ought to be unacceptable given how wicked they have been,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island who is one of the most vocal proponents of climate action in Congress. “What all of corporate America should be doing is saying if you are a trade organisation or lobby group and you are interfering on climate, we are out. Period,” he added. On its website, Google says it is committed to ensuring its political engagement is “open, transparent and clear to our users, shareholders, and the public”. But the company declined to answer the Guardian’s questions on how much it has given to the organisations. On a webpage devoted to “transparency”, it describes the groups – among hundreds of others, including some progressive advocates such as the Center for American Progress – as having received “substantial” contributions. Apart from CEI, they include the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, worked for a decade for Koch Industries and shaped the company’s radical anti-environment policies in Washington; the American Enterprise Institute, which has railed against climate “alarmists”; and Americans for Tax Reform, which has criticised companies who support climate action for seeking out “corporate welfare”. It has also donated undisclosed sums to the Cato Institute, which has voiced opposition to climate legislation and questioned the severity of the crisis. Google has also made donations to the Mercatus Center, a Koch-funded thinktank, and the Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action, a pressure group that said the Paris agreement was supported by “cosmopolitan elites” and part of Barack Obama’s “destructive legacy”. Bill McKibben, a prominent environmentalist who has been on the frontline of the climate crisis for decades, said Google and other companies were engaged in a “functional greenwashing” given the contradiction in their public pronouncements and private donations. He said Google and other technology companies had also not used their own lobbyists to advocate for change on climate. “Sometimes I’ll talk to companies and they will be going on and on about their renewable server farm or natural gas delivery, and I say thank you, but what we really need is for your lobbying shop in Washington to put serious muscle behind it. And they never do,” McKibben said. “They want some tax break or some regulations switch and they never devote the slightest muscle behind the most important issue of our time or any time.” A spokesperson for Google said: “We’ve been extremely clear that Google’s sponsorship doesn’t mean that we endorse that organisation’s entire agenda – we may disagree strongly on some issues. “Our position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100% renewable energy for our global operations.” The company said it called for “strong action” at the climate conference in Paris in 2015 and helped to sponsor the Global Climate Action summit in San Francisco last year. But that position is at odds with the support it gives to CEI. The group’s director of energy and environment policy, Myron Ebell, helped found the Cooler Heads Coalition 20 years ago, a group of libertarian and rightwing organisations that have sowed the seeds of climate denial with funding from the fossil fuel industry. When Donald Trump was elected to the White House in 2016, Ebell joined the transition team and advised the new president on environmental issues, successfully lobbying Trump to adhere to a campaign promise and abandon the Paris agreement. Kert Davies, the founder of the Climate Investigations Center, a research group that examines corporate campaigning, said Ebell had led the anti-climate-action crusade for decades. “They’re extremists,” he said, referring to the Cooler Heads Coalition. “They are never finished,” he said. “Myron has taken a lot of credit for Trump’s actions and is quite proud of his access.” Recently, however, Ebell – who declined a request for an interview – has criticised the White House for not rolling back environmental protections aggressively enough, even though the Trump administration has gutted every major environmental act established under Obama. His wishlist now includes reversing a 2009 finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that CO2 and other greenhouse gases endanger the health and welfare of Americans. CEI said it “respects the privacy of its donors” and declined to answer questions about Google. A CEI spokesperson told the Guardian: “On energy policy, CEI advances the humanitarian view that abundant and affordable energy makes people safer and economies more resilient. Making energy accessible, especially for the most vulnerable, is a core value.” One source who is familiar with Google’s decision-making defended the company’s funding of CEI. “When it comes to regulation of technology, Google has to find friends wherever they can and I think it is wise that the company does not apply litmus tests to who they support,” the source said.

"American carnage and Brexit collapse, detention camps and environmental breakdown – the daily barrage of bad news makes it easy to forget that these are disparate symptoms of the same disease unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis.  Back then, activists in Europe and the US pushed for a holistic cure: a Green New Deal to deliver necessary investments in people and planet. But establishment economists waved them off, preferring a shot-in-the-arm of easy money. Now, all the grave symptoms of recession have returned – and the old drugs don’t work any more, antibiotics to which the disease has already adapted. But now is not the time for I-told-you-so. Never before has so much idle cash accumulated as in the past decade – and never before has circulating capital failed so miserably to invest in human health and habitat. We are long overdue for a Green New Deal. Back in 2008, commentators were quick to announce the death of financialized capitalism. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, was trotted out in front of Congress to apologise for his faith in self-regulating financial markets. Activists occupied town squares from Oakland to Madrid. And even the CEO of Goldman Sachs admitted he had a “reason to regret”. It seemed like radical change was around the corner. It wasn’t. Far from collapsing, banks like Goldman Sachs turned around to record profits, hand out record bonuses, and rehash the risky practices that produced the Great Recession. Mortgage debt – the proximate cause of the Wall Street collapse – is now at levels higher than in the pre-crisis period. The stock of BBB-rated bonds in Europe and the United States has quadrupled since 2008. Public debt has ballooned. And collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, have surged to $3tn, “reminiscent of the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations that amplified the sub-prime crisis”, according to the Bank of International Settlements. How did this happen? How did the financiers succeed in snatching such riches out of the jaws of their bankruptcy? How did the most severe economic downturn in a century result in a broad preservation of a broken status quo? By a combination of carrots, sticks and tricks. The first two ingredients are well known. The banks, of course, got their carrots. Governments in the US and the EU bailed out their bankrupt private lenders, shifting the mass of their debt on to the public balance sheets. The public would then get the stick. Instead of punishing the irresponsible architects of the crash, our governments punished the pensioners, the poor and anyone who rose up to challenge the regressive cuts they imposed. Less well known are the tricks deployed by governments and their central banks to stabilize the financial system and stave off the growing demand for fiscal stimulus. Among many – swaps, exchanges, special vehicles purposes – quantitative easing was the most impressive, and the most poisonous. To understand how it worked, recall that banks hate one thing more than bank robbers: assets on their books that they cannot lend with interest. After the 2008 collapse, with investment dead in the water, the central banks had pushed interest rates to near, or sometimes below, zero – hoping to kickstart investment. But this drove bankers up the wall, since they could not charge interest to lend their assets. To help them along, the central banks bought trillions of these assets from the banks, using freshly minted cash. One knew that things got silly when the Bank of England bought IOUs issued by McDonald’s. On the surface, the tricks worked. The influx of central bank money ended the recession, shrank unemployment, even revived the United States’ gargantuan trade deficit to its pre-2008 levels. Business-as-usual regained its dominance, and banks were declared safe again. Under the surface, however, the crisis was deepening. The easy-lending environment created by quantitive easing and rate cuts – far from raising wages and sparking new startups – encouraged corporations to buy back their own shares, deliver more money to their wealthy shareholders, and load up on debts in the process. In 2018, buybacks soared to a record-high $806bn, a 55% increase from the year before. According to a recent study by the Bank of England, the overall effect of quantitive easing was to increase the wealth of the bottom 10% in the UK by roughly £3,000, and that of the top 10% by £350,000. Meanwhile, investment in the real economy has plummeted. In the US, public investment dropped to 1.4% of GDP, its lowest level in 75 years. In the eurozone, net public investment has remained near zero for nearly a decade, with infrastructure investment in southern European countries over 30% lower than it was pre-crisis. And with the state on the sideline, the planet warmed, the environment collapsed, and species after species moved toward extinction. Now, we are heading back into recession – but the old tricks don’t work any more. Rates have been cut, liquidity has been pumped, and the economy remains at a stall. Central banks are simply “pushing on a string”, as the former Fed governor Marriner Eccles once said. If 2008 saw the original development of the Green New Deal proposal, then, 2019 is the time to deploy it: a moment when the architects of the old strategy, pockets empty, no longer seem able to defend it. “There was unanimity,” said Mario Draghi, retiring president of the ECB, “that fiscal policy should become the main instrument.” But fool me twice, shame on me. Having squandered the last crisis, we cannot fall again for Draghi’s promise of a mild Keynesian stimulus in the face of human extinction. Instead, we must mobilize behind the Green New Deal as the only reasonable response to the coming recession. It is tempting to think of the present moment as a crossroads: we either get our Green New Deal, or we descend into eco-fascism. But the fallout from the last recession suggests that – if we do not articulate a shared demand – we might just as easily get a slightly reconfigured version of the status quo: a little more green around the edges, sure, but with roughly the same distribution of power and resources. Such a plan is already under way in Europe, where the European commission now calls for a “green deal” with none of the transformative content of the Green New Deal agenda. With the climate strikers marching on their front feet – and the old guard caught retreating on its heels – we have a clear opportunity to achieve a true systems change. But it will require us to make clear to our governments: it is a Green New Deal or bust."
"Nearly a year ago, England implemented a five pence charge on plastic carrier bags in an attempt to cut down on their usage, which had become embedded into how people shopped. In 2014, 8.5 billion single-use plastic bags were used by customers in British supermarkets alone. This is more than 58,000 tonnes of plastic, most of which will have ended up in landfill or as litter along roads and in waterways. The environmental consequences of this are clear: synthetic plastic bags can take centuries to decompose while those that block waterways and drainage systems have a more immediate effect, causing harm to wildlife who may ingest or get entangled in them. It is not surprising therefore that governments and organisations around the world have tried to curb their use through bans or mandatory charges – but have these tactics been successful? Our research has found that, yes, the five pence charge has been effective in reducing plastic bag use across the country. Not only that, it has also made people think more about the environment, and as a result they have become more supportive of other environmental policies. Mandatory bag charges have been shown to be popular among the public, because people think that their declining use will help the environment. The economist Frank Convery and colleagues even call the Irish plastic bag levy the most popular tax in Europe. They say the “plastax” is so popular it would be politically damaging to remove it. The environment is a devolved policy area in the UK, and so the regional governments have introduced charges at different times over the past five years. Wales was the first to introduce a five pence single-use carrier bag charge in October 2011, followed by Northern Ireland in April 2013, and Scotland in October 2014. England then introduced its charge on single-use plastic bags sold by large retailers in October 2015. The plastic bag charge is a good example of how devolution can be an opportunity to develop policies in one part of the UK before rolling them out to other parts. In effect, the UK has become a ready-made natural laboratory to test which policies work. We took this idea and used it to examine how the English plastic bag charge has changed shopper behaviour. Our researchers conducted nationally representative surveys, and asked participants to keep a diary after which we interviewed them about their shopping habits. We also observed shoppers leaving supermarkets. We did this before and after the plastic bag charge was introduced in England, and then compared the results with Wales and Scotland where charges were already in place. We found that the charge was highly effective. The majority of supermarket shoppers in England (57%) used single-use plastic bags beforehand, but this fell to only 21% after the charge was introduced – the same level as in Wales (18%). Most of the shoppers replaced single-use plastic bags with reusable “bags for life” after the policy was implemented. It was surprising to see how quickly the change took place. Already one month after the introduction of the charge, plastic bag use in England was indistinguishable from plastic bag use in Wales and Scotland. So how was this tiny charge so effective in changing behaviour?  A plastic bag charge is usually seen as an economic instrument, that is, an incentive to incorporate an environmental cost into the household budget. Indeed, we found that some people changed their behaviour to avoid paying the charge, which, if paid, would lead to them increasing their expenditure. For most people, however, the charge acted as a “habit disruptor”. Before its implementation many shoppers would just simply forget to bring their own bag to the supermarket. We found that the charge made people stop and think about waste, and whether they really need to use a single-use plastic bag for their shopping. It also appears that plastic bag charges become more popular after they are introduced. In England, a majority (52%) already supported the charge before it was introduced, and support increased to 60% one month after. A similar effect was found in Wales in 2011. One reason why people became more positive was that it is easy for them to adapt to the charge. Shoppers quickly found new routines, such as keeping bags in the boot of the car, to help remember to take them to the supermarket. There were some other, unexpected effects too: not only did people become more supportive of a plastic bag charge after they experienced it, they also became more supportive of other charges to reduce waste. Support for a hypothetical charge on water bottles increased from 34% to 40% across the UK, for example. In particular, those who changed their opinion about the plastic bag charge also changed their opinion about other charges.  And so it seems that the plastic bag charge may have also paved the way for other measures to reduce waste. Now may therefore be the right time to trial other waste reduction policies, such as a deposit return scheme for drinks cans and bottles or a charge on disposable coffee cups."

"The Guardian’s analysis of MPs’ climate records relies on two extensive pieces of research. Politicians were rated from 0% to 100% based on 16 key parliamentary votes that would affect the UK’s carbon emissions. The votes were chosen by the Guardian and DeSmog UK with additional consultations with Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and other sources. A detailed breakdown of the methodology can be found here.  The Guardian also compiled publicly available information about donations, salaries, gifts and other interests registered by MPs that are linked to the fossil fuel industries. The analysis has already provoked strong reactions from some MPs, while others – even those with modest scores – recognised it was an important exercise that would stimulate debate between voters and the people who represent them. The sole criteria in assessing MPs’ scores was whether their votes were likely to increase or reduce emissions. So, votes for fracking and Heathrow expansion were considered negative because those bills encouraged more carbon-intensive gas production and airline travel. But votes for onshore wind and subsidies for renewable energy were deemed positive because those bills would have accelerated the shift to a low-carbon economy.  For this analysis, a vote for nuclear power was judged positive in purely climate terms, even though there are many other serious environmental and economic concerns about this form of energy. Motions passed without a recorded vote could not be included in the scores. In addition, the Guardian looked at information taken from the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests that showed donations, salaries or benefits from fossil fuel companies, aviation firms or individuals and organisations that deny the need for urgent climate action. The results are not intended as the final word on whether an MP is for or against climate action, and there are limitations to the methodology used. The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear. The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become."" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.  Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent. For example, it is difficult to quantify the work politicians do in committees, mobilising colleagues, spending time on climate issues or speaking out in the House of Commons. Individual MPs’ votes are also heavily influenced by the party whip. Yet academics and campaigners said they hoped the analysis would spur a debate about why parliament is not doing more to cut the UK’s emissions. “Every MP will look at this list and say: ‘Why am I there?’ They will have to justify their position,” said Rebecca Willis, a research associate at Lancaster University who has studied parliamentary attitudes on global warming. The analysis also comes at a critical moment, before a likely general election that could leave the winning party in power until 2025 – halfway through the decade in which scientists warn that humankind must make a decisive shift away from fossil fuels and other sources of carbon emissions. The current government already claims to be on the right path and political parties across the spectrum express support for radical action.  Yet the the Guardian’s analysis shows Tory MPs have frequently voted down short-term practical measures to reduce emissions, for example through home heating efficiency or renewable energy subsidies, while lending their support to fracking and airport expansion. The Conservatives have the worst record of any party, with an average score of 17%. Despite Labour’s relatively high score of 86%, the party’s record was more mixed when it was in power in 2008-10. A year after pushing through the landmark Climate Change Act, Gordon Brown’s government voted against the 10:10 climate campaign and blocked a bill that would have made airport expansion more difficult. The Conservatives, who were then in opposition, supported both measures because their leader David Cameron wanted to create an image of a greener party. Yet after winning in 2010, his party – then in coalition with the Liberal Democrats – rolled back ambitious climate policies. The Lib Dems had an average score of 59% – until they accepted a number of ex-Tory MPs. Their inclusion brought the party down to 51%. The research has thrown up anomalies. Some relatively green Conservative MPs, such as Peter Bottomley (23%), Sarah Newton (15%), Peter Aldous (23%) and James Heappey (0%), have low scores because they were only eligible for a handful of votes, and in those they stuck to the party line. Other more climate sceptical MPs – most notably Owen Paterson (42%) – scored relatively highly because he has been in the house long enough to have been part of Cameron’s green Tory rebranding. Similarly, some Labour MPs have higher scores because they have only voted in opposition, while the stalwart environmental campaigners Kerry McCarthy (86%) and Mary Creagh (78%) fell short of a perfect mark because they stuck to the party line over the 10:10 campaign and airport expansion. Ed Milliband scored 78% although, as author of the 2008 Climate Change Act, he has arguably achieved as much as any MP in promoting emissions cuts.  MPs who have a strong record on the environment said privately they were glad parliamentarians were being held to account on their climate voting records, though this could never be a perfect measure."

"There’s a lot of hype around edible insects. Insects are being championed as a healthy and sustainable alternative to conventional protein sources in Europe and the US, and “ento-prising” new products are appearing almost every week. Cricket-based cocktail bitters, anyone? Of course, these new bug-based foods aren’t for everyone. In fact, in Western societies, they’re still not eaten by many people at all. But why is this, if they’re so good for us and for the planet? First of all, there’s the “yuck factor”. According to many researchers and commentators, one of the main stumbling blocks is individual psychology – the stigma, aversion or disgust that many people in the West feel towards the idea of eating insects, and the subsequent rejection of insects as food.  Daniella Martin, a US advocate for insect consumption, has called this “the biggest obstacle” to Western acceptance of insects as food. If only we could convince people to change their attitudes, the argument runs, then Westerners would all be snacking on chapuline grasshoppers rather than chicken nuggets. However, this focus on individual psychology is problematic. It seems that the emphasis given to the yuck factor (or “ick factor”, as it’s also sometimes called) may be too great. Efforts to convince the unwilling public to eat insects may also not be the right approach to encourage wider acceptance. In the past, when new foods arrived in Western societies, the general public didn’t just suddenly decide to “accept” them following information campaigns or advertising. Research on the successful introduction of new foods such as sushi – or even, once upon a time, tea – suggests instead that they were first integrated into the diets of a handful of early adopters. This creates a relatively small but established market from which more widespread acceptance gradually develops. As such, it is probably more important to focus on people who are already willing to eat insects, rather than trying to convince those that aren’t. But, crucially, the willingness of early adopters to eat a new food is not usually sufficient to encourage its wider uptake. Getting people to continue to eat a new food also depends on them being easily able to afford and access that food. It must also be easy enough for people to integrate the food into their existing culinary routines. And obviously the food needs to taste sufficiently good for people to choose to eat it instead of something else.  Successful establishment of a new food, no matter how unusual, relies on quite mundane and conventional considerations such as price, taste, availability, and how easily people can cook with it. My research found that the same principles apply to the insect burgers and other insect-based convenience foods which have been on sale in Jumbo, a Dutch supermarket chain, since late 2014. The Netherlands is a leading light in efforts to develop insects as a sustainable new food source in Europe. Academics from Wageningen University were behind a landmark report on the subject from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2013, and – in addition to working on a €1m research project on the use of insects as a sustainable protein source – have produced an insect cookbook and given TED talks. Yet despite the relative prominence of edible insect advocacy, science, and products in the Netherlands, the uptake of the insect-based foods available there remains low. My research found that among a group of willing early adopters of insect-based convenience foods, only a handful repeatedly consumed the products, because many of the social, contextual and practical requirements necessary to ensure repeat consumption were not met. People’s “willingness to eat” insects was generally high, but this alone did not account for how insects were (or were not) being integrated into their diets. Much existing research in this area focuses on forecasting people’s initial willingness to eat insects, but downplays the influence that social context has on food consumption once foods are actually available in stores. Studies assume that if you show people pictures of imaginary insect foods, ask them to imagine being in a shop where insects are available, or ask them to sample insect burgers in a lab, that this will reveal their consistent attitudes towards insect eating – something that will later be reflected in their food choices.  But this isn’t necessarily the case. In the “real life” context of shopping and cooking, food consumption – whether for insects or more conventional products – tends to be determined by the social, contextual and practical factors such as the ones I have mentioned above. Indeed, the idea that an individual’s diet is primarily the result of a series of rational cost/benefit decisions has been criticised by social scientists investigating sustainable consumption, who argue that consumption is always affected by the many interrelated, routine social practices in which individuals participate. So, although you may be motivated to eat insect products because of their healthiness or sustainability, a range of competing factors will ultimately affect whether insect products actually end up on your plate: when and where you shop, who you eat with and what other food you eat will all play a part. These social and practical factors are not as newsworthy as the yuck factor or soundbite-friendly surveys projecting people’s likelihood of buying insect products. But my research suggests that how people are going to regularise their consumption of insect products will need to be a more important focus for both commercial and academic attention if insect foods are ever really going to fly."
"Daily Telegraph reporter Mitchell Van Homrigh got dressed up in a bee costume to go “undercover” with Extinction Rebellion but his stunt wasn’t even the most foolish response to the mass protests we saw this week. After making all the bee puns he could think of, Van Homrigh admitted he found the protesters “passionate and kind and helpful to this blind little bee”. But he finished by reverting to the Joe Hildebrand school of argument about how little the protest would help their cause.  Kyle Sandilands has praised Daily Telegraph reporter Mitchell van Homrigh for creating a buzz with his undercover reporting of yesterday’s Extinction Rebellion bee-mergency protest.https://t.co/tFVHzSGgBL “Would these people be better off directing their passions towards developing programs and policy that enact their vision?” he wondered as he removed his bee head. Hildebrand had earlier declared in his weekly news.com.au column that global action for climate change was a waste of time unless the protesters had a solution, as “passion on its own achieves nothing without a practical plan to back it up”. “Romeo and Juliet were passionate and look what happened to them,” the Studio 10 co-host wrote, before conceding that marching was at least better than doing drugs. Upfront at the #10Upfronts2020 with this squad. pic.twitter.com/FOJ1QCE6EC But it was Hildebrand’s occasional co-host on Studio 10, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, who stole the headlines with the most offensive response to the protests. Kennerley suggested that protesters be used as speed bumps. Or better still locked up in jail and starved: “Put ’em in jail, forget to feed them,” she said. “Personally, I would leave them all superglued to wherever they do it,” Kennerley said when the panel discussed the disruption to the cities the protesters were causing. “The guy hanging from the Story Bridge. Why send emergency services? Leave him there until he gets himself out. No emergency services should help them, nobody should do anything and you just put little witches’ hats around them or use them as a speed bump.” Channel 10, which this week narrowly missed censure for an earlier ill-advised comment by Kennerley, later insisted the veteran TV presenter was only joking. “This morning on Studio 10 Kerri-Anne Kennerley made comments regarding climate protesters that were said in jest,” a spokesman said. “Before the show concluded, Sarah Harris reiterated the tone of her remarks, affirming that Kerri-Anne wasn’t inciting violence. “Kerri-Anne confirmed that she was indeed speaking in hyperbole and her words were clearly a joke. There was no intent to cause offence. Over the past few days, Studio 10 has extensively addressed a range of opinions on this subject.” The Australian’s media editor, Leo Shanahan, saw nothing amiss with KAK’s call, describing her rant as “sage advice”. “Kerri-Anne Kennerley has some sage advice to Extinction Rebellion protesters: just stay on the road”, the Oz said. Kerri-Anne Kennerley reckons #extinctionrebellion protesters should be used as speed bumps, thrown in and left to starve https://t.co/XwJEW3REiQ It wasn’t just Ten that was all class this week. The media tripped over each other to put the worst light on the protesters who were using civil disobedience to get the attention of governments. Seven breakfast host Samantha Armytage said the protesters were annoying people to get on TV. “So you deliberately want to annoy people, so you appear on national television,” Armytage said. “What is your message? What are you trying to do?” Nine’s A Current Affair took the theme of the inconvenienced punter to the extreme, finding a woman stuck in traffic who was on her way to clear out her late mother’s nursing home. Her mother had died on Sunday and now she had been blocked by the protest. “Fuck the environment,” the distressed daughter said. “People are more important. “They think [protesting] is so important but what is important is the everyday, good Australian people just trying to go about their everyday lives. It’s not fair.” The Daily Telegraph blogger Tim Blair kept score of the arrests in each city, as if it were a sporting competition. His best line in National Climate Comp: Sydney Going for Gold was suggesting that the protesters must be on “electric lettuce”, also known as marijuana. The West Australian editor, Anthony De Ceglie, thought he had an even better gimmick, running a large blank space on his front page. The (deliberately blank) front page of tomorrow's The West Australian pic.twitter.com/2bYVEkQLNd “The climate change ‘rebellion’ plans to bring its protests to the doors of the West Australian today,” he editorialised. “This is a democracy. And we support free speech and peaceful demonstration. In that spirit, here’s a blank front page for your placards. Use it wisely.” But the last word should go to the Daily Mail, which got way too excited about the possibility of nudity, with activists planning to “get their gear off”. “A NAKED parade and traffic stopping rave: how Extinction Rebellion plan to bring Australia to a standstill during week of mayhem over climate change,” the headline said on Tuesday."
"When Eric Schmidt was asked on a radio show in 2014 why Google was supporting an ultra-conservative climate-denying pressure group in Washington, the then chairman of the internet giant offered an unequivocal response: it was wrong and Google was not going to do it again. “The consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake and so we’re trying to not do that in the future,” Schmidt told NPR. People who opposed or questioned climate science were making the world “a much worse place”, he added, and Google “should not be aligned with such people”. But five years later, Google still funds more than a dozen organisations that deny the climate crisis and oppose political action to try to solve it. Among them is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the group that launched the notorious Cooler Heads Coalition two decades ago, a group of conservative and libertarian pressure groups dedicated to dispelling the “myths” of global heating. The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear. The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become."" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.  Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent. For Google, providing financial backing to groups such as CEI and the Cato Institute – staunch free marketeers – has nothing to do with climate science, and everything to do with its effort to curry favour with conservatives on its most pressing issue in Washington: protecting an obscure section of the US law that is worth billions of dollars to the company. The law – known as section 230 of the Communications Decency Act – was established in the 1990s, at a time when the internet was in its infancy, and helped to give rise to internet giants, from Google to Facebook, by offering legal immunity to the companies for third party comments, in effect treating them as distributors of content and not publishers. Section 230, in effect, allowed Google and Facebook to be shielded from the kinds of libel laws that can ensnare other companies, such as newspapers. The law has important advocates across the political spectrum, from Democrats who hail it as a triumph of free speech, to Republicans who say it has promoted free enterprise and innovation. But now some lawmakers, including Republicans, think it might be time to revise section 230. The senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has said Google’s alleged bias in favour of Democrats means it is not a neutral platform and should not be protected from liability. Google’s decision to give to groups such as CEI reflects an attempt to win friends in Republican and conservative circles, and support those lawmakers on the right who are champions of section 230. “I think the future of conservatism is up for grabs in the Trump era,” said one person who is familiar with the company’s thinking on political giving. “We are in a moment where Google has been injected in a lot of culture wars … and there is a lot of hostility in conservative circles.” There is little doubt that Google has a loyal friend in CEI. In a recent letter to members of Congress, CEI and other conservative groups called for the protection of section 230, saying it had created “new venues for conservative speech”, and that lawmakers who wanted to upend it were “well-meaning but mistaken”. CEI has also defended Google in other realms. In a recent op-ed published in the Atlantic, a CEI senior fellow named Mario Loyola argued that the launch of a recent antitrust investigation into Google by 48 state attorneys general, led by the Texas attorney general Ken Paxton – a strong supporter of Ted Cruz – would not do anything to help the public. A CEI spokesperson, who declined to comment on questions about Google, told the Guardian: “CEI is a nonprofit organisation that advocates free-market solutions to public policy issues. CEI’s research programmes and positions are developed independently by policy experts and reflect a longstanding, steadfast dedication to principles of economic liberty and limited government.” When Google was asked about its support for CEI and groups like it, a company spokesperson said: “We sponsor organisations from across the political spectrum that advocate for strong technology policies. We’ve been extremely clear that Google’s sponsorship doesn’t mean that we endorse that organisation’s entire agenda – we may disagree strongly on some issues.” Google employees have privately spoken out about the company’s support for some conservative groups. In a discussion with employees in March 2018 – a recording of which was heard by the Guardian – Adam Kovacevich, who at the time served as head of public policy at Google (he has since left the company), defended the company’s alignment with some conservatives. He said he had been directed to forge the relationships after the 2016 election of Donald Trump. It reflected a view that the company was seen as too close to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and other Democrats. The discussion took place after a controversy over Google’s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual meeting of conservatives, where Google hosted a party. To the consternation of many employees, its logo appeared on banners next to the NRA’s. In his opening remarks on the call, Kovacevich said it was important to build relationships not only with people in power “but also the people who influence them”. “It can be hard sometimes to reconcile our business interests with our stated values, and finding that balance is something our team has to navigate really on a daily basis, and it has gotten more and more complicated,” Kovacevich can be heard saying in the recording. While Google staff seemed to accept Google needed to forge ties across the political spectrum, the majority of the employees on the call expressed concern that the company was too far out of step with its values. The Wall Street Journal and Wired have previously reported on the meeting. This year, Google did not sponsor CPAC. But big technology companies were frequently named – and lambasted – by conservative participants in their speeches. In one case, the rightwing provocateur James O’Keefe encouraged tech employees to secretly record colleagues in their offices in order to expose their alleged biases. “We will equip you with a camera,” O’Keefe said. “If they’re lying, cheating, scamming, we’re going to find them, make them famous internet celebrities, expose them for all the world to see.”"
"Companies and industries that are not moving towards zero-carbon emissions will be punished by investors and go bankrupt, the governor of the Bank of England has warned. Mark Carney also told the Guardian it was possible that the global transition needed to tackle the climate crisis could result in an abrupt financial collapse. He said the longer action to reverse emissions was delayed, the more the risk of collapse would grow. Carney has led efforts to address the dangers global heating poses to the financial sector, from increasing extreme weather disasters to a potential fall in asset values such as fossil fuel company valuations as government regulations bite. The Guardian revealed last week that just 20 fossil fuel companies have produced coal, oil and gas linked to more than a third of all emissions in the modern era. The Bank of England has said up to $20tn (£16tn) of assets could be wiped out if the climate emergency is not addressed effectively. But Carney also said great fortunes could be made by those working to end greenhouse gas emissions with a big potential upside for the UK economy in particular. The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear. The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become."" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.  Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent. In an interview with the Guardian, Carney said disclosure by companies of the risks posed by climate change to their business was key to a smooth transition to a zero-carbon world as it enabled investors to back winners. “There will be industries, sectors and firms that do very well during this process because they will be part of the solution,” he said. “But there will also be ones that lag behind and they will be punished.” Carney said in July: “Companies that don’t adapt will go bankrupt without question.” US coal companies had already lost 90% of their value, he noted, but banks were also at risk. “Just like in any other major structural change, those banks overexposed to the sunset sectors will suffer accordingly,” he told the Guardian. The central bank governor said transition to net zero carbon emissions would change the value of every asset, raising the risk of shocks to the financial system. “Some [assets] will go up, many will go down. The question is whether the transition is smooth or is it something that is delayed and then happens very abruptly. That is an open question,” he said. “The longer the adjustment is delayed in the real economy, the greater the risk that there is a sharp adjustment.” In April, Carney said: “The stakes are undoubtedly high, but the commitment of all actors in the financial system to act will help avoid a climate-driven ‘Minsky moment’ – the term we use to refer to a sudden collapse in asset prices.” Far from damaging the global economy, climate action bolsters economic growth, according to Carney. “There is a need for [action] to achieve net zero emissions, but actually it comes at a time when there is a need for a big increase in investment globally to accelerate the pace of global growth, to help get global interest rates up, to get us out of this low-growth, low-interest-rate trap we are in.” Failing to act would have severe consequences, he said. “I don’t normally quote bankers, but James Gorman, who is the CEO of Morgan Stanley, said the other day: ‘If we don’t have a planet, we’re not going to have a very good financial system.’ Ultimately, that is true.” The UK remained a climate leader, Carney said, and could benefit from action as a climate-smart financial centre and zero-carbon industrial force. “Certainly the UK financial system is one of the most sophisticated at managing this risk. The UK can extend that lead, for the good of the UK, for the good of the world,” he said. “A number of the industrial solutions draw on the strengths of UK innovation, from the use of artificial intelligence in energy systems through to potentially advanced materials like graphene. There is a big upside for the UK economy.” On Tuesday, Carney told big corporations they had two years to agree rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators devised their own and made them compulsory. Reacting to the Guardian’s revelations about fossil fuel companies, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK Labour party, said: “Labour will delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the [London Stock Exchange], and reform the finance sector to make it part of the solution to climate change instead of lending to companies that are part of the problem.”"

By: W. Müller, M. Limburg (Translated/edited by NoTricksZone)
Prof. Ross McKitrick, economist and statistician of the University of Guelph (Toronto, Canada) will make a speech in the Haus der Zukunft (House of the Future) at Albrechtstraße 11 in Berlin on 17 September 2012. He is invited by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and the Berlin Manhattan Institute.
The main topic: What is wrong with the IPCC?
McKitrick is one of the relentless scientists (next to Steve McIntyre) who exposed the hockey stick chart by Michael Mann, which not only was adopted by the IPCC, but was also defended against all proof of the hockey stick fraud. McKitrick published evidence against it. In the IPCC Third Assessment Report –  and more discreetly in the Fourth Assessment Report -Michael Mann and the IPCC falsely claimed that the current warming was the the highest in the last 1600 years. In doing so, they eliminated the well documented Medieval Warm Period by using tricks.
In addition to Professor McKitrick, Prof. Karl-Friedrich Ewert (EIKE) will report on the retroactive alterations made to the temperature data from worldwide stations by American GISS (Goddard Institute of Space Science). These now show – after having been altered – a significant drop in earlier temperatures so that the present can appear to be warmer.
Economist and environmental expert Prof. McKitrick will take a critical view of the the UN IPCC – the basis for German climate policy and show that the current climate protection measures are not justified. McKitrick became famous worldwide through his work on the hockey stick temperature curve, which was exposed as phony. After Prof. McKitrick’s speech, Prof. Ewert will show that NASA retroactively altered important temperature data and so led to false results in climate science.

"A growing number of tour operators are offering to offset carbon emissions on behalf of holidaymakers. Trekking and adventure company World Expeditions says all of its trips will be carbon neutral as of 1 November – at no extra cost to its clients. The Australian company, which was established in 1975, sells 500 itineraries globally. For every holiday sold it will invest in forest protection projects in Zimbabwe and Tasmania, and renewable energy projects in China and Vietnam. Bamboo Travel has also announced plans to offset 1.5 tonnes of carbon for each client it sends on its holidays in Asia through a partnership with Gold Standard, a major player in the offsetting market. According to new research by adventure travel company Intrepid, younger travellers are keener to book through a company that offers offsetting than older ones. The study, based on its own figures and research by YouGov, found that 58% of travellers believe sustainability is an important factor when making travel choices, but when asked what steps they would like companies to take, only 20% of travellers aged 55+ said they would like the chance to offset, compared with 44% of those born in the late 1990s.  Intrepid has been carbon-neutral since 2010 and offsets all of the 2,000 trips that it sells, buying carbon credits in renewable energy schemes. As of 2020 it will extend its offsetting to flights that clients book, as well as the trips they take. Other tour operators that have recently introduced offsetting schemes include: glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which plans to plant  a million trees by 2025 through its partnership with Treesisters; and Undiscovered Mountains which introduced a voluntary tree planting scheme in December 2018 but from this autumn it will make it automatic for every booking, and has increased the prices of its activity holidays in the southern French Alps slightly as a result. Through a joint initiative with Mossy Earth it has established its own forest in Portugal, and is planting more trees in the Southern Carpathian region. The increase in travel companies offering to offset emissions generated by their own holidays comes despite criticism of off-setting. Last week British Airways was accused by Greenpeace of wanting to “have their cake and eat it” after it announced plans to offset its domestic flights as part of its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But for World Expeditions offsetting is an important message to its customers and part of a wider commitment to sustainable travel. “It’s not a gimmick,” said UK manager Gordon Steer. “The travel industry is a contributor [to the climate crisis] and we have to be seen to be taking the first steps to carbon offset our customers’ travel and encourage them to do likewise if they are buying flights themselves.” Steer said the company will extend the scheme to sister brands UTracks and Sherpa Expeditions in the near future.  Responsible Travel, an online directory of over 400 holiday companies, says offsetting is fundamentally flawed and will not promote tour operators’ offsetting schemes on its website. The company, which introduced an offsetting scheme in 2002 then dropped it in 2009, says it is opposed to the idea because it doesn’t work and detracts from the need to reduce emissions. “They provide a quick fix and delay the need for urgent innovation and investment by allowing the continued use of emissions-intensive fuels,” said founder Justin Francis. Instead Responsible Travel, which promotes holidays that involve flying, advocates a global tax on aviation that is weighted so that business- and first-class travellers and those taking domestic flights pay more than those in economy seats. Founder of Much Better Adventures, Sam Bruce, agreed that offsetting schemes are incredibly “murky.” He said his company partnered with Cool Earth in 2018 after years of research into suitable schemes. “The more we looked into [offsetting] the more holes we found. I was never going to go for something that wasn’t airtight. It’s a really murky world.” Cool Earth works alongside rainforest communities to halt deforestation. Bruce added, “The truth is people will continue to travel and we need to reduce the carbon that’s being spat out from their travels and make sure we’re putting it back in. The travel industry should be doing more. Offsetting shouldn’t be about carbon neutrality, it should be about being carbon positive.”"
"Before we get to what’s going on with Labor and climate change, because politics is a deeply human business, we need to start first with the psychology of a political party still coming to terms with losing on 18 May. Viewed through the prism of the five stages of grief, Labor finds itself, depending on the person, somewhere between bargaining, depression and acceptance. Co-existing with the five stages of grief is pent up anticipation, or anxiety, associated with the campaign review being spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, which will serve as the official history of the loss. With that assessment about to land, we’ve had a bunch of people front-running the process, from Bill Shorten down.  As they wait for the final verdict from Jay and Craig, Labor is telling itself three stories about why it lost in May. Version one is we lost because too many voters disliked Shorten. Version two is we lost because Chris Bowen proposed too many revenue measures and that fuelled the death tax scare campaign. Version three is we lost because Mark Butler was too left-leaning on climate change, and couldn’t answer basic questions about how much climate action would cost. Putting Shorten’s contribution to one side, the internal folklore at the moment for people inclined to aggressive simplicity veers between it was Bowen what dunnit and it was Butler in the library with the candlestick. As well as the current history wars – which is a more elevated way of characterising what is, predominantly, a combination of arse-covering, blame-shifting and reasonably unsubtle positioning for the future – people also want to influence where Labor lands in policy terms for the coming term. All the Shorten-era policies are up for grabs and the right faction is seeking to assert itself in the vacuum, because there is a view around that Labor skewed too far left during the last parliamentary term and there needs to be a course correction. The rationale for a shift is expressed as follows: one of the primary reasons Bowen had to chase highly progressive revenue measures (that may or may not have cost Labor votes) was to pay for left-driven social spending (that may or may not have won Labor votes) – and that combination killed us. Just a couple of things about the right faction, or a “right view” that we need to be clear about before we move on. The first is the right faction is not monolithic, there isn’t a single view, there’s a spectrum of views; and the second obvious thing to point out is the person leading the charge on “we must present as more friendly to growth and aspiration” (which can be read as we are going to tax and spend less) is actually the most senior leftwinger in the show, the leader, Anthony Albanese. With those caveats noted, it is absolutely correct to say the right faction is restless and keen to assert itself, and Joel Fitzgibbon, a veteran of the NSW right, has nominated himself as titular head of the repositioning effort. A special repositioning envoy, if you will. Fitzgibbon becoming more vocal serves a few purposes. In brutal power terms, it provides a public reminder to Albanese that the NSW right faction is around and remains important to the stability of his leadership given a number of them backed him post-election for the top job instead of Bowen, one of their own. Just in case anyone might have a memory lapse. Hint hint Albo. Hi. Fitzgibbon, colleagues say, got the fright of his life in May when his ultra safe seat in the Hunter, the heart of coal country, flipped over to marginal, so he’s got an interest in narrowcasting to his constituency. So there’s a bit of that going on, and 2019 tells us Labor won’t win elections if it can’t speak compellingly to that element of its base. I also think Fitzgibbon is seeking to create space for a genuine debate on where Labor should land on climate policy, and on other things – which would be fine, welcome even, except the climate science tells us the time for rolling seminars was actually over a decade ago, and is certainly over now. The longer we delay action, the worse things will get. This genuine debate point is important though, and we need to linger here for a moment to nail this thought. Part of the reason Labor feels off balance at the moment, both internally and externally, is because these people have spent the last two parliamentary terms prioritising discipline over everything else. In order to atone for throwing away government during the Rudd/Gillard period, Labor as a collective has held its tongue for six years. Right now, what we are watching is a group of people learning how to argue productively with each other again, when argument, either constructive or destructive, has been considered the cardinal sin. Speaking anthropologically, this is interesting, watching a sub-culture fashion new rules of engagement in full public view. Considered through the prism of basic human psychology, moving argument from banned activity to permissible is going to feel, for the protagonists, kind of liberating and energising and cathartic, and kind of wrong, perhaps consequentially so. Having mapped out the general terrain, now we can come to the substance of climate change, and whether ambition in Labor’s climate policy is now up for grabs. Let’s step through some basics that might not be obvious. Labor can’t take the same 2030 emissions reduction target to the next election as it proposed in 2019, because Australia will be three years closer to the deadline. Just as a matter of practicality, the 45% by 2030 target will have to be reviewed, which is why Fitzgibbon nominated his own alternative target in a speech to the Sydney Institute this week, framing his adverturism philanthropically as “a sensible settlement” on climate policy. Fitzgibbon said Labor should adopt the same 2030 target as the Coalition – 28%. Not content with that, Fitzgibbon then wondered out loud how many elections and leaders Labor was prepared to lose as a consequence of championing an ambitious climate policy that voters in regional NSW and Queensland had rejected. Creating a bit of forward sizzle for his speech, Fitzgibbon wondered these things in the news outlets most likely to amplify this thesis: the Australian and Sky News. This was sufficiently provocative to warrant a swift response. Butler, the shadow climate change minister, blasted back quickly. He said no to 28% – that was a crap target, and Labor wasn’t about climate capitulation. Albanese’s office then circulated a letter from Butler which was distributed pre-emptively to all MPs to respond to any incoming voter angst triggered by Fitzgibbon’s foray. In that letter, Butler describes Labor’s commitment to achieving the goals of the Paris agreement, keeping warming well below 2C, as “unshakeable”. If this particular issue was going to be decided today, you’d put your money on Butler prevailing, because the Fitzgibbon view is not universally held in the right. Views are mixed and there is a solid constituency in the shadow cabinet and caucus for climate action. But there is a long way to go in this discussion and Labor has to resolve more than pollution reduction targets. It has to work through what it says to coal communities like the one Fitzgibbon represents – and that is genuinely difficult. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"
"Bolivia’s glaciers have shrunk by more than 40% in the past few decades. This puts further pressure on an already stressed water supply, while the meltwater lakes left behind risk collapsing in sudden and catastrophic outburst floods. That’s the conclusion of a new study of the country’s glaciers I conducted with colleagues based in the UK and Bolivia. Our results are published in the journal The Cryosphere. Although Bolivia sits in the tropics, the Andes run through the country like a spine. Many mountains exceed 6,000 metres, among the highest outside of south and central Asia, meaning that glaciers can exist here. Indeed, Bolivia contains around 20% of the world’s so-called “tropical glaciers”. But these glaciers are very sensitive to the effects of a warming climate. Our study shows that Bolivian glaciers have shrunk by around 43% since the mid-1980s – a period marked by increasing temperatures. We estimate that these glaciers will be much diminished by the end of the century. This matters first because people depend on water that drains from glaciers. The capital La Paz and neighbouring El Alto draw on water from several surrounding glaciers, for instance, and together these cities form a fast-growing metropolitan area that is home to more than 2m people. Throughout the year, glaciers supply around 15% of the potable water, but this proportion almost doubles during the dry season between May and October. The glaciers can’t keep “topping up” an unsustainable water supply like this. The short-term gain of more water during the dry season will turn into a longer-term water resource problem once the glaciers disappear. Some have already gone – in 2009, the Chacaltaya glacier 30km from La Paz and once home of Bolivia’s only ski resort, finally disappeared entirely.  These disappearing glaciers also threaten to unleash sudden and devastating floods from meltwater lakes that develop as the ice recedes. The landscape underneath glaciers is typically “lumpy” – that’s because glaciers are very effective at eroding what they pass over. Essentially, they take bite marks out of the bedrock below. When they recede into these basins, meltwater can pond. Sometimes these lakes are dammed by loose piles of sediment, known as moraines – these can be quite stable, but are often rather weak, which raises the concern that they might fail. One particular risk is a sudden rock or ice avalanche into the lake, which causes a huge wave to escape the lake basin and head downstream. These so-called “glacial lake outburst floods” have killed thousands of people around the world in recent decades. Our study was the first to look specifically at the risk of these floods in Bolivia. We identified 25 potentially dangerous lakes that represent a threat to downstream areas. One lake we’re particularly concerned about is Laguna Glaciar, which sits above the communities of Cotaña and Sorata in the northern Cordillera Real. This lake has grown to almost 1km in length, and has a glacier at one end that calves icebergs.  Fortunately, in most cases, these lakes occur in relatively sparsely populated areas. But that’s no comfort for those who do live there. We’re now working to model the potential inundation from these floods, and to investigate how they might affect the communities living below the lakes. In 2009, an ice-dammed lake in the mountains near the Peruvian border suddenly burst. This wasn’t a particularly large lake, but the the flood was serious enough to generate a peak flow of around 400 cubic metres per second – that’s more than six times the regular flow in the River Thames. The resulting flood swept through the nearby village of Keara. Fortunately, nobody was killed, but several homes were damaged, farm animals were killed, and the village was cut off for several months because the road was washed away. We are worried that other such events could take place in the future, and that there could be fatalities. Perhaps the most infamous glacial lake outburst flood event took place in Peru in 1941. A huge chunk of glacier ice fell into Lake Palcacocha, sending a flood of water and sediment down the valley to the city of Huaraz. Sadly, this event killed somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 people. Ultimately, we hope our work will raise awareness of these issues in Bolivia. Like it or not, the glaciers are disappearing, and we must be prepared for what comes next."
"A controversial new coal power plant being built in Bangladesh is already running out of friends. Environmentalists worry it will spell disaster for the world’s largest mangrove forest, while locals worry about pollution and being driven from their homes. The vast majority of Bangladeshis have been critical of the project since its inception in 2010. Even the business case seems to be falling apart, as costs mount and international investors pull out. So why is it still being built? Rampal, a 1320MW coal power station, will be big enough to provide around 10% of the country’s electricity generation. It’s scheduled to be operational from 2020. The project is owned jointly by Bangladesh and India’s state-owned energy utilities, which each have 15% equity, while the remaining 70% of the total funding is expected to come from bank loans. The first and most obvious problem with Rampal is its location on the edge of the Sundarbans, a large, dense mangrove forest that straddles the Bangladesh-India border. The forest is a UNESCO world heritage site and hosts endangered species such as river dolphins and Bengal tigers which will see their habitat damaged if the plant becomes a reality. Environmental groups claim the outer edge of the project is within a 14km radius of the forest, thereby breaking Bangladeshi forest laws. Each year, nearly 5m tonnes of coal will have to be shipped to the plant along the Poshur River, which cuts across the Sundarbans and will need to be dredged. There is a real danger of coal-carrying vehicles scattering large amounts of fly ash, coal dust, sulphur and other toxic chemicals. Reports by NGO network Banktracks, anti-coal think-tank IEEFA and UNESCO claim the project takes no account of the potential for industrial accidents, transportation incidents, tidal waves and regular cyclones.  Human rights agencies have also raised concerns about the displacement of families and the occupation of land in adjacent areas. Fishermen, woodcutters and honey collectors have already lost their livelihoods as a result of displacement and encroachments onto their lands. The above concerns are further compounded by the proposed technological and risk management plans. The plant is set to use outdated supercritical (SC) technology, which skips the water-boiling phase of conventional coal-fired generation but has since been superseded by the more modern and efficient “ultra-supercritical” (USC). Contrary to the claims of the Bangladeshi government, this is bound to produce high levels of carbon dioxide and waste-water discharges. It is also likely that Rampal will in fact be run using poor quality coal imported from India, which spits out lots of ash without creating much energy. A Banktrack report suggests that the project fails to comply with even the minimum environmental and social norms established under the “Equator Principles”, which more than 80 major international financial institutions have signed up to. Consequently foreign banks have shown no interest in financing the project. Given this, the Indian government arranged financing through its state-owned EXIM Bank at an effective interest rate of 5.2%. That’s much lower than market rates in India. However it’s still not an attractive deal for Bangladesh which could usually get a better rate from one of its “development partners” – richer countries such as Norway or Japan which have built close ties with the country.  Nevertheless, this is not a project in which development partners in Bangladesh are prepared to invest. The Norwegian Pension Fund, for instance, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, pulled out citing serious environmental and human rights concerns. The cheap loan below the market rate means the Indian taxpayer is effectively due to pay US$988m throughout the project, while the Bangladeshi taxpayer will pay even more: US$936m in tax breaks and US$1.87 billion for river dredging throughout the project. In order to recover the subsidies and costs, the Rampal power plant will require a standard tariff of Tk9.54/kWh (US12.1c/kWh). Environmentalists claim that alternative power sources, such as solar panels, cost much less than this. This tariff may even be an underestimate, given it is based on the plant operating at 85% capacity (when a Chinese coal plant typically operates at 50-60%) and doesn’t account for the coal market. Rampal electricity would become even more costly if coal prices rose. Rampal faces national and international resistance, and overwhelming financial and environmental concerns. So why are the ruling regime of Bangladesh and the Indian government continuing to push for the project?  Many Bangladeshis are wondering whether the Rampal project will open up markets for low-energy Indian coal, and whether this might be used as a political tool by an Indian government seeking influence in its neighbour. Whatever the consequences for future regional politics, this project will not only cause environmental and human rights disasters, but is also destined to create a financial nightmare for Bangladesh."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the inconvenient results of earlier models are coming in, the once esteemed German climate institutes, which we were not allowed to question, are sitting neck-deep in embarrassment. I’ve always said that the activist IPCC scientists, by abandoning the principles of science, had been setting themselves up to become the laughing stocks of future generations. They have not let us down.

German leading daily Bild writes: “Summer has a personality disorder. It thinks it’s autumn.”
And so do climate scientists. They think they can forecast 100 years into the future when they couldn’t even get the last 10 years right.
History may even soon look back and view them as bonafide crackpots. What other conclusion can be drawn about scientists who naively insist climate can be controlled by a single factor, trace gas CO2?

We all remember the forecasts of “barbecue summers” and snow being “a thing of the past” coming out of England. Well, we’ve seen the same in Germany. Just last week I wrote about how once authorative model projections from the once prestigious Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg have completely have fallen in disagrace.
Today, Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt, author of the bestselling “Die kalte Sonne” skeptic book, take a look at how another model of another once “esteemed” German institute and scientist is faring – from IPCC climate scientist Professor Mojib Latif of the Heimholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. Lüning quotes a recent article in the German daily Die Recklinghäuser Zeitung of 13 July 2012 (yes, even the press is now beginning to ask questions): Die Recklinghäuser Zeitung writes:
Under the motto “parched summers– a climate tale?“ meteorologist Dominik Jung took a look at the dire predictions that climate scientists such as Mojib Latif and looked at the weather archives of the last 10 summers. While the professor of the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, one of the leading admonishers when it comes to the greenhouse effect, years ago foresaw hot and dry summers coming to Central Europe, meteorologist Jung has been unable to confirm that trend. ‘The fact is: Summers over the last 10 years have not been dryer as they were forecast earlier, but have even become wetter nationwide,’ said Jung. His rain summary: There has not been a dry summer since 2003. Rainfall amounts were average in five of the summers, three summers were to some extent extremely wet: 2007, 2010 and 2011, with the latter being 35% above average. ‘And this year does not look any different, especially with the really wet days that are in the pipeline,’ Jung warns.”
In the months and years ahead, we are going to dig up all these once “unquestionable forecasts” and compare them to the real observations. And we are not going to do it just once, but over and over again – just like how the media and activist scientists repeated all the bogus dire warnings of hot, dry summers over and over again.
Get used to it!

"A river in Norilsk, Siberia, has turned a vivid shade of red, alarming local residents and resulting in a minor social media storm. The change in colour was reportedly due to a spill from a nearby nickel smelting plant. While the owners of that specific plant have denied responsibility, it seems likely that this is the latest incident in what appears to be a mounting international list of major spills in the mining and mineral processing sector.  Last month there was a major spill of waste from an alumina processing in China, only one year after the destructive spill of mine tailings at Minas Gerais in Brazil. These follow similar spills in Mount Polley, Canada, in 2014 and Ajka, Western Hungary, in 2010.  Striking images of the red river have captured the world’s imagination, evoking blood, danger, and even the end of days. But this “mysterious” phenomenon may have a fairly straightforward explanation.  When water is polluted by mining and mineral processing, a reddish hue is usually associated with iron oxides, that are common in mineral-rich areas. Indeed, in areas where the natural weathering of metal sulphide minerals (such as pyrite) occurs, it’s common to find streams named for their reddish hue, such as the Red River in England, Rio Tinto in Spain and Afon Goch in Wales.  Mining mineral deposits greatly increases the chance that the natural process of weathering will speed up, releasing more metals into the environment. While iron oxides that result from this weathering are relatively benign chemicals, these sediments can smother stream beds, with major ecological consequences.  What’s more, the waste from mining and mineral processing can be acidic, and contain a range of metals that are highly toxic to aquatic life and potentially damaging to public health. We don’t yet know exactly what chemicals have caused the Siberian incident. The owners of the plant, Norilsk Nickel, have denied responsibility but have said they will monitor the situation.  But if the spill was of slurry (waste rock) destined for the tailings pond, it would be acidic and rich in nickel and copper (among other elements), which are very toxic to aquatic life. In similar cases at Aznalcóllar (Spain) and Baia Mare (Romania) at the turn of the century, the spills led to long term ecological impacts on birds, mammals and fish. Throughout much of Europe and North America, the bulk of heavy primary industry has shrunk over the past 30 to 40 years. And thankfully, the risk of major pollution disasters is relatively small, due to the enforcement of high regulatory standards through waste tip inspections. But abandoned storage facilities for metal tailings can still fail, and the legacy of historic mining can still be seen (albeit in a less spectacular fashion) through the pollution caused by mine waters and the gradual erosion of exposed spoil heaps. For example, 5% of rivers in England and Wales are still polluted by metals from mines abandoned in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. What’s more, the expansion of mining activity continues on a global level. There’s a growing demand for metal resources both old and new, with mines searching out iron, zinc, copper and lead, as well as rare earths and e-tech metals for renewable energies and new technologies.  As such, the potential for metal waste pollution is increasing on a global scale. This issue is exacerbated by the increased working of lower-grade ores, which leads to a greater portion of waste rock being generated. Indeed, studies suggest that the human circulation of metals through mining, refining, processing, use and disposal now greatly outweighs the natural flow of metals around the planet, through the slow weathering of bedrock, transportation and transformation of metals. Some observers have even suggested that metal-laden river sediments associated with early mining activities are a good marker for the Anthropocene epoch – the designated period in which human activity has had a profound effect on the climate and the environment. The mining industry itself has taken major strides to limit its environmental impacts through various initiatives, in no small part because of the significant costs of managing long-abandoned “legacy” sites. Steps taken include better source control, and novel approaches to deal with long-standing mine pollution, such as biological treatment of metal-rich waters. Despite this progress, pollution problems can and will still occur. These may be associated with legacy waste, than with a lack of public funds to address them, or less scrupulous mining companies operating in lax regulatory regimes. In many cases, sudden failures of mine waste storage facilities are caused by extreme weather events. As such, the resilience of current and historic mine waste facilities to the expected impacts of climate change needs to be a priority.  The striking appearance of the red river in Siberia is a stark reminder of the potential environmental costs linked with modern technology, and the severe pollution risks associated with one of humanity’s oldest industries. We wait to see what the Russian authorities officially conclude was the cause of the river changing colour. But better reporting of such incidents globally – which has been enhanced by social media in recent years – will add pressure on mining companies to continue to clean up their act."
"The four-yearly World Conservation Congress of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has just taken place in Hawai’i. The congress is the largest global meeting on nature’s conservation. This year a controversial motion was debated regarding incorporating the language and mechanisms of “natural capital” into IUCN policy. But what is “natural capital”? And why use it to refer to “nature”?  Motion 63 on “Natural Capital”, adopted at the congress, proposes the development of a “natural capital charter” as a framework “for the application of natural capital approaches and mechanisms”. In “noting that concepts and language of natural capital are becoming widespread within conservation circles and IUCN”, the motion reflects IUCN’s adoption of “a substantial policy position” on natural capital. Eleven programmed sessions scheduled for the congress included “natural capital” in the title. Many are associated with the recent launch of the global Natural Capital Protocol, which brings together business leaders to create a world where business both enhances and conserves nature. At least one congress session discussed possible “unforeseen impacts of natural capital on broader issues of equitability, ethics, values, rights and social justice”. This draws on widespread concerns around the metaphor that nature-is-as-capital-is. Critics worry about the emphasis on economic, as opposed to ecological, language and models, and a corresponding marginalisation of non-economic values that elicit care for the natural world. The use of “natural capital” as a noun is becoming increasingly normalised in environmental governance. Recent natural capital initiatives include the World Forum on Natural Capital, described as “the world’s leading natural capital event”, the Natural Capital Declaration, which commits the financial sector to mainstreaming “natural capital considerations” into all financial products and services, and the Natural Capital Financing Facility, a financial instrument of the European Investment Bank and the European Commission that aims “to prove to the market and to potential investors the attractiveness of biodiversity and climate adaptation operations in order to promote sustainable investments from the private sector”. All these initiatives share the UK Natural Capital Committee’s view that “natural capital” consists of “our natural assets including forests, rivers, land, minerals and oceans”. People used to talk about “nature” or “the natural environment” – now they speak of “natural capital”. So what does the word “capital” do to “nature” when they are linked? And should nature be seen in terms of capital at all? One controversial aspect, backed by IUCN’s Business and Biodiversity Programme, is receiving particular attention. This is the possibility of securing debt-based conservation finance from major institutions and the super-super-rich based on the value of income generated from so-called natural capital assets conserved in situ. At the IUCN’s conservation congress a Coalition for Private Investment in Conservation was launched. Led by financial services company Credit Suisse, and backed by the IUCN and the World Wide Fund for Nature, the coalition builds on a series of recent reports proposing capitalising conservation in exactly this way.  In 2016, and following a 2014 report, Credit Suisse and collaborators published two documents outlining proposals for debt-based, return-seeking conservation finance. The most recent is called Levering Ecosystems: A Business-focused Perspective on how Debt Supports Investment in Ecosystem Services. In this, the CEO of Credit Suisse states that not only is saving ecosystems affordable, but it is also profitable, if turned “into an asset treasured by the mainstream investment market”. The report proposes a number of mechanisms whereby “businesses can utilise debt as a tool to restore, rehabilitate, and conserve the environment while creating financial value”. The idea is that as “environmental footprints move closer to being recognised as assets and liabilities by companies, debt can be used to fund specific investments in ecosystems that lead to net-positive financial outcomes”. Debt-based financing – for example, through tradeable securities such as bonds – is framed as attractive in part because interest received by investors is “usually tax-deductible”. The Levering Ecosystems report followed quickly from Conservation Finance: From Niche to Mainstream, steered by a small group including the director of IUCN’s Global Business and Biodiversity Programme. This report estimated the investment potential for conservation finance to be roughly US$200-400 billion by 2020. Of course, investors loaning finance to projects associated with conservation also expect market-rate returns to compensate for investments considered to conserve, restore or rehabilitate ecosystems. In the documents above, financial returns are projected as coming in part from new markets in payments for ecosystem services and sales of carbon credits. These new markets will supply the potentially monetisable “dividends” of conserved and restored habitats as “standing natural capitals”. Investor risk is proposed to be reduced through mobilising these assets, as well as the “land or usage rights” from which they derive, as underlying collateral. The graphs above present two schematic diagrams redrawn from the Credit Suisse texts to indicate how these flows of financial value may be leveraged from areas capitalised as investable natural capital. The models are based in part on expectations that recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change support for international carbon compensation mechanisms will release new long-term sources of public funding to “balance anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases”, thereby boosting possibilities for financial flows from forest carbon. Such financialising moves, nascent and clunky as they are, may yet have significant implications if applied to countries in the global south with remaining high levels of “standing natural capital”. Caution is needed regarding the possibility that forest-rich but least developed countries may become indebted to ultra high-net-worth investors who access returns on their investments from new income streams arising from conserved tropical natures in these countries. In 1986, the central secretariat of the WWF decided to change the name of the organisation from the World Wildlife Fund to the World Wide Fund for Nature. The thinking was that an emphasis on “wildlife”, borne of a concern for endangered species, no longer reflected the organisation’s scope of work for the conservation of the diversity of life on earth. It was considered that overall the organisation would be better served by the term “nature”. In other words, it seems that naming and framing “nature” matters. Given the conversations and debates at IUCN’s World Conservation Congress, it seems important to ask: how exactly does the conservation of natural capital equate with the conservation of nature? Do these terms in fact invoke different things? If they do, then it is worth clarifying whether the conservation of natural capital is always good for the conservation of nature. If they don’t, then it remains worth querying why exactly “nature” needs to be renamed as “natural capital”."

Readers may ask just where is Munich RE getting it’s “science”? Well, here’s one report it used in the past…written by Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Science in the service of Big Bilkers scaring clients.
Warren Buffet and the Munich RE
According to Wikipedia, last year Munich RE equity amounted to €23.0 billion. The group’s premium income for the year (gross premiums written) was €45.5 billion, with its consolidated profit amounting to €2.430 billion. In February 2010, U.S. investor Warren Buffett became Munich Re’s largest single shareholder with 10.2 percent of the company.
Munich RE even approved using the WTC attack to spread climate fear
Just look at the following video (in German) at the 5:20 mark. Munich RE managing director Thomas Loster uses terror attacks to promote climate fear among schoolchildren:
I think it’s okay for one to take what is impossible and to imagine it. As is the case with the World Trade Center attack, one has to think of the unthinkable in order to understand the world.”

One has to think of the unthinkable to scare people into paying higher premiums. Once again the little guy gets the shaft.

"One of my favourite lines in an article on the climate crisis is by American science journalist Sharon Begley: “If a rich technologically advanced nation won’t put its own house in order, then developing countries have a perfect excuse to do nothing.” She also wrote in the same article: “For those who fear that the greenhouse will arrive – and no responsible scientist denies that possibility – it seems imperative to take immediate steps to mitigate it.” Great lines. Written 30 years ago. Begley wrote them in the same 1989 Newsweek magazine that reported on the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is astonishing how little has changed. In the same article she noted that car companies like Ford were strongly opposing any moves to introduce emission cuts that targeted the industry – “it would throw industry into a tailspin and have minimal environmental impact”, one spokesperson suggested. This week the Guardian found that car manufacturers have “been pouring millions of dollars through industry bodies into lobbying efforts to challenge attempts to tackle global heating in the past four years”. And in the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall that nothing has changed is a damning indictment on our political and media systems. But it would be wrong to blame only those in power 30 years ago, for what we have seen this week is that blame can be well and truly passed down to the following generation of political leaders. Gen X is as guilty as the much-maligned baby boomers. As a member of that most cynical and sarcastic generation, who spent our youth mocking baby boomers who preached revolution and then sold out into the Me Generation as soon as a high-income tax cut and four-bedroom home with a two-car garage was dangled before their eyes, we must acknowledge that the answer to the question of “Are we the baddies?” is yes. All that cynicism has mostly been translated into complacency. Our media discourse this week was flooded with comments by 40- and 50-year-olds wondering who the Extinction Rebellion are trying to convince: “I’m all for action on climate change, but ... ” and “Don’t they realise you catch more flies with honey?” We thought we were Rage Against the Machine but we are really FM Easy Listening. Thirty years of inaction. Thirty years of waiting. Thirty years of playing nice. If you think that strategy has worked, then you probably think the Queensland Labor party is a progressive government. You can understand the reaction to protesters by arch-conservative Gen Xers like the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who it appears sees a day without stripping people of their civil liberties as a day wasted. But when you see notionally progressive Gen X leaders like the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, rushing through legislation to prevent these protests you have to wonder not only what is the point of the ALP, but whether my generation is worse on climate change than baby boomers. Palaszczuk tweeted that “everyone has the right to protest in this state” but then added the caveat: “It’s when extreme protesters using dangerous devices put at risk our emergency services & hinder people going about their daily business that it oversteps the mark.” Forget that there is zero evidence that anyone in the Extinction Rebellion movement is using dangerous devices, but if hindering people going about their daily business is the new standard, then protest in the state has effectively become something allowed only in cases when it is neither seen nor heard. Which, it seems, would suit Palaszczuk just fine. It is rather disappointing that she is so eager to embrace laws that Joh Bjelke-Petersen and any number of conservative autocrats would embrace. After all she had to battle oppression and malevolent forces all through her youth to get to the point of *checks notes* taking over the safe parliamentary seat her father held for over a decade. Still, at least her opposition to climate change protest is not one that will see her alienated in the ALP. This week, federal MP Joel Fitzgibbon suggested Labor should adopt the LNP’s Paris agreement target of a 26%-28% cut in emissions from 2005 levels. That cut in reality is closer to 15% once you take into account carry-over credits and dodgy accounting, and which is massively short of the minimum 45% cut that scientists argue is needed. It is rather disappointing that Fitzgibbon is so eager to capitulate to the government. After all he had to had to battle oppression and malevolent forces all through his youth to get to the point of *checks notes* taking over the safe parliamentary seat his father held for over a decade. Look I get it – it is annoying to have your day disrupted. But don’t come at me with arguments that amount to basically doing what has been done for 30 years and expecting anything real to happen. The problem is it has been easy to ignore climate-change activism and as a result ignore the issue completely. Nonviolent resistance is about resisting, not just being nonviolent. And it is about provoking the inevitable overreaction by those in power – the same overreaction that occurred during civil rights and anti-Vietnam war protests. An overreaction that saw the New South Wales and Victorian police demand bail conditions on protests so onerous you would assume they were dreamed up in a Palaszczuk-Dutton group chat. Thankfully those like the ALP’s Mark Butler quickly condemned Fitzgibbon’s suggestion, and others in the party have criticised Palaszczuk’s new laws, so perhaps there remains some hope for it (but, as Richard Marles would suggest, prepare to be disappointed). This week also came a report from the IMF that suggested even with a $111 carbon price, Australia would be unable to meet its Paris target. When the Gillard government introduced a carbon price seven years ago it was just $23. That is the price of inaction. At some point we need to get angry, but if your anger is directed at those protesting rather than at parliamentarians then I suspect you have consigned yourself to expecting nothing to change. That’s fine, but own it. Realise if you are annoyed by them it’s because you have become more annoyed by protest than a lack of action. Don’t pretend to still be seeking change when your anger is directed at those trying desperately to make up for the past 30 years of wasted cynicism and complacency. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s skeptic book Die kalte Sonne has succeeded in exposing something unsettling, something that the established German climate scientists have been harboring for quite some time now: an acute phobia of climate science debate.
This phenomenon is now being exposed by a recent flurry of newspaper articles.
For example, yesterday I wrote about a Spiegel report on how a recent 38-page study by the German Academy of Sciences and Engineering reached the conclusion that climate warming is not a catastrophe and that it will be completely manageable. But because the study involved Fritz Vahrenholt, a professor of chemistry and an expert on renewable energy, 4 warmist scientists resigned in order to protest the non-conforming view. Spiegel wrote:
There was a dispute about the reliability of climate prognoses. Because of the involvement of RWE Innogy supervisory board chairman Fritz Vahrenholt (Social Democrat Party), four scientists resigned from the Committee. The former Senator of Environment of Hamburg accused established climate science of exaggerating man’s share in causing climate change.”
Meanwhile, veteran German journalist Ulli Kulke found the reaction of the 4 resigning scientists peculiar and not at all in the spirit of the scientific approach. At his blog he published a piece called: The debate-phobia of the climate alarmists. In his essay, Kulke writes:
This is not the first time this phobia of debate flares up. One after another the hardliners, those who worship the reports of the IPCC, always refuse to show up when critical climate scientists are invited to podium discussions or other events, also on television. They avoid the public discussion. They are suffering from acute debate phobia.

What is most aggravating about this, is that it is precisely the scientists who have set down the basis for the sun’s influence using extremely sophisticated datasets, and have made great strides, are not only being shut out from the public discussion, but also from the IPCC process. This involves renowned scientists, who for example are working at the CERN atomic research centre in Geneva, an institute of the Danish government, and others. And then in a condescending manner, we only hear talk about how the sun does not show the necessary fluctuations to be responsible for the climate changes of the past.”
That was yesterday.
Today we find an interview with Fritz Vahrenholt in the online daily of the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (NOZ). Earlier this year, Prof. Vahrenholt had been invited by the University of Osnabrück to give a speech – that is until word of his new, controversial skeptic book Die kalte Sonne got out. The University promptly disinvited Vahrenholt – once again non-conforming views not welcome!
In today’s NOZ interview, Vahrenholt is asked about that particular disinvitation. His reply:
Back then that decision from the Uni Osnabrück was tough. I had been invited by a German university to present a certain topic, but they bowed to pressure and disinvted me. But at least I was invited by the University of Oslo, the Royal Society in London, to Vienna and Bern. With the thinking and acting of the University directors in Osnabrück, the findings of Alfred Wegener would have never seen the light of day. He would have been scorned, ridiculed and disinvited. Unfortunately it was not until after his death that his theory of continental drift became accepted. I hope I’ll live long enough to get an apology from the University for their gag order.”
Like the Berlin Wall was an admission of a failed political system, the climate scientists’ phobia of public debate is an admission of a failed science.

"Extinction Rebellion activists charged in Melbourne with blocking streets as part of the “Spring Rebellion” climate change protest have won a battle to have their bail conditions revoked, following a similar court victory in Sydney. The bail conditions placed on those charged in Melbourne were not as onerous as those for the Sydney protesters, including the former Greens senator Scott Ludlam. But according to the bail conditions document seen by Guardian Australia, police were seeking to prevent the protesters from participating in similar protests blocking roadways in Melbourne while on bail. On Thursday, the Melbourne magistrates court struck out the bail conditions for four of the 12 people charged, after their lawyers argued the conditions were excessive, and police ultimately decided to release the remaining eight with no bail conditions. The protesters refused to sign the bail agreement, so were held in custody until the conditions were revoked. They have been charged with intentionally obstructing an emergency service worker. One of those charged, Peta Mallins, said she was held in custody for about 10 or 11 hours on Thursday after refusing to sign the bail agreement. She said she asked for the conditions about obstructing roadways to be removed but was refused by police. She said the conditions were “completely ridiculous” and it was excessive of police to keep them locked up. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It did seem excessive, especially given we are non-violent and [they are] peaceful protests,” she said. Mallins said she would continue to participate in protests but would be careful not to get arrested. A Melbourne Activist Legal Support spokesperson, Anthony Kelly, has been observing the protests and legal action this week. He said it was an inappropriate use of the bail act to limit protests. “Bail ostensibly is designed to ensure that you turn up to court at a particular court date ... it can’t put an injunction on participating in public protests,” he said. Kelly said police had been careful in policing because they were aware they were under scrutiny, but he said they were still “overreaching” and “unjustifiably limiting human rights”. “Bail conditions are one example of that, the other example is the cordoning off of entire intersections to prevent access for peaceful assemblies,” he said. “We believe they’ve set the bar far too low for what they believe to be disruption.” The protesters in Melbourne on Thursday blocked King St Bridge and the road outside Southern Cross Station, with some protesters gluing their hands to the bitumen. Friday’s protest is focused on the offices of mining giant BHP. In Sydney, the police had sought to keep protesters out of a 2.5km radius of Sydney Town Hall but those bail conditions were also rejected for some protestors. However, one Sydney man has revealed that his bail conditions had not been revoked – but allowed to continue by a magistrate in the Waverley local court. Ben Burdett, a 40-year old carpenter, was given bail conditions similar to those of  Ludlam: to not attend any Extinction Rebellion protests and to not enter within 2.5km of the Sydney Town Hall. On Thursday, a magistrate of the Waverley local court ruled that these conditions should continue for 20 more days, until his hearing on 31 October. Burdett was not represented by a lawyer. In contrast, in the Downing centre local court, Ludlam’s conditions had been dismissed."

Reinsurers are cashing in by spreading dubious fears of weather extremes. Photo source: Tomas Castelazo, GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version.
Spiegel reporter Axel Bojanowski has a piece today at the online Der Spiegel: Scientists reprehend climate warnings made by insurance companies.
We know that Big Insurance is drooling over the fat profits to be made from jacked up premiums that policyholders are being asked to cough up because of “increasing weather-related extremes.” Spiegel introduces its piece with:
The Münchener Rückversicherung (Munich RE) claims to have found the first proof that man-made climate change is triggering more and more weather catastrophes in North America. Scientists are outraged.”
Here the scientists are not outraged about the man-made weather catastrophes. They are outraged by the outrageous claims now being made by reinsurers like Munich RE, which underwrites insurance companies against extreme payouts for weather-related damages. The Munich RE is now telling its clients worldwide that it has found the “first footprint” of man-made climate change in North America.
The Munich RE is convinced that it has enough data to conclude that the frequency of weather extremes has increased in North America, a market where it collects half of its premiums. Its press release claims:
Nowhere in the world is the rising number of natural catastrophes more evident than in North America. The study shows a nearly quintupled number of weather-related loss events in North America for the past three decades, compared with an increase factor of 4 in Asia, 2.5 in Africa, 2 in Europe and 1.5 in South America.”
Munich RE director of geo-research Peter Hoppe adds: “Such a chain of evidence for the impact of climate change is unprecedented.”
That means profits – if the policyholders believe it. Spiegel quotes Munich RE board of directors member Peter Röder:

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




With today’s premiums against weather catastrophes in the USA we are “really satisfied,” explained Röder at a press conference in Munich. ‘The expectations for more violent storms have already been factored in.'”
And now the money is flooding into Munich Re coffers and those of other reiensurers, like a tsunami. So what do scientists say about the (money making) claims made by reinsurers like Munich RE? Spiegel quotes Roger Pielke Jr., who wonders (paraphrased): “Where’s the evidence?”
Atmospheric scientist Clifford Mass of the University of Washington in Seattle adds:
Most of the claims make no sense and contradict observations.”
Indeed observations show that there has not been any increase in extreme weather. Spiegel cites a tornado study by Pielke that is slated to appear soon in “Environmental Hazards”. The study shows that tornadoes since 1950 have actually reduced in their destructive power.
Spiegel calls the claims made by the reinsurers, particularly Munich RE, “suspicious”, quoting Pielke and Mass:
‘When the Munich RE thinks it has discovered the first footprint, then it should submit its study to a scientific magazine for review’. Publicizing an alleged discovery via press release “is suspicious”. Atmospheric scientist Mass agrees: “Climate change is serious, but hyping the trend and distorting it is irresponsible.”
Pielke reminds us that the data tells us the opposite; droughts in the USA have gotten shorter and less severe over the last decades.
Bojanowski sums up by quoting the late Austrian climate researcher, Reinhard Böhm: “With this short term gag, which is getting light attention, we should not bury the credibility of science.”
Thanks Spiegel for this insightful piece!

"Eels are found everywhere throughout Europe, wherever there is access to and from the sea. They’re unfussy eaters, and are flexible enough to live in almost any lake, river, stream, ditch or estuary. To the casual observer, therefore, it may come as a surprise to learn that the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is categorised as critically endangered on the official IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In fact, the European eel is technically of greater concern than conservation icons like the Bengal tiger or giant panda. This is partly because the European eel’s lifecycle still remains surprisingly mysterious. We do know that they spend most of their lives in freshwater, before migrating some 5,000-10,000km to their presumed spawning area in the Sargasso Sea, a vast, calm, distinctive body of water in the western Atlantic. Here, it is assumed the eels spawn and lay eggs (although this has never actually been witnessed). Once hatched, the larvae then drift across the Atlantic Ocean back to Europe. There, they transform into transparent “glass eels” which colonise rivers and lakes and where they live and grow to adulthood. This cycle means most Europeans will never see the earliest eel life stages and has led to much speculation over the years. Where, people wondered, do eels come from? In his History of Animals, written in the 4th century BC, Aristotle claimed that eels were produced not through sexual reproduction but by spontaneous generation. Lacking in milt (the fish equivalent of semen) or eggs, nor possessing the passages for either, he asserted that eels emerged from earthworms:  There can be no doubt that the case is so. For in some standing pools, after the water has been drained off and the mud has been dredged away, the eels appear again after a fall of rain. In time of drought they do not appear even in stagnant ponds, for the simple reason that their existence and sustenance is derived from rainwater. It is easy to laugh at this fanciful notion, armed with the wealth of knowledge accumulated in the centuries since the ancient Greeks. However, almost 2,500 years later scientists are still trying to solve the riddle of the lifecycle of one of the world’s most mysterious and fascinating animals. Indeed, it wasn’t until the beginning of the 20th century that Danish scientist Johannes Schmidt was able to identify the southern Sargasso Sea as the presumed spawning site of the European eel. Schmidt never actually saw any adult eels there, though. Instead, he collected larvae from across the Atlantic, and noted that the smallest, youngest larvae were found in the Sargasso Sea. To date, however, despite considerable research efforts, European eels have still not been observed reproducing in the wild, nor have any adult eels been captured in the Sargasso Sea. These days, thanks to GPS and more recent developments in batteries and satellite tracking tags small enough to fit on the back of an eel – technologies that Schmidt could only dream of, never mind Aristotle – scientists have the tools to investigate aspects of the eel life cycle that were previously out of reach. One team of researchers, led by marine ecologist David Righton, has mapped oceanic migration routes using pop-up satellite tags, which attach to the eel temporarily before eventually coming loose and floating to the surface where they can broadcast data. Across a five-year study, the researchers attached these tags to 707 eels they released from five European locations. Most eels they tagged were quickly eaten, but 87 survived and made it into the open ocean before their trackers ran out of power.  The findings from this study, published in Science Advances, reveal some extraordinary journeys. Eel migration routes extended toward the Azores, some 5,000km in the direction of their presumed spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. As trackers become smaller and more powerful, the European eel’s full migration route will hopefully eventually be revealed. However, in the meantime, this recent research provides a fascinating insight into their migration. For example, all tagged eels exhibited daily vertical migrations, moving from deeper water during the day to shallower water at night.  In addition, the range in swimming speeds (anywhere from 3k to 47km per day) suggests it is unlikely that all eels spawn as a single cohort in the spring after they leave their river the previous autumn – an assumption held since Schmidt’s first discovery of eel larvae in the Sargasso Sea at the beginning of the 20th century. Rather, the researchers suggest that European eels likely adopt a mixed migration strategy, with some fast swimmers soon reaching the relevant area for immediate spawning, while others arrive only in time for the following season. This new Europe-wide collaborative research, utilising advances in technology to go where we haven’t been able to go before, may finally help us solve the final piece of the puzzle of the life cycle of this most enigmatic of creatures. But then again, eels have been leading us up a slippery path for years."
"Farming is one of many industries facing uncertainty in a post-Brexit world. The way crops and livestock are managed could look very different in the years ahead.  The politician responsible for British agriculture, Andrea Leadsom, recently caused controversy by suggesting British people fill fruit-picking jobs potentially left vacant by migrant workers. But the very notion that young Britons should go “back to the land” to do a job associated with meagre wages, long hours, gruelling, and in some cases slave-like conditions caused a flurry of ridicule.  Indeed, Leadsom’s remarks, and the response they provoked, demonstrate significant confusion about what actually constitutes a career in agriculture. Casual workers make up just 33% of the agricultural workforce, and seasonal fruit and vegetable picking is only one cog in the very complex machine that is farming in the 21st century. Ignoring the majority of the agricultural workforce could be a big mistake. Farm workers make up less than 1% of the current British workforce. Since around 1850, with the rise in industry drawing people to urban jobs, and the increasing development of technology and machinery, the number of farm workers has declined significantly, from around 1.7m to around 130,000 today.  Over the last ten years this rapid decline in permanent farm workers has somewhat stemmed, partly due to an adaptation of new technology creating new work opportunities. A government review estimated in 2013 that 60,000 new entrants would be needed in the agricultural industry over the next ten years. Yet some farms are already struggling to fill permanent positions, many of which are well-paid with substantial benefits. With only 4% of young people considering a job in food and farming, along with potential Brexit fallout stemming from new policies on immigration, close attention needs to be paid to the agricultural labour force in order to prevent a further crisis. Research in 2014 for The National Centre for Universities and Businesses revealed that many students are put off working in agriculture due to a poor perception of jobs in the sector. This is despite a study of 1,300 farm workers revealing a happy workforce which largely debunked the myths of the work being low-paid, unskilled or boring.  A large majority of that workforce – 80% – said they would recommend a career in agriculture.  A lack of connection  between the agricultural industry and secondary education has also been cited as one of the main issues steering potential workers away from farming careers. My own research among farm workers in south-west England suggests bright young students are often discouraged from pursuing a career in farming by teachers and careers officers. Many believe that automation will fill the gap created by the lack of availability of labour, replacing human intuition that has been relied upon for centuries, with precision agriculture. But technology and innovation also bring new opportunities, and don’t automatically signal the extinction of the farm worker. At a crucial point in the agricultural industry, where a potential skilled labour crisis looms large, the old image of agricultural work being back-breaking and intellectually undemanding needs a complete overhaul.  Without access to sufficient labour, many businesses could be forced to move away from labour intensive farming, such as horticulture, dairy, pigs and poultry – or move out of farming altogether.  With the average age of the farm workforce older than 55 and with fewer people crossing the gap from agricultural education to the farm workforce, everything that can be done to attract new entrants into the industry should be done.  Leadsom was right in saying that more young people should be encouraged to “engage in countryside matters”. But by bunching the concept of an agricultural career up with preconceived notions of seasonal labour, she has created a precarious lack of clarity around the issues. As for encouraging more British workers to pick fruit in the future, if history is anything to go by, this looks unlikely. So, while the potential shortage in seasonal labour need to be urgently addressed, new entrants to the permanent agricultural workforce need to be suitably encouraged, trained and invested in, to secure the future of British agriculture.  In the face of significant challenges such as climate change, an increasing population, and the unpredictability of global markets, the British farming industry needs to be more competitive, sustainable, and resilient than ever.  We need effective schemes and apprenticeships, the provision of the right opportunities by employers, and the establishment of a greater and more informed linkage between schools and farming to provide a sturdy step in the direction of a more secure future for farming."

Arctic Ice Melt – Is The End Of The World Coming?
by Klaus-Eckart Puls (Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
Over the last years things have been very quiet among the climate alarmists and prophets of catastrophe because: 1) The global temperature did not rise for 14 years, and instead is now showing a slight downward trend (Is the quiet sun having an impact?) and 2) In contradiction to the IPCC forecasts, sea level rise shows no acceleration, and at many coasts it is even showing a slow-down, e.g. at the German Bight (read here).
Since the minimum of 2007, Arctic sea ice began to recover, until 2011. Now – in summer 2012 – there was “finally” a new minimum of just about 2% below the 2007 value. Among the alarmists this was cause for an outbreak of hysterical jubilation: Finally the headlines of the “coming end of the world” were back.
Some comments:
1) It should have been clear even among the ‘most naive’ journalists (but obviously it wasn’t!) that neither the modest 0.7°C of global warming nor the 14 years of declining global temperature could be responsible:

Figure: Global temperature anomaly. (Source: www.metoffice.gov.uk/)
The source of the above graphic is the IPCC-friendly Hadley-Center. It shows that since 1998 there’s been no temperature increase; instead there’s been a downward trend going on through July 2012 (…and that with continuously increasing CO2! …where’s the correlation?).
(2) The scientific literature also shows that for a long time now there has to be other reasons to explain the glacier-ice sheet melts, namely soot and dust which are (not only) produced by man.
(3) New studies and theories show that also tropospheric ozone plays a considerable role in climate change and ice melt.
(4) And as the Arctic ice is decreasing, ice in Antarctica is growing as it is getting colder there. Neither event is a climate catastrophe.
(5) Arctic sea ice melts have occurred time and again in the past.

(6) In relation to point no. 5: It’s been known for a long time in Arctic research that there are natural fluctuations/cycles of 60/70 years. This is repeated by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI):
(a) ‘This is in part due to natural developments that have a period of 60-70 years.’ (Source: Rüdiger Gerdes, AWI, in the Nordsee-Zeitung daily, 29 Aug 2012, p.3);
(b) ‘Since the 1990s, we have had a strong temperature increase in the area of the North Atlantic and the North Polar Sea. This is in part due to a natural oscillating development with a period of 60-70 years. We are now in the warm phase.’ (Source: R. Gerdes, AWI, in the Nordwest-Zeitung daily, NR.202, 29 August 2012, p. 2)
(c) And, again from the AWI, Prof. Dr. Miller (AWI Vice Director): ‘We can’t say with certainty when and whether the Arctic will become ice-free.’ (Source: Prof. Dr. Heinrich Miller, interview with Professor Dr. Heinz Miller, Deputy Director of the Alfred Wegener Institute. As a geophysicist, he works with climate reconstructions and ice dynamics, 3 November 2007; http://www.awi.de/).
(d) AWI Director Prof. Dr. Karin Lochte in a FASZ interview (FAZ 16 November 2007, p. 46) concerning the question of whether the large ice lost in the summer of 2007 is an indication for the man-made warming: ‘We have to wait and see. We still don’t know today if we will have more ice once again in five years…’
(e) And again Karin Lochte on that question upon the research ship FS POLARSTERN having circled the North Pole in 2008, on whether it’s global climate change: ‘That is not clear… There’s no answer to the question of whether the decline in sea ice will continue, or if there will be a colder phase.’ (ElbeWeserAktuell daily, 29 October 2008, p.6 BC).
Summary
The Arctic ice melt of the last 20 years is for the most part a well-known, natural ‘cyclic phenomenon’ that cannot be explained by the moderate secular temperature increase of 0.7°C (in the Arctic about 1°C) , and also not by the CO2 increase.

"Human noise is forcing animals around the world to go through changes, unknown and invisible to most of us. It will be another case of the survival of the fittest: some species will adapt and thrive; others will struggle to survive. Our loud lives matter as sound is crucial for many animals. Songs, grunts, roars or cheeps can be used to keep in contact with others, to warn of danger or defend territory, to attract a mate, or to beg for food from a parent. But cities interrupt these communications. Our road traffic or construction sites, even our talking, fill their ears with low-pitched noise. So how do animals living in cities adapt? The fringe-lipped bat, of Central and South America provides one example. Using robotic, inflatable frogs and a large cage with microphones and speakers, a team led by Wouter Halfwerk recently revealed how these bats have adapted their hunting to noisy conditions. Their study is published in the journal Science. Most bats use echolocation – a series of ultrasonic chirps – to find their prey. The fringe-lipped bat, however, along with a group including Europe’s long-eared bat, normally hunts by listening for lower frequency sounds that humans could also hear. In this case, the researchers focused on the loud, croaking, mating calls produced by some species of frogs.  In the wild, the movement of the frog’s vocal sacs as they inflate before they croak can be picked up by echolocation, so the bats could use both listening (eavesdropping) and echolocation for hunting. In the cage they set up for the experiment in Panama, scientists used pressurised air to inflate the robot’s vocal sacs thus mimicking the wild frogs. Halfwerk’s team wanted to find out what happened if the mating calls were obscured by background noise, so they arranged the robot-frogs in such a way that some could only be detected by their croaking while others could also be detected by bats using echolocation. Would the bats change their hunting strategy if they could not hear the croaking above the high ambient sound played through the loudspeakers in the cage? When the team flooded the cage with low-level, ambient, natural noise, both the non-inflating and the inflating robots were hunted in equal numbers. The bats heard the croaking and homed in on the robot frogs. However, when the volume of the ambient noise was turned up to obscure the sound made by the robot-frogs, the bats hunted only the robots which were having their vocal sacs inflated. In noisy conditions, the bats sent out twice as many echolocative calls as when it was quieter. The bats had switched to using echolocation to find their prey. This change in behaviour is an example of what scientists call phenotypic plasticity – the ability of an organism to respond to changes in their environment with adaptations to their physique, behaviour or life cycle. These changes can occur very quickly and may or may not be permanent throughout their lifespan.  Of course, bats aren’t the only animals to exhibit such plasticity of course, and other examples show how many species are adapting to live alongside their noisy human neighbours. Nightingales raise the volume of their song in response to traffic noise and it also appears that they sing louder on weekday mornings than at weekends. Male song sparrows shift their song into higher frequencies, so it is not obscured by the lower rumble of cities. Similar observations have been made in great tits and it was also found that the songs of urban great tits were shorter and faster than those of their forest-dwelling cousins. Such responses are not confined to birds: mammals, amphibians and insects have all responded in similar fashion. Whales in noisy harbours and shipping lanes sing louder but less often. Californian ground squirrels shift their calls to higher harmonics where there are noisy wind turbines. In response to traffic noise, the southern brown tree frog from Australia and the bow-winged grasshopper in Germany shift their acoustic signals to a higher pitch. While singing louder and at a higher pitch are common responses, they are not the only adaptations that have been seen and several urban birds have started singing at different times. For example, European robins now sing at night in areas that are noisy during the day. But what does all this mean for wildlife in the cities of the Anthropocene? It is clear that some species are able to adapt to noisy environments. These are the species that exhibit phenotypic plasticity, the generalists that can thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions and make use of different resources. More specialised species, those that are not able to adapt, face becoming locally extinct.  The generalists, the adaptors, are the species with the survival kits for the 21st century, the species many city-dwellers will see every day. Our noisy lives have unwittingly given these animals a helping hand."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s no longer any hope of adequately curbing CO2 emissions and preventing run-away global warming, writes Die Zeit weekly here. The hopelessly deep-in-despair German weekly has given up all hope and has resigned itself to the world as we know it coming to an end. Human society has failed.

The IPCC and goverments are in self-deception says Germany’s Die Zeit weekly. (Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/)
Die Zeit claims this because it is obvious that countries are not even going to reduce emissions anywhere near the levels needed to reach the theoretical 2°C target set by IPCC scientists.
Die Zeit’s  report, authored by Frank Drieschner, starts by claiming that even if the entire world changed light bulbs, drove electric cars, and insulated their homes, i.e. followed Germany’s example in greening up, the planet would still heat up by 4°C by the year 2100. To believe anything else is “self-deception,” he writes.
Let’s assume that the world’s ecological revolution were successfully completed by the end of the century. How much would the Earth heat up? Answer: about four degrees Celsius. Four, not two.”
Drieschner is fanatically warmist, believes even the most pessimistic of the IPCC scenarios, and is hopelessly convinced that the end of the world is imminent. Die Zeit says it is all but sure the planet will heat up this century and we will leave our children a world that is “more dangerous, inhospitable and life-threatening then it ever was was during the entire history of mankind.”
Seasons, vegetation patterns and coastlines will change, and not just once, but do so continuously, probably for hundreds of years. […] In addition, there will be incalculable changes in ocean currents in the Atlantic and Pacific with unpredictable consequences. […] In the best case, it’s going to cost millions of lives. [… The probability of such changes is high.”
Die Zeit (Drieschner) claims that no now matter how green the planet gets in the decades ahead, we are all condemned to 4°C of warming hell because we are well beyond the point of no return. The crime has been committed. The guilty ones are the rich industrial countries. Die Zeit advises:
The transition to green energy must be far more rapid, we have not been radical enough by a long shot.”
So why does Die Zeit say the 2°C limit has no chance and that the planet will see 4°C of warming at best?
Here they apply the climate forcings and the emissions scenarios used by the IPCC in its previous reports. When it comes to global GHG emissions, these have far exceeded anything the IPCC projected just a few years ago in even its most pessimistic forecasts – thanks to astronomical emissions growth in China and developing countries.
Die Zeit reminds us that China’s emissions surpassed those of the USA in 2008, and just 3 years later they were 50% higher: “Nobody thought such development could be possible; suddenly all calculations were obsolete.”
And the chances of reaching emissions targets are “hopeless,” Die Zeit writes. The USA refuses to ratify a treaty, Europe is now backing down from its 30% reductions target by 2020. There’s no chance of reducing emissions. The amount of carbon dioxide needed to theoretically heat the planet more than 2°C will surely be emitted sooner than later, and more than enough will be emitted to heat the planet 4°C. Die Zeit:

What industrial countries managedto save in emissions with unified commitment over the last 20 years equals what emerging and developing countries have added in just a year.”
Thus in order to reach the 2°C limit, worldwide emissions would have to drop 2.5 to 3 percent annually starting now, Die Zeit claims. How difficult would that be? It turns out impossibly difficult.
Die Zeit illustrates why this is so by comparing that figure to the reductions achieved by the most successful countries thus far, namely Germany. Die Zeit writes:
Sure [German] emissions per capita compared to Europe are high, but they are dropping faster than almost anywhere else. How fast are they dropping? About 1.3% per year.”
That’s a far cry from the needed 2.5 – 3%. Die Zeit then writes that even if the planet imposed the strictest reductions proposed in the wildest dreams of the eco-activists, emissions would drop only 2.3% per year. No country in the world is prepared to make that kind of economic sacrifice. So clearly there is no chance of reducing emissions to the extent that is needed to meet the theoretically calculated 2°C limit. What’s more, emissions from developing countries are exploding.
Climate policy is based on an illusion that is based on an illusion
Clearly we see that there is absolutely no chance to reduce global CO2 emissions to a point that would satisfy the 2°C target requirements – no matter how much the developed countries cut back. Yet, as Die Zeit frets, countries and governments continue to act like the target is still attainable without much pain. Die Zeit quotes Australian philosopher Clive Hamilton, who writes in his über-pessimistic book Requiem for a Species:
Nobody is ready to publicly tell us what climate science has to tell us: That it’s too late to prevent a global warming that will radically alter the planet this century.”
And even though the mathematics tell countries and world leaders that the 2°C target is impossible, governments continue form policy around it. Die Zeit writes: “one has to conclude that climate policy in total is based on an illusion”.
By now we see that climate policy is actually based on 2 illusions: 1) CO2 is the Earth’s thermostat, and 2) the theoretical 2°C target still can be reached. Governments and the IPCC now have illusions based on illusions!
Die Zeit concludes:
While a warming of over 4°C can be hardly prevented, the IPCC remains relentless in defending the illusion that the world can still calmly decide whether it would like to set the thermostat in the greenhouse at +2°C or perhaps at +1.5°C.”
Die Zeit is probably the first media outlet that I know that has given up on rescuing the planet from global warming has resigned to the fate that we are going to burn up by the end of the century. Drieschner is a total incurable basket case who by now has probably crawled under his bed with his teddy bear.
There’s no data out there that will cure Die Zeit of its terminal pessimism. Obviously the publication is still oblivious to the fact that global temperature has not risen in 16 years.

"In what looks very like a tit-for-tat downgrading of bilateral relations, Russia and America have traded diplomatic insults in recent weeks over nuclear weapons, geopolitics and economics, prompting speculation about “a new Cold War”. Moscow acted first, announcing on October 3 that it had suspended its agreement with Washington on the disposal of surplus weapons-grade plutonium. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accused the United States of “creating a threat to strategic stability as a result of unfriendly actions towards Russia”. He cited the recent build up of American forces in Eastern Europe, especially the Baltic states. For its part, the US suspended talks with Russia over the war in Syria, on top of its existing sanctions against Moscow over Russia’s 2014 military actions in Ukraine.   How to escape from this standoff? Are there any lessons to be learned from the era of détente and the end of the Cold War in the 1970s and 1980s? In particular, about the role of international statecraft and personal dialogue between leaders?  October 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland which had aimed for an agreement on bilateral nuclear arms reductions. At the time the meeting was depicted in the media as a total failure, particularly over Star Wars, the US plan for a sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defence system. “No Deal. Star Wars Sinks the Summit,” Time magazine trumpeted on its cover with a photo of two drained and dejected men, unable to look each other in the eye.  The last session ended in total deadlock between the two leaders – maybe a fateful missed opportunity. “I don’t know when we’ll ever have another chance like this,” Reagan lamented. “I don’t either”, replied Gorbachev. They wondered when – or even if – they would meet again.  This familiar, negative narrative was – and is – shortsighted. In reality, both leaders soon came to a more positive view of the summit. Far from being a “failure”, Gorbachev judged Reykjavik to be “a step in a complicated dialogue, in a search for solutions”. Reagan told the American people: “We are closer than ever before to agreements that could lead to a safer world without nuclear weapons.” Reagan and Gorbachev had both learned how open discussion between those at the top could cut through much of the red tape and political misunderstanding that ties up international relations. At Reykjavik, even though Stars Wars proved a (temporary) stumbling block, both sides agreed that they could and should radically reduce their nuclear arsenals without detriment to national security. And this actually happened, for the first time ever, just a year later when they signed away all their intermediate-range nuclear forces – Soviet SS-20s and US Cruise and Pershing II missiles – in Washington in December 1987. The treaty testifies to the value of summit meetings that can be part of a process of dialogue that deepens trust on both sides and promotes effective cooperation. Reagan and Gorbachev clicked as human beings at Geneva in 1985, they spoke the unspeakable at Reykjavik in 1986 with talk of a nuclear-free world – and they did the unprecedented in Washington in 1987 by eliminating a whole category of nuclear weapons. All this helped to defuse the Cold War. Today, however, the world seems in turmoil and trust is once again in short supply. We seem to be back to political posturing, megaphone diplomacy and military brinkmanship. Is there is any place for summitry in a situation of near-total alienation? This question was, of course, at the heart of the easing of hostilities in the 1970s, when East and West tried to thaw relations and find ways of living together peacefully.  Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s “global chancellor” of the 1970s, was a great practitioner of what he called “Dialogpolitik”. He argued that leaders must always try to put themselves in the other person’s shoes in order to understand their perspective on the world, especially at times of tension. He favoured informal summit meetings as a way to exchange views privately and candidly, rather than feeding the insatiable media craving to spill secrets and proclaim achievements.  In the early 1980s, when superpower relations were stuck in a deep freeze, Schmidt conducted shuttle diplomacy as the self-styled “double-interpreter” between Washington and Moscow. Even when no real deals were in the offing, he believed it particularly vital to keep talking.  The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, recently revived Schmidt’s approach, emphasising the need to maintain lines of communication with the Kremlin at a time of renewed East-West tension. Equally, however, she has insisted on the importance of a strong defence capability. Merkel is surely right. There is always a delicate balance to be struck between the diplomacy of dialogue and the politics of deterrence – making up your mind when to reach out and when to stand firm. Three decades on from Reykjavik, that remains the perennial challenge for those who have the vision, skill and nerve to venture to the summit."
"Recent changes in the patterns of tropical storms are threatening the future of the Mekong River delta in Vietnam. This is one of the world’s great deltas. It is home to more than 20m people and the rice that is grown on its fertile land underpins food security across South-East Asia.  Working with colleagues from the UK, US and Finland, we’ve just published a paper in Nature, which shows that fewer tropical storms have been hitting the Mekong catchment in recent years. This in turn results in much less mud and sand reaching the delta. We’re worried that this could have dramatic effects on the delta’s sustainability in the medium and longer term due to the adverse impacts on flooding and reduced agricultural productivity.    The world’s deltas are facing a sustainability crisis: 28 of the 33 largest are at risk of “drowning” as a result of rising relative sea-levels. Deltas naturally sink slowly under their own weight, but under normal conditions the sediments supplied from the rivers that feed them are deposited, maintaining the delta surface above sea-level.  However, the rate of sea-level rise is accelerating as a consequence of climate change warming the oceans, and drilling for oil and gas or the “mining” of groundwater is causing rapid subsidence. Meanwhile, the sediment loads in many rivers are declining as a result of human activities upstream – the large-scale development of dams being a particular issue in many river systems. The Mekong faces many of these challenges – and the IPCC has recognised it (along with the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Nile deltas) as one of the three most vulnerable to climate change. The sustainability of the delta is critical to the lives and livelihoods of local residents, many of whom are poor. River sediment represents a critical resource for building delta lands, reducing flooding and maintaining fertile soils. Our work had two main components. First we carried out an extensive programme of fieldwork to quantify the Mekong’s sediment load under varying conditions (including, in September 2013, during one of the largest floods on record, which itself was generated by a typhoon), so that we could link water and sediment flows.  The second aspect of our work traced the frequency and location of tropical storms that have tracked over the Mekong basin in the past 30 years or so. Working with our colleagues in Finland we used this information to run a computer model of the flows of water through the whole Mekong catchment, taking into account scenarios “with” and “without” tropical storms.  Our results showed just how crucial tropical storms are in maintaining the Mekong delta. Only around 5% of the catchment area’s total annual rainfall is sourced from storms, but because this heavy and sudden rainfall is so effective at washing mud and sand into the river, the storms are responsible for more than 30% of the sediment that reaches the delta. Future climate models predict that tropical storms, such as the so-called “Super Typhoon” Haima which, at the time of writing, is tracking towards the Philippines, are going to get stronger and more frequent as oceans warm up. However, these models also project that their typical track locations will shift north and eastwards towards China, so that in the future it is likely that fewer storms will cross the Mekong’s catchment.  Sand mining is already reducing the sediment being delivered to the Mekong delta and further reductions are anticipated as a result of future damming upstream. Therefore, if the storm projections are correct and even less sediment is washed downstream, the delta’s prospects look bleak.  Our study is the first to show the significant role tropical storms can have in the delivery of sediment to large river deltas. This has implications for a range of other major rivers, such as the Ganges in Bangladesh, the Yangtze in China, and the Mississippi in the US. All of these have catchments that are regularly struck by tropical storms. Some 500m people live and work in the world’s major river deltas – and our work shows we can’t evaluate their future vulnerability to sea-level rise without also considering changes in the storms that feed the deltas. Chris Hackney, Andrew Nicholas, Rolf Aalto, Matti Kummu and Jim Best also contributed to this research."

Frosty temperature forecast for Germany for 29 Oct 2012. Source: http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/.
The 15-day weather simulations are beginning to converge and are indicating that a huge mass of polar air is about to sweep across Europe by the end of next week and early November. See the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) forecast model here at German meteorological site wetter.24

The various forecast models have been in increasing agreement over the last days on that a blast of polar air sweeping over Europe will develop over the course of next week. Foremost there is still uncertainty over when it will reach us in Germany.”
According to the ECMWF the cold likely will begin to grip northern Germany and Poland on Thursday. Scandinavia will be hit especially hard, with temperatures plummeting to under -10°C in some regions. Wetter.24 also writes:
The timing is also not so certain, but the probability is high that on Sunday of the coming week all of Germany will be under the influence of really cold air.
Joe Bastardi also tweets a cold blast will grip Europe saying, “…coldest start to Nov in many a year shaping up.”
I think it’s still a little early to say it’s going to be really cold. We’ll get a much clearer picture from the simulations over the next 48 hours. But keep in mind, Joe usually gets them right.

All that cold in Australia and has got to be due to global warming. It fits right in, after all. For example “climate scientists” using advanced computer simulations are now warning that global warming is also going to cause especially bitter-cold, snowy winters in Europe and North America in the years ahead. Apparently the effect is now reaching way down into the southern hemisphere!

" A project to produce detailed maps of all the land on Earth through laser scanning has been revealed by researchers who say action is needed now to preserve a record of the world’s cultural, environmental and geological treasures. Prof Chris Fisher, an archaeologist from Colorado State University, said he founded the Earth Archive as a response to the climate crisis.  “We are going to lose a significant amount of both cultural patrimony – so archaeological sites and landscapes – but also ecological patrimony – plants and animals, entire landscapes, geology, hydrology,” Fisher told the Guardian. “We really have a limit time to record those things before the Earth fundamentally changes.” He also said that while it was important to take action on the climate crisis, even if we started “living like the Flintstones”, changes are already taking place. The main technology Fisher hopes to use is aircraft-based Lidar, a scanning technique in which laser pulses are directed at the Earth’s surface from an instrument attached to an aircraft. The time it takes for the pulses to bounce back is measured, allowing researchers to work out the distance to the object or surface they strike. Combined with location data, the approach allows scientists to build 3D maps of an area. The method has already helped reveal ancient cities deep in jungles and map the full extent of sites built by rivals to the Aztecs. The resolution of aircraft-based Lidar data can lead to images with stunning detail. “We can see things on the ground that are on the order of 20cm or so … which is about the size of a construction brick,” said Fisher. Fisher said the idea to use Lidar to create a global map came to him after hearing of the work of CyArk, a non-profit organisation which uses digital techniques including laser scanning to record cultural monuments and sites in 3D.  “I came to realise that is great, but those archaeological sites are just a tiny fraction of what we are actually about to lose in the next couple of decades because of the climate crisis,” he said.  Fisher said that Lidar works well over land and the ice caps. As a result the project will focus on the planet’s land area: roughly 29% of the Earth’s surface. Fisher says the first areas to be recorded will be those most under threat, such as coastal regions at risk from sea level rises and the Amazon, where deforestation is surging under the Bolsonaro government in Brazil. Fisher said the first move was to collate existing Lidar data. The Earth Archive will also contain data from other techniques including aerial photography and satellite data, some of which already exists. The result, Fisher said, will be an open source record of the planet which could help archaeologists, geologists, conservationists and others. Besides revealing manmade structures within jungles, Lidar can also reveal details such as the age and complexity of forests. The data can also be used to reconstruct landscapes and to track changes to the landscape over decades. Building the Earth Archive will not be cheap: Fisher estimates it would cost about $15m (£12m) to scan much of the Amazon within two or three years. He says a large part of the cost lies in getting the equipment to the required location, while filtering the data takes people power. While Fisher said the team was seeking funding, he said some organisations had already pledged to donate services in kind.  Fisher’s plans have had a mixed response from others in the field. While most say such a resource would be valuable, they say the practical hurdles are considerable. Kevin Tansey, professor of remote sensing at the University of Leicester, welcomed the project, but said Lidar was expensive and time consuming. What’s more, changes in some areas are happening so quickly that landscapes could be altering drastically even as data is collected. Prof Mat Disney of University College London raised concerns the project’s expensecould divert money away from other research. What is more, he added, getting permission to map certain areas could prove difficult. “Who is going to give them permission to fly over Brazil? The Brazilian government aren’t,” he said. Dr France Gerard of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology also has mixed feelings. “I think conceptually it is a great idea,” Gerard said. She added that many countries such as the Netherlands were already carrying out Lidar surveys.  However, Gerard has concerns over areas being captured at different points in time. “The date of the observations will vary tremendously across the globe,” she said. Gerard said there were also questions about whether the raw data would be made available, and what sort of data would be collected.  Both she and Disney note there have already been space-based Lidar projects that offer consistent, global-scale data and are providing valuable information on forests, albeit at a far lower resolution than aircraft-mounted Lidar – this lower resolution is something Fisher says is problematic. Fisher says his project will take time but will be valuable. “I won’t live long enough to see the results of this project, none of us will, and our kids won’t live long enough,” he said.  “It is for their grandchildren, and their grandchildren, and their grandchildren. [It’s like] the ultimate gift we can give to future generations.”"
"Despite Hinkley Point C’s obvious problems, Britain badly needs the proposed nuclear power station. But Hinkley, which was finally given the go-ahead on September 15 after a six week government review, must be just the start of a major programme of new nuclear plants in the UK. Coal and gas are too dirty – and wind and solar too intermittent – for the country to be able to rely solely on any of these technologies.  Only nuclear can provide the consistent and secure supply of low-carbon electricity that the UK needs to secure the long-term supply to its national grid. In order to maintain a stable flow of electricity, Britain needs at least some large fossil or nuclear-fuelled generators. Wind and solar alone can’t do it as the technologies are inherently unable to hold the grid frequency stable at 50Hz. Yet the UK’s dirty coal-fired plants will be gone by 2025 – so that leaves gas and nuclear plants to provide this stability into the future. The debate surrounding the proposed nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C has focused largely on the price EDF will get for electricity generated. This was set four years ago at an inflation-linked £92.50/MWh. That’s more expensive than generation from gas, or Britain’s soon-to-be-defunct coal plants, but it should be affordable.  Wind power can take up some of the slack. The UK now has enough turbines installed that, on windy days, total generation is similar to that from nuclear. Things will only accelerate thanks to several huge projects in the pipeline such as DONG Energy’s Hornsea One, which will become the world’s first offshore windfarm with greater than 1GW of generating capacity. All this has been achieved under an industry target of reducing the cost of energy from offshore wind to below £100/MWh by 2020. An unavoidable consequence of the drive towards cleaner and more sustainable power is that the industry will rely on government subsidies and more expensive electricity prices in order to incentivise the necessary new technologies. Electricity from regular, dirty coal is by far the cheapest form of large-scale generation, but the decision has already been made to move away from this. Many UK coal stations are now closed and in some cases pulled down. So Hinkley C is expensive, but not out of line with the direction of travel in the industry. The larger questions concerns the long-term security of Hinkley’s supply. After all, it will take a minimum of ten years to build the plant and all the evidence suggests it is highly likely to be much longer before it actually comes online.  Hinkley C will use the new third-generation Areva EPR nuclear reactor design which is not yet in commercial operation anywhere in the world. New nuclear plants at Flamanville (France), Olkiluoto (Finland) and Taishan (China) are all currently under construction with this new type of reactor – and all of these projects are experiencing long delays and significant cost over-runs. At the moment the UK’s nuclear plants consist of a number of Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (AGR) stations (including Hinkley B) and the Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) station at Sizewell B. The AGRs have now all passed their original design lives and have been specially licenced for extended operation.  But as the plants get older, the risks inevitably increase. Only two winters ago cracks were found in the steam generators on the AGR units at Heysham, Lancashire. Not only was Heysham shut down for inspection and repair, but also its sister units in Hartlepool. The result was that a significant proportion of the UK’s nuclear generators were not available for several months over the winter demand-peak, leading to concerns at the time over the availability of reserve generating capacity. With a variety of creaky old nuclear plants dating back to the 1970s or 1980s, and question marks over exactly when Hinkley C will be available, what the UK needs is a nuclear building plan that severely reduces the risk of supply gaps. Fortunately, other nuclear options are potentially more secure. Small Modular nuclear Reactors (SMRs) are now receiving increased attention and government interest. Each SMR unit is typically capable of delivering 100-200MW of electricity. That’s far smaller than Hinkley C’s planned two units totalling 3,200MW, but their size means they can be built quickly, each one requires a fraction of the capital investment of Hinkley, and they could even be built locally.  New SMR reactor designs are available. China National Nuclear Corporation’s ACP100 for example, passively cools the nuclear core in the event of a complete power failure in the same way as the much larger EPR reactor design planned for Hinkley C will do.  The UK needs viable new nuclear plants – and Hinkley C has only ever been one part of the solution. Many more will be needed. Britain is running out of time to deliver further nuclear power before major disruption to its future electricity supply. The door may be opening for small modular nuclear reactors."

No North Atlantic Phenomenon: Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age Found in the Andes
(Translated from the German by P Gosselin)
The Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period are North Atlantic phenomena, so claim Stefan Rahmstorf and other IPCC colleagues. Globally, they were compensated for by other regions, and so we should not worry too much over these local climate anomalies. And least of all, we should not get the idea the sun may have had something to do with it. It is only a pure coincidence that the sun happened to be so strong during the Medieval Warm Period. Also, the low solar activity during the Little Ice Age also means nothing. Moreover, it is also completely meaningless that the second half of the 20th century was one of the most active episodes for solar activity in the last 10,000 years.
In September 2012 in the journal Climate of the Past Discussions a new study on the climate development of the last 1000 years in the Andes Mountains in South America was published. A group led by Marie-Pierre Ledru of the Institute of Sciences of Evolution of Montpellier studied pollen from a sediment core extracted from a marsh in Ecuador. They compared the climate development there with data from other areas taken in the mountains range.
For the time of the Medieval Warm Period from 900 to 1230 A.D. the scientists found warm and wet conditions. On the other hand, cold conditions dominated in the second half of the Little Ice Age, around 1750-1810 A.D. The general pattern of the 1000-year natural climate cycle is easy to see from the parameters of the study, and even if some developments in other areas are a bit shifted.

It’s back to the drawing board for the hapless IPCC.

"What happens wildlife protection laws don’t keep pace with science? You can end up in a bizarre situation where an endangered species ceases to have any legal protection, thanks to an update to its scientific name.  This is an unintended consequence of the intersection between advances in taxonomy and genetics, intended to categorise species and biodiversity more precisely, with the objectives of conservationists and wildlife protection authorities. When these two disciplines fall out of synch, newly renamed species can lose their protection. This may sound pedantic, even absurd, and it’s clearly against the “spirit” of policing the illegal wildlife trade. Yet if the accused find themselves on trial for smuggling a species that is no longer specifically named in the legislation charges are brought under, they may get away with it. This is a particular risk for threatened species in China, as detailed in our latest research. The country is a hotspot for the illegal wildlife trade because animals and animal products are used for food and medicine, as objets d’art, or for pets. This trade is run by criminal cartels that are increasingly good at evading detection and punishment by, for instance, smuggling pangolin scales or disguising real elephant tusks within permitted consignments of quality synthetic ivory.  China is especially exposed to taxonomic name changes because its native Protected Species List (PSL) has not been updated since it was first implemented in 1989. Animal science has moved on a great deal in the 27 years since, as new species have been discovered, and old ones have had their family trees or geographic distributions redrawn. Failure to update the names used on China’s PSL allows formerly-protected species to slip off, and also causes discrepancies with CITES, the international convention on illegal wildlife trade, and the IUCN Red List, the official register of endangered species. For now, China still brings convictions under old species names, as given on the PSL, but once defence lawyers succeed in setting a precedent that these names are inaccurate (and they are trying) many threatened species will be at risk. At this point, appeals against current prison sentences are to be expected, with some perpetrators exonerated and even eligible for state compensation. China’s protected list includes 79 mammal groups referred to by their common name (tigers, say) and by their scientific name (Panthera tigris). Of these, 18 threatened species have undergone taxonomic name changes that are no longer consistent with the legislation aimed at protecting them. For instance, there is lot of demand for pangolin scales for traditional Chinese medicine. These cute, scaly animals are the world’s most-trafficked wild mammals, but only the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) is listed on China’s PSL as a native species. Currently, other pangolin species receive protection as exotic animals under international law. However, new data show that the Malayan pangolin (M. javanica) and the Indian pangolin (M. crassicaudata) are, in reality, also native to China. This means trafficking these two species no longer necessarily implies international trade, and thus no violation of the CITES treaty. Until they are added to China’s protection list, trade in potentially “native” Malayan and Indian pangolins is not, literally, in contravention of current legislation. Another problem arises when a protected species becomes split into several newly recognised species. The goral, for example, is a small goat-like animal that lives in the mountains of south and east Asia: The animal appears as “Naemorhedus goral” on China’s list. However, there are now three recognised species: the Himalayan goral (N. goral) in southern Tibet (still protected), along with two new unprotected species, the long-tailed goral (N. caudatus) and the Chinese goral (N. griseus), both of which are found in the country. Similarly, the Chinese mainland serow (Capricornis milneedwardsii), a “goat antelope”, was elevated from sub-species status in 2005, leaving only the residual Sumatran serow, C. sumatraensis, on China’s protected species list. The legal status of the Northern pig-tailed macaque and the Siberian ibex are affected likewise. Ambiguity is exacerbated when discrepancies arise between the scientific names on China’s protected list and those used internationally. For example, in Yunnan Province, 34 cases of Asian black bear trafficking or poaching have been prosecuted successfully using its Chinese name, Selenarctos thibetanus, although CITES calls this same bear Ursus thibetanus.  Similarly, the Asian golden cat is Felis temminckii on China’s protected list (the name used in two criminal cases in Yunnan) but known as Catopuma temminckii elsewhere. Other species with different names on the Chinese and CITES lists include the Eurasian lynx, the fishing cat, Eld’s deer and the hog deer. These naming differences hinder prosecutions and accurate data collection on the illegal wildlife trade. So what can be done to remedy this bizarre situation? Although China lags behind many other nations in updating its protected species lists, this issue can afflict any country. All 181 CITES signatory nations should keep in step with the latest taxonomy. A database called “Species+”, used by the UN and the CITES secretariat to define the legal names, protected status, and distribution of all species, should become the standard for national legislation. This would allow wildlife enforcement agencies to all identify species to the same standard and alleviate trans-border inconsistencies. In light of substantial worldwide attention to wildlife crime in China, its government is committed to a “zero tolerance policy” and is consulting on the revision and amendment of existing wildlife laws. This is a decisive opportunity to close those taxonomic loopholes, and save China’s endangered species."

Many of you by now are aware of the notorious, creepy 3.5-minute video of NYU modern-eugenics-nutjob S. Matthew Liao made by a Huffington Post correspondent, see below. H/t: Tom Nelson.

In the video, the psychopathic professor resurrects the darkest science of our past and proposes a series of methods for altering humans so that they fulfil the green master standards and plan. This “human engineering” is all about an elite group of humans viewing the rest as inferior, and eliminating the inferior by fundamentally altering them.
This modern eugenicist claims “people are not thinking correctly” and that we should consider giving the inferior ones oxytocin “to make them more willing to cooperate” and to “get them to act collectively”. He says we also should give people Ritalin “to better control the population” and to “screen for embryos using a genetic diagnosis” so that only small humans get selected. Liao proposes hormone treatments for children in order to stunt their growth and keep them small. He also suggests drugging people to make them allergic to meat.
At the end he says it’s no big deal – we already have the technology to do this, so “it’s not far-fetched”.
He constantly uses phrases like: “we could” or “one possibility is…” or “we can try to…” or “another thing we could do is…”. This is the language of experimentation, used by mad scientists getting set to conduct ghoulish experiments.

Liao insists that all of this is innocent, and of course would be voluntary – God forbid it has anything to do with Nazi-type practices.
What a complete menace. This twisted, five-and-dime professor obviously has never picked up a history book in his life. Ideas to rescue the planet always begin with good intentions. But what happens if people don’t volunteer enough? I guess we could just double the dose of oxytocin until the population does “cooperate”.
Which kid is going to volunteer to be the class shorty? Liao is a borderline psychopath, I fear.
Just watching Liao makes me sick and disgusted. But that’s just me. Liao probably has the full support of his university and I’m sure a good number of “climate scientists” agree with him. They’re probably already getting ready to claim there’s a consensus that this “science” would work and that it’s for our own good.
Should it surprise us that green nutjobs are losing it and are now spending more and more time, it seems, contemplating “final solutions”? A little background information on the roots of the green movement tells us where they lie. Read here, here and here to start.
I can only hope that Prof Liao is not running the local water utility.

"US mayors are seeking to go over President Trump’s head and negotiate directly at next month’s UN climate change conference in Santiago, they said as they met in Copenhagen for the C40 World Mayors Summit.Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, who rallied US mayors to commit to the Paris climate agreement after Trump announced his intention to withdraw the country in 2017, said he would ask the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Thursday to give American cities a new role in UN climate talks.“I’m going to bring it up with the UN secretary general,” Garcetti said. “If cities are invited to be at the table, I believe they will help accelerate the work that needs to be done. Hopefully, we can do it in concert with our national governments, but [we can do it] even where there is conflict.”Garcetti, who was announced on Wednesday as the next chair of the C40 group of global cities, said he would use his position to seek “a more formal role in the deliberations” at the conference. “The United Nations works directly with cities all the time ... so they shouldn’t feel feel scared about jumping down to that local level,” he said.  Garcetti was in Copenhagen with 11 other mayors of US cities that as members of the C40 have committed to bring net emissions to zero by 2050.According to the C40, carbon emissions are now declining in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco and Washington DC, as well as 21 non-US cities. A full 435 US mayors representing 71 million Americans have now signed up to Garcetti’s Climate Mayors organisation, committing them to adopt and uphold the Paris agreement.“When [Trump] pulled out of Paris, the mayors jumped in,” Boston mayor Marty Walsh told the Guardian at the conference. “I think that Donald Trump’s inaction in the long run hopefully will be good for the climate, because it’s energised and activated more mayors to do more.” Boston’s government on Thursday released an updated climate plan that included a demand that all new city buildings have a climate-neutral design, and that standards be brought in to decarbonise large buildings. LA last month approved a plan to build a giant 400MW solar project that will capture and store enough energy to power 283,330 homes. Walsh, Garcetti and others were scathing in their assessment of the US president.“I think that we have gotten so caught up in the noise around Donald Trump and his tweets,” Walsh said. “You can’t govern by Twitter, by attacking and insulting people, insulting women, insulting people, a college kid. You can’t govern like that.” He said he believed Trump’s denial of the climate crisis was partly due to simple ignorance. “One, he’s denying it for his friends in certain industries, and number two, I think he’s denying it because he knows nothing about it,” he said. Garcetti said Trump had been an obstacle to LA’s plans. “We would love to have a president who was a partner instead of a polluter,” he said. “Literally in California, he’s forcing us to pollute ourselves and change our own rules that we’ve made for our own cities and own state, with car companies and ourselves. It’s crazy.” As well as enacting ambitious city-level actions to reduce climate change, mayors are also suing the federal government to prevent it from interfering with their efforts. “We’re suing to hold on to our clean-air protections, and to push forward with our fuel efficiency standards, our clean water,” Garcetti said. At the same time, the federal government’s refusal to acknowledge the severity of the problem is starting to backfire, as extreme weather events have become too frequent for voters to ignore, and Republican-led state governments and the federal government are forced to act. ﻿New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell pointed to the “fair share” deal she reached in May with Louisiana’s Republican governor, John Bel Edwards, to repair the city’s roads, canals and pipes, and improve stormwater management. “We saw bipartisan support and a shift that we have never seen before at a state level,” she said. “And it is because of, one, the rate of rain that we’re seeing, and also the actions that are required to mitigate the city from flooding.” Cantrell said she now hoped to see a similar shift at a federal level, after a recent surge in spending on emergency measures to counter extreme climate events. New Orleans this summer suffered two so-called 100-year storms over just two months, she said, at one point receiving more than 20mm of rain in 90 minutes. The city is also, she said, losing “a football field every 100 minutes” to coastal erosion, while the Mississippi River has hit the highest levels recorded in 200 years.“The amount of money that the federal government has had to put forward in a very limited time – just over a year – is extremely significant,” she said. “It’s more than the federal government has had to put out in decades. So, the dollar speaks. “I think we will continue to see the federal government paying more attention, because you cannot deny the impact that it’s having on our cities.” In LA, Garcetti said even members of Trump’s core voter base were beginning to become concerned about the climate. “It’s a losing fight: whether it’s earthquakes in Oklahoma, flooding in Houston, the Florida Panhandle, this is affecting so-called red states as much as blue states,” he said. “I always say, ask a firefighter if climate change is real in Los Angeles. Every single one of them – and they’re not, you know, a leftwing bunch – know it’s real because they’ve seen some of their colleagues threatened and even die on the line.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
"A well-circulated statistic this week, from a new book by the University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, shows that the richest 400 families in the United States now pay a lower tax rate than the bottom 50% of families. Those 400 families – the 0.01% – own more wealth than 60% of households in the US. The top 0.1% own more than 80%. Rates for the top 0.01% and the bottom 50% have been creeping closer since 1960. Also this week, the Guardian’s polluters series found that just 20 private and state-owned fossil fuel producers are responsible for 35% of manmade carbon dioxide and methane emissions over a similar period. On Thursday, the IMF suggested a $75-per-ton global carbon tax is the most efficient way to fight greenhouse gas emissions and keep warming below 2C. The tax is, if anything, far too low.  Mind, actual carbon prices worldwide average about $8 per ton, according to the OECD. And proposals for far lower carbon taxes in the US have been reliably shot down, albeit in no small part thanks to significant industry lobbying. Even this modest amount would raise energy prices in the US by 53%, since fossil fuel companies will pass the cost of the tax directly through to consumers. While it does consider the possibility of the tax funding clean energy investments or the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the IMF – perhaps most famous for enforcing brutal austerity on to small debtor nations – also proposes using revenue generated by the tax in wealthy G20 nations to lower income taxes, “reduce fiscal deficits, or pay an equal dividend to the whole population”, so members of the top 0.01% are cut the same check as those in the bottom 50%. If the IMF thinks that’s going to make a $75-per-ton carbon tax politically feasible in the US, I have a yellow vest to sell them. In the context of gaping inequality, any climate policy that doesn’t look to make the economy more equal overall will be dead on arrival. The reason people have taken to the streets against fuel price hikes from France to Ecuador is pretty straightforward: the rich can afford to adjust, and the poor can’t. Barring huge state investments that allow the majority of people to lead lower-carbon lives – through public transit, energy-efficient housing and much more – even a tax with dividends paid back to the public is going to be met with protests, and rightfully so. Amid 30 years of wage stagnation in the US and decades of disinvestment from our public sphere, people using inefficient cars to drive to work or school isn’t a matter of making a greener choice. It’s a necessity, and a flat annual or monthly check, or even a few token investment projects, won’t change that. It’s not that we need the top 0.1%’s money, though. As the United States’ expansive military budget and fossil fuel subsidies should show, there is more than enough money lying around in the public purse to fully fund a rapid and equitable decarbonization tomorrow; we shouldn’t hold the fate of human civilization hostage to the Jeff Bezoses of the world. The reason to make tax rates fairer is simple: to eliminate billionaires. And let’s ban their carbon-spewing yachts and private jets while we’re at it. Among the ultra-wealthy, there’s also a special place in hell reserved for the executives of those 20 top-polluting companies, who have arguably done more to fuel the climate crisis than anyone else on Earth, misleading the public about its existence in the name of hoarding more and more wealth. Any climate policy worth its salt needs to directly confront the business model of the fossil fuel industry – to dig up and burn as much carbon dioxide as possible – and get rid of the generous subsidies and tax breaks they and their executives enjoy. Tax policy, after all, is social policy, and it reflects what a society values. As of now, the United States’ tax structure primarily values a small layer of elites who wreck the planet and extract wealth from the workers who actually run their companies – elites who then throw that wealth into hot real estate markets and the unregulated casino known as speculative finance so that their money can go on making more money. Still, the IMF report does represent a departure from its previous thinking, and shows just how far climate strikers and calls for a Green New Deal have shifted the political landscape on climate. As the report’s authors correctly note, “the economic costs of mitigating climate change through less-than-optimal tools would still be lower than the devastating effects of global warming”. But the most optimal tools aren’t going to cut it. We need more equitable ones."
"A new book, The Hidden Life of Trees, claims that trees talk to one another. But is this really the case? The simple answer is that plants certainly exchange information with one another and other organisms such as insects. Think of the scents of newly mowed grass or crushed sage. Some of the chemicals that make up these aromas will tell other plants to prepare for an attack or summon predatory insects to defend them. These evocative smells could be seen as cries of warning or screams for help. When plants are damaged by infection or by being eaten, they release a range of volatile molecules into the air around them. After exposure to some of these chemicals, nearby plants of the same species and even other species become less vulnerable to attack, for example by producing toxins or substances that make themselves harder to digest. These changes don’t usually happen straight away but the genes needed turn on much more quickly when they are needed.  There is also evidence that the chemicals released by plants in a particular location are subtly different from those released elsewhere by the same species. Consequently, it seems that if plants talk, they even have languages or at least regional accents. But is this really communication, as humans understand it? It really isn’t clear whether a plant releasing chemicals intends to pass on information to another plant by doing so. I respond to the chemicals released by frying onions but that doesn’t mean that the onions are talking to me. So are these really messages or just the opportunist use of chemical information in the environment?  It seems more likely that these signals started out not as a way to send information to other trees but to get messages quickly and efficiently to other parts of the same plant. Pests or infections will often jump from one branch of a tree to the ones closest to it. But a warning telling those branches to prepare for an imminent attack might have to travel most of the way through the tree and then back up it if the message had to move through the body of the plant. This could be a journey of tens of metres in a tall tree.  A signal that can travel through the air, meanwhile, can go directly to the branches closest to the attack. A consequence of these volatile signals, however, is that they can be “overheard” by any plants the chemicals reach. So when other trees respond by also beefing up their defences, is it communication or eavesdropping? Perhaps it is a bit of both. Maybe an internal messaging system became co-opted to help plants close enough to “listen in” as they would often be related to the tree sending the message in a classic example of evolutionary “kin selection”. However, releasing chemicals into the environment is indiscriminate and other plants and organisms can take advantage. Sometimes these chemical “messages” can attract pests or parasites. The smell of crushed sage doesn’t protect it from humans, for example … rather the opposite.  Not all transfer of information between plants is through the air. The vast majority of plants live in symbiotic relationships with soil fungi. We tend to think of forest fungi as mushrooms and toadstools above the ground but these only pop up after sexual reproduction. The real fungus is a mat of elongated cells spreading through the forest floor.  The trees provide the fungi with sugar and the fungi help the tree to gather water and soil nutrients. And many plants can be joined underground by cells of the same individual fungus. Sometimes when one plant suffers damage, other plants connected to it through their soil fungi protect themselves against future attacks while other plants equally near that aren’t “plugged in” don’t. This fungal network is another carrier for information, a true Wood Wide Web.  But who is in control? The messages are relayed by the fungus and perhaps it is the one really using the information, gathering it from one of its host plants and passing it on to the others to protect its “revenue”. The fungus helps the plants to communicate but may do it for its own purposes, and that might include preferentially helping its best producers, whether they are related to the tree sending the message or not. Information intended for family and friends may end up being passed on to unrelated third parties to profit the carrier of the message. In this way, fungi is a bit like a social media company, listening into and benefiting from its users’ posts. So we return to the question of whether any of these examples are communication in the sense that we would mean it. Anything that makes people think more about plants is good, but perhaps making trees seem more like us can lead us to overlook their essential nature. As a slightly hippy student, what attracted me to plant science was the way that trees and other plants fluidly adjust to their environment. Perhaps using the chemicals that reach them to shape their adaptation is just another facet of this. Worrying about whether trees communicate actually says more about us than them."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLike Mann’s hockey stick, some climate fairy tales keep insisting they are real. The CO2-fingerprint tale is another example.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt comment here on a new paper that completely discredits the atmospheric CO2-fingerprint theory, long ballyhooed by Mojib Latif and Bart Verheggen, for example.
===============================
Bad news for Mojib Latif: New study in the Journal of Geophysical Research questions stratospheric CO2 fingerprint
 By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
 (Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Mojib Latif is a well-known friend of the climate catastrophe. He travels across the country, from one media appearance to another, hawking his climate theories, and especially his new book. One of his main assertions is the so-called CO2 “fingerprint” that we supposedly find in the atmosphere. According to Latif, the CO2-fingerprint confirms the enormous power of CO2 as a greenhouse gas. Tens of thousands of meters over our heads, the middle atmosphere has cooled and that can only be explained by CO2 trapping the heat below in the troposphere.
However, in the meantime, atmospheric science has progressed and it now shows a very different story, casting great doubt on Latif’s fingerprint theory. Already back in March of this year we reported on a new modelling study from the Leibniz Institute for Atmospheric Physics in Germany. The study showed that temperature fluctuations at middle altitudes are due mostly to ozone concentrations (see our blog article here). And even though we brought up this new science time and again in various newspaper and blog articles, Latif continued to keep his head in the sand and failed to acknowledge his error.

In June, 2012, his colleague Bart Verheggen jumped to his aid. In a piece, which Verheggen recycled a number of times (e.g. here or here or here), he tried to salvage whatever he could of the CO2 fingerprint theory. He wrote that we should not confuse short-term and long-term trends. Moreover, he claimed that the Kühlungsborner study involved the mesosphere while the “fingerprint” was limited to the stratosphere, and sat back thinking the issue was settled.
Now it appears that the air has finally gotten really thin for Latif’s and Verheggen’s fingerprint tale. Earlier this month a new study has appeared in the Journal of Geophysical Research written by Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia University and Susan Solomon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study closely examined the temperature development of the lower stratosphere, precisely the layer where CO2 is alleged to be causing cooling. The results of the study speak for themselves. Here’s the abstract (emphasis added):
The effect of ozone depletion on temperature trends in the tropical lower stratosphere is explored with an atmospheric general circulation model, and directly contrasted to the effect of increased greenhouse gases and warmer sea surface temperatures. Confirming and extending earlier studies we find that, over the second half of the 20th Century, the model’s lower-stratospheric cooling caused by ozone depletion is several times larger than that induced by increasing greenhouse gases. Moreover, our model suggests that the response to different forcings is highly additive. Finally we demonstrate that when ozone depletion alone is prescribed in the model, the seasonal cycle of the resultant cooling trends in the lower stratosphere is quite similar to that recently reported in satellite and radiosonde observations: this constitutes strong, new evidence for the key role of ozone depletion on tropical lower-stratospheric temperature trends.”

Some years ago, Latif also claimed that winters and snowfall would disappear from Europe because of CO2. That too turned out to be a fairy tale. Prof. Latif is digging a deep hole.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science is hopelessly confused. A few years ago we were told to expect more hurricanes, but have since gotten almost none. We were told we would get winters without snow, instead we’re now getting hit by bitter cold, snowy winters. We were told to expect an Arctic melt down, and now they are telling us to expext a new ice age.
Is it any wonder that nobody believes climate scientists anymore?
This week German NTV public television is broadcasting a show titled “Der Super Frost” – scheduled to air Wednesday evening at 11 p.m. CET. Hat-tip to Die kalte Sonne website. “Der Super Frost” just happens to be the Mega Freeze episode of the US Mega Disasters series from 2006 (see trailer below).

In the trailer, they ask if global warming will lead to a tipping to global freezing, in which case we would have to call it global cooling – which in reality climate scientists say is now global warming.
This show isn’t just some outdated theory from 2006. Once again today the notion that warming will lead to an ice age is coming back. For example last week German daily Bild here (and a host of other German media outlets) carried the story from scientist Jennifer Francis of Rutgers-University. Bild opened with:

In the Arctic it is getting warmer and warmer, the ice sheet covering the sea has reached a record minimum. Scientists fear that the winter in North America and Europe will therefore become extremely icy! Meaning: The Arctic sea is releasing more and more heat into the air – and this delivers frigid cold!
Wow! warming produces extreme cold. It really does, the scientists say. So should we be preparing for a bitter cold winter? Well, not really. You see Bild reports that these Francis added an opt-out provision to cover her tush:
However, many factors play a role, like snow cover in Siberia or also tropical influences. Thus despite less sea ice coverage, sometimes also mild and wet winters may remain – like last year. Climate scientist Francis: ‘I can only say that it will probably be a very interesting winter.’“
If that’s all you can say, then why did you tell us the rest? Is it because now, no matter what happens, you and the rest of the charlatans will be able to say your models predicted it?
If their idiotic hypothesis that a warm Arctic produces a cold northern hemisphere were true, then the opposite would have to be true. That is, when there’s lots of sea ice, as was the case 35 years ago, then North American and European winters would have to be very mild. That was not the case.
As climatologist Pat Michaels says, the hypothesis is horseshit.

"The pledge by International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is bold, in the context of a global aviation industry that has been accused of reacting slowly to the climate crisis. But someone needed to set an example. The onus to act is clear: although aviation’s current share of total carbon emissions is less than 2.5%, its share is projected to grow rapidly. This is even before factoring in the more onerous effects of emissions at altitude, and the warming effect of aircraft contrails.  Yet airlines remain in a bind. While other sectors have clear, achievable methods of decarbonising, aviation struggles to see a route ahead – bar the fraught, unsatisfactory system of offsetting. The energy sector, the previous chief emitter ahead of transport, has rapidly found cleaner alternatives to coal. Within the transport sector, those sustainable forms of energy could transform much of road usage. But battery or hydrogen power will not fly commercial passenger volumes in the foreseeable future. If offsetting – where companies invest in environmental projects to balance out their own carbon footprints – is the only way, credit is therefore due to IAG for at least doing more than its peers in making such a commitment. And yet the immediate financial impact, a $3m (£2.4m) annual offsetting bill, is small. Offsetting all BA flights would cost less than, say, a pilots’ strike or a data breach fine. An annual bill in the tens of millions would still only dent, rather than wipe out, BA’s profits. Soon, even that may look cheap for airlines. The question of the environment is on the lips of every potential financial investor. IAG’s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has been more far-sighted than most of his global peers. He was pushed by the then Labour government’s increase to air passenger duty more than a decade ago to realise how environmental pressure could spell ever more punitive taxes for the industry. Aviation has now tried to get ahead of the curve in taking the initiative and, in some places, proclaiming its green credentials. The Corsia offsetting scheme agreed at the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation, the UN aviation agency, is far from perfect but could, if policed and monitored properly, at least allow airlines to mitigate their impact. The alternative is likely to be growing government action and public pressure to rein in flying. For now, aviation has time to sort its house out; while a growing minority may choose to remain on the ground, it would be premature to believe such attitudes are mainstream. Flight shaming, or flygskam as they call it in Sweden, has yet to catch on as widely as enthusiasts might hope. Aviation continues to underpin myriad aspects of life that are intensely valued and celebrated – whether that be enabling artists to tour, films to be made, political summits or football matches to take place – let alone the trade Britain needs, or holidays millions take every summer. No one tried to flight shame the 150,000 repatriated Thomas Cook passengers. That aspect of life was astutely noted by Walsh, who said that if flying were to become “socially unacceptable”, it would be more unacceptable to simply restrict the experience to the very rich, as was effectively the case 40 years ago. Proposals to target frequent flyers for greater taxation, or issue personal quotas for aviation, could prove a more equitable solution. The evolution of the climate crisis could rapidly bypass such debates. What is clear even now is that offsetting can only ever be part of a global solution, and aviation’s special pleading cannot last for ever. While the hunt for a sustainable solution continues, only by demonstrating that they are doing their utmost to decarbonise will airlines deserve indulgence. IAG’s pledge is the least that competitors should emulate: a 2050 deadline seems a long way away. Don’t shed tears for Adam Neumann, co-founder of WeWork, now that he’s no longer worth $4.1bn and is a mere sub-billionaire whose personal wealth is $600m, according to Forbes. These things can happen when your company is exposed to some proper market scrutiny. In fact, Neumann should count himself lucky that bubbly conditions in private markets lasted long enough for him to cash out a few hundred millions from WeWork. An encounter with reality, in the form of the botched initial public offering (IPO), revealed that the office space company was never really worth $47bn. That was just the silly valuation at which Japanese group Softbank bought its last bundle of shares. After the collapse of the IPO, the tables have turned. Loss-making WeWork now desperately needs to find lenders willing to keep the show on the road. Rating agency Fitch this month downgraded the current IOUs to triple C-plus status, meaning junk territory, so WeWork will have to pay paupers’ rates for its new money. That’s tough, but just financial reality. Softbank, one assumes, will be willing to contribute a few dollars for new shares or new debt; it has invested about $9bn so far, and is semi-obliged to carry on. So there ought to be the basis of a refinancing to build on. But both Softbank and the banks would be perfectly entitled to ask Neumann to dig deep to demonstrate confidence in his creation. He is no longer chief executive of WeWork but remains chairman, so is hardly disconnected from the revised corporate plan to slim down, slow expansion and demonstrate that there’s a solid business there. Ask Neumann for, say, $200m and see what he says. If he remains a true believer, he ought to jump at the chance to invest. If British industry didn’t have bad luck, it would have no luck at all. At least, that’s the way it sometimes seems after a string of collapses – or chastening near-death experiences – in recent years. There was the ignominious failure of Carillion and the descent into insolvency of British Steel, whose future remains uncertain despite ongoing rescue talks. The steady march towards a no-deal Brexit has sent a chill through the car industry, among others, while the decline of the high street continues apace. Restaurant chains have gone bust or shut outlets, while once-proud retail stalwarts such as Debenhams and House of Fraser are embroiled in existential crises. US children’s show host Mister Rogers famously said that when he saw scary incidents on television, his mother would comfort him by saying: “Look for the helpers, you will always find people who are helping.” And so to Thomas Cook and Wrightbus, the two most recent failures to stun the UK business community. Hays Travel, a successful, family-run enterprise rooted in its home town of Sunderland, came to the aid of 555 Thomas Cook high street shops, promising to save the jobs of up to 2,500 people. John and Irene Hays, the affable husband-and-wife team who run the business, have a big job ahead of them but their confidence and enthusiasm is infectious. Another ray of sunshine on the horizon emanates from the direction of Northern Ireland, where there is an agreement in principle to rescue bus manufacturer Wrightbus, the maker of London’s revived Routemaster. Last week a deal was struck to save the historic Harland & Wolff shipyard, which built the Titanic and HMS Belfast. What these dei ex machina prove is that, even in such febrile times, the UK business community is not short on verve, drive and imagination. That should be cause for a degree of optimism, however cautious."
"Is the throwaway era about to end? The past half century has given us toasters that are irreparable after a minor fault, T-shirts that quickly shrink or fade, and vacuum cleaners that need replacing after a few years. “Planned obsolescence” means old smartphones may perform worse after necessary updates, and products ranging from clothing to spectacles are regularly redesigned to encourage new purchases. However the Swedish government’s plan to reduce the rate of VAT levied on repair work from 25% to 12% is the latest sign that Europeans are beginning to question the “take, make and throw away” culture of consumerism that lies at the heart of industrialised economies. In France, planned obsolescence is now punishable by two years’ imprisonment with a fine of up to €300,000. Spain recently became the first country to set a target designed to increase reuse. Meanwhile Germany’s environment agency, the UBA, has commissioned research on the lifetime of electrical goods in order to develop strategies against obsolescence. These policies need to be understood in the context of European Union initiatives aimed at advancing sustainability, notably on waste and the “circular economy”, in which materials are kept in use for as long as possible and ultimately recycled. For instance the Waste Framework Directive, approved in 2013, requires each member state to produce a waste prevention programme. To its credit, the UK’s then-coalition government was the first to do so. The minister overseeing waste policy, Dan Rogerson, even proclaimed that “products should be designed … with longer lifetimes, repair and reuse in mind”.  A 2015 EU Action Plan added to the momentum, committing the European Commission to investigate the extent of planned obsolescence and take action where necessary.  And the EcoDesign Directive, which has primarily been used to address energy efficiency, is also to be applied to product lifetimes. The directive already requires vacuum cleaners sold in the EU from September 2017 to have motors designed to last at least 500 hours. Other products may soon be subject to similar requirements. Sweden’s VAT tweak is a small success for environmental campaigners, given the strong pressure on member states to have identical rates of VAT. But, sadly, it’s unlikely to increase repair work substantially. Research suggests that the tax reduction is unlikely to make a big enough difference to repair costs for people to change their behaviour, because social attitudes are so deeply embedded and, over time, the cost of replacing faulty goods has also become cheaper. But it is a welcome signal that governments are beginning to respond to recent lobbying by Brussels-based environmental NGOs. Further change may be on the horizon, notably access to service manuals with technical information on products that would help independent repairers and users. The European Union’s circular economy initiative is highly significant. That said, a sustainable economy will demand much more than increased recycling, or “closing the loop”, not least because the processes involved in collecting discarded products, disassembling them into constituent materials and manufacturing new items use energy – usually from fossil fuels. Moreover, recycling metals, plastics and textiles is often subject to technical limitations that threaten quality. In many cases, virgin material has to be added to the recycled material, making 100% recycling impossible. Real change will require increased product lifetimes so that less new stuff has to be manufactured. Repair and reuse are part of this. But it’s equally important that products are designed to last longer from the outset. This will requires profound cultural and systemic change, such that businesses are able to survive while selling fewer – but longer lasting – products and consumers choose to buy them and keep them. After all, no benefit is gained if products are designed for longevity and then discarded prematurely. The extent to which a post-Brexit Britain will align itself to these positive trends remains unclear. Does the British public want to be freed from European legislation in order that companies are able to supply consumers with cheap, shoddy items destined for short lifetimes? Or would it prefer the incentives increasingly being offered by European partners to end the throwaway culture and create a more sustainable economy? We shall have to see."

===================================
“Sounds crazy but it’s true. For all those who doubt climate change, a company called Propaganda has designed a bathtub plug in the form of an iceberg with a polar bear stranded on it. By using this plug, the perilous situation of our planet will finally be made clear, the product description promises. You can find the product description at Discovery 24 Shop, and is as follows:
‘Climate warming also in the bathtub
Melting polar caps, rising sea level, changed precipitation patterns, and increasing weather extremes – these are all consequences of global warming. And because there are people who still refuse to believe it, Chaiyut Plypetch, designer at PROPAGANDA, has found a clear symbol for climate change through a sole polar bear on an iceberg. At first glance, the bathtub plug with the polar bear may look cute, yet it communicates the seriousness of the situation in a simple and forceful way.

The bathtub plug from PROPAGANDA; Material: plastic; dimensions: approx. 7.5 cm high, approx. 7 cm diameter, chain approx. 53 cm long. Order No.: 5621208

€ 16,90 incl. VAT, s+h not included’
Thanks to Ms Renate Lüning for the tip.”
=============================
Nice to see that it’s made from that good old petroleum by-product we call plastic. I find the price of €16.90 a bit, well, capitalistic. Maybe the state will subsidize them.
I wonder if it’s flexible, as sitting down on the damn thing could really hurt. Or a person could trip over it.
Hey! Let’s send one to a warmist! (Yes, I know that sounds mean :).)

"Seagrass has been around since dinosaurs roamed the earth, it is responsible for keeping the world’s coastlines clean and healthy, and supports many different species of animal, including humans. And yet, it is often overlooked, regarded as merely an innocuous feature of the ocean. But the fact is that this plant is vital – and it is for that reason that the World Seagrass Association has issued a consensus statement, signed by 115 scientists from 25 countries, stating that these important ecosystems can no longer be ignored on the conservation agenda. Seagrass is part of a marginalised ecosystem that must be increasingly managed, protected and monitored – and needs urgent attention now. Seagrass meadows are of fundamental importance to human life. They exist on the coastal fringes of almost every continent on earth, where seagrass and its associated biodiversity supports fisheries’ productivity. These flowering plants are the powerhouses of the sea, creating life in otherwise unproductive muddy environments. The meadows they form stabilise sediments, filter vast quantities of nutrients and provide one of the planet’s most efficient oceanic stores of carbon. But the habitat seagrasses create is suffering due to the impact of humans: poor water quality, coastal development, boating and destructive fishing are all resulting in seagrass loss and degradation. This leads in turn to the loss of most of the fish and invertebrate populations that the meadows support. The green turtle, dugong and species of seahorse, for example, all rely on seagrass for food and shelter, and loss endangers their viability. The plants are important fish nurseries and key fishing grounds. Losing them puts the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people at risk too, and exposes them to increasing levels of poverty.  There is clear, extensive evidence of the rapid loss of seagrass. Growing historic, recent and current records show degradation and fragmentation of the plant around the world. In Biscayne Bay, Florida, for example, 2.6km² of seagrass disappeared between 1938 and 2009. Up to 38% of the seagrass in a lagoon in the south of France may have been lost since the 1920s. The nearshore waters of Singapore has lost some 45% over the past 50 years. Similar examples have been reported in Canada, the British Isles and the Caribbean too.  Even the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has suffered periods of widespread decline and loss of seagrass over the past decade, particularly along its central and southern developed coasts; a consequence of multiple years of above average rainfall, poor water quality, and climate-related impacts followed by extreme weather events. The most recent published monitoring surveys show that the majority of inshore seagrass meadows across the reef – which cover some 3,063 km² – remain in a vulnerable state, with weak resistance, low abundance and a low capacity to recover. As the human population grows and the world economy expands, there will be increasing pressure on our coastal zone. And it must be ensured that this doesn’t negatively influence seagrass meadows. It is already recognised that poor water quality, specifically elevated nutrients, is the biggest threat to seagrasses; these problems are particularly acute in many developing nations with rapidly growing economies, such as Indonesia, where municipal infrastructure is often limited and environmental legislation is largely weak.  Coastal development is a competition for finite space: boating, tourism, aquaculture, ports, energy projects and housing are all placing pressures on seagrass survival. These threats exist with a backdrop of the impacts of environmental change and sea level rise too. Humans must reduce their local-scale impact on seagrass so that it can remain resilient to longer term environmental stressors. There can be a bright future for this oceanic plant, however. Across the world, communities, NGOs and governments are beginning to embrace the monitoring of meadows. As knowledge of the plants’ ecology improves, conservationists are learning more about how to successfully restore seagrass meadows: Tampa Bay in Florida and Virginia’s bays, for example, have seen genuine large scale recovery. We also now have greater appreciation for the value of seagrass in the global carbon cycle, and governments are more willing to include its conservation in ways to mitigate carbon emissions. Though commendable, these are just the first steps on a course of targeted strategic action. As the WSA statement calls, seagrass meadows must be put at the forefront of marine conservation today. We need to increase its resilience by improving coastal water quality, prevent damage from destructive fishing practices and boating, include seagrasses in Marine Protected Areas and ensure that fisheries aren’t over exploited. Seagrasses also need to be managed effectively during coastal developments, and steps taken to ensure recovery and restoration in areas where losses have occurred. The scientific community must be more united, not only in its work, but in engaging more actively with the general public, coastal managers and conservation agencies too. Seagrass ecosystems must fully pervade policy around the globe too, as well as the consciousness of our global coastal communities. For the sake of future generations we need to work together to ensure the survival of the world’s seagrass meadows now."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman daily Bild here reports on a study commissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Office. The study, which projects what Hamburg’s climate will be like in 2050, was carried out by the University of Hanover and a company named Geo-Net.
To say the least, the study appears to be another example of customized science for pay. The study’s conclusion Bild writes (like we’re really surprised):
The number of days with a maximum temperature of over 25°C increases: At the moment the number is 21 in the city centre, but in 2050 it will be up to 29!”
To me that sounds like a welcome improvement. Who wouldn’t mind a few extra warm days in cool, dreary Hamburg? And what’s the reason for the extra warm days? Climate change of course, the study says. But, surprisingly, it also cites the urban heat island effect as a reason.
Number of 30+°C days will almost double
Of course, every environmental study needs something dramatic with which to scare public. Bild adds:
There are also going to be more heatwave days with temperatures over 30°C: In the city there are now 6 per year. In 2050 that figure will be 11!’Because of climate change, the figures will almost double,’ the scientists say.”
Now there are a few things about the number that seem peculiar. Firstly, today 21 days are over 25°C – of which 6 are above 30°C (29%). But in 2050 the numbers change to 29 over 25°C, of which 11 will be over 30°C (38%). Or, in other words, of the 8 extra days over 25°C, 5 will be over 30°C. If one imagines a Gaussian distribution curve, the study’s mathematical claim is pure nonsense. Shifting the curve to the right will not create such a result.
The second point is: what trend are we seeing now? Are we really getting more and more hot days in Hamburg?
I went back into the records for the last 10 years and here’s what I found for the number of days over 30°C:

2003: 11
2004: 4
2005: 2
2006: 8
2007: 1
2008: 9
2009: 2
2010: 10
2011: 0
2012: 3
The first 5 years saw 26 days of 30+°C (average = 5.2 days). The second 5 years we saw 24 days (average = 4.8 days). Here we see that the last 10 years are below the average of 6 days per year that the study says is normal for Hamburg. Moreover, the last 5 years were less than the 5 years before, indicating heat days are likely declining, and not increasing.
Of course this is just a crude, first-check analysis, and a better, more scientific approach needs to be applied. But this simple preliminary check does raise red flags. There are no numbers that indicate heat days in Hamburg are increasing or going to increase. Granted I need a copy of the report to see how it reached its conclusion.
The increase appears to be purely in crystal ball models loaded with dubious warming assumptions. They do not even fit with normal data distributions one invariably sees in such datasets. And they appear not to agree with observations.
 

Gaussian distribution curve.
To the scientists at the U. of Hanover, you might want to go back and check your crystal balls again – compare them to real observations. And your client, the Hamburg Environmental Office, and taxpayers, may want their money back for what appears to be worthless fortune telling.
We’ll be keeping an eye on Hamburg over the years ahead.
