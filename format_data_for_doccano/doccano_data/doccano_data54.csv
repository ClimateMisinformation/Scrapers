"Last week, authorities in Sweden took an unusual step. They issued an appeal for international aid to help them tackle an epidemic of wildfires that has spread across the nation over the past few days. After months without rain, followed by weeks of soaring temperatures, the nation’s forests had become tinderboxes.  The result was inevitable. Wildfires broke out and, by the end of last week, more than 50 forest blazes – a dozen inside the Arctic circle – had spread across Sweden. A nation famous for its cold and snow found itself unable to cope with the conflagrations taking place within its border and so made its appeal for international help, a request that has already been answered by Norway and Italy who have both sent airborne firefighting teams to help battle Sweden’s blazes. Nor is the nation’s fiery fate particularly unusual at present. Across much of the northern hemisphere, intense and prolonged heatwaves have triggered disruption and devastation as North America, the Arctic, northern Europe and Africa have sweltered in record-breaking temperatures. In Africa, a weather station at Ouargla, Algeria, in the Sahara desert, recorded a temperature of 51.3C, the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Africa. In Japan, where temperatures have reached more than 40C, people were last week urged to take precautions after the death toll reached 30 with thousands more having sought hospital treatment for heat-related conditions. And in California increased use of air conditioning units, switched on to counter the scorching conditions there, has led to power shortages. But perhaps the strangest impact of the intense heat has been felt in Canada. It too has been gripped by ferocious heat, with Toronto recording temperatures that have exceeded 30C on 18 days so far this year. This figure compares with only nine such days all last summer. Dozens have died in the withering heat – with startling and grim consequences. Montreal’s morgue has been swamped with the bodies of those who have died because of the heat, and many corpses have had to be stored elsewhere in the city. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu said it was first time the city’s morgue had been overwhelmed this way. Britain’s scorching weather – which has melted the roof of Glasgow’s Science Centre and parched the lawns of the nation’s historic homes – may have made regular UK headlines. However, it has been relatively mild in impact compared to those experienced in many other parts of the world. Far from being a parochial problem, the current heatwave is clearly an issue that affects vast stretches of our planet: a global concern not a local one. But why is so much of our world currently being afflicted with blisteringly hot weather? What is driving the wildfires, the soaring temperatures and those melting rooftops? These are tricky questions to answer, such is the complex nature of the planet’s weather systems. Most scientists point to a number of factors with global warming being the most obvious candidate. Others warn that it would be wrong to overstate its role in the current heatwaves, however. “Yes, it is hard not to believe that climate change has to be playing a part in what is going on round the globe at present,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University. “There have been some remarkable extremes recorded in the past few weeks, after all. However, we should take care about overstating climate change’s influence for it is equally clear there are also other influences at work.” One of those other factors is the jet stream – a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface that blow from west to east and which steer weather around the globe. Sometimes, when they are intense, they bring storms. On other occasions, when they are weak, they bring very calm and settled days. And that is what is occurring at present. “The jet stream we are currently experiencing is extremely weak and, as a result, areas of atmospheric high pressure are lingering for long periods over the same place,” added Mitchell. Other factors involved in creating the meteorological conditions that have brought such heat to the northern hemisphere include substantial changes to sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. “These are part of a phenomenon known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation,” said Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office. “In fact, the situation is very like the one we had in 1976, when we had similar ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and an unchanging jet stream that left great areas of high pressure over many areas for long periods,” said Scaife. “And of course, that year we had one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers in the UK in the 20th century.” However, there is one crucial difference between 1976 and today, added Professor Tim Osborn, director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. “The baseline on which these effects operated is very different today. Since 1976 we have had several decades of global warming – caused by rising carbon emissions – which has raised baseline global temperatures significantly.” As a result, any phenomenon such as the weakening of the jet stream is going to have a more pronounced effect than it did 40 years ago. And as global carbon emissions continue to rise and predictions suggest the world will be unable to hold global temperature rises this century to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, widespread heatwaves are very likely to get worse and become more frequent, scientists warn. Nor is the problem of increasingly severe heatwaves confined to the land. “We have marine heatwaves as well – all over the globe,” said Michael Burrows, of the Scottish Marine Institute, Oban. “For example, there was a major marine heatwave that struck the coast of Australia last year. It devastated vast swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. More to the point, marine heatwaves are also becoming more and more frequent and intense, like those on land, and that is something else that we should be very worried about.” Additional reporting: Ashifa Kassam, Toronto"
"Scott Pruitt, the hugely controversial administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has resigned. Donald Trump announced Pruitt’s departure on Twitter and said Pruitt had done an “outstanding job”. He further posted that Pruitt’s deputy Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator from Monday. ...on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright! Trump had repeatedly defended Pruitt following a multitude of ethics scandals. In his resignation letter, Pruitt struck an unapologetic tone. “It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role,” Pruitt wrote. “However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us.”  Pruitt also infused several references to God while lavishing praise on the president. “I believe you are serving as president today because of God’s providence,” he wrote. “I believe that same providence brought me into your service.” Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma, had come under increasing pressure over issues including the use of public funds for travel and office improvements; for using an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act to give pay raises to two aides; and for having paid $50 a night to rent a room in a Capitol Hill townhouse from the wife of an energy industry lobbyist. An EPA ethics official who initially said the condo deal was not inappropriate subsequently rowed back on that claim. In April, Reuters cited an anonymous Republican aide who said the condo deal was being examined by the House oversight committee. The Associated Press detailed extensive spending on a “a 20-member full-time security detail” for Pruitt. In recent weeks, the barrage of headlines over Pruitt’s alleged impropriety at the EPA escalated – prompting several staff members to resign. A whistleblower revealed earlier this week that Pruitt kept a secret calendar to hide meetings with industry representatives. Staffers reportedly met in Pruitt’s office to alter or remove records of the meetings. It also emerged that Pruitt asked staffers to use their personal credit cards for his hotel bookings. As of last month, Pruitt’s activities were the subject of at least 14 separate federal investigations. Trump nonetheless continued to defend Pruitt following his resignation, telling reporters aboard Air Force One: “Scott Pruitt did an outstanding job inside of the EPA.” “You know, obviously the controversies with Scott, but within the agency we were extremely happy,” he added. Trump also said there was “no final straw” leading up to Pruitt’s departures and that the embattled EPA chief offered his own resignation. “I think Scott felt that he was a distraction,” Trump said. “It was very much up to him.” Even some Republicans, who had grown tired of defending Pruitt’s daily controversies, celebrated the news of his departure. “Finally. Actually he did a horrible job,” Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican congressman from Florida, tweeted in response to Trump. “He was a disaster and an embarrassment from day one, and the country is far better off without him.” It was reported in April that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, had urged Pruitt’s firing but was rebuffed by the president.  Pruitt reportedly hoped to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general if that job became vacant.  He was an aggressive champion of Trump’s anti-regulation agenda, repealing a host of environmental protection measures, many implemented by the Obama administration. “You know, I just left coal and energy country,” Trump said after a recent trip to West Virginia. “They feel very strongly about Scott Pruitt. And they love Scott Pruitt.” Speaking to the Guardian before Pruitt resigned, a senior EPA official who asked not to be named said of agency management: “People are so done with these folks. We wanted and waited for some adults to show up. But the relentless tide of bullshit from Pruitt and his cronies is tough to deal with.” Janet McCabe, a former EPA assistant administrator, said: “I think morale at the EPA is at a very low ebb. The bigger concern is the environmental mission of the agency. Substantively, what has happened in the last year is a big a threat as the agency has ever faced.” "
"In March this year I started to care about the planet. Like, in a big way. Before that, I fretted about it and treated it like an extremely beautiful but very sick creature I was afraid to get too attached to. If you want to know how my change of heart started, I’ll tell you the same thing I told the poor old Texan man sitting beside me on a flight out of JFK. “I’m going for a chemistry test with the first woman president of Ireland so I could potentially be her co-host for this climate justice podcast she’s about to make.” He stayed quiet after that. The following morning, jet-lagged and disoriented on a winding London street, I couldn’t find the restaurant where I was supposed to meet Mary Robinson. When I eventually did find it, I couldn’t find the door, so her first impression of me was of a tardy wild-eyed woman knocking on a window mouthing “so sorry” and “just an omelette please”. My first impression of her was way back when I was eight years old, and she became the president of Ireland. Back then, she came across as powerful and good and clever, certainly not someone to mess with. Those were the instincts of a child and three decades later I’m glad to have been proven correct. After the Irish presidency Mary Robinson became the UN high commissioner for human rights, and it was during this time she began to see the link between climate change and human rights. She focused in on this and 15 years ago set up the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice. Climate justice means a people-centered solution to climate change. It pushes for restorative justice and recognizes the integrity of the planet and every creature on it. And I’ve come to understand that climate justice is a way out of the capitalist and paternalist way of living that’s gotten us into this climate change mess in the first place. I’m a comedian and a podcaster, as I explained to the Texan on the airplane who was now pretending to be asleep. My job as co-host, should I get it, would be to help navigate the world of podcasting and, I whispered as I patted his hand, I’d add in my own sense of curiosity and hopefully some levity too.  The following morning, after hurriedly eating my omelette, we headed to a studio where we had some classic podcast banter, which went as follows: Me: “On you and your husband’s first date, who paid for dinner?” Mary, narrowing her eyes: “This is a little frivolous. Shall we begin the divestment discussion?”  That’s how it started; that’s how I learned more about climate justice in the past six months than in the whole rest of my life. I count myself lucky, because climate justice is fascinating, uplifting, and intersectional in a way that’s still too large for me to comprehend but could change the course of the world.  Over the course of five months, Mary and I spoke to and heard from amazing women all over the world. There are scientists in Africa, farmers in Asia, politicians in Brussels, and indigenous community leaders in America, all working to solve climate problems every single day. People I didn’t realize were helping turn out to be the heroes of this story – like lawyers and children and midwives. People like Tara Houska, an attorney who advocates on behalf of tribal nations at the local and federal levels, who spent six months on the frontlines in North Dakota fighting the Dakota Access pipeline.  She is also heavily engaged in the movement to defund fossil fuels, and she travels the world challenging major banks and institutions about this. I got so fired up after listening to that I called my bank to see what they were doing with my savings: $3,200 at the time (less now that I had to buy a new sofa). Turns out I needed to move it (my money, not my sofa) because Chase Bank is … not a good choice if you care about divestment from fossil fuels. Two youngsters stick in my mind, Victoria Barrett and Ridhima Pandey. They are just a couple out of dozens of kids worldwide using the law to force their governments to take climate change more seriously. Victoria is a 19-year-old New Yorker. Her school was flooded by Superstorm Sandy and she’s a plaintiff in a groundbreaking constitutional climate lawsuit against the US government, arguing the administration’s climate-changing actions violate young people’s constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. The trial starts in October. Ridhima, from Uttarakhand, India, filed a petition against her government in 2017 when she was just nine years old. She argued that the Indian government had failed to fulfill its duties to her and the Indian people to protect them from climate impacts – a hearing on the case is expected soon. When I was nine, all I wanted was one of those pens with lots of different colors to click between.  While all of us have contributed to climate change to some extent, its results are not gender neutral I also learned that while all of us have contributed to climate change to some extent, its results are not gender neutral. It affects women first and worst: women are more likely to die in a climate disaster, and day to day they are the ones cooking on solid fuel stoves that can ultimately poison them. Climate justice offers a feminist solution, one that sees women as equally valuable as men. I learned too that the countries that do the worst damage to the planet don’t actually feel its effects, at least not fully and not yet.  Which brings me to what I unlearned. I’m sorry to say that in the past I’ve seen people in countries and communities hit worst by climate change as unfortunate victims, and failed to see that precisely because of this suffering, they are often the ones leading the fight against it. Climate justice heroes come from Bangladesh, Rwanda and Puerto Rico, to name a few, and also from indigenous communities worldwide. It took repeated conversations and actual listening on my part to break down my colonial mindset, my internalized “the west knows best” attitude, one I wasn’t aware I had.  Within the US, people of color and poor people breathe dirtier air than whiter, wealthier people. In LA, you’re almost twice as likely to die in a heatwave if you’re black, because of the urban heat island effect and less access to air conditioning and cars than other Angelenos. Isn’t that just disgusting? But again, leadership is coming from within the communities at risk. We had a conversation with Sarra Tekola. She’s a climate justice and Black Lives Matter activist working on a PhD in climate science in Seattle. It was thrilling to sit in a studio and be part of a discussion between Mary, someone accustomed to and comfortable moving through the halls of power, and Sarra, someone who is 40 years younger and usually found protesting outside those very halls.  As you would expect, there was more in common than not, and what I found moving was the women’s shared sense of urgency and fighting spirit, and the unspoken kinship that comes with it. Anyone can be a part of this, you just have to join in. Until now, I’ve felt a pervasive sense of doom that’s kept me stuck when it comes to climate change. But today, there are new elements I’ve learned about that bolster me and give me hope: namely the ethics, the politics and the spiritual dimension in our relationship to the planet and the people who live on it.

"Nestled beneath the imposing white peaks of two glaciers in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca, the aquamarine Lake Palcacocha is as calm as a millpond. But despite its placid appearance it has become a deadly threat to tens of thousands people living beneath it as a result of global warming. A handful of residents of Huaraz, the city below the lake, can recall its destructive power. In 1941 a chunk of ice broke away from the glacier in an earthquake, tumbling into the lake. The impact caused a flood wave which sent an avalanche of mud and boulders cascading down the mountain, killing about 1,800 people when it reached the city. Today the lake is even more potentially dangerous, swollen with glacial meltwater like an almost-overflowing bathtub. A temperature rise of 0.5-0.8C between the 1970s and the 2000s has seen a third of Peru’s ice caps vanish in the last four decades.  The city’s population has grown too. With more than 150,000 inhabitants, today Huaraz is about 15 times larger than it was during the last deadly landslide.  Flood wave modelling by the University of Texas shows how a breakaway chunk of glacier could displace up to 15bn litres of meltwater from the 70-metre deep, mile long (1.7km) lake, propelling a wave of up to 30 metres over a ridge of rocks and down the mountain.  “There are around 50,000 people living in the danger zone,” says Noah Walker-Crawford, a social anthropologist from Manchester University. “According to the authorities’ estimates, even if you were able to warn the people, there could still be about 20,000 fatalities,” he adds. The people would have 30 minutes to evacuate, says Cesar Florez, a risk management specialist for the region’s government and the man ultimately responsible for the people’s safety.  “It’s more than enough time,” Florez says. “It’s the same time allotted to evacuate coastal areas in the case of tsunami,” he tells the Guardian, adding the escape time could be lengthened by a series of energy dissipators and dykes.  So far, however, none of that flood mitigation infrastructure is in place. For now, 10 black tubes pump out water to reduce the lake’s level. Perched on a bluff facing the lake, Calef de la Cruz radios in a status report to the regional government every two hours.  Living in a hut for up to a fortnight at a time, it is a lonely and sleepless vigil. But until an early warning system is installed, which authorities say will happen later this year, the watchfulness of De la Cruz and his colleagues is all that stands between the lake and the residents below. But for the poor, largely indigenous farmers in the verdant mountains around the ice caps, the problem is not too much water but too little. The Andean country is home to 70% of the world’s tropical glaciers and as they gradually ebb away, a water crisis looms. Climate change has made the weather unpredictable and the unseasonal melting of the glaciers has thrown the farmers’ existence into jeopardy. Alejandro Rosales is a 62-year-old farmer from Yarush, a tiny hamlet above Huaraz. For him, like many residents of the mountains, the snow-capped peaks are apus – beings of mythic or semi-divine importance. He never thought he would see the white peaks he gazed at as a child turn black, he says. “Sometimes there are years when you get a good harvest; there are also years when the harvest fails. That means the children go to school without their daily bread. It’s really hard,” he adds, showing the Guardian blackened potatoes which crumble in his hands. The potatoes, which were stored months earlier to sow later this year, are riddled with moth caterpillars. The warming has meant new pests are creeping to higher altitudes where the colder weather once held them at bay. Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide whose home in Nueva Florida is in Lake Palcacocha’s flood path, has filed a lawsuit against the German electro-domestic firm RWE for its role in causing global warming, as one of the world’s top emitters of carbon dioxide. “The glacier is a source of water for those in the countryside and for us all in the city, so you can imagine what the future will be like if we don’t have it,” he says.  “From the risk problem to the water scarcity problem; all of this is what inspired me to file a lawsuit,” he adds. Lliuya’s 2015 demand for damages from RWE has been admitted on appeal by a higher regional court in the German city of Hamm. Lliuya is seeking compensation of about $20,000 (£15,000) from the energy giant to help install the lake’s safety measures, as well as the reimbursement of €6,384 he has spent on flood protection. It is a tiny amount for the company, he admits but adds: “What we are saying is this is happening and it’s putting us at risk. The damage caused is irreversible; for that no amount of money is enough.”          "
"Marc Morano is the real-world fossil fuel industry version of Nick Naylor. His career began working for Rush Limbaugh, followed by a job at Cybercast News Service where he launched the ‘Swift Boat’ attacks on 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. In 2006, Morano became the director of communications for Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who is perhaps best known for throwing a snowball on the Senate floor and calling human-caused global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” Thus it’s unsurprising that in 2009, Morano began directing fossil fuel-funded think tanks designed to cast doubt on the reality of and dangers associated with human-caused global warming. As he admitted in Merchants of Doubt, Morano frequently embodies the strategy of climate denial known as ‘fake experts’:  Most recently, Morano created a short video that centers on three common climate myths and has garnered over 5m views on Facebook.  Morano begins his video by denying the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Consensus denial is one of the most popular climate myths, and was the subject of the most widely-shared climate story of 2016. Morano’s strategy is to critique two of the studies that found a 97% expert consensus. One, published in 2009 by Peter Doran and Maggie Zimmerman surveyed 3,146 Earth scientists, but fewer than 80 of the participants were actively publishing climate science research (and hence experts on the subject). Basically, the critique is that the study sample size was too small to make a conclusive determination about the level of expert consensus.  That’s a valid point, except this was just one among many such climate consensus studies. In fact, the authors of seven separate consensus studies using a variety of approaches (some with very large sample sizes) teamed up in 2016 to publish a paper concluding that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is between 90 and 100%. So, this critique is invalid when considering all the available consensus research. Morano also critiques the consensus study that my colleagues and I published in 2013. He does so simply by quoting economist Richard Tol saying our 97% figure “was pulled from thin air.” Tol argued that the methodology in our study was flawed, but when we applied his critiques in a follow-up paper published in 2014, we found that the consensus was still 97 ± 1%.  Moreover, Tol himself has said, “The consensus is of course in the high nineties” and “There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans. I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct.” In short, Morano’s only evidence to dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is to quote an economist who agrees the consensus is 90–100%, and that the experts are correct that humans are responsible for global warming. Next in the video, Morano claims that we’re not actually in the midst of the hottest period on record, and that ‘hottest year’ claims are “merely political statements” because for example, he claims, scientists can’t say with 100% certainty that 2016 was hotter than 2015 due to the margin of uncertainty in the data. This claim is similar to one made on Fox News that earned a ‘Pants on Fire’ rating from Politifact based on consultation with climate scientists. 2014 through 2017 are indeed the four hottest years on record, outside the range of uncertainty. Morano concludes the video by claiming “the most outrageous myth of all is that carbon dioxide is somehow the control knob of the climate.” Ironically, Nasa climate scientists published a paper in 2010 titled, “Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature.” Morano argues that the experts are wrong because there are hundreds of factors influencing Earth’s climate, and that carbon dioxide “is one of these factors that gets essentially drowned out, and you can’t distinguish its effect from natural variability.” That claim is entirely false, as elegantly illustrated in this graphic created by Bloomberg. Human-caused global warming now far outside the range of natural variability. In fact, we’re now warming global temperatures more than 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. And of course, climate scientists have observed human fingerprints all over climate change, most recently in the atmosphere. It would be absurd to take Marc Morano’s word over the evidence published in peer-reviewed studies by climate scientists at Nasa and other scientific institutions around the world. Lately, Facebook has struggled mightily in trying to figure out how to combat the epidemic of fake news propagated via its platform. Mark Zuckerberg made headlines last week when he defended fake news from Holocaust deniers, saying he didn’t “think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.” It’s virtually impossible to discern an individual’s intent, but if that person is spreading misinformation, intent is irrelevant. If Facebook wants to stop misinforming millions of its users, it needs to tackle the problem of fake news regardless of intent. So far, Facebook seems more concerned about the appearance of ‘bias’ than about making sure the content shared on its site is factually correct. Fortunately, the exposure to Morano’s misinformation video is not as bad as it seems at first blush. Although Facebook implies the video has been viewed over 5m times, a “view” is counted after just three seconds, and videos on the site play automatically.  Nevertheless, the video has been shared over 75,000 times, so it has certainly reached a wide audience. Facebook needs to come to terms with the fact that there is an objective reality. Even if Marc Morano sincerely believes humans aren’t causing global warming, that belief is false, and by continuing to host his myth-filled video, Facebook is misinforming tens of thousands, perhaps even millions of its users."
"The planet’s largest colony of king penguins has declined by nearly 90% in three decades, researchers have warned. The last time scientists set foot on France’s remote Île aux Cochons – roughly half way between the tip of Africa and Antarctica – the island was blanketed by 2m of the penguins, which stand about a metre tall.   But recent satellite images and photos taken from helicopters show the population has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science. Why the colony on Île aux Cochons has been so decimated remains a mystery. “It is completely unexpected, and particularly significant since this colony represented nearly one third of the king penguins in the world,” said lead author Henri Weimerskirch, an ecologist at the Centre for Biological Studies in Chize, France, who first set eyes on the colony in 1982. Climate change may play a role. In 1997, a particularly strong El Niño weather event warmed the southern Indian Ocean, temporarily pushing the fish and squid on which king penguins depend south, beyond their foraging range. “This resulted in population decline and poor breeding success for all the king penguin colonies in the region,” Weimerskirch said. El Niño events are cyclical events that occur every two to seven years, but they can be amplified by global warming, which itself produces many of the same results, albeit on a longer timescale.  Indeed, Weimerskirch and colleagues showed in an earlier study that climate change, on its current trajectory, will probably make the Crozet islands – the archipelago that contains Île aux Cochons – unviable for king penguins by mid-century. Migration is not an option because there are no other suitable islands within striking range. Other factors may be contributing to the decline of the Île aux Cochons colony, including overcrowding. “The larger the population, the fiercer the competition between individuals,” noted a statement from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, which funded the study. “The repercussions of lack of food are thus amplified and can trigger an unprecedented rapid and drastic drop in numbers.” But this so-called “density-dependent effect” can also be made worse by climate change, the study notes. Another possible culprit is avian cholera, which has affected seabirds on nearby Marion and Amsterdam Islands, including some king penguins. But until Weimerskirch and other researchers return to Île aux Cochons – hopefully, he said, in early 2019 – they won’t know for sure. It is also possible that invasive species such as rats, mice or cats, have found their way on to the island. The Red List of Threatened Species conservation status for king penguins is currently “least concern,” but the new data may prompt a reevaluation. King penguins are the second-largest penguin species after the Emperor. They do not make a nest, but rather lay one egg at a time and carry it around on their feet covered with a flap of abdominal skin, called a brood patch. Parents take turns incubating the egg, switching every couple of weeks over a two-month period."
"Last year was the fifth warmest on record for the UK, showing a clear warming trend above the long-term average, despite a wet summer last year and cold winter. The average temperature over the past decade, since 2008, was 0.8C above the 30 year average to 1990. Summers over that period have also been “notably wetter”, the Met Office said, in its fourth annual State of the UK Climate report on Tuesday. These figures do not take account of the recent heatwave and two-month dry spell over much of the country, which have caused wildfires and hazards across much of the country. Thunderstorms over the weekend and heavy rain have brought a temporary halt to the run of hot dry weather since the end of May, but temperatures are set to rise again later this week. Mark McCarthy, manager of the Met Office’s national climate information centre, said the analysis confirmed that the UK’s climate was heating up. “Our climate is changing, globally and here in the UK,” he said. “People might not recall 2017 as having been a particularly warm year, with its relatively wet summer and snowfall in December. Despite this, when looking at the longer-term perspective, last year was still more than 1C above the 1961-1990 baseline.” The second half of 2017 was closer to the long-term average in temperature, but warm weather from February to June, and in the month of October, pushed last year up the temperature rankings. UK land temperature record dates back reliably to 1910. Coastal water temperatures, for which a series exists since 1870, were also the fifth warmest on record, while sea levels have risen by 16cm since the start of the last century. Compared with the long-term average, the last decade has seen 8% more rainfall and 6% more sunshine, but summers have changed particularly, with a 20% increase in rainfall compared to 1961 to 1990. Mary Creagh, chair of parliament’s environmental audit committee, which recently warned of the need to adapt the UK’s infrastructure to a changing climate, called the report a “timely reminder”, along with this summer’s heatwave, of the pressure that the country will come under from warmer and wetter summers in future. “We must do everything we can to protect our iconic landscapes and native plants and animals from the stresses of climate change,” she told the Guardian. “Climate change is real [and] will have profound impacts on everyone. We need to take steps now to help our children cope with the extreme changes and challenges that lie ahead.” Campaigners warned that the changing climate was owing to man-made influences. “Our climate is changing before our very eyes,” said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “From droughts to wildfires, the consequences are extremely real. But while the planet heats, government action has cooled.” She called on the government to heed advice from the Committee on Climate Change, which has called for an accelerated transition to electric vehicles and a renewed focus on renewable energy. “The government must make cutting [greenhouse gas emissions] a top priority, and do far more to help take the heat off our planet,” she said. Nine of the UK’s 10 warmest years on record have been since 2002, and the top ten have all occurred since 1990. The longest weather record for the UK, the central England temperature series, which goes back to 1659, shows that the present century has so far been warmer than the previous three. The nationwide figures from the Met Office also conceal important differences among the UK’s regions. Much of highland Scotland and lowland England were drier than usual last year, while Wales, the north-west and parts of south-west and north-east Scotland were wetter. Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser for climate change at WWF, the conservation charity, said: “Climate change is not just a problem for others – this report shows that it affects us here in the UK. We’re in the age of consequences – extreme weather such as we’ve experienced this summer threatens our health, our water supplies, and our natural world. These extreme events will become normal if we don’t heed these warnings and act with urgency. The government needs to work harder to cut our carbon emissions and build a cleaner, greener economy.”"

"Environmental campaigners have lost their high court challenge against the government over its policy for tackling climate change. The charity Plan B Earth brought legal action against the government’s stance on the 2050 carbon target, set out under the Climate Change Act 2008.  The charity and 11 UK citizens aged nine to 79 – including the publisher Dame Carmen Callil – wanted to bring a judicial review against the business secretary, Greg Clark. But Mr Justice Supperstone rejected Plan B Earth’s case on Friday, saying it was “unarguable”. Lawyers for the charity previously argued the government should have, in light of the current scientific consensus, gone further than its original target of reducing carbon levels by 2050 to 80% of that present in 1990. They said the decision not to amend the 2050 target put the UK in breach of its international obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change and was influenced by the government’s belief that a “more ambitious target was not feasible”. At a hearing on 4 July, Jonathan Crow QC told the court: “The secretary of state’s belief that he needs to have regard to what is feasible, rather than what is necessary, betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the scheme of the 2008 act and must be quashed. “All of the individual claimants are deeply concerned about climate change.” The barrister argued the business secretary’s “continuing refusal” to amend the 2050 target means the UK is playing “Russian roulette with two bullets, instead of one”. But, refusing permission for a full hearing, Mr Justice Supperstone said Plan B Earth’s arguments were based on an “incorrect interpretation” of the Paris agreement. He said: “In my view the secretary of state was plainly entitled ... to refuse to change the 2050 target at the present time. “I do not consider it arguable that the secretary of state’s refusal to amend the 2050 target is an unlawful exercise of his discretion.” Tim Crosland, director of Plan B Earth, said the charity was “surprised and disappointed” by the ruling and plans to appeal. He said: “We consider it clear and widely accepted that the current carbon target is not compatible with the Paris agreement. “Neither the government nor the committee on climate change suggested during our correspondence with them prior to the claim that the target was compatible. “Indeed, it was only in January of this year that the committee published a report accepting that the Paris agreement was ‘likely to require’ a more ambitious 2050 target. “Moreover the government acknowledged in these proceedings that it was uncontroversial that the 2050 target was insufficient to meet the 1.5C target, one of the key aspects of the Paris commitment. “In these circumstances, Plan B and the other 11 claimants continue to consider that a full hearing on an issue of such urgent and vital importance is necessary. “As with other legal campaigns confronting powerful vested interests it takes time to break through, and time is not on our side. “We’ll be doing everything possible to accelerate the process. Wildfires raging in the Arctic Circle must surely be a wake-up call.” "
"Inside a Kansas greenhouse, a buzzing horde of flies set about laying waste to 20,000 seedlings. But as researchers watched, there was one species of growth that remained untouched – an ancient Syrian grass known as Aegilops tauschii. Now those Syrian seeds, once stored in a vault outside of Aleppo, could end up saving US wheat from the menaces of climate change. From 2000 to 2015, average temperatures in the US midwest rose from 1 to 2 degrees fahrenheit above the 20th-century average. Periods of time between rainfalls are lengthening, according to a 2016 assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency. In other words, conditions in some areas of the midwest are starting to resemble conditions in the Middle East.  Rising temperatures are already leading to drops in midwestern crop yields, and threaten further reductions of as much as 4% per year. In the heart of US cereal and grain country, new pests and diseases are following the hot and dry conditions northward – and frequently overwhelming the ability of agricultural chemicals to battle them off. In response, scientists are seeking sources of natural resistance – and finding them in Syria, in the heart of the Fertile Crescent, the birthplace of domesticated agriculture. One of the world’s most important seed banks used to be located about 25 miles west of Aleppo in the town of Tal Hadya, and was run by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda). That UN-affiliated centre specialises in preserving and researching seeds in hot, dry areas – conditions now being faced by many of the Earth’s food-growing regions. It’s also the place of origin of today’s domesticated wheat, and the seeds that were stored there benefit from genes embedded with survival strategies evolved over thousands of years. Now diseases and pests such as the Hessian fly, long familiar to Middle and Near Eastern farmers, are moving north from the southern US and Mexico and surging across Kansas and surrounding states – Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska and in some instances up to Illinois and the Dakotas. Even as forces supporting the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, were bombing Aleppo in spring 2016, researchers at Kansas State University (KSU) were receiving increasingly urgent reports from US wheat farmers of devastating attacks by the Hessian fly, leading to an average 10% yield loss per year, according to the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Applied Wheat Genomics at KSU. That’s a significant bite out of the earnings of farms already operating on shaky margins. Ming-Shun Chen, a professor of molecular entomology at KSU, says the flies’ larvae used to be killed off by the cold of winter. But that cold is coming later in the season, and the larvae survive to turn into flies. Their devouring of wheat seems drawn from science fiction: the flies don’t have teeth, so they inject a protein-based substance into the plant that transforms it into a kind of nutritious slurry they can suck up and digest.  From November through April, Chen collaborated with the plant scientist Jesse Poland to run a sequence of experiments that unfolded in the university’s greenhouses with brutal Darwinian efficiency: they planted commercial US wheat seedlings from Kansas and surrounding states along with an assortment of wild wheat-related grasses obtained from the seed vault in Syria, as well as random other assorted plantings. The seedlings grew for two to three weeks, and then the flies were unleashed to attack. The results were clear: Syria’s Aegilops tauschii was the sole survivor. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com Wheat has the most complex genome of any of the world’s major crops, one of the reasons efforts to genetically engineer wheat traits have thus far not succeeded. It also means it has multiple genetic “wild relatives”. Over time the domesticated wheat, dependent on agrichemical boosters, lost resistance to diseases and pests. So breeders are reaching deep into the history of wheat to bring back some of those lost characteristics. “Wild relatives are by definition hardier. They’ve survived on the margins of our pampering,” says Maywa Montenegro, a PhD in environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, who has spent years studying wild relatives of crops. “On a farm, the farmer does everything to favour his crops: he pulls out competitor plants, weeds, gives water. But the wild relatives haven’t been getting assistance for thousands of years. They’re dealing with drought and flooding and salt.”  She said indigenous farmers have for millennia encouraged wild species to grow along the edges of their farms in order to encourage interbreeding between the wild and domesticated species to confer those strengths – a practice that has been long-neglected on massive industrial farms. The indomitable Aegilops tauschii grows wild in Syria in the hills surrounding Tal Hadya and Aleppo. Poland cites a litany of diseases to which the grass is resistant, with names like a lineup of underground rock bands: barley yellow dwarf, mosaic virus, wheat rust. It also shows resistance traits to more than half a dozen common insect pests, including the Hessian fly.  The tauschii and thousands of other seed varieties once stored at Icarda’s Tal Hadya seed bank have a dramatic recent history, intertwined with the Syrian civil war. The area around Aleppo was a rebel stronghold until 2016. The rebel commander in Tal Hadya, according to one of the veteran scientists who used to work at the Icarda facility, was himself a farmer and understood the importance of the seed bank. The scientists and the rebels struck a deal: the rebels protected the seed bank and, equally important, ensured that the generator kept running to keep the stored seeds cool – in return for the scientists providing the rebels with food grown from the centre’s experimental fields. That lasted until spring 2016, when Assad’s military started bombarding Aleppo and the surrounding towns, including Tal Hadya. The remaining scientists loaded up the seeds in a truck and raced across the Lebanese frontier. Other seeds emanating from Syria are helping farmers contend with climatic changes elsewhere in the midwest. In Illinois and the Dakotas, Syrian seeds seem to perform strongly when faced with the combination of increasing temperatures with brief but intense rainfalls, which leads to the spread of virulent fungus. Efforts are under way at the University of North Dakota, Bismarck, to introduce Syrian seeds into the breeding stock. Poland says the latest round of Hessian fly experiments, completed in early April, affirmed KSU’s plan to incorporate the tough survivors of the fly onslaught into the breeding of commercial American wheat varieties. After undergoing formal certification and government approval, the Aegilops tauschii will be dispersed to US breeders to make their way into the besieged fields of the midwest. The US has been losing diversity at an alarming rate during more than three decades of consolidation in the seed industry, and the steadily expanding size of farms. Diversity in seed varieties has dropped in almost every region of the country, most dramatically in the lower midwest. Globally, the UN has declared that three-quarters of all the world’s crop varieties that were around in the early 1900s had become extinct by 2015.  “You may be using wild crop relatives to boost industrial agriculture, while industrial agriculture itself is one of the greatest pressures on their existence,” says Montenegro. “They’re threatened from the usual pressures – pollution, land-cover changes – but also from turning diverse fields into monoculture plantations.”"
"Experts have criticised Morrisons’ decision to switch from plastic to paper bags for fruit and vegetables, branding it a retrograde step for efforts to tackle climate change. This week the supermarket ditched transparent plastic bags in favour of recyclable paper ones, in a move it said was prompted by customers’ worries over pollution. But the step is likely to have unintended consequences and trade one environmental challenge for another.  The Environment Agency found that paper carrier bags, across their lifecycle of production, use and disposal, had a greater global-warming impact than plastic ones. The agency’s study found paper ones were only better than plastic if they were used four or more times, but that was unlikely due to durability of paper bags. While the research was published seven years ago, the government’s top waste and recycling advisers, Wrap, said the findings were still relevant today. Chris Goodall, an author and environmental expert, said: “This is a retrograde step, moving back to paper.” He agreed the impact of plastic pollution on marine life was very serious, but said: “Most of the plastic in the sea comes from a small number of rivers, it does not come from me buying green beans in Morrisons.” Compared to using plastic bags for loose fruit and vegetable, paper bags were a backwards step in climate and energy use terms, Goodall said. One reason for the greater climate impact is that using paper will lessen the life expectancy of produce, he argued, leading to more food waste in landfill, where it generates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Why is plastic being demonised? Since the 1950s, 8.3bn tonnes of plastic has
been produced. Plastic is seen as a versatile,
indispensable product, but the environmental
impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now
so pervasive that recycling systems cannot
keep up and the leakage into the environment
is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will
outweigh fish. In 2017 scientists found
plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has
been found in the stomachs of sea creatures
in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic
waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into
the natural environment, where it is causing
huge damage to eco-systems on land and
sea, creating near permanent contamination.
According to academics in the United States,
by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since
the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12%
incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill
sites or the environment. Why are the supermarkets under fire? Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. Supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic. Who pays to clean up the waste? The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. UK producers and retailers pay among the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the “polluter” is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more. What can shoppers do to help? Supermarkets are under pressure, not least
from the prime minister, to create plastic-free
aisles. A growing number of zero-waste
shops are springing up and consumers are
being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic. Sandra Laville However, Friends of the Earth said that it welcomed Morrisons’ switch and that green issues other than climate change should be factored in. Julian Kirby, a campaigner at the group, said: “The thing about climate change is because it’s such a huge worry it has eclipsed other very serious environmental and health concerns, and that would include … pollution.  “With a paper bag, if it escapes into the environment it will biodegrade very soon. That is not the case with a plastic one.” The supermarket appeared aware of the trade-off, saying it had weighed the environmental impact of paper against the potential pollution from plastic. “We have listened to customers and they are telling us that the overuse of plastic is the most important environmental issue for us to deal with,” a spokesperson said."
"Temperature rises as a result of global warming could eventually be double what has been projected by climate models, according to an international team of researchers from 17 countries. Sea levels could also rise by six metres or more even if the world does meet the 2 degree target of the Paris accord.  The findings, published last week in Nature Geoscience, were based on observations of evidence from three warm periods in the past 3.5m years in which global temperatures were 0.5-2 degrees above the pre-industrial temperatures of the 19th century.  The researchers say they increase the urgency with which countries need to address their emissions.  The scientists used a range of measurements to piece together the impacts of past climatic changes to examine how a warmer earth would appear once the climate has stabilised. They found sustained warming of one to two degrees had been accompanied by substantial reductions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and sea level rises of at least six metres – several metres higher than what current climate models predict could occur by 2100. “During that time, the temperatures were much warmer than what our models are predicting and the sea levels were much higher,” said Katrin Meissner from the University of New South Wales’s Climate Change Research Centre and one of the study’s lead authors. She said the effects today would mean populous urban areas around the world and entire countries in the Pacific would be underwater. “Two degrees can seem very benign when you see it on paper but the consequences are quite bad and ecosystems change dramatically.” Meissner said potential changes even at two degrees of warming were underestimated in climate models that focused on the near term. “Climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100,” she said. “But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.” The researchers looked at three documented warm periods, the Holocene thermal maximum, which occurred 5,000 to 9,000 years ago, the last interglacial, which occurred 116,000 to 129,000 years ago, and the mid-Pliocene warm period, which occurred 3m to 3.3 m years ago. In the case of the first two periods examined, the climate changes were caused by changes in the earth’s orbit. The mid-Pliocene event was the result of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that were at similar levels to what they are today. In each case, the planet had warmed at a much slower rate than it is warming at today as a result of rising greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans.  “Observations of past warming periods suggest that a number of amplifying mechanisms, which are poorly represented in climate models, increase long-term warming beyond climate model projections,” Prof Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern, one of the study’s lead authors. “This suggests the carbon budget to avoid 2°C of global warming may be far smaller than estimated, leaving very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”"
"I don’t know anybody who remembers 10 August 2003 and its significance, although the date has never faded from my mind. That was Britain’s hottest ever day, the day the current British air temperature record was set: it leapt from the old record of 37.1C, set on 3 August 1990, to the new figure of 38.5C.  Those bare numbers may not mean much to you, though they may well appear more meaningful if you convert them to fahrenheit. For the old record was 98.8F,but the new one was 101.3F, and that meant that the 100F barrier had been broken in Britain for the first time ever. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that this was a hugely symbolic crossing of an environmental threshold; yet the population instantly forgot all about it. The current heatwave bids fair to be the longest period of sustained hot weather since the fabled summer of 1976. But will it actually be the hottest? Might we actually see a new British record air temperature? Local records are already being broken and there was a brief flurry of excitement 10 days ago when it appeared that the Scottish national record had been smashed with a temperature of 33.2C (91.7F) recorded in Motherwell, but now the Met Office has rejected the claim because a vehicle with its engine running was too close to the thermometer. It seems a new British record is certainly possible this summer that, if achieved, would give considerable force to the suggestion that the very high temperatures that have been in evidence all over the northern hemisphere this summer are at least partly the product of global warming, rather than just natural variation. For anyone interested in following and watching out for this, I have a suggestion: keep your eye on the fahrenheit as well as the celsius measurement it will mean more. I say this as a baby boomer who grew up with F rather than C; it was not until 1962 that the Met Office adopted celsius, and in my early childhood I acquired the instinctive feel that everybody then had (and people still have in the US), which told you that, in fahrenheit terms, 60 was pleasantly warm, and 70 was really lovely weather, and 80 was seriously hot, while 90 represented the sort of heatwave that was a major event. Anything approaching 90 would result in front-page headlines in the Daily Express proclaiming: “88 … 89 … 90! Phew! What a scorcher!” That was the point about the 100 figure. It was off the map. It had never been recorded in meteorological history, in the daily temperature records that go back to 1772. But it had no place in cultural history either. There was no reference point for it: no stories, no memories, no jokes, no newspaper headlines. In our native land of showers and cool summers, 100 degrees fahrenheit represented an unknown country. The round number certainly helped. In celsius terms, 100F is 37.8C, and of course 37.8C as such isn’t any sort of figure the mind will register, any sort of boldly marked frontier whose breaching will seem significant. But once you represent it in fahrenheit, the move up from two digits to three has a symbolical significance of real power. That’s what I thought, anyway, in the years I spent writing about climate change and being something of a temperature nerd, waiting for the 100 mark to be hit, for “the ton to be up”. When the 100F threshold is broken, I thought, everyone will see at once that we are in new territory in terms of climate; everyone will perceive the reality of global warming, in an instinctive way. And in August 2003 the day finally came, and I remember vividly how hot it was; and the day went; and people carried on with their business just as before, and have forgotten it completely. Yet my own view is that we did indeed enter new territory that day; and if we have waited 15 years to get back there (and maybe we will wait still longer), it merely illustrates what we know, that climate change proceeds in a non-linear way, in irregular jumps rather than a smooth ascent. But watch out for it, this sweltering summer (probably in the first week of August); watch out for it on the old-fashioned fahrenheit scale as well as on the modern celsius. And if you see that the ton is up, and 100F is exceeded, be assured that even if a new outright temperature record is not set, the world is changing in the profoundest of ways. • Michael McCarthy is the author of The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy"

"Taking action on climate is about a lot more than our energy economy. Climate disruption is the leading threat to our built environment, an accelerant of armed conflict, and a leading cause of mass migration. Its effects intensify and prolong storms, droughts, wildfires, and floods — resulting in the US spending as much on disaster management in 2017 as in the three decades from 1980 to 2010.  Fiscal conservatism and national security require a smart, focused, effective solution that protects our economy and our values. Political division between the major parties in Washington has left the burden of achieving that solution largely on Democratic administrations using regulatory measures that — for all their smart design and ambition — cannot be transformational enough to carry us through to a livable future. Conservatives say the nation needs an insurance policy. Business leaders want to future-proof their operations and investments. Young people are demanding intervention on the scale of the Allies’ efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II.  The International Monetary Fund — whose mission is to ensure national dysfunction doesn’t undermine the solvency of public budgets and lead to failed states — warns that nations that depend heavily on publicly subsidized fossil fuels are endangering their future solvency by investing in a way that destroys future economic resilience. Resilience intelligence requires diversification and innovation on a massive scale.  The rapid expansion of green bonds is making clear the deep need for clean economy holdings among major banks and institutional investors. Climate-smart finance, still a new concept, is expected to be the standard for both public and private-sector actors at all levels within 10 to 20 years.  Republican former Secretaries of the Treasury James Baker and George Shultz have called for a carbon dividends strategy, because:  Unpaid-for pollution and climate disruption limit our personal freedom and then, by adding cost and risk to the whole economy, undermine our collective ability to defend our freedom and secure future prosperity. Even with record oil and gas production, the US still depends heavily on foreign regimes hostile to democracy that manipulate supply and undermine the efficiency of our everyday economy.  Energy freedom means reliable, everywhere-active low-cost clean energy, answering the call of expanded Main Street economic activity. Ask any small business owner if they would rather have higher or lower hidden business costs built into everything they buy from their suppliers. Of course, they would prefer lower hidden costs and risks, and for consumers to have more money in their pockets.  That is how carbon dividends work.  The result is a steady shift in new investment to practices that are more competitive on a level playing field. With the flow of dividend dollars through local economies, lawmakers can concretely leverage good policy to motivate new investment and job creation, without having to build “bridges to nowhere.” Banks will either lead or follow, but it is certain that when investment in local economies and energy innovation are both more efficient than they are now, finance at all levels will go to work on that trend. Trillions of dollars in subsidies for the old economy will be freed up to support expansion of the new economy. New opportunities for industrial production of clean energy devices, electric vehicle infrastructure, battery storage, smart grids and related services, will ensure under-served communities in both rural and urban areas will draw new investment and locally rooted job creation. There is no faster way to reduce emissions while driving investment into the creation of millions of new jobs. There is no more economically efficient way to ensure the 21st century energy innovation economy reaches major cities, heavy industry, and also “the last mile,” where conventional infrastructure has always been hardest to fund.  The shortest route to American energy freedom and climate solvency is through a clear-headed, high-efficiency carbon dividends strategy.  Joseph Robertson is Global Strategy Director for Citizens’ Climate Lobby, Founder and President of the Geoversiv Foundation, and lead strategist in the Resilience Intel initiative."
"Tony Abbott seems mired in the first stages of grief: denial and anger. This week we were treated to a former prime minister making a political comeback pitch that went like this: I had no idea what I was doing when I took the decision to sign Australia up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015, I have a lot of feelings and I don’t mind sharing them, be the wind beneath my wings.  Sadly for Abbott, this compelling pitch to the world at large did not stoke a revolution, just a couple of public smackdowns. The same sortie fell similarly flat during the last couple of sitting weeks in the parliament when the former prime minister tried and failed to blow up the national energy guarantee. Politics can be a singularly cruel business, so when Tuesday night’s treatise of denial to a group of climate sceptics in Melbourne didn’t quite land in the way Abbott might have hoped, the anger kicked in. Popping up on his favourite radio station 2GB the next day, Abbott was a-n-g-r-y. Angry with Malcolm Turnbull, who had “politically assassinated” a democratically elected prime minister (apparently overlooking the inconvenience of his own political assassination of a democratically elected opposition leader in 2009). Abbott told his interlocutor he didn’t really want to be out on this denial tour – playing these one-night-only ukulele gigs on Sky News at night and 2GB and the Australian – he wanted to be sorting out this fight internally, but he couldn’t because Turnbull had changed the dynamics in the Coalition party room in a way that limited internal political discussion. Incredibly moving, this oppression. Pass the tissues. Before Tuesday night and its aftermath, Abbott had performed his own forward sizzle by granting an exclusive interview with Simon Benson at the Australian. He wanted to know whether his Liberal party colleagues realised they had now washed up at the very same juncture they’d reached in 2009 “with Malcolm Turnbull trying to do a deal with the Labor party on emissions reduction”. Hint, hint, guys. Then he shared an insight that more than any other insight exemplifies the politics of Tony Abbott. Climate change, he contended, was not “a circle you can square with the Labor party … it is a fight that has to be won. There can be no consensus on climate change … you either win or lose … and at the moment we are losing”. This really is the most extraordinary thing to say. Just let it settle on you for a moment. There can be no middle ground, no pragmatic and sensible compromise in the national interest, no consensus, there is just total victory or total defeat. Apart from the small problem of the default disposition trapping the country in some medieval jousting session, as if the joust has some intrinsic value in and of itself, that it is some sort of heroic conquest – there’s the fact that Tony’s victory is Australia’s defeat. Let’s be clear. We are in the mess we are at the moment – higher power prices, rising emissions, a more unreliable electricity grid – largely because Abbott in 2013 prioritised a political jousting session with Labor on climate change over the national interest. A massive misjudgment was made. It was clear at the time, and it has only become clearer with the passage of time. But in Abbott’s head this cage fight – one dogged Forestville resident versus evidence-based policy (the former prime minister showed in technicolour how little he cares about policy detail on Tuesday night when he indicated he didn’t understand the Paris commitments he signed up to in 2015) – is more important than the practical consequences that flow from it. The mythic, the totemic, the symbolic, trumps the practical. Just let that settle on you for a moment or two, and think about how you might feel about your politics being a game of toy soldiers. Fortunately for Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg, the signs point to the Abbott sortie being contained: Don Quixote tilting at imagined wild-eyed, carbon-constraining leftists like the Business Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation. What isn’t contained is an internal push on coal that could easily blow up the national energy guarantee. At this stage of proceedings, we need to train our eyes on the Nationals. The national energy guarantee as a policy mechanism is supposed to be technology neutral. It will impose a reliability guarantee and an emissions reduction target on energy retailers, and that framework is then supposed to let the market determine the optimal energy mix to deliver reliable power with emissions trending downwards. Turnbull has made much in recent months of the virtues of technology neutrality (engineering and economics) as opposed to ideology determining what the various power sources should be. If this seemed all too good to be true, turns out it was. Some Nationals want a new taxpayer funded boondoggle for coal as the price for supporting the Neg. The ambit claim is either new power stations or retrofitting or both. This week I asked the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, what his party’s position on the Neg was, and whether the coal boondoggle was an official Nationals position or a position being championed by some Nationals, and by this I meant Nationals in Queensland. This was his answer: “I support a sound energy policy that can help to achieve reliable supply and affordable energy prices for all Australians, especially those in rural and regional Australia who the Nationals represent”. “Like other Nationals, I support the Neg and its purpose in bringing about consistency in the energy supply arrangements through a Coag process. All governments in Australia have a role to play in this process. “In relation to current issues being reported by the media on negotiations in the Liberal and Nationals federal government, these matters are still in consideration.” So, drum roll please, the official Nationals position articulated by the party leader is we support the Neg at a price still to be determined. This would be fine if settling the Neg was only up to the commonwealth. The fact of the matter is any state or territory can veto the policy, and some of the Labor states are already concerned that the emissions reduction target in the scheme is too low. What you do not want to say to those fretful states, if you are Frydenberg, is please sign off on this policy even though you think the emissions reduction target is too low ... and by the way, here’s my new coal boondoggle. Surprise! The other moving part that some of the states will have in the back of their mind when they meet Frydenberg in early August will be the results of the 28 July super Saturday byelections. If the Coalition performs well, taking either Braddon or Longman from Labor, then there will be a rush of collective blood about an early election, notwithstanding the fact Turnbull keeps insisting the government will not go to the polls until 2019. It’s possible that some states might be tempted to sit tight rather than be herded into a quickie agreement on a policy they have reservations about if they think we are five minutes away from going to the polls. Even if one of the states doesn’t kill the policy on the basis that technology neutrality and a Queensland inspired coal boondoggle are inherently contradictory propositions, then Labor federally might. The working assumption has been Labor is more likely than not to support the policy once it returns to the federal arena, with some caveats such as increasing the level of ambition with emissions reduction, in the event it wins the next federal election. I suspect this is still more likely than not, but I certainly don’t think it should be assumed that Labor will sign up on any terms. I’ve been saying for months Frydenberg settling this policy is a lot like scaling Everest without oxygen. So far, the energy minister has managed to haul himself to the south base camp at Nepal. He will back himself to get to the summit, but the toughest climb still looms."
"Hundreds of glaciers in Canada’s high Arctic are shrinking and many are at risk of disappearing completely, an unprecedented inventory of glaciers in the country’s northernmost island has revealed.  Using satellite imagery, researchers catalogued more than 1,700 glaciers in northern Ellesmere Island and traced how they had changed between 1999 and 2015.   The results offered a glimpse into how warming temperatures may be affecting ice in the region, from glaciers that sprawl across the land to the 200-metre thick ice shelves, said Adrienne White, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa. “It’s an area that’s very difficult to study,” said White. “Logistically it’s very hard to get to and even with satellite imagery – for the longest time Google Earth didn’t even have complete imagery – it was kind of the forgotten place.”  White’s study, published last month in the Journal of Glaciology, found that the glaciers had shrank by more than 1,700 sq km of over a 16-year period, representing a loss of about 6%.  A previous study of glaciers in the region – which used air photos and did not include ice shelves – showed a loss of 927 sq km between 1959 and 2000, hinting that the pace of loss may be increasing. Of the 1,773 glaciers tracked by White, 1,353 were found to have shrunk significantly. A handful had disappeared altogether: “What we found is a loss of three complete ice shelves,” she said. “In terms of glaciers that terminate on land, we’ve lost three small ice caps.”  None of the glaciers in the study showed any signs of growing.  The findings echo the changes White has observed during her years of visiting the island. “We see a lot more icebergs,” said White. “Where there was one continuous ice shelf, we now see individual icebergs broken up, we see a lot more crevasses.”  She attributed the findings to an increase in temperatures. Canada’s Arctic – one of the world’s most glaciated regions – is warming at one of the fastest rates of anywhere on Earth.  In northern Ellesmere Island, the annual average temperature in the region increased by 3.6C between 1948 and 2016.  In particular, “there seemed to be a shift in the mid-90s,” she said, describing it as a “sudden increase in warming,” that saw temperatures increase at about 0.78C per decade between 1995 and 2016. “These increases were greatest in autumn and winter,” she said. “So what you end up with is a lot more melt.”  While the most direct impact is rising sea levels, the melting ice also risks wiping out the region’s unique ecosystems, such as the freshwater lakes that form when the water flowing off a glacier is trapped by a floating ice shelf.  “When these glaciers break away, all of a sudden there’s nothing holding back these ecosystems that have been growing and developing for thousands of years,” said White. “And they’re gone before we even have the chance to study them.”  Extrapolating from research done on glaciers from a neighbouring island, White’s study suggested that many of the glaciers on northern Ellesmere Island may not be high enough to accumulate enough snow to counter the pace at which they are melting. “Without growth, that glacier is just in a state of loss,” she said. “It will disappear if climates don’t change.” "
"The Republic of Ireland will become the world’s first country to sell off its investments in fossil fuel companies, after a bill was passed with all-party support in the lower house of parliament. The state’s €8bn national investment fund will be required to sell all investments in coal, oil, gas and peat “as soon as is practicable”, which is expected to mean within five years. Norway’s huge $1tn sovereign wealth fund has only partially divested from fossil fuels, targeting some coal companies, and is still considering its oil and gas holdings.  The fossil fuel divestment movement has grown rapidly and trillions of dollars of investment funds have been divested, including large pension funds and insurers, cities such as New York, churches and universities.  Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong and economically risky. However, some critics argue say that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective.  The Irish fossil fuel divestment bill was passed in the lower house of parliament on Thursday and it is expected to pass rapidly through the upper house, meaning it could become law before the end of the year. The Irish state investment fund holds more than €300m in fossil fuel investments in 150 companies. “The [divestment] movement is highlighting the need to stop investing in the expansion of a global industry which must be brought into managed decline if catastrophic climate change is to be averted,” said Thomas Pringle, the independent member of parliament who introduced the bill. “Ireland by divesting is sending a clear message that the Irish public and the international community are ready to think and act beyond narrow short term vested interests.” Éamonn Meehan, executive director of international development charity Trócaire, said: “Today the Oireachtas [Irish parliament] has sent a powerful signal to the international community about the need to speed up the phase-out of fossil fuels.” Meehan said: “Just last month Ireland was ranked the second worst European country for climate action, so the passing of this bill is good news. But it has to mark a significant change of pace on the issue.” The bill defines a fossil fuel company as a company that derives 20% or more of its revenue from exploration, extraction or refinement of fossil fuels. The bill also allows investment in Irish fossil fuel companies if this funds their move away from fossil fuels. Gerry Liston at Global Legal Action Network, who drafted the bill, said: “Governments will not meet their obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change if they continue to financially sustain the fossil fuel industry. Countries the world over must now urgently follow Ireland’s lead and divest from fossil fuels.”"
"The warm temperatures that have scorched much of the US appear to be influencing Americans’ acceptance of climate science, with a new poll finding a record level of public confidence that the world is warming due to human activity. A long-running survey of American attitudes to climate change has found that 73% of people now think there is solid evidence of global warming. A further 60% believe that this warming is due, at least in some part, to human influences. Both of these findings are record highs in a twice-yearly survey that has been conducted by the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College since 2008. The latest poll was conducted during May, which was hotter than any May recorded in the contiguous US in 124 years of record keeping, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, eclipsing the 1930s during the Dust Bowl era.  “There’s lots of evidence that contemporary weather is a contributing factor to belief in climate change,” said Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “But there are other factors. People are telling us they are experiencing a climate that isn’t what they remember in the past and the evidence itself, such as declining polar ice, is having an effect. Americans are moving to a lot more confident space on this.” But there remains a yawning ideological divide when it comes to climate change in the US. The survey found that while 90% of Democrats accept there is solid evidence of climate change, only 50% of Republicans feel the same.  However, Borick said that messaging from those who deny or obfuscate climate science has shifted away from outright rejection of temperature data. While Donald Trump has previously called climate change “bullshit” and a Chinese-inspired hoax, he has rarely spoken of the issue while president apart from framing action to address it as economically costly.  “The talking points have turned more to the cost to mitigate climate change rather than deny its existence,” Borick said. “That said, if you want one factor that influences your view on climate change, it’s party affiliation. Age, race and gender don’t even come close.” The hot temperatures have persisted in much of the country since the May survey, with Los Angeles hitting a monthly overnight record of 79F (26.1C) on 7 July. Chino, near Los Angeles, saw a record temperature of 120F (48.9C), while Death Valley in California reached 125.6F (52C) on 8 July. About 80 million Americans have been placed under heat warnings in recent weeks, with cities such as Denver, Colorado and Cheyenne, Wyoming, both experiencing record temperatures.  The heat has been fierce on the US east coast and Canada, too. About 70 deaths have been blamed upon a punishing heatwave experienced in and around Montreal, with further deaths recorded in New York and Pennsylvania due to the high temperatures. A string of warm days in New York City helped trigger a return to smog-like conditions on 2 July, when the temperature in the city reached 95F (35C). Researchers who flew a light aircraft taking measurements over a hazy New York were astonished to find that the ozone concentration was 150 parts per billion. This far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s eight-hour average ozone health standard of 70 parts per billion. The high ozone readings have continued, with preliminary data for Tuesday showing 85 parts per billion in New York. Ground-level ozone is created when pollutants react to intense sunlight, potentially causing haze or smog. This can cause serious health problems and even death for people who are elderly, sick or who have respiratory conditions. “This is a disturbingly high level, we were very surprised at the results,” said Russell Dickerson, a professor at the University of Maryland’s department of atmospheric and oceanic science. “The sky was very gray. It reminded me of Beijing. It was like what New York used to be like, before it cleaned itself up.” Overall air quality in the US has improved markedly in recent decades following the introduction of federal clean air rules. Ozone levels have remained stubbornly high in New York, however. “We are trying to work out why this is but the recent high level could well be because of the hot, stagnant weather, with weak winds,” Dickerson said. “It’s a public health concern. I’d certainly advise people to stay indoors during the hottest part of the day.”"

"Ocean waters are rising because of global warming. They are rising for two reasons. First, and perhaps most obvious, ice is melting. There is a tremendous amount of ice locked away in Greenland, Antarctica, and in glaciers. As the world warms, that ice melts and the liquid water flows to the oceans.  The other reason why water is rising is that warmer water is less dense – it expands. This expansion causes the surface of the water to rise.  Rising oceans are a big deal. About 150 million people live within 1 meter (3 feet) of sea level. About 600 million live within 10 meters (33 feet) of sea level. As waters rise, these people will have to go somewhere. It is inevitable that climate refugees will have to move their homes and workplaces because of rising waters.  In some places, humans will be able to build sea walls to block off the water’s rise. But, in many places, that won’t be possible. For instance, Miami, Florida has a porous base rock that allows sea water to permeate through the soils. You cannot wall that off. In other places, any sea walls would be prohibitively expensive.  It isn’t just the inevitable march of sea level that is an issue. Rising waters make storm surges worse. A great example is Superstorm Sandy, which hit the US East Coast in 2012. It cost approximately $65 bn of damage. The cost was higher because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Climate scientists do their best to project how much and how fast oceans will rise in the future. These projections help city planners prepare future infrastructure. My estimation is that oceans will be approximately 1 meter higher in the year 2100; that is what our infrastructure should be prepared for. What I don’t know is how much this will cost us as a society. A very recent paper was published that looked into this issue. The authors analyzed the cost of sea level if we limit the Earth to 1.5°C or 2°C warming. They also considered the future cost using “business as usual” scenarios.  What the authors found was fascinating. If humans take action to limit warming to 1.5°C, they estimate sea level will rise 52 cm by the year 2100. If humans hold global warming to 2°C, sea levels will rise by perhaps 63 cm by 2100. The difference (11 cm) could cost $1.4 tn per year if no other societal adaptation is made. This is a staggering number and in itself, should motivate us to take action. But the authors went further, they considered an even higher future temperature scenario (one that is essentially business as usual). With that future, global annual flood costs would increase to a whopping $14 tn per year.  In the study, the authors considered which countries and regions would suffer most. It turns out upper middle income countries will be worse off, particularly China. Higher-income countries have a slightly better prognosis because of their present flood protection standards. But make no mistake about it, we will all suffer and the suffering will be very costly.  There are four important takeaways from this study. First, while the economic costs are large, there is some range of projections. The actual costs may be lower or higher than the median predicted in the study. This is largely due to the fact that we don’t know how fast Greenland and Antarctica will melt. If they melt faster than projected, things will be worse than what I’ve described here. Second, adaptation will help. By adaptation I mean making our societies less susceptible to sea level rise. For example, building sea walls when possible, building new infrastructure away from coasts, putting in natural breaks to limit storm surge during large storms, and making infrastructure more water-resistant. Third, what we do now matters. If we can get off the high-emissions business as usual scenarios – if we can increase investment in clean and renewable energy – we can reduce the future costs. Finally, while scientists often use 2100 as a benchmark year, it isn’t like oceans will stop rising then. In fact, we are committing ourselves to hundreds of years of rising oceans. The ocean has a lot of climate inertia. Once it starts rising, you cannot stop it. So, by focusing only on the year 2100, we are deluding ourselves into underestimating the long term costs.  This research shows it’s important to connect climate science with economic science. Too often, social scientists and economists with very little climate science understanding have tried to tell us that climate change is not a problem. Whenever you hear an economist or a social scientist give you a rosy future prediction, take it with a grain of salt. Their opinion is worthless without being backed by physical understanding. And the loudest economists and social scientists often have very little of this physical understanding."
"Scientists like me – and really, everyone – can learn from President Donald Trump’s mastery of viral messaging.  True, he has turned the United States into a pariah nation, one reviled for ripping immigrant children from their parents and from withdrawing from our only real chance at stabilizing the climate, the Paris Accord.   But Trump’s success at creating and maintaining a political base is not because of his incoherent policies. It is solely because he is able to communicate with people in ways that that evoke emotion, go viral, and make people think he understands them.  The way super-communicators like Jesus, Shakespeare, Oprah, or even Trump work their magic was unpacked by Dr. Joe Romm in a must-read book, How To Go Viral and Reach Millions. The job for scientists, for all of us, is to learn the techniques that make our messages clicky and sticky, but use the techniques in a way that keeps the science true and the facts straight. Be a Jedi, not a Sith Lord. Yet it’s more than just that. Many of us – scientists included – downplay the importance of catchy writing, memorable phrases, and captivating metaphors. Using purposefully compelling language is somehow ‘dirty.’ I am a scientist for crying out loud. Can’t I just stick to facts, show my graphs, and let the data speak? No, you can’t; not if you want anyone to hear you or listen to you. And if no one is listening to you, why are you here?  Let me be clear to my colleagues, all so-called pointed-headed, ivory-tower intellectuals who think they have something important to say. Listen up. Are you listening? There is nothing special about you and your message.  Audiences are fire-hosed with information from all sides. We have very little time to really dig deeply into issues. Communicators are competing with many other voices, and most more interesting than you. So, if you are not going to learn techniques to communicate quickly and compellingly, you might as well just stay home. So how does Dr. Romm’s book teach effective communication? I won’t spoil it too much – you need to read the book. But I will tell you that he has five basic rules that he leads with. I will also tell you that he teaches everything from word choice to how to recast your scientific stories in ways that connect with people emotionally. He tells the importance of long-successful tools such as repetition, use of irony, metaphor, and foreshadowing. But perhaps the most important chapter is the one devoted headlines. How the first few words a reader sees or hears are all-important in determining whether they will devote any mental energy to your message. Whether they will click on your headline, read any part of your article, keep the channel tuned to your station, or just tune out and turn off.  Throughout the book, Dr. Romm weaves in evolutionary biology, art, and history to reinforce his message. He discusses how the human brain evolved to be able to process huge amounts of data. The processing amounts to quickly assessing whether a situation warrants our attention; think of these as “mental shortcuts” that we use, subconsciously, to determine whether and how we digest a message. He shows how the world’s greatest artists and communicators have used the very same strategies throughout history to go viral, to get their message to spread and endure. In a nutshell, Dr. Romm teaches techniques to become a force of good in this world using time-tested techniques. We can be Luke Skywalker, not Darth Vader. I asked Dr. Romm why he wrote this book and he told me: I wrote this book because I have met so many frustrated scientists and environmentalists who want to get their message out, but don’t know how to be heard above the Niagara Falls of noise gushing from the internet and cable news. As an MIT-trained physicist who has been blogging for 12 years, I’ve learned a lot of the secrets of viral storytelling and messaging. But I’ve also had to unlearn a lot of things I was taught on the road to my Ph.D. So, I wrote this handbook for anyone who wants to learn the lessons from the world’s greatest viral communicators. The main message is that if you want to grab and keep people’s attention – if you want to be as clicky and sticky as possible – you need to create an emotionally compelling and memorable message using a few basic rules. And rule number one is to tell a story with the simple And-But-Therefore formula used by Hollywood screenwriters and viral superstars like Oprah.  And he is so right. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve listened to colleagues on radio, television, or in print media get into loooooonnnnnngggggg and boring descriptions about all the caveats and nuances of their studies. Even I get bored, and I am a nerd. Nothing makes me sleepier than a scientist launching into their science-speak descriptions of their work.  Get to the point already! Tell me why it matters, why do I care? Only then tell me about all your nuances and caveats. Joe Romm has solidified his place among master communicators. He is a teacher, a scholar, a storyteller; just damn good at what he is doing. If you want to become more like him, then read the book. And if you don’t care about being compelling, or you don’t think it is important, then sit down and shut up. Because your message doesn’t matter anyway. Other scientists agree with me. Dr. Michael Mann told me:  Climate change represents perhaps the greatest challenge we have ever faced as a civilization. But those seeking to communicate the scientific evidence have found themselves subject to concerted attacks by fossil fuel interests who find the implications of the science to be a threat to their bottom line.  Few have had both the courage to do battle with the forces of denial and the skill to communicate the science and its implications with clarity and vision. My friend Joe Romm is such an individual. Hear, hear, Mike Mann. I wholeheartedly agree."
"The water company ordering a hosepipe ban on 7m households in the north-west of England has the second-worst record for leaking pipes of any supplier, industry data shows. The temporary use ban being imposed by United Utilities from 5 August has led to calls for water firms to do more to tackle leakage on their networks. United Utilities is second only to Thames Water for the amount of water lost en route to households, at 133 litres per property per day, well above the sector’s average of 121 litres. The amount of water wasted through leaking pipes is almost identical to regional average daily use, which stands at 132 litres per customer. The company is also the industry’s third-worst performer on the other main measurement, cubic metres of water leaked per kilometre per day. Tony Juniper, the executive director for advocacy and campaigns at WWF-UK, said: “In the short-term one would hope the water companies, all of them, would be putting more effort into leakage reduction, the promotion of water efficient appliances from dishwashers to showers, and about communicating to consumers.” He added the hosepipe ban was “another reminder that on climate change we’ve entered the era of consequences”. United Utilities said it took water wastage seriously, and had 160 inspectors looking for leaks, as well as sniffer dogs and satellites. “Reducing leaks is a top priority. We have cut leakage by half since the 1990s and are working hard to do even more,” a spokesperson said. The company met its leakage targets for 2016-17. Around 2,900m litres a day, or 20% of all public water supply, is lost through leaks on suppliers’ networks. The government was recently told by its infrastructure advisers to set a target for firms to halve leakage by 2050. The National Infrastructure Commission pointed out that reductions had largely stalled over the past decade and households needed to be encouraged to conserve more. The average use per person nationally is 141 litres per day, down from 150 litres in 2000, but still well behind Europe’s best-performers, the Belgians and the Danes, who use about 115 litres per day. One of United Utilities’ customers, the fracking firm Cuadrilla, has said residents would not be left short at its Lancashire operations, at a site between Blackpool and Preston.  The water industry has warned shale firms they could face a shortage of water supplies in some areas. Cuadrilla said that fracking the two wells at Preston New Road, which is now expected to take place in late August or early September, would use up to 32,500 litres of water. A company spokesperson said: “It is highly unlikely that our operations would be affected by a water shortage, however estimates of predicted water demands have been supplied to United Utilities to allow them to assess their existing systems and any impacts on their wider network.” Reservoir levels in the north-west fell 10-15% in June. The region has been more seriously affected by the warm, dry weather than other parts of the country, which were cushioned by a wet spring."
"Those who debunk climate change misinformation often face a dilemma. We’re flooded with such a constant deluge of climate myths, where should we focus our efforts? Climate misinformation is propagated via congressional climate hearings, conservative media outlets, denial blogs, and even from some genuine climate alarmists.  Specifically, there has recently been a debate as to whether Skeptical Science – a website with a database of climate myths and scientific debunkings, to which I’m a primary contributor – would be more useful and effective if it called out misinformation from ‘alarmists,’ and if it eliminated or revised its Climate Misinformers page.  I describe the SkS lists as political because their 'misinformer' lists don't include those on the 'climate action' side who actively deny science & espouse conspiracy ideation eg. https://t.co/OTkhEiKmzv or who unjustifiably talk-up doomsday stories https://t.co/faGCDQCevx There is some validity to these critiques, and in response, Skeptical Science is renaming the page ‘Climate misinformation by source.’ But the site is run entirely by a team of international volunteers, and as such, opportunity costs must be considered. Time devoted to refuting alarmists is time not devoted to debunking the constant deluge of climate denial. Climate deniers are obviously incredibly influential. Despite their lack of supporting evidence or facts, not only do 28% of Americans continue to believe that global warming is natural and 14% that it’s not even happening, but deniers also dictate Republican Party policy. Republican policymakers constantly invite deniers to testify in congressional hearings, including many of those featured on the Skeptical Science misinformers page. There is no symmetry on the other side of the aisle. In those same congressional hearings, Democratic Party policymakers invite mainstream climate scientists to testify. Their party policy is based on the consensus of 97% of the climate science community.  Ultimately, the issue boils down to a warped ‘Overton Window’ – the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse. In the real world, we have climate deniers on one extreme, alarmists on the other, and mainstream climate science in the middle. But the public discourse is warped – we instead have a heavy focus on climate denial among conservative media outlets and policymakers, a heavy focus on mainstream climate science among reputable media outlets and liberal policymakers, and the alarmists are largely ignored. Michael Tobis nicely diagrammed this in the climate Overton Window: That being said, there are a few reasonably well-known individuals who could be accurately described as climate alarmists. The most prominent is Guy McPherson, who decided in 2002 that climate change would likely drive humans to extinction by 2030. Sixteen years later, we’re now more than halfway to 2030 and the global human population has grown from 6.3 bn to 7.6 bn. It’s quite safe to say we won’t go extinct in the next few decades. McPherson’s case basically boils down to arguing that feedbacks like large methane releases will soon kick in, causing a rapid spike in global warming that will lead to global extinctions. One of his primary pieces of supporting evidence is that Earth System Sensitivity – which describes how sensitive the climate is to the increased greenhouse effect over millennia – is higher than the shorter-term climate sensitivity. That was essentially the gist of a recent study profiled here in the Guardian. Over millennia, global temperatures and sea level rise will continue to rise beyond what climate models predict will happen over the next couple of centuries. But these are slow feedbacks, and as such won’t kick in within the next few decades. Scott Johnson did a very deep dive into McPherson’s flawed arguments, for those who want to learn about them in greater detail. As another example, Peter Wadhams predicted in 2012 that the Arctic would be ice-free in the summer by 2016. In fact, the summer of 2012 saw a dramatic decline in year-to-year Arctic sea ice extent (down to 3.6 million square km), which Wadhams believed would become the norm. That hasn’t yet been the case – there were 4.7 million square km of Arctic sea ice in the summer of 2016. It’s worth noting that Wadhams gets most of the climate science right. There is absolutely a long-term decline in Arctic sea ice, which is in the midst of what many have described as a ‘death spiral.’ And Arctic sea ice is thinning rapidly. The Arctic will eventually be ice-free in the summer, but not within the next few years. According to Met Office Chief Scientist Julia Slingo, 2025–2030 would be the earliest date for an ice-free Arctic summer, and 2040–2060 is more likely. Wadhams also believes that there may soon be a large methane release from the Arctic, but a review of the relevant research suggests this isn’t a near-term concern: There is no evidence that methane will run out of control and initiate any sudden, catastrophic effects. There’s certainly no runaway greenhouse. Instead, chronic methane releases will supplement the primary role of CO2.  Wadhams has received some mainstream media attention, including in the Guardian, but his more alarmist warnings are largely ignored. There certainly isn’t a powerful political party basing its climate policies on his inaccurate predictions.  And that’s really the key point. While there are people on ‘both sides’ who spread misinformation, there are far more on the denier than the alarmist side, who are generally far wronger, and the deniers also have a far greater influence over policymakers.  There’s certainly nothing wrong with debunking overly alarmist claims – in fact, it’s a worthwhile endeavor, and some groups like Climate Feedback do just that. But debunking uninfluential alarmism comes at a cost. It diverts resources away from addressing the never-ending flood of misinformation coming from climate deniers who currently control the climate policy platform of the party in charge of one of the most powerful countries on Earth."
"The UK is “woefully unprepared” for deadly heatwaves, according to a cross-party committee of MPs, with the government ignoring warnings from its official climate change adviser. One in five homes dangerously overheats during heatwaves today, the MPs found, while on the hottest day of 2016 alone there were almost 400 heat-related deaths. But climate change has doubled the risk of heatwaves and events even worse than the heat currently baking the nation could occur every other year by the 2040s, the MPs report said, with a tripling of heat deaths to 7,000 a year as a result. Buildings, particularly hospitals and care homes, must be prepared for heatwaves, the MPs said, with sick and elderly people especially vulnerable to heart and breathing problems. But currently the NHS is only required to prepare plans for severe cold weather and there are no building regulations to prevent overheating with ventilation and shading.  The MPs also called for other measures, including formal guidance from Public Health England to relax office dress codes and allow home working during heatwaves, and to head teachers about relaxing school uniform policy. The MPs said a public information campaign on the serious dangers of heatwaves was needed and health minister Steve Brine, giving evidence to the MPs in June, acknowledged this: “Heat alerts tend to be seen as barbecue alerts, as opposed to there being a risk.” Mary Creagh MP, chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “The government has sat on its hands, ignored the warnings of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and left the UK woefully unprepared.” As far back as 2003, a severe heatwave saw temperatures reach 38.5C and more than 2,000 heat-related deaths in 10 days, she said: “But the government has continued to allow homes, hospitals and schools to be built that are not resilient to heatwaves.” Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the CCC said: “We have recommended to government every year since 2014 that a new standard or regulation is needed to address the risk from overheating in new homes.” Ministers have rejected the advice, citing a commitment to “reduce net regulation on homebuilders”. The government published its updated National Adaptation Strategy on 19 July but Brown said it made no commitment to deal with the issue. “Action is needed now to redouble efforts to tackle overheating – one of the key risks facing the UK from climate change.” Heatwaves are known killers in the UK and the number of hot days is rising. “It is likely that more than 1,000 people have died in the UK as a result of the extended heatwave conditions this summer,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “There would justifiably be an outcry if more than 1,000 people had died in a flood.”  “The government’s apparent lack of concern about the growing risks of deadly heatwaves is absolutely woeful,” he said. “The lack of communication by government departments and agencies about the risks of heatwaves is contributing to the death toll every year.” The EAC report found that homes in densely populated urban areas, which can be 10C hotter than the countryside, are already at significant risk of overheating, as are certain other buildings, including houses built in the 1960s and 1970s. “The current lack of regulation to prevent overheating, means that new developments, including hospitals and care homes, which will be around for the next 70 years will add to the number of buildings that overheat,” it said. Excess deaths in nursing homes increased more than 40% in some parts of the UK during the 2003 heatwave, the MPs reported, but the homes are still not required to report their readiness to cope under NHS emergency preparedness rules. Heatwaves are also economically costly, the EAC reported, particularly due to lost working days as a result of transport problems. “Only 50% of the UK’s motorways and major roads are surfaced with material that is the most resilient to the kind of summer temperatures the UK is beginning to experience regularly,” the MPs said, while in June, railway tracks buckled in the heat and caused significant delays. Research cited in the report found that in 2010, 5m staff days were lost due to overheating above 26C, resulting in an economic loss of about £770m. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment."
"Imagine that instead of taxing cigarettes, America subsidized the tobacco industry in order to make each pack of smokes cheaper. A report from Oil Change International (OCI) investigated American energy industry subsidies and found that in 2015–2016, the federal government provided $14.7bn per year to the oil, gas, and coal industries, on top of $5.8bn of state-level incentives (globally, the figure is around $500bn). And the report only accounted for production subsidies, excluding consumption subsidies (support to consumers to lower the cost of fossil fuel use – another $14.5bn annually) as well as the costs of carbon and other fossil fuel pollutants.  At a time when we need to transition away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible, the federal and state governments are giving the industry tens of billions of dollars to make the production of their dirty, dangerous products more profitable. Crucially, the OCI report noted that if we want to meet the Paris target of limiting global warming to less than 2°C (and we do!), not only does the fossil fuel industry have to stop developing new reserves, but “some already-tapped reserves must be retired early.” This reality is incompatible with continued US government subsidization of fossil fuel industry production, including $2.5bn per year for the exploration of new fossil fuel resources ­– new resources that simply cannot be developed if we’re to meet the Paris climate target. To achieve that goal, we instead need to replace fossil fuels with clean energy as quickly as possible. And yet, OCI notes that permanent tax breaks to the US fossil fuel industry are more than seven times larger than those for renewable energy. Some of those fossil fuel subsidies have been around for over a century. And they’re making it profitable for the oil industry to extract resources that would otherwise be left in the ground: at current prices, the production of nearly half of all U.S. oil is not economically viable, except with federal and state subsidies. And as David Roberts notes, federal policy is also propping up the coal industry. Were they forced to meet modern pollution standards, 98% of currently operating coal power plants would be unprofitable compared to an equivalent natural gas plant. Coal power plants only stay open through regulations allowing pollution exemptions, and by forcing taxpayers to pick up the climate change bill. Without a price on carbon pollution, Americans are effectively subsidizing the fossil fuel industry for the costs incurred through its products’ climate change damages. For example, think about the added costs to taxpayers for worse wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, and flooding, all amplified by human-caused climate change. In the absence of a price on carbon pollution, the fossil fuel industry doesn’t pay a cent of those costs. Taxpayers pick up the whole tab. These costs can be estimated via the ‘social cost of carbon.’ It’s a difficult number to pin down, but even at the extremely conservative US federal estimate of $37 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution (some recent research pegs the value at more than five times higher), that’s about $200bn per year for America and $1.3tn globally. While direct government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry are expensive, they’re dwarfed by the costs incurred by failing to tax carbon pollution. The OCI report noted that the Obama administration actually proposed to eliminate 60% of federal fossil fuel industry subsidies, but that proposal went nowhere for one obvious reason: In the 2015-2016 election cycle oil, gas, and coal companies spent $354 million in campaign contributions and lobbying and received $29.4 billion in federal subsidies in total over those same years - an 8,200% return on investment. Of those fossil fuel industry contributions to political campaigns, 88% went to Republican politicians. As a result, 97% of House Republicans oppose taxing carbon pollution, and the Trump administration is looking into every possible scheme to further prop up the dying coal industry. The GOP might as well rebrand itself as the Grand Oil Party. Subsidies are a way for the government to assist an industry, hypothetically for good reason. For example, wind and solar power help meet our energy needs without producing harmful pollution in the process. Because of the associated societal benefits, it’s possible to justify subsidizing clean energy. Alternatively, we could eliminate all energy subsidies and instead tax carbon and other forms of pollution. If rising energy prices are a concern, we could offset those costs by returning the pollution tax revenue to taxpayers. There are numerous different policy options available to achieve the Paris climate target. We can avoid unacceptably risky levels of global warming while also achieving cleaner air, water, and public health without destroying whole landscapes. But continuing to funnel tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry is perverse and counter-productive, as the OCI report noted: Removing these highly inefficient [fossil fuel] subsidies – which waste billions of dollars propping up an industry incompatible with safe climate limits – should be the first priority of fiscally responsible climate, energy, and tax reform policies. Perhaps the Democratic Party should add ‘abolish fossil fuel subsidies’ to its platform."
"If you’re looking for good news on the climate front, don’t look to the Antarctic. Last week’s spate of studies documenting that its melt rates had tripled is precisely the kind of data that underscores the almost impossible urgency of the moment. And don’t look to Washington DC, where the unlikely survival of the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, continues to prove the political power of the fossil fuel industry. It’s as if he’s on a reality show where the premise is to see how much petty corruption one man can get away with.  But from somewhat less likely quarters, there’s been reason this month for hope – reason, at least, to think that the basic trajectory of the world away from coal and gas and oil is firmly under way. At the Vatican, the pope faced down a conference full of oil industry executives – the basic argument that fossil fuel reserves must be kept underground has apparently percolated to the top of the world’s biggest organization. And from Wall Street came welcome word that market perceptions haven’t really changed: even in the age of Trump, the fossil fuel industry has gone from the world’s surest bet to an increasingly challenged enterprise. Researchers at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis minced no words: “In the past several years, oil industry financial statements have revealed significant signs of strain: Profits have dropped, cash flow is down, balance sheets are deteriorating and capital spending is falling. The stock market has recognized the sector’s overall weakness, punishing oil and gas shares over the past five years even as the market as a whole has soared.” The IEEFA report labeled the industry “weaker than it has been in decades” and laid out its basic frailties, the first of which is paradoxical. Fracking has produced a sudden surge of gas and oil into the market, lowering prices – which means many older investments (Canada’s tar sands, for instance) no longer make economic sense. Fossil fuel has been transformed into a pure commodity business, and since the margins on fracking are narrow at best, its financial performance has been woeful. The IEEFA describes investors as “shell-shocked” by poor returns. The second weakness is more obvious: the sudden rise of a competitor that seems able to deliver the same product – energy – with cheaper, cleaner, better technologies. Tesla, sure – but Volkswagen, having come clean about the dirtiness of diesel, is going to spend $84bn on electric drivetrains. China seems bent on converting its entire bus fleet to electric power. Every week seems to bring a new record-low price for clean energy: the most recent being a Nevada solar plant clocking in at 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour, even with Trump’s tariffs on Chinese panels. And the third problem for the fossil fuel industry? According to IEEFA, that would be the climate movement – a material financial risk to oil and gas companies. “In addition to traditional lobbying and direct-action campaigns, climate activists have joined with an increasingly diverse set of allies – particularly the indigenous-rights movement – to put financial pressure on oil and gas companies through divestment campaigns, corporate accountability efforts, and targeting of banks and financial institutions. These campaigns threaten not only to undercut financing for particular projects, but also to raise financing costs for oil and gas companies across the board.” Hey, the movement against Kinder Morgan’s pipeline got so big, the Canadian government had to literally buy the thing in order to try and ram it through. Protesters will die, a former Bank of Canada governor predicted this week – though he added the country will have to muster the “fortitude” to kill them and get the pipeline built. For activists, the best part of the IEEFA report is a series of recommendations for precisely how to hurt the industry the most, from creating delays that “turn a marginal project into a cancelled one” to “strategic litigation” to “changing the narrative”. The report’s authors write: “The financial world is just beginning to understand the fundamental weakness of the fossil fuel sector, and barely acknowledges the global climate movement’s growing power and reach. This has created a powerful opportunity to develop and foster a new storyline on Wall Street: that the oil and gas industry is an unstable financial partner just as it faces its greatest test.” That’s work we’re capable of. If a few years of campaigning is enough to convince the pope we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, a few more quarters might finally persuade the suits that there’s more money to be made elsewhere. But speed is clearly of the essence. If massive losses of money loom over Wall Street, massive losses of polar ice loom over us all."
"Farmers across northern and central Europe are facing crop failure and bankruptcy as one of the most intense regional droughts in recent memory strengthens its grip. States of emergency have been declared in Latvia and Lithuania, while the sun continues to bake Swedish fields that have received only 12% of their normal rainfall.   The abnormally hot temperatures – which have topped 30C in the Arctic Circle – are in line with climate change trends, according to the World Meteorological Organization. And as about 50 wildfires rage across Sweden, no respite from the heatwave is yet in sight. Lennart Nilsson, a 55-year-old cattle farmer from Falkenberg near Malmo and co-chair of the Swedish Farmers Association, said it was the worst drought he had experienced.  “This is really serious,” he said. “Most of south-west Sweden hasn’t had rain since the first days of May. A very early harvest has started but yields seem to be the lowest for 25 years – 50% lower, or more in some cases – and it is causing severe losses.”  If no rain comes soon, Nilsson’s association estimates agricultural losses of up to 8bn Swedish kronor (£700m) this year and widespread bankruptcies. The drought would personally cost him around 500,000 kronor (£43,000), Nilsson said, adding that, like most farmers, he is now operating at a loss.  The picture is little different in the Netherlands, where Iris Bouwers, a 25-year-old farmer, said the parched summer had been a “catastrophe” for her farm. “Older families around me are comparing this to 1976,” she said. “My dad can’t remember any drought like this.”  The Bouwerses expect to lose €100,000 this year after a 30% drop in their potato crop. After investing in a pig stable over the winter, the family have no savings to cover the loss.   Asked what she would do, Bouwers just laughed. “Hope and pray,” she said. “There is not much more I can do. I wouldn’t talk about bankruptcy yet, but our deficit will be substantial. It probably means we need to have a very good talk with the bank.” If anything, the situation is even worse in Poland, Belarus and the Czech Republic, where vegetation stress has taken hold. In parts of Germany, some farmers are reportedly destroying arid crops. After June was declared the second warmest on record, the European commission pledged to help farmers with a raft of measures, including the temporary suspension of “greening” obligations partly intended to prevent climate change. Farmers who have diversified their crops and invested in irrigation are in a better position to handle extreme weather events, which will become more common as the climate warms. But that is not an option for smallholders with monocultures and little access to irrigation. Jannes Maes, a small dairy farmer in Flanders and the president of the European council of young farmers, said concerns about insolvent farms were rising but were not the only problem.  “Bankruptcies would be hard,” he said, “but the economic loss farmers are suffering is often just as bad because they are hidden bankruptcies that have been prevented by wasting family capital on a farm.”  Thomas Duffy, an Irish dairy farmer from County Cavan, said the drought “won’t break us, but our feeding costs are 50% higher than last year and all the money we’d normally be putting into improving conditions for the cows and infrastructure is now going to silages [winter feed] and buying forage.” The European Drought Observatory (EDO) has described the drought as “an extensive and severe anomaly” affecting Scandinavia, Scotland, Ireland, the Baltics, the Netherlands and northern Germany. A spokeswoman for the EU’s Joint Research Centre, which oversees the EDO, said farmers should prepare to adapt to a warmer climate with “diversification or change of crop types and varieties, but also a more efficient use of water”. All water-related sectors “should be preparing sustainable adaptation measures towards an increase of drought frequency and intensity in the future”, she said."
"The NHS is experiencing a “summer crisis”, with increased emergency admissions and uncomfortable conditions in buildings not equipped for the heat, while the Met Office has warned that the UK temperature record of 38.5C could be broken on Friday. Authorities in Greece are dealing with the aftermath of devastating wildfires that killed at least 85 people, while efforts to control blazes in Sweden and in California continue. In Japan, 23,000 people have been taken to hospital in the past week and the weather described by officials as a “disaster”. In Algeria, a new African record has been set of 51.3C. Weather systems are highly complex and scientists are cautious about assigning specific causes to one-off events. But experts are already pointing to global warming as a driver for the current heatwave, with a study based on computer models and temperature data due to be published by scientists at Oxford University on Friday. Meanwhile, a new report from the environmental audit committee points to the likelihood of more frequent heatwaves in future, and the UK government’s failure to prepare adequately for them.  There’s nothing wrong with enjoying the heatwave, as many people are. Such a long spell of warm weather is extraordinary and, for sun lovers, a treat. No doubt many are hoping it doesn’t break before they take their holidays. But whether or not any more records are broken, or wildfires ignited in the coming weeks, the claim that rising temperatures have nothing to do with the global state of extreme weather must not go unchallenged. When the former US environment secretary Scott Pruitt was asked about climate change following Hurricane Harvey last year, he said that it was not the right time to talk about it. The opposite case is that the aftermath of an extreme event, when the atmospheric conditions have become the news, rather than the backdrop to the news, can be a “teachable moment”, when different kinds of conversations become possible. One of those conversations is the one about adaptation. Since some effects of climate change are now inevitable, we must deal with them. As this week’s committee report says, building regulations must be altered to ensure heat resilience, and new measures must be brought in to improve drainage and water efficiency. The public information campaign that the committee calls for is even more urgent. The 2008 Climate Change Act commits the UK government to reducing emissions by 80% of their 1990 levels by 2050. The latest British Social Attitudes survey showed that more than 90% of British people accept that climate change is happening. But only around a quarter describe themselves as very worried about this. Politicians, along with journalists, scientists and others, have a responsibility to make sure that people know what to expect and can make informed decisions – for example, about how to heat and insulate their own homes. Treating the symptoms of climate change makes no sense if the causes are not tackled at the same time. British laws – as well as the Paris agreement – commit the UK government to doing this, meaning decarbonisation of the electricity supply, heating and transport. These measures have cross-party support, but commitment by politicians is inconsistent. Just a few weeks ago, parliament approved a new runway at Heathrow, a decision that now faces a legal challenge. This week, the government gave approval for fracking in Lancashire, enraging all those who fear that this is proof – combined with slashed solar subsidies, the de facto ban on new onshore wind farms, and the rejection of the Swansea bay tidal scheme – that the government is unenthusiastic about renewables. Enjoy the sun if you can. We only live once and in countries with temperate climates such as the UK not all of the effects of climate change are necessarily harmful. Domestic tourism could even benefit. But don’t lose sight of the suffering caused by higher temperatures. In all our hands rests the future of life on earth."

"  A leading energy market analyst has warned that parts of the economy other than electricity will bear the brunt of Australia’s emissions reduction effort under the Paris agreement – a development that will inevitably drive up the costs of abatement for high-emitting energy, materials and industrial companies.  The warning comes as Tony Abbott has escalated his efforts to scuttle the national energy guarantee despite failing during the last parliamentary sitting fortnight to trip up Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg before a critical meeting of state energy ministers in August. Abbott declared on Tuesday night that Australia should pull out of the Paris agreement, despite being the prime minister who signed Australia up to the agreement before being deposed from the Liberal leadership by Malcolm Turnbull in 2015. When he signed Australia up to the Paris agreement in 2015, Abbott said there was a “definite commitment” to reduce emissions by 26% “but we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28%”. On Tuesday night, the former prime minister told a climate sceptics group his government would have never signed up to the treaty had it known Donald Trump would pull the US out.  “Absent America, my government would not have signed up to the Paris treaty, certainly not with the current target,” Abbott said. “Knowing what we know now, we would not have made the Paris agreement. But if we wouldn’t have done it, had we known; we shouldn’t be in it, now that we do.” While Trump has signalled his intention to withdraw, the US cannot actually pull out until November 2020, which is close to the time of the next presidential election. Abbott has been positioning this week to attempt to make the Neg a leadership flashpoint, suggesting on 2GB it was possible he could return to lead the Liberal party if drafted, noting “let’s just see how things work out”. He also used an interview with News Corp before his speech to declare the Liberal party had come full circle on climate change, and was now “back to where we were in late 2009, with Malcolm Turnbull trying to do a deal with the Labor party on emissions reduction”. Abbott unseated Turnbull from the party leadership in 2009 using his support for emissions trading as a trigger. The former prime minister also declared climate and energy policy was “not a circle you can square with the Labor party … it is a fight that has to be won”. Abbott is attempting to rally the party base and exploit divisions within the government on the Neg with his various forays. The policy divides the National party and some Liberal conservatives, including Abbott, have held out the possibility of crossing the floor. But his efforts to stir dissent have been met internally by a show of force. Turnbull has declared it is time to move on from the hyper-partisanship of the decade-long climate and energy wars, and a number of Liberals and Nationals have also rallied publicly in support of the policy. Privately, there is considerable frustration from many government MPs about Abbott’s behaviour. With Abbott again on the warpath, the respected advisory firm RepuTex has issued new guidance saying the Neg, if implemented, will only deliver 10% of the national emissions reduction effort. The firm says the emissions reduction target for electricity under the Neg of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 translates to cutting national emissions by 10%, leaving a shortfall across the rest of the economy of close to 500m tonnes of carbon pollution. The government is yet to spell out any roadmap for emissions reduction in the rest of the economy. RepuTex says, assuming emissions will need to be reduced across the economy to conform with the Paris agreement, that will double the price of carbon to $35 per tonne by 2030 “with industry – notably high-emitting energy, materials and industrial companies – bearing the brunt of the higher abatement cost”. “With the electricity sector locked into the Neg, other sectors – particularly large energy, materials and industrials facilities – will be called on to fill the gap to 2030”, the firm’s executive director, Hugh Grossman, says. “As this occurs, we expect carbon contract prices to rise to $35/t in 2030 – more than double current levels – behind the need for more expensive abatement from industry.” Grossman says abatement is cheaper in the electricity sector than elsewhere in the economy: “Abatement is far more expensive for large energy, materials and industrials facilities.” He says the firm’s advice to clients is prices will increase considerably from 2020 “in line with the need for more expensive abatement to be triggered, and greater demand for offset buying”. “This will lead to a higher sustained price path over time, with industry expected to contribute around half of all emissions reductions to 2030”. While consumers are beginning to see a reduction in their energy costs due to a recent fall in wholesale prices, the latest Guardian Essential poll also shows the Turnbull government has not yet convinced voters the Neg will lower power prices. The latest fortnightly survey of 1,030 voters shows only 15% think the Neg will help reduce energy bills, 22% think it will increase them and 38% believe it will make no difference."
"Sometimes, the sheer weight of the social, economic and environmental “wicked problems” in our world can leave us feeling frozen, unable to take any kind of action. But these are exactly the kinds of problems that researchers everywhere can help with – especially if we use methods that include and draw attention to the communities most affected by them. First, let’s define our terms: the concept of a wicked problem dates to the 1970s, when two researchers used it to describe problems with no obvious or clear solution. Today, they’re also thought of as problems for which time to find a solution is running out.  A good example of a “wicked problem” is climate change, but there arenumerous others: lack of access to healthcare and clean water, to agriculturalland, sovereignty and self-determination, and the prevalence of poverty andviolence.In the case of climate change, the bulk of evidence supports the findings of the US Climate Science Special Report, which states that it is “extremely likely” that human activities have caused warming since the mid-20th century. The report reviewed thousands of scientific studies from around the world that documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; diminishing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidification; and increasing atmospheric water vapour. Yet even with this large body of research-based evidence, we see thecontinuation of practices that are destructive to the environment – often in the name of economic development and job creation. A wicked problem seems a pretty apt description to my mind. If the world seems to be ignoring the evidence produced and presented byresearchers, why should we have a key role to play? The answer lies in the methods we use and how these can strengthen the credibility of evidence. First, our research needs to be transformative, by which I mean it needs to acknowledge that many of the problems we are facing are systemic – based in a system that is unjust, discriminatory and oppressive. Thirty years of working with marginalised groups, including the deaf community, indigenous people, women, disabled people and members of minority ethnic groups has taught me that many of them don’t think researchers are accurately capturing their experiences. What they tell me is that researchers come, take data and leave – and they see no substantive change.Researchers can change this by being culturally respectful and responsive, and by working with people to create a platform for a change that they see as valuable for themselves and their communities.We can do this by not assuming that we understand the nature of a problemand the nature of the solution. We also need to accept and take into accountthat there are different perspectives on the same issue.In the case of climate change, for example, there are two versions ofthe same reality. One version is that climate change does not exist. Anotherversion is that a community where dozens of trucks drive over a bridge everyday has the highest rates of asthma, heart disease and cancer. To move forward we have to make both versions visible, examine theconsequences of both and ask ourselves who suffers and who benefits.When we set out on our research, we must ask who needs to be included,how we build relationships with people and work with them, how we can be transparent and understand that things may need to be flexible and change.  We need to understand the history and not treat our participants like animals in the zoo that we have come to observe.Unless we put the systemic nature of the world’s wicked problems out on thetable, we will not come up with solutions and our research will simply helpreinforce and perpetuate the status quo.Researchers stand at an important point in history. They can be frozen intheir tracks, continuing to do research “on people”: collecting, analysing andreporting and moving on. Or they can work in a more inclusive way that stands a better chance of solving some of the world’s wicked problems – and helping achieve economic and social justice.

"In my corner of south-eastern Ireland, even a comparatively modest heatwave has been taking its toll. “We’re just not made for this weather,” said the woman at the petrol station. “It has to end soon.” And, indeed, it did, the rain spilling down that very evening. But though it brought relief to our yellowed fields and gardens, we didn’t need the downpour to grant us a return of sanity – because, unlike the UK, we hadn’t lost our marbles in the first place. It’s a strange thing to look at your nearest neighbour, until a few weeks ago your home, and wonder if it’s losing it. To look at its leaders and movers and shakers and think: “Are they high?” Last week’s corker: stockpiling food on the outside chance that the catastrophically hobbled Brexit talks do not suddenly surge forwards and yield a happy ending. I’ve found myself humming The Quartermaster’s Song (“There are mice, mice, mice/ Running through the rice, at the Quartermaster’s store”) as I think of Dominic Raab counting in the boxes of hardtack and pemmican, growing ever more furious as the supermarket top brass ring to tell him they haven’t any shelf space left.  It is, of course, not funny. We can safely assume that taking back control was never supposed to mean growing our own onions in a window box and bartering scraps of ham on street corners and yet here we seem to be. Add in the latest headlines – health chiefs warning of outbreaks of super-gonorrhoea – and you begin to think that things might be going slightly awry. Ah, a nation of hungry, sun-stroked belligerents with the clap. Meanwhile, two developments of a more cheering, but nonetheless mildly puzzling, nature. Those of a certain vintage will recall Saturday afternoons round at your nana’s watching wrestling on the telly – Mick McManus, Jackie Pallo, Kendo Nagasaki (real name: Peter Thornley), Giant Haystacks (Martin Ruane) and Big Daddy (Shirley Crabtree). These guys had it all: the names, the costumes, the bizarre rituals (Catweazle licking a lucky toad between rounds). They were who we watched when we weren’t watching Leonard Sachs barking up the acts on The Good Old Days and the snooker programme Pot Black, even if you didn’t have a colour set. This was a time when truly sophisticated television – by which I mean Bergerac – was a rare and carefully husbanded treat. But now, wrestling is back! As of teatime yesterday, you can watch Dave Mastiff (aka Human Hate Machine) and Grado (The Chubby Wee) slugging it out, with the addition of two female wrestlers, nicknamed Lilith and Viper. And while Mastiff’s declaration that this new incarnation of British wrestling is “like the punk rock scene used to be” might not bear close examination, I’m willing to get with the 1976 vibe. “Greetings, grapple fans!” And today’s political scene is agreeably amenable to the retro-feel. Young people are declaring themselves communists and free-floating liberals are plotting new parties. Jeremy Corbyn, 40-odd years ago a Haringey councillor calling for free dentistry and the national ownership of everything, hasn’t even had to change his Donovan hat. On the other side of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg looks like he’s stepped off the front page of the Daily Sketch, where he jumps out of his Triumph Stag to rail against union leaders meeting behind closed Downing Street doors for beer and sandwiches. But in all this disarray, a truly delightful moment, this time courtesy of the 1980s. In Albert Square, Walford, the home of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, residents are about to see a long-lost face, that of Dr Harold Legg, beloved GP and community stalwart. Dr Legg, who appeared in the very first episode, and who subsequently found himself at the heart of several major storylines, many of them also featuring Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. What could be more bolstering than the revival of a treasured doctor? One whose fictional back story – his Jewish family driven from the East End during the rise of Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists, but who himself returned to serve and nurture the community – hardly seems out of kilter with the times. The actor who plays Dr Legg, Leonard Fenton, is now 92, and has a career that encompasses such TV series as Secret Army and Shine on Harvey Moon. What a swansong. But nostalgia, as we know, is dangerous, and although these cultural throwbacks and revivals are pleasant, they can’t displace the depth of our current troubles. As numerous experts, including the food writer Jack Monroe and the botanist James Wong, are in the process of pointing out, the potential shortage of food and medicines will have a disproportionately grave effect on those least equipped to withstand them, and even the apprehension of the instability and duress they will cause is damaging. In the heat of the last few weeks, it seems as though people were losing their minds and were driven to ever more ingenious ways of keeping cool. One such was the idea of drenching a sheet in cold water, then wrapping it around oneself before attempting to sleep. But as the mercury dips – for now at least – the country and those gifted its governance need to be careful that a cooling swathe of linen doesn’t become a winding sheet.Put more simply: it’s time to get a grip. • Alex Clark is an Observer columnist"
"Northern Europe should brace itself for more upland fires like the one on Saddleworth Moor this week as the climate changes and extreme weather events become more common, scientists have warned. As the army joined firefighters to tackle the blaze near Manchester and a second fire was reported on nearby upland, scientists said similar events are increasingly likely in future, with potentially devastating consequences for the environment and human health.  Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, said recent studies showed “climate change is expected to increase the fire frequency and severity of wildfire in Europe”. He said the effect is predicted to be “even more pronounced in northern Europe, including the UK and Ireland”. Dr Richard Payne of the University of York agreed, saying that “devastating events like we are seeing today at Saddleworth Moor are likely to happen more often in the future”. He also warned the fires would exacerbate climate change, as the UK’s peatlands store huge amounts of carbon that is then released. “The UK’s peaty moorlands are crucial for the carbon they lock away as peat,” he said. “Since the last ice age these peatlands have helped cool our climate but fires can reverse that effect, rapidly returning carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.” The fire at Saddleworth Moor could also have more immediate health implications. Prof Susan Page of the University of Leicester said peat fires release toxic chemicals into the air as well as small particulates that have long-term health implications – especially for children or those with existing respiratory conditions. “For the Saddleworth Moor fire,” she added, “a further concern is the industrial legacy of this region, with the peat soils containing the fallout from many years of heavy industry in surrounding towns and cities. The peat soils contain this pollution legacy in the form of increased levels of heavy metals, which will also be liberated into the smoke by the fires.” The Saddleworth fire has reached seven square miles across (18 sq km), with the active “fire front” stretching up to 2.5 miles (4km), according to firefighters, who say it could take weeks to put out. People across the region have been advised to stay indoors and keep windows shut. Prof Vincent Gauci of the Open University said Saddleworth Moor had “been a sponge for regional pollutants for decades and centuries, as the region was an engine of the UK’s industrial revolution”, and warned the health implications of the fire were unknown. He said: “With none of the current pollution abatement strategies in the early industrial period, these moors were on the receiving end of a whole range of quite nasty industrial pollutants. So these peats are a store of past pollution, which could be remobilised in the current fires with unknown consequences for human health.” Campaigners have also warned that the use of UK uplands for grouse shooting makes fires more likely. Guy Shrubsole, an environmental activist who is writing a book on land ownership in England, said there was “a strong correlation” between the fire on Saddleworth Moor and “the tell-tale signs of intensively managed grouse moor”. He said there was growing evidence that grouse shooting degraded the environment and made both flooding and fire more likely. Pat Thompson of the RSPB said management of UK uplands for grouse shooting had made them more susceptible to fire over the past 150 years: “Over time large parts of the land have been transformed from wetlands with a high water table to a drier, heather-dominated environment.” He said this made them more susceptible to fire and less able to absorb water, contributing to flooding. “What we need to do is get this dry hard habitat back to being a wetland environment that can resist fire more effectively and across which water travels much more slowly,” he said. Thomas Smith at the LSE said other UK moorlands were highly susceptible with “moderate to very high fire danger ratings across most of the UK and the Republic of Ireland”. He said that besides the Saddleworth Moor fire, there were at least two fires burning in the Northumberland national park this week, “one of which appears to be quite large at over 2km across”. “The last time we had conditions similar to this was in spring 2011,” he said, “when there were fires breaking out across the whole of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, from a forest fire in Berkshire to moorland fires in the Scottish Highlands. I should imagine that fire and rescue services in areas at risk will be preparing themselves for a busy weekend.”"
"Eleven teams participated in a recent Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) project, examining the economic and environmental impacts of a carbon tax. The studies included “revenue recycling,” in which the funds generated from a carbon tax are returned to taxpayers either through regular household rebate checks (similar to the Citizens’ Climate Lobby [CCL] and Climate Leadership Council [CLC] proposals) or by offsetting income taxes (similar to the approach in British Columbia). Among the eleven modeling teams the key findings were consistent. First, a carbon tax is effective at reducing carbon pollution, although the structure of the tax (the price and the rate at which it rises) are important. Second, this type of revenue-neutral carbon tax would have a very modest impact on the economy in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). In all likelihood it would slightly slow economic growth, but by an amount that would be more than offset by the benefits of cutting pollution and slowing global warming.  Meanwhile, House Republicans are again on the verge of introducing a Resolution denouncing a carbon tax as “detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.” The modeling teams examined four carbon tax scenarios, with starting prices of $25 or $50 per ton of carbon dioxide, rising at 1% or 5% per year. These are somewhat modest policy scenarios; CCL proposes a starting tax of $15 per ton rising at $10 per year, and the CLC proposes $40 per ton rising around 4% per year. The most aggressive policy considered by the Stanford EMF teams ($50 per ton rising 5% per year) falls in between these two proposals. The modeling studies consistently found that for all four carbon tax policies considered, whether the revenue is returned via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes, the direct economic impact is minimal: in every policy scenario, in every model, the U.S. economy continues to grow at or near its long-term average baseline rate, deviating from reference growth by no more than about 0.1% points. We find robust evidence that even the most ambitious carbon tax is consistent with long-term positive economic growth, near baseline rates, not even counting the growth benefits of a less-disrupted climate or lower ambient air pollution The last sentence is critical. The analyses consistently found that coal power plants would be the biggest losers if a carbon tax were implemented, and the costs associated with health impacts from other pollutants released by burning coal (e.g. soot and mercury) are substantial. Phasing out coal power plants results in significant health and economic benefits to society.  So does slowing global warming, of course. A working paper recently published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond concluded that US economic growth would slow by an extra 0.2–0.5% per year if we stay on our current climate path (3–3.5°C global warming) than if we meet the 2°C Paris target. This compares favorably to a less than 0.1% per year slowing of the US economic growth rate under the carbon tax scenarios. In short, climate change will slow American economic growth. If we don’t curb global warming, the economic impact will be larger. If we implement a carbon tax to help meet the Paris climate targets, the economic impact will be negligible, and will be offset by the benefits of phasing out dirty coal power plants. The Stanford EMF studies also consistently concluded that a carbon tax is an effective way to curb carbon pollution, especially in the power sector: carbon price scenarios lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions, with the vast majority of the reductions occurring in the electricity sector and disproportionately through reductions in coal … Expected economic costs (not accounting for any of the benefits of GHG and conventional pollutant mitigation), in terms of either GDP or welfare, are modest The analyses also found that the rate of increase of the carbon tax was more important than the starting price. For example, a tax of $50 per ton of carbon dioxide rising by 5% per year would cut carbon pollution 33–56% by 2040. A tax of $25 per ton rising 5% per year cuts it by 25–50% by 2040. However, the policies including a tax increasing at just 1% per year would result in a short-term cut (of about 20–40%), but carbon pollution would remain stable at those levels.  These results suggest that the most effective carbon tax might start relatively low to give taxpayers time to adjust, but increase rapidly over time, similar to the CCL proposal, which a separate report projected to cut carbon pollution 52% by 2040. The Stanford EMF studies also found that returning the tax revenue by offsetting income taxes was slightly more beneficial for the economy than using dividend checks as the rebate mechanism, but the former is a regressive policy and the latter is progressive. Real-world examples demonstrate that pricing carbon pollution is smart. British Columbia’s emissions have fallen as its economy has continued to grow. California’s carbon cap and trade system has helped the state meet its climate targets 4 years ahead of schedule, while its economy has flourished.

That’s why there’s a 95% consensus among economists that the US government should commit to cutting carbon pollution, with 81% favoring a market-based solution like a carbon tax."
"Much of the world is in the grip of a heatwave. Britain is so hot and dry that we have Indonesia-style peat fires raging across our moorlands. Montreal posted its highest temperature ever, with the deaths of 33 people in Quebec attributed to the scorching heat. And if you think that’s hot and dangerous, the town of Quriyat in Oman never went below a frightening 42.6C for a full 24 hours in June, almost certainly a global record. While many people love a bit of sun, extreme heat is deadly. But are these sweltering temperatures just a freak event, or part of an ominous trend we need to prepare for? Earth’s climate system has always produced occasional extreme weather events, both warm and cold. What is different about now is that extra short-term warmth – from the jet stream being further north than usual – is adding to the long-term trend of rising global temperatures. The warming trend is very clear: the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that all 18 years of the 21st century are among the 19 warmest on record; and 2016 was the warmest year ever recorded. Overall global surface air temperatures have risen by 1C since the industrial revolution. It is therefore no surprise that temperature records are being broken. And we can expect this to become a feature of future summers. The long-term warming trend is driven by the release of greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide. Many alternative causes have been tested by scientists: the effects of sunspots, volcanic eruptions and other natural events. Only greenhouse gas emissions, dominated by fossil fuel use, explain the warming over the past century. This understanding isn’t just retrospective: 30 years ago this summer, climate scientist James Hansen told a US Senate committee that the climate was changing and fossil fuels were the main culprit. He made headlines worldwide with predictions that if emissions continued our planet would continue to warm, which it inexorably has. Today’s heatwave is not related, as some have suggested, to the every-few-years shift of Pacific Ocean currents that affects global weather patterns, known as El Niño. A new modest-sized El Niño is predicted for later this year but is not yet detectable. Today’s heatwave is what is expected as Earth moves to an ever warmer state. But it is worth watching the news for the coming El Niño later this year: if it turns out to be a large event, next summer could bring more extremely hot weather. And beyond that, as the climate warms, summer heatwaves will escalate in their severity. So what is to be done? The amount of warming we see is directly related to the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. Stopping the warming requires moving to zero emissions of carbon dioxide. Despite the Paris agreement on climate change being designed to do exactly that, progress has been slow. Today 80% of world energy use is from fossil fuels. While the share of renewables is rising rapidly, so is energy use, meaning that globally, carbon emissions are flatlining, not declining. Commitments made so far under the Paris agreement show that we are on track for an additional 2C warming this century. Such large and rapid change will make it very difficult for societies to cope. We will therefore also need to adapt. There is a lot we can do. At an individual level, we can cool our homes by keeping the curtains and windows shut on the sunny side of our house during the day to slow the rate at which it heats up, and then open windows at night to cool it down. We also need to keep a close eye on the very young and very old because they cannot regulate their temperatures very well, and suffer most in the heat. The major 2003 European heatwave killed 70,000 mostly older people. Changes to social care, for example, to attend to the needs of people who are vulnerable to high temperatures, can help avoid such death tolls in the future. Climate change is a greater threat to the UK than EU directives, terrorism, or a foreign power invading Beyond this, many aspects of society will require deep and difficult changes, including to our own mindsets. In the summers of the future, particularly in the south of England, we will regularly live in Mediterranean-type conditions. Adapting our national infrastructure, particularly around maintaining our water supplies, updating our housing stock as it is built to retain heat, and altering how we manage our land to avoid further catastrophic fires, will all be required. It is under-appreciated that climate change will transform the very fabric of the experience of living in the UK. This coming new reality is not high on the political agenda. Climate change is a greater threat to the UK than EU directives, terrorism or a foreign power invading. Yet the scope of our political discussion on future threats is limited to Brexit and spending on defence. Instead of this blinkered view where the future is the same as the past, we need to step out of the intense heat and take a cool look at what we are doing to our home planet. The development of farming and rise of civilisations occurred within a 10,000-year window of unusually stable environmental conditions. Those stable interglacial conditions are over. Human actions are driving Earth to a hot new super-interglacial state. What scientists call the Anthropocene epoch, this unstable time, is a new chapter of history. Today’s heat is a forewarning of far worse to come. To live well in this new world needs political action to catch up with this changing reality.

"At least 11 wildfires are raging inside the Arctic Circle as the hot, dry summer turns an abnormally wide area of Europe into a tinderbox. The worst affected country, Sweden, has called for emergency assistance from its partners in the European Union to help fight the blazes, which have broken out across a wide range of its territory and prompted the evacuations of four communities. Tens of thousands of people have been warned to remain inside and close windows and vents to avoid smoke inhalation. Rail services have been disrupted. The Copernicus Earth observation programme, which gives daily updates of fires in Europe, shows more than 60 fires burning across Sweden, with sites also ablaze in Norway, Finland and Russia, including in the Arctic Circle. Norway has sent six fire-fighting helicopters in response to its neighbour’s request for assistance. Italy is sending two Canadair CL-415s – which can dump 6,000 litres of water on each run – to Örebro in central southern Sweden.  In western Sweden, fire-fighting operations were temporarily halted near an artillery training range near Älvdalen forest due to concerns that unexploded ordnance might be detonated by the extreme heat.  Residents in Uppsala said they could see the plumes of smoke and have been banned from barbecuing in national parks, after 18 consecutive days without rain. “This is definitely the worst year in recent times for forest fires. Whilst we get them every year, 2018 is shaping up to be excessive,” said Mike Peacock, a university researcher and local resident.  There have been huge fires in the past in Sweden, but not over such a wide area. This appears to be a trend as more and bigger blazes are reported in other far northern regions like Greenland, Alaska, Siberia and Canada. The sparks come from a variety of sources: BBQs, cigarettes and increasingly lightning, which is becoming more frequent as the planet warms. Swedish authorities say the risk of more fires in the days ahead is “extremely high” due to temperatures forecast in excess of 30C. Much of the northern hemisphere has sweltered in unusually hot weather in recent weeks, breaking records from Algeria to California and causing fires from Siberia to Yorkshire. Ukraine has been hit especially hard by wildfires. The European Forest Fire Information System warned fire danger conditions were likely to be extreme across much of central and northern Europe in the coming weeks. EU officials said many of this year’s fires are outside the traditional European fire zone of the Mediterranean, and are increasingly taking place at unexpected times of year. 2017 was the worst fire year in Europe’s history, causing destruction to thousands of hectares of forest and cropland in Portugal, Spain and Italy, as late as November. “There are clear trends of longer fire seasons and frequent critical periods in Europe that are leading to dangerous fire situations,” said a European commission official. Climate scientists said the Arctic and other areas that were once relatively fire-free are likely to become more vulnerable. “What we’re seeing with this global heatwave is that these areas of fire susceptibility are now broadening, with the moors in north-west England and now these Swedish fires a consequence of that,” said Vincent Gauci, professor of global change ecology at the Open University.  “Both these areas are typically mild and wet which allows forests and peatlands to develop quite large carbon stores,” he added. “When such carbon-dense ecosystems experience aridity and heat and there is a source of ignition – lightning or people – fires will happen.”"
"Environmental campaigners and clean air groups have warned that the government’s green credentials are in tatters after a flurry of “disastrous decisions” that they say will be condemned by future generations. The government’s plan to expand Heathrow won overwhelming backing in the Commons on Monday – with more than 100 Labour MPs joining the majority of Tory politicians to back the plan – despite grave concerns about its impact on air pollution and the UK’s carbon emissions.   On the same day, the government rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, dashing industry hopes of Britain leading development of a new source of renewable energy. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party said it had been a day “of government-induced environmental disaster”. “First they plough ahead with Heathrow expansion, and now they put a nail in the coffin of the tidal lagoon. They really have taken a wrecking ball to the UK’s climate policies.” The growing concern around the government’s environmental strategy was highlighted by two new developments on Tuesday. Firstly, a coalition of clean air campaigners, green transport groups and environmentalists – including WWF and Greenpeace – has warned that “repeated delays” in the publication of the government’s strategy for sustainable road transport risks undermining the UK’s electric car industry and entrenching dangerous levels of air pollution for decades to come. In a letter to the prime minister, Theresa May, they said reports the government was planning to water down a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 would “seriously weaken the UK’s hopes of leading the race towards cleaner transport”. And it urged May to bring forward the 2040 ban on new diesel and petrol car sales by 2030. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said May’s environment policies were “in tatters” after Heathrow and Swansea and warned further backtracking on its flagship transport strategy would “cement her government’s failure to fulfil its pledge to be a global leader on climate action”. Separately, campaigners have condemned what they say is a watering down of a key element of the government’s climate change strategy, which will mean councils no longer have to assess planning proposals “in line with the objectives and provisions of the Climate Change Act 2008” but will instead only have to have reference to the “context” of the act. Legal advice sought by Friends of the Earth concludes this change “weakens the emphasis to be placed on climate change”. Dave Timms, Friends of the Earth campaigner, said it sent a negative signal to councils about the importance of climate change in the decision-making process. “The devil’s always in the detail, and by weakening the importance of the Climate Change Act in council decision-making, the government is hiding bad news in the fine print.” The government says the new planning proposals are a draft and still being consulted on, and a spokesman rejected claims its environmental policies were in disarray. “Our 25-year environment plan sets out our commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. This includes ambitious plans to replenish depleted soils, rid the seas and oceans of plastic waste, cut greenhouse gas emissions, end the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040, cleanse our air of toxic pollutants and develop cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.” The government’s plans to build a new runway at Heathrow passed through the Commons by 415 votes to 119 – a majority of 296 – on Monday night. It won the backing of the overwhelming number of Tory MPs as well as more than 100 Labour politicians. Environmentalists expressed anger and dismay at what they said was the overwhelming lack of engagement with the scale of the looming climate crisis by most Westminster politicians. A spokesman for the No Heathrow Group, which staged a series of direct action campaigns and organised a hunger strike in opposition to the proposals, said the politicians had failed on the “defining existential issue of our time”. It said a third runway was “a declaration that the lives of those ‘others’ around the world already suffering from the worst impacts of climate change, and the thousands displaced to build the runway, are worth less than the luxuries of the minority of wealthy frequent flyers who stand to benefit most from a third runway.” There is already a legal challenge to the Heathrow plans being prepared by several councils and supported by the mayor of London. Campaigners vowed to continue their fight.  A spokesperson for No To Heathrow said: “We are going nowhere, the third runway will never be built, we will use all the disruptive, creative, and peaceful tactics at our disposal to prevent the construction of this extreme and devastating megaproject: Heathrow, expect us.”"
"The coastal waters of the Baltic have been starved of oxygen to a level unseen in at least 1,500 years largely as a result of modern human activity, scientists say. Nutrient run-off from agriculture and urban sewage are thought to be to blame. “Dead zones” – areas of sea, typically near the bottom, with a dearth of oxygen – are caused by a rise in nutrients in the water that boosts the growth of algae. When these organisms die and sink to the seafloor, bacteria set to work decomposing them, using up oxygen in the process.   The resulting lack of oxygen not only curtails habitats for creatures that live on the seafloor, but also affects fish stocks and can lead to blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. But it is not a problem confined to the Baltic. Earlier this year a study revealed that ocean dead zones have quadrupled in size since the 1950s, and are found the world over in coastal regions of high population, from Europe to North America and China.  Researchers behind the latest study say that while nations are taking action to help waters rebound, individuals can help.  “In terms of the general public, one of the main things to do in the future may be to reduce the proportion of meat in the diet. Livestock agriculture generates higher nutrient losses per kilogram of food produced,” said Sami Jokinen, a PhD student at the University of Turku, and Tom Jilbert, an assistant professor of the University of Helsinki, who are co-authors of the research. At present, the Baltic Sea dead zone extends across 70,000 km2 – an area almost twice the size of Denmark, Jokinen says. The team say the lack of oxygen in the waters at the bottom is seasonal, related to layering of the water resulting from summer heating of the surface.  While previous studies have revealed that oxygen depletion has occurred in the central Baltic at various points in time in the past several thousand years, the latest study looks at how oxygen levels have changed in coastal waters. Writing in the journal Biogeosciences, the team, from Finland and Germany, describe how they probed the issue by removing two four-metre-long cores from a site between the coasts of Sweden and Finland.  The team used a host of measures to analyse one of the cores, including looking at the grain sizes of the sediment layers and ratios of different types of elements. They also used both cores to hunt for trace fossil burrows from organisms that lived in the sediment.  Among the findings, they found clear layers of sediment dating back to just over 100 years, suggesting that animals including bivalves and annelids disappeared from the bottom of the sea from this point. The upshot was that the researchers were able to reconstruct how oxygen levels at the seafloor have changed over the past 1,500 years, revealing that while the degree of oxygen depletion in coastal areas has varied over the period – largely due to changes in the climate – there has been a marked depletion in the past 100 years or so. The researchers say they were surprised to find that the steep drop in oxygen levels began before the postwar peak in urbanisation and intensive agriculture in the region in the 1950s. They say a combination of factors is likely to blame, including an uplift of the Baltic area as well as human activity – the latter a factor that appears to have become increasingly important. “Our evidence of deoxygenation at the beginning of the 20th century suggests that the human influence was felt earlier – in other words, that the system is more sensitive than we thought previously,” Jokinen and Jilbert told the Guardian. The pair note that since 2007, coastal nations around the Baltic Sea have attempted to improve the situation with an action plan to reduce nutrients flowing into the waters, and that oxygen levels are on the rise in waters off Stockholm. But, they add, global warming might be hindering progress, with no evidence of recovery seen in the regions examined.  “It is likely delaying the recovery process, because oxygen dissolves less easily in warm water,” they said.  Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “Its great strengths are the fine-scale resolution of the timing of changes in conditions, and its ability to take us back all the way to Europe in the dark ages, long before the industrial revolution and modern population growth,” he said. “By doing so, the researchers can separate human from environmental forces shaping the Baltic, to show that Baltic dead zones are the responsibility of those who live along its shores.” But, he said, the study also raised concerns. “One troubling finding is that recent efforts to reduce pollution have not yet led to recovery,” said Roberts. “The Baltic is stuck in a vicious cycle in which low oxygen at the seabed releases nutrients trapped in bottom sediments to fuel yet more plankton bloom and bust that causes the dead zones to get bigger.”"
"The clematis is in full bloom right now: a riot of purple flowers up the side of the deck, aiming for the wall. Being a vine, a clematis will twine around anything that crosses its path, including itself, at all available opportunities. The result is often, even with a short period of gardener inattention, a snarly mess; the leafstalks curl, and curl, in on themselves in order to find some – any – purchase. In this situation, if you want to coax the vine outward, you have to unwind the intricate tendrils very gently and place them against better climbing scaffolds: a thin stick, a wire. One long Canadian spring afternoon in May, that is what I did: slowly and carefully took apart the knots, suggesting to each shoot a less tangled path up a new, metal trellis.  On that particular afternoon, I had to wait until the sun had passed over the deck to do this work, or it would have been just too hot. It was nearly 31C that afternoon with high humidity: not quite record-breaking, but unseasonable for Toronto. Summers, here, are getting longer and hotter, and winters warmer and more unpredictable. This year, the thermometer hit 16C in February: that’s in a Canadian city in which the historical average high for the month is -3C. Now, we are in the middle of an extended heatwave. In a year of large contrasts, there was also an exceptional storm in mid-April that turned roads and sidewalks to glass for days, and with such high winds that insurance companies threw up their hands at the number of claims related to roof damage, including mine. Then in May – May! – there was a heat alert. This is enough drama to make even my least environmentally-conscious friends make noises about global warming. The garden has suffered this year, especially the lower-growing plants; even some of the hardy, well-established lavenders packed it in. The problem is not that it was too cold (although there was a top-10 longest and coldest polar air event in December/January), or that it was too warm in those double-digit February days, or that there was the ice storm in April, or that it was 31C in May, or even that there are now again record-breaking temperatures. The problem is that all of these things happened in a remarkably short time span, and that longer-term climate changes have already begun to destabilise plant communities, making them more vulnerable to extreme weather events. From my perspective as caretaker of this little plant community, the problem is also that many of the seasonal understandings that have been basic to gardening in Toronto can no longer be assumed. Lavender might not survive the winter without wrapping. Tomatoes might need to be shaded in order to survive what is forecast to be an especially hot summer. Plants that require specialist pollinators may find their calls unanswered because the short-lived insects on which they rely may now have lives out of sync with the blooms. There is a multitude of opinions about gardening in these climate changing times. Many urban gardeners talk about how to protect their plants from climate change: shielding them from extreme temperatures, conserving and/or diverting water, planting a greater range of resilient species in more cohabitative arrangements, and being extra-aware of the presence of both predatory and pollinator insects. Some gardeners understand their work as itself a form of climate change mitigation: getting rid of lawns that require mowing, planting to preserve and foster biodiversity, moving toward organic and permaculture practices to decrease the use of chemical fertilisers, and favouring native species that know what resilience means. Some are preparing for an intensified food security crisis, adapting flower beds for vegetables, and planting fruit-bearing shrubs and trees for future sustenance. To me, more than anything, gardening in these times means two things. First, looking after my little backyard demands that I pay close attention to the present and future: what are the plants telling me about the ways the climate is changing? What do they need that I can give them? What do these needs tell me about the larger scale of the changes in which we are immersed? What can I do, concretely, to mitigate change, to adapt to it, and even to resist it? Second, and more foundationally, this garden invites me to reflect on the past and present: on gardening itself, and how the particular plants I am tending are part of larger processes of colonial, global transformation in which histories of plant movements are bound up with those of capitalist, fossil-fueled developments. We can, perhaps, more easily think about cotton, wheat, sugar cane, and corn at this level: plants that were central to slavery, to the rise of industrial agriculture, to what some scholars call “ecological imperialism.” But gardens are also part of this picture. Think about the clematis, for example. The purple specimen growing up my back deck is a Clematis “jackmanii”, a cross with Mediterranean and Chinese origins of an already global species first made by 19th century English horticulturalist George Jackman. Although there have been clematis in North America for millennia, there is no question that the international spread of C. “jackmanii” stems from a history of British colonial botany and, more recently, capitalist horticultural trade, both of which have selected for masses of large blooms rather than, say, medicinal potency. Many popular cultivars originate from particular species that are appealing to this narrow set of aesthetic criteria. The resulting inbreeding has spread particular diseases, like “clematis wilt”; moreover, the favouring of these cultivars by gardeners and industry means that less attention is paid to species that invite different kinds of relationship. What does it mean, then, to worry about this beautiful, compromised, plant in the midst of climate change, when it is already so clearly implicated in global colonialism and capitalism? Yes, we can tend to gardens as acts to mitigate climate and foster biodiversity. But we can also challenge the relationships that have brought these particular gardens into being as part of, rather than as a refuge from, climate changing times. Gardens are microcosms of the complicated relationships that are the difficult world in which we are living, whether we like it or not, even as we may consciously refract those relations into new possibilities. In the garden, this practice involves taking careful stock: of the plants that are here, of the travels that have brought them here, and of the possibilities that “here” might yet bring about. • Catriona Sandilands is a professor in the faculty of environmental studies at York University, Toronto • Sandilands will give a talk titled Feminist botany for the age of man as part of the HumanNature Series at the Australian Museum on 12 July"
"This government’s decision to create more pollution at Heathrow (Report, 26 June) while simultaneously rejecting tidal power in Swansea Bay (Report, 26 June) shows it has no strategy for tackling climate change. Although aviation only contributes about 2% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, it accounts for over 6% of global warming due the effects of other greenhouse gases and vapour trails. The upcoming report by the UK Committee on Climate Change shows that a third runway will increase CO2 emissions from air travel from 37 to 43 million tonnes per annum. But since our overall carbon budget will have fallen by 2030 to 344 million tonnes, the contribution from aviation will have jumped from 6.5% to 12.5% of the UK’s carbon emissions. In other words, a third runway is incompatible with the UK’s climate commitments, and things will only get worse post-Brexit.Dr Robin Russell-JonesMarlow, Buckinghamshire  • Len McCluskey may well think that supporting plans for a third runway at Heathrow will provide “good jobs” – especially important at a time when so much employment is insecure and poorly paid (Unite boss urges Labour MPs to support Heathrow expansion, 25 June). But this is shortsighted and ignores the enormous impact on the quality of life of people living under the flight path and the health of even more people affected by heavier traffic during and after the construction phase. I’d prefer Len to demonstrate that unions think about the quality of people’s lives rather than just the availability of work. Les BrightExeter • What would Len McCluskey not want jobs for his members in? Arms for Saudi Arabia? Prison surveillance equipment for Palestinians in Israeli jails? As a socialist he must be aware of concepts like internationalism and global justice. He already supports the replacement of Trident, which contradicts the fought-for nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Now he urges the commissioning of the third runway at Heathrow.

"At least three people have died and thousands have been evacuated in California as eight active wildfires continue to burn across the state. More than 3,000 firefighters have been deployed to contain the flames, and the destruction is expected to worsen throughout the weekend as high temperatures and dry conditions inhibit efforts. The state governor, Jerry Brown, has declared a state of emergency in northern California’s Shasta county, and in southern California’s Riverside county, to help provide local fire crews with the resources they need to battle the blazes. Donald Trump has not yet commented on the fires.  Redding, a city of 92,000 near the Oregon border, is at grave risk from the Carr fire, which has so far killed two people. The fire is only 3% contained and has already scorched more than 44,450 aces. “Really, we’re in a life-saving mode right now in Redding,” said the Cal Fire battalion chief, Jonathan Cox. “We’re not fighting a fire. We’re trying to move people out of the path of it because it is now deadly, and it is now moving at speeds and in ways we have not seen before in this area.” The Carr fire erupted on Monday 23 July and is being propelled by “extreme fire behavior and challenging wind conditions”, according to CalFire officials. The blaze continues to threaten nearly 5,000 structures and 65 buildings have already been incinerated.  Meanwhile, in southern California, the Cranston fire has consumed 11,500 acres and is also only 3% contained. The fire threatens swaths of lands in Idyllwild, and Mt San Jacinto state park and San Bernardino national forest have both been closed. The Ferguson fire, which has burned close to 46,000 acres near Yosemite national park and caused the death of a firefighter, prompted national parks officials to close the most popular areas, including evacuating the famous Yosemite valley at the peak of tourist season. More than 3,800 fire personnel are working to protect the groves of ancient sequoias along the western edge of the park. The season has followed a particularly destructive and deadly fire year in the state –in 2017 nearly 9,000 wildfires tore through 1.2m acres, taking down close to 11,000 structures. Forty-six people lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest fire seasons on record in the state. This year could prove to be even worse – already this year, roughly 4,000 fires have erupted in California, scorching more than 144,303 acres, and officials say it is still early in the season. “We are still in July, which is kind of unnerving for us here in California because we are seeing this kind of destruction happening already,” Lynne Tolmachoff, a CalFire representative, said. “We still have at least three months – and generally the worst part of fire season – yet to come.” She explained that California’s recent five-year drought killed 129m trees, which are fuel for the fires. So are the grasses that grew over the winter but have now dried out. “It’s the kindling for a big fire,” she adds. California’s climate has become drier, with longer, hotter summers. Over the past two decades the fire seasons has become longer, stretching from May to November or December.  “There have been numerous homes destroyed in the Carr fire just last night and two deaths that we have confirmed already,” Tolmachoff said. “So it is definitely not looking good and it’s turning out to be a very difficult fire season. It could, depending on what occurs down the road, could easily meet or surpass last year.” The Associated Press contributed reporting"
"The sun shone and shone over County Cork last week, just as it did over most of Britain. When we came last year, to the same place in the same week, the steep banks of the lanes grew thick with wild roses, fuchsia and foxgloves; now the vegetation looked limper and dustier, the roses drier, the foxgloves solitary and stooped. But a poorer foreground view had its compensation in the background, where the lack of drizzle, cloud and mist revealed a rolling landscape of hills and woods that was unexpectedly Tuscan in its clarity. By four in the afternoon, the airless main streets of the small towns felt like ovens.  On the coast east of Skibbereen we found a delightful cove, of the sort that in my experience rarely exists outside children’s fiction: perfect in its firm sand, its protective reefs of smooth black rock, and its warren of caves that ran back into the cliffs, invaded every day by the tide, and entirely free of plastic flotsam. The sea was calm and clear, and changed its shade of blue according to the depth and composition of the seabed. Moreover, it wasn’t chill. In 60-odd years swimming off the British coastline, I’ve rarely known water as welcoming or as hard to leave: even after 40 minutes, it seemed a shame to get out. Newspaper reports said the prolonged heatwave had raised sea temperatures in other places to over 20C, which sounded impossibly warm, almost like a heated swimming pool. In that temperature, there would surely be no dallying in the shallows, no theatrical shivering when the water reached crotch level, no complaining that the cold was unbearable, no need to stand there uncertainly while your companion, already swimming briskly, urged you to “get in and get it over with”. Instead immersion would be a swift, Mediterranean experience – a run or brisk walk into the sea and then a splash as you struck out for the diving platform. Temperatures in the Firth of Forth never made getting into the water so easy. To be consistently tempting, the estuary needed exceptional conditions – and the summer of 1955 provided them. The sun shone for weeks, and day after day my friends and I made the 10-minute walk to the beach – not a Blue Flag candidate, if Blue Flags had existed then, because a pipe ran right down the middle of it that carried sewage to the sea from the army barracks to the rear. Looking back, it seems odd that people made no fuss about this, or about another more torrential outlet not far upstream, where the sewage turned the sea pink with its infusions of potassium permanganate. But it was a beach, all the same, with a sandbank that appeared at low tide and a hut at the far end that opened on especially busy days to sell crisps and lemonade; and by the second week, I had taught myself to swim. All kinds of things happened in 1955: Anthony Eden won the general election; Princess Margaret announced that she didn’t intend to marry RAF Group Captain Peter Townsend; Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK. I remember none of them. For me, it was the year I was turned brown by the sun. A family snapshot, one of our first in colour, shows me in swimming trunks, staring across a shiny flat sea towards a visiting American battleship, the USS Wisconsin, which lay anchored in the firth. My back is unselfconsciously brown – there had been no lying on towels and striving for this effect – which tells a story of capering about on the beach with no recourse to the plastic macs and sweaters that in most years the visitor to the Scottish seaside was wise to bring. (As the actor and comedian Stanley Baxter remembers, returned Glaswegian holidaymakers when questioned about the weather might reply stoically, “Well, it never kept us in.”) The strong sunlight gave everything a memorable clarity, just as it did in Ireland last week, so that certain scenes of no particular emotional importance remain fixed, when in other years they would have faded: the sight of a spoil tip near an old mine or ironworks – abandoned even in 1955 – that revealed an interior of bright red cinders where a jagged crack had split its grassy surface. It makes no sense to remember it, and yet there it is through the window of the Glasgow bus, under a bright blue sky. Unclothed adults at the seaside were then hardly visible, other than in newspaper pictures of crowded beaches at sophisticated resorts such as Ayr or Blackpool. When my grandfathers came to the beach, they retained their flat caps and waistcoats. My mother never owned a swimsuit. My father had trunks – as a boy he’d liked to swim – but I only once saw him wear them. None of this was very exceptional. I can’t think of any adult in our street who went to the beach and did much more than roll up a trouser leg. Nobody could have complained, as the aesthete James Lees-Milne did in his diary in July 1976: “Heatwave continuing. Whole country parched, and trees dying. Found E naked but for a pair of long blue shorts, with white skin, smarmed hair (for he had just had a bath), flabby muscles, pendulous breasts, looking like Picasso aged 90. How can aesthetic persons bear to be seen in this condition at 74 even by their intimates?” The great summers of my lifetime have been 1955, 1976 and now this one. With each, a little more innocence has been shed as well as clothes. Prolonged sunshine now seems ominous – a portent as well as a pleasure. Ireland, for instance, has a rural economy that largely depends on grass, and in a drought grass fails to thrive. That has huge consequences for every cattle farmer, but posterity may see it as no more than a little local difficulty, one of the negligible effects of a global temperature change that melts glaciers and ice caps. Carpe diem, then, in a cove near Skibbereen. • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"
"Thirty years ago, James Hansen testified to Congress about the dangers of human-caused climate change. In his testimony, Hansen showed the results of his 1988 study using a climate model to project future global warming under three possible scenarios, ranging from ‘business as usual’ heavy pollution in his Scenario A to ‘draconian emissions cuts’ in Scenario C, with a moderate Scenario B in between. Changes in the human effects that influence Earth’s global energy imbalance (a.k.a. ‘anthropogenic radiative forcings’) have in reality been closest to Hansen’s Scenario B, but about 20–30% weaker thanks to the success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Hansen’s climate model projected that under Scenario B, global surface air temperatures would warm about 0.84°C between 1988 and 2017. But with a global energy imbalance 20–30% lower, it would have predicted a global surface warming closer to 0.6–0.7°C by this year.  The actual 1988–2017 temperature increase was about 0.6°C. Hansen’s 1988 global climate model was almost spot-on. The incredible accuracy of Hansen’s climate model predictions debunks a number of climate denier myths. It shows that climate models are accurate and reliable, that global warming is proceeding as climate scientists predicted, and thus that we should probably start listening to them and take action to address the existential threat it poses. Hansen’s predictions have thus become a target of climate denier misinformation. It began way back in 1998, when the Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels – who has admitted that something like 40% of his salary comes from the fossil fuel industry – arguably committed perjury in testimony to Congress. Invited by Republicans to testify as the Kyoto Protocol climate agreement was in the works, Michaels was asked to evaluate how Hansen’s predictions were faring 10 years later.  In his presentation, Michaels deleted Hansen’s Scenarios B and C – the ones closest to reality – and only showed Scenario A to make it seem as though Hansen had drastically over-predicted global warming. Deleting inconvenient data in order to fool his audience became a habit for Patrick Michaels, who quickly earned a reputation of dishonesty in the climate science world, but has nevertheless remained a favorite of oil industry and conservative media. Last week in the Wall Street Journal, Michaels was joined by Ryan Maue in an op-ed that again grossly distorted Hansen’s 1988 paper. Maue is a young scientist with a contrarian streak who’s published some serious research on hurricanes, but since joining the Cato Institute last year, seems to have sold off his remaining credibility to the fossil fuel industry. In their WSJ opinion piece, Michaels and Maue claimed: Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16. Assessed by Mr. Hansen’s model, surface temperatures are behaving as if we had capped 18 years ago the carbon-dioxide emissions responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect. They provided no evidence to support this claim (evidence and facts seem not to be allowed on the WSJ Opinion page), and it takes just 30 seconds to fact check. In reality, global surface temperatures have increased by about 0.35°C since 2000 – precisely in line with Hansen’s 1988 model projections, as shown above. And it’s unscientific to simply “discount” the El Niño of 2015-16, because between the years 1999 and 2014, seven were cooled by La Niña events while just four experienced an El Niño warming. Yet despite the preponderance of La Niña events, global surface temperatures still warmed 0.15°C during that time. There’s simply not an ounce of truth to Michaels’ and Maue’s central WSJ claim. Dumbest sentence in WSJ oped: ""Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16."" Translation: ""Temperature has not increased if you omit the data showing it has increased."" It’s also worth noting that Hansen’s 1988 paper accurately predicted the geographic pattern of global warming, with the Arctic region warming fastest and more warming over land masses than the oceans. And climate deniers in the 1980s like Richard Lindzen were predicting “that the likelihood over the next century of greenhouse warming reaching magnitudes comparable to natural variability seems small.” If anyone deserves criticism for inaccurate climate predictions, it’s deniers like Lindzen who thought there wouldn’t be any significant warming, when in reality we’ve seen the dramatic global warming that James Hansen predicted. Michaels’ and Maue’s misinformation didn’t stop there: And it isn’t just Mr. Hansen who got it wrong. Models devised by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have, on average, predicted about twice as much warming as has been observed since global satellite temperature monitoring began 40 years ago. Once again, this unsupported assertion is completely wrong. I evaluated the IPCC’s global warming projections in my book, and showed in detail that theirs have been among the most accurate predictions. The climate model temperature projections in the 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2007 IPCC reports were all remarkably accurate; the IPCC predicted global warming almost exactly right.  We don’t even have to guess at the motivation behind Michaels’ and Maue’s misinformation; they give it away toward the end of their opinion piece, asking: Why should people world-wide pay drastic costs to cut emissions when the global temperature is acting as if those cuts have already been made? Michaels and Maue don’t want us to cut carbon pollution, and it’s easy to understand why. They work for the Cato Institute, which was co-founded by and is heavily controlled by the Koch brothers, who have donated more than $30 million to Cato. As Michaels admitted, they’re basically fossil fuel industry employees. But the answers to their question are simple. As climate scientists have predicted for decades, global temperatures are rising dangerously rapidly. Moreover, research has shown that the economic benefits of cutting carbon pollution far outweigh the costs. Michaels and Maue want us to bet the future of all life on Earth. They want us to put all our chips on black – a bet that burning billions of barrels of oil and billions of tons of coal every year won’t cause dangerous climate change. They want us to make that bet even though their arguments are based on unsupported lies, whilst they cash paychecks from the Koch brothers. We would have to be incredible suckers to take their bet."
"Whether summer in your city is present or past, there is a good chance you weathered record-breaking temperatures this year.  A heatwave swept the planet, and it was not simply one hot summer: the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that all 18 years of the 21st century are among the 19 warmest on record, and 2016 was the warmest year ever. “In 20 years’ time, the [recent] heat ... will no longer be news. It will be routine,” warned a Guardian editorial. Climate change in cities is frequently discussed in terms of flooding or storms – but its most dangerous consequence may be heat. Air conditioning, private transport and water engineering have allowed urban settlements in arid areas to expand at a dizzying and unsustainable rate, while outdated paradigms of urban planning and design give little relief from rising temperatures. Cities around the world may find their water use restricted – Cape Town, South Africa and Shimla, India have already have already come dangerously close to “day zero”, when taps run dry – and their power infrastructure compromised by reliance on air conditioning. Standards of living are likely to fall. Heat islands, droughts and disrupted seasons will likely lead to more deaths – particularly among the young, the old and those with health issues. Guardian Cities will be publishing a special week of journalism next month investigating heat in cities, and we want to hear from you. How are rising temperatures affecting or changing your city? What, if anything, is being done to mitigate this? What concerns you most about sweltering summers and more frequent and extreme heatwaves and droughts? Do you have any suggestions for what could be done? Please share your experiences with us using the form below – or, if you’d prefer to speak with a member of the team directly, you’re welcome to email Guardian Cities communities editor Elle Hunt via elle.hunt@theguardian.com.

"The heatwave searing northern Europe was made more than twice as likely by climate change, according to a rapid assessment by scientists. The result is preliminary but they say the signal of climate change is “unambiguous”. Scientists have long predicted that global warming is ramping up the number and intensity of heatwaves, with events even worse than current one set to strike every other year by the 2040s. “The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said Friederike Otto, at the University of Oxford and part of the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium that did the work. “What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace, and in some cases, it already has,” she said. “So this is something that society can and should prepare for. But equally there is no doubt that we can and should constrain the increasing likelihood of all kinds of extreme weather events by restricting greenhouse gas emissions as sharply as possible.” The new analysis is a climate-change attribution study. By comparing extreme weather with historical measurements and with computer models of a climate unaltered by carbon emissions, researchers can find how much global warming is increasing the risk of dangerous weather. The researchers analysed records of the hottest three-day period at seven weather stations in northern Europe, from Ireland to the Netherlands to Scandinavia, where data was easily accessible. “We found that for the weather station in the far north, in the Arctic Circle, the current heatwave is just extraordinary – unprecedented in the historical record,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also part of WWA.  Across northern Europe, the group found global warming more than doubled the risk of scorching temperatures. “We can can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said. “It is amazing now that it is something you can really see at a local level.” “Most heatwave studies have been done on large scale averages, so European-wide temperatures,” said Otto. “In this study, we have looked at individual locations, where people live, to represent the heatwave people are actually experiencing.” The analysis is a preliminary study as a full study requires many climate models to be run on high-powered computers, which takes months. Previous attribution analyses have shown very strong connections between climate change and extreme weather events. The scorching summer in New South Wales, Australia, in 2016-17 was made at least 50 times more likely by global warming, meaning it can be “linked directly to climate change”, said the scientists.  The “Lucifer” heatwave across Europe’s Mediterranean nations in 2017 summer was made at least 10 times more likely by climate change, while the unprecedented deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey also in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change, new research has found. However, other events, such as storms Eleanor and Friederike, which hit western Europe in January, were not made more likely by climate change, according to the scientists. In Europe, the heatwave has been caused by the stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice. The role of climate change in driving extreme weather events may actually be underestimated by these attribution studies, according to Prof Michael E Mann at Penn State University in the US. The work is good, he said, but computer models cannot yet reliably account for the complex jet stream changes caused by global warming, making the attribution studies “inherently conservative”.  Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of climate research at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.” The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, points to global warming as the culprit, said Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the UK’s Met Office: “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change.” The heatwave across northern Europe has seen wildfires in the Arctic Circle and prolonged heat across the UK and the European continent. In the south, fierce blazes have devastated parts of Greece, with scores of people killed.  But extreme weather has struck across the globe. Severe floods killed at least 220 people in Japan in early July, with the nation then hit by an “unprecedented” heatwave that peaked at 41.1C and left 35,000 people in hospital. In the US, extreme heat in the west is feeding wildfires, with Yosemite national park being evacuated, while flooding is affecting the east. Temperature records have also fallen in Taiwan, with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang, and in Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara desert, which reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C, the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa. The first six months of the 2018 are the hottest recorded for any year without an El Niño event, a natural climate cycle that raises temperatures."
"A Queensland-led coal push is intensifying as the Turnbull government attempts to land the national energy guarantee, with the looming weekend state LNP conference set to deal with several motions calling for a new coal-fired power station and an end to renewable subsidies. Several of the state’s branches have endorsed the LNP push for the federal government to build “high energy, low emissions coal-fired power stations and the orderly closing down of older technology coal-fired power stations in order to drive down electricity prices, reduce emissions and promote economic growth”.  While the coal push favours government intervention, separate proposals on renewable energy call for the state and federal governments “to apply policies which affirm the LNP’s commitment to the free market provision of least-cost, secure and reliable energy supplies from all technologies where their use is economically viable and technically feasible”. Nuclear power will also be back on the agenda at the LNP conference, with the Fairfax branch pushing for the consideration of “the feasibility of nuclear power generation in Australia”. The weekend motions come as Tony Abbott has attempted this week to exploit internal divisions within the Turnbull government over the Neg in an effort to torpedo the policy. Abbott used a speech to a forum of climate sceptics to declare Australia should withdraw from the Paris agreement – a treaty he joined Australia to while prime minister – as a precursor for dumping the Neg. The government’s energy policy is supported by a majority of Liberals and some Nationals, and there is internal frustration about Abbott’s antics.  Some Nationals want Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg to agree to provide transitional assistance for the coal sector, either through subsidies for coal stations or bankrolling retrofitting to extend the life of existing plants while lowering emissions. That internal push is being driven out of Queensland. Labor has earmarked at least 10 of the government’s Queensland seats as vulnerable, making the state the potential election swinger, and support for a coal-inclusive energy future is gaining traction with MPs in marginal seats. With pro-coal forces in the government on the march, during the last parliamentary sitting fortnight before the winter recess the Coalition voted with One Nation in the Senate, backing a motion calling on the government “to facilitate the building of new coal-fired power stations and the retrofitting of existing baseload power stations”. While it is clear that agreeing to some assistance for coal would help smooth over the government’s internal divisions on the policy, a coal side deal would create problems with Labor states and territories who have to sign off on the policy in early August. Some Labor states and the ACT will be highly attentive to any deal the Turnbull government strikes internally to prolong the life of coal-fired power plants, given some of them are already of the view the emissions reduction in the Neg is nowhere near ambitious enough for Australia to meet its Paris commitments. Any one of the states or the ACT could scuttle the policy because implementing it requires agreement across participants in the national electricity market. A coal side deal could also derail bipartisan consensus on the Neg with Labor in Canberra. The Turnbull government will need Labor’s support to get the policy through the parliament. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has already warned the government that new subsidies for coal as part of any internal settlement on the Neg will scuttle the chances of securing peace after 10 years of warring over climate and energy policy. Butler said in late June: “We’re not going to agree to a model that seeks to fly in the face of all of the expert advice, from industry and stakeholders, that building new coal-fired power stations would mean there is no way of achieving our commitments under the Paris agreement and also would deliver higher priced electricity to households and businesses.”"
"Australia’s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has been revealed as a key funder of the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs – a consistent promoter of climate science scepticism. Rinehart’s company, Hancock Prospecting, donated $2.3m to the IPA in 2016 and $2.2m in 2017, according to disclosures made to the New South Wales supreme court.  As part of a long-running legal dispute over the use of company funds, Rinehart’s daughter Bianca had served a subpoena to access documents that would have shed light on the two donations from Hancock Prospecting to the IPA. The IPA has close ties to the Liberal party and IPA fellows regularly appear in the media. The payments suggest that more than a third of the IPA’s income in 2016 and 2017 was from Hancock Prospecting, the majority of which is owned privately by Rinehart. According to Forbes, Rinehart was the seventh-richest woman in the world in 2017 and Australia’s richest person, with current wealth estimated to be $17.6bn. The IPA is a registered charity but is not legally required to disclose its funders and has declined to reveal them in recent years, citing concerns that donors could be “intimidated”. According to the court judgment, Bianca Rinehart’s solicitors had been provided with a schedule of “donations and sponsorships” from Hancock Prospecting where it was disclosed, the judgment said, that the company “paid or provided amounts to IPA in a total of $2.3m for the 2016 financial year and $2.2m in the 2017 financial year”. The donations also raise questions about the way the IPA has disclosed the nature of its revenues.  The IPA’s 2017 annual report declared $6.1m of income but said that 86% had come from individuals. Based on that report, Hancock Prospecting’s $2.2m donation would appear to have constituted more than a third of the IPA’s income that year. In 2016, the IPA reported that 91% of donations were from individuals, but that year Hancock Prospecting’s $2.3m donation constituted almost half the IPA’s income of $4.96m. Hancock Prospecting was asked why it was supporting the IPA, if the donations were linked to specific work, and if it was still a supporter. IPA spokesman Evan Mulholland replied, “no comment” when asked about the donations and if supporters should be concerned that so much if its income is derived from one person. The IPA has a long history of publishing books and sponsoring speaking tours of prominent climate science deniers. Rinehart’s own views on human-caused climate change match those promoted by the IPA. In 2011, she wrote in a magazine column that she had “yet to hear scientific evidence to satisfy me that if the very, very small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (approximately 0.38%) was increased, it could lead to significant global warming”. She added: “I have never met a geologist or leading scientist who believes adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will have any significant effect on climate change, especially not from a relatively small country like Australia.” Rinehart has also supported Australian speaking tours of British climate change denier Lord Christopher Monckton. Prof Ian Plimer, another prominent geologist who rejects climate change science, sits on the board of Hancock Prospecting subsidiary Roy Hill Holdings. In 2013, the IPA gave Rinehart a “free enterprise leader award” – which she accepted at a dinner alongside Tony Abbott just before he became prime minister and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch’s father, Sir Keith Murdoch, helped found the institute and the News Corp boss served on its council from 1986 to 2000. In 2016 Rinehart was made an “honorary life member” of the IPA. The IPA has also promoted massive export-focused coalmines planned for the Galilee basin, arguing they would help lift Indians out of poverty. Rinehart has a direct stake in GVK Hancock, one company looking to develop coalmines in the Queensland deposit. The IPA is seen among progressives as having an outgrown influence on the Liberal party. Liberal MP Tim Wilson and Senator James Paterson are both former IPA staff members. In May it was reported the IPA had been proposed as a potential co-host of a later-cancelled visit to Australia by former US EPA chief Scott Pruitt. An IPA-sponsored climate study that claimed most global warming was natural was heavily promoted among conservative media outlets around the world. Climate scientists who reviewed the paper, which had appeared in a journal, described the work as “junk science”. HPPL was approached for this article but no response had been received at the time of publication."
"Humanity is devouring our planet’s resources in increasingly destructive volumes, according to a new study that reveals we have consumed a year’s worth of carbon, food, water, fibre, land and timber in a record 212 days. As a result, the Earth Overshoot Day – which marks the point at which consumption exceeds the capacity of nature to regenerate – has moved forward two days to 1 August, the earliest date ever recorded. To maintain our current appetite for resources, we would need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation that makes an annual assessment of how far humankind is falling into ecological debt. The overshoot began in the 1970s, when rising populations and increasing average demands pushed consumption beyond a sustainable level. Since then, the day at which humanity has busted its annual planetary budget has moved forward. Thirty years ago, the overshoot was on 15 October. Twenty years ago, 30 September. Ten years ago, 15 August. There was a brief slowdown, but the pace has picked back up in the past two years. On current trends, next year could mark the first time, the planet’s budget is busted in July. While ever greater food production, mineral extraction, forest clearance and fossil-fuel burning bring short-term (and unequally distributed) lifestyle gains, the long-term consequences are increasingly apparent in terms of soil erosion, water shortages and climate disruption. The day of reckoning is moving nearer, according to Mathis Wackernagel, chief executive and co-founder of Global Footprint Network. “Our current economies are running a Ponzi scheme with our planet,” he said. “We are borrowing the Earth’s future resources to operate our economies in the present. Like any Ponzi scheme, this works for some time. But as nations, companies, or households dig themselves deeper and deeper into debt, they eventually fall apart.” The situation is reversible. Research by the group indicates political action is far more effective than individual choices. It notes, for example, that replacing 50% of meat consumption with a vegetarian diet would push back the overshoot date by five days. Efficiency improvements in building and industry could make a difference of three weeks, and a 50% reduction of the carbon component of the footprint would give an extra three months of breathing space.   In the past, economic slowdowns – which tend to reduce energy consumption – have also shifted the ecological budget in a positive direction. The 2007-08 financial crisis saw the date push back by five days. Recessions in the 90s and 80s also lifted some of the pressure, as did the oil shock of the mid 1970s.  But the overall trend is of costs increasingly being paid by planetary support systems.  Separate scientific studies over the past year has revealed a third of land is now acutely degraded, while tropical forests have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Scientists have also raised the alarm about increasingly erratic weather, particularly in the Arctic, and worrying declines in populations of bees and other insect pollinators, which are essential for crops.

"The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate. The plutocrats can fund political campaigns, but to capture enough votes to win elections, the GOP has resorted to identity politics. Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters.  The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party. Like racial resentment, climate denial is a position held mostly by old, white, male conservatives. There’s a climate change generational, ethnic, and gender gap. 61% of Republicans under the age of 50 support government climate policies, compared to just 44% of Republicans over 50. Similarly, a majority of Hispanic- and African-Americans accept human-caused global warming and 70% express concern about it, as compared to just 41% of whites who accept the scientific reality and 50% who worry about it. But the plutocratic wing of the GOP loves fossil fuels. Republican politicians rely on campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry, and quid pro quo requires them to do the industry’s bidding. It might as well be called the Grand Oil Party.  There is no other reason why the GOP should not unify behind a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This free market, small government climate policy – which taxes carbon pollution and returns all the revenue to American households – is indeed supported by many conservatives. A group of Republican elder statesmen created a coalition called the Climate Leadership Council to build conservative support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. They’re now backed by Americans for Carbon Dividends (AfCD), led in part by former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott with a renewed effort to build support for this policy. AfCD recently released polling results showing that 55% of Americans believe US environmental policy is headed in the wrong direction (29% say it’s on the right track), 81% of likely voters including 58% of Strong Republicans agree the government should take action to limit carbon emissions, and by a 56% to 26% margin (including a 55% to 32% margin among Strong Republicans), Americans support a revenue-neutral carbon tax.  It’s not a wildly popular policy proposal, but it does have broad bipartisan support. It’s also a smart way to curb climate change with minimal economic impact, and in fact with a massive net economic benefit compared to unchecked climate change. That’s why economists overwhelmingly support a carbon tax. The GOP was on the wrong side of history on civil rights and gay marriage and has paid the price, having largely become the party of old, straight, white men. Climate change is a similarly critical historical issue, but one that will directly impact every single American. Some smart Republicans recognize that the party can’t afford to be on the wrong side of history again on this issue. Donald Trump managed to win the presidency in 2016 by stoking racial resentment among white Americans, but still lost the popular vote by a margin of nearly 3 million, and Republicans have only won the presidential popular vote once in the past two decades. They’re winning elections by relying on structural advantages (gerrymandering and weighting of rural votes), voter suppression, and mobilizing older white voters. Trump seems to be doubling down on the latter strategy ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, for example by claiming that illegal immigrants are “infesting” America and by putting immigrant children in concentration camps. While only 25% of Americans support separating immigrant children from their parents, 49% of Republicans favor the policy. It’s a recipe for turning out the racist base (who also tend to be climate deniers), but not for winning a general election. Especially over the long-term as America becomes less white and as younger, more tolerant Americans become a larger proportion of the electorate. When asked about the child concentration camps at a press conference, Senator David Perdue (R-GA) made the connection between the GOP coalition of plutocrats and racists, telling reporters:  we came here to talk about a crisis. Your job is to inform the American people, our job is to provide solutions. ... God help us if we don’t solve this debt crisis. This is the No. 1 topic in America today … I want to make sure that the few minutes that we have didn’t get hijacked by the current shiny object of the day. [The national debt] is the current crisis in America. The national debt might be less of a crisis had the GOP not added well over $1tn to the deficit in order to give wealthy Americans a tax cut. But apparently, it’s now a greater crisis than the American government taking immigrant children from their parents and putting them in concentration camps, or the existential threat posed by climate change. In other words, GOP priority #1 is further enriching plutocrats, priority #2 is reducing the national debt by cutting programs that help non-plutocrats; keeping families together and preserving a livable climate fall somewhere down the list. Outside of the Republican base, these are unpopular priorities and policies. But as Katie Arrington, who recently beat Climate Solutions Caucus member Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) in a primary put it, “We are the party of President Donald J. Trump.” That’s a party that can only win races that are decided by white racial resentment. It’s a party that, given demographic changes, has become an endangered species.  Some Republicans are trying to save the party by embracing smart policies like a revenue-neutral carbon tax. But so far, the party dodos are winning."
"Back in 2012 a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed that the Environment Agency was warning that 12 out of the UK’s 19 nuclear sites were in danger of coastal flooding and erosion because of climate change. Among them was Hinkley Point in Somerset, one of the eight proposed sites for new nuclear power stations around the coasts.  That was before the increasing volume of melting of the Greenland ice cap was properly understood and when most experts thought there was no net melting in the Antarctic.   Satellite measurements released earlier this month and other recent observations of how warmer seas are eroding ice shelves and glaciers have removed uncertainty. Estimates of sea level rise in the next 50 years have gone up from less than 30cm to more than a metre, well within the lifespan of the nuclear stations the UK government has planned.  The extra coastal erosion and threat of storm surges that this increase in sea level will bring to our shores might make sensible people think twice about siting any buildings in vulnerable places, let alone nuclear power stations.  So far, however, the government has yet to respond and is pressing ahead with its plans. "
"Scientists have uncovered a new threat to the world’s endangered coral reefs. They have found that most are incapable of growing quickly enough to compensate for rising sea levels triggered by global warming. The study suggests that reefs – which are already suffering serious degradation because the world’s seas are warming and becoming more acidic – could also become overwhelmed by rising oceans.  The research – led by scientists at Exeter University and published in Nature this week – involved studying growth rates for more than 200 tropical western Atlantic and Indian Ocean reefs. It was found only 9% of these reefs had the ability to keep up with even the most optimistic rates of sea-level rises forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “For many reefs across the Caribbean and Indian Ocean regions, where the study focused, rates of growth are slowing due to coral reef degradation,” said Professor Chris Perry, of Exeter University. “Meanwhile, rates of sea-level rise are increasing – and our results suggest reefs will be unable to keep up. As a result, water depths above most reefs will increase rapidly through this century.” Sea levels rose by several inches over the past century and measurements indicate the speed of this increase is now rising significantly. Two key factors are involved: climate change is making ocean water warmer and so it expands. And as ice sheets and glaciers melt, they increase amounts of water in the oceans. At the same time, reefs are being weakened by ocean warming and also by ocean acidification, triggered as more and more the seas absorb more and more carbon dioxide. These effects lead to bleaching events that kill off vast stretches of coral and limits their ability to grow. “Our predictions, even under the best case scenarios, suggest that by 2100 the inundation of reefs will expose coastal communities to significant threats of shoreline change,” said co-author Prof Peter Mumby of Queensland University. This point was backed by US marine scientist Ilsa Kuffner writing in a separate comment piece for Nature. “The implications of the study are dire. Many island nations and territories are set to quickly lose crucial natural resources.”"
"I spend the afternoon in Shorecrest, a neighborhood a couple of miles north of downtown Miami. To get there I leave the beach behind and drive past Arky’s Live Bait & Tackle, Deal and Discounts II, Rafiul Food Store, Royal Budget Inn, Family Dollar and Goodwill. As I continue north, the buildings all lose their mirrored glass and their extra floors, until most are single story and made from stucco.  It isn’t raining when I arrive in Shorecrest, and there isn’t a storm offshore; the day is as clear and as blue as the filigree on a porcelain plate. But the streets are still full of water. I watch as a woman wades ankle deep across Tenth Avenue. She has gathered her long russet-colored skirt in her right hand, and in her left she holds a pair of Jesus sandals. When she reaches the bus stop, she sits and puts her shoes on.  “We get flooded with just about every high tide,” the woman tells me. “And if the moon is big it’s worse.” All along the east coast, from Portland, Maine, to Key West, “sunny day flooding” is increasingly frequent. Many places in the Sunshine State are so low lying that high tide – when coupled with something as innocuous as a full moon – can cause the streets to brim with water. Sometimes the tide simply rises above the seawalls and starts to spill into the roadways; in other cases it enters the neighborhood through the storm-water infrastructure belowground. The very pipes designed to reduce flooding by ushering rain out instead give salt water a chance to work its way in. In Shorecrest I spend a minute watching the bay burble up through the street grate and on to Northeast Little River Drive before whipping out my camera and snapping half a dozen photos. Just then a man walks up behind me, peers down, and says: “I’ve seen fish come swimming out.” “No, you haven’t!” “I have,” he says, pushing his sunglasses up. “I’ve been here 20 years. When I first moved we used to flood once a year, maybe twice. Now it’s constant.” His name is Robert Cisneros. He grew up in Cuba and moved to Florida in 1962, dropping the final “o” in Roberto. He thought the name change might help his fledgling boat repair company succeed. Robert points to his house and his yard, which are catty-corner from the drain we stand by, and says: “I used to have a nice garden here, and now you see how it is. The water comes in and sits. And everything dies because of the salt. It’s not rain that floods this place. It’s the ocean. I just bought some stones to put here to try to keep the water out. But other than that, what can I do?” I ask if the city is helping the neighborhood come up with short-term solutions. Robert gets upset. “I think they need to raise the street. They need to install pumps. But those kinds of things only happen on the beach. They’re not giving any of us here any relief.” Like Miami Beach, Shorecrest was built atop a former wetland. On the strip, where billions of dollars in real estate investment are at risk, the government is using a mixture of property taxes and municipal bonds to invest in formal sea level rise adaptation. But in Shorecrest, Hialeah, and Sweetwater – low to middle-income neighborhoods where the majority of residents are people of color – residents are expected to remove their shoes and wade through the water. Robert shakes his head in disbelief. “I wanted to leave this house to my kids, but soon it’s going to be worthless,” he says. On his stoop sit two pairs of rubber boots, ready for the flood that is already here. **** The following Friday I return to the Cox Science Center at the University of Miami. In the parking lot I sit in my rental car as the past decade of storms goes thundering through my mind. I see large waves pulsing into New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. Roiling chocolate milk ripping homes off their foundations in Oakwood Beach, Staten Island. Family cottages in the Rockaways in New York turned into aquariums during Sandy. I remember walking through the Lower Ninth five years after Katrina. The storm’s eerie language was still clearly legible on one house’s laminate siding: a painted X, its upper quadrant marked to show one dead in the attic. On the next building, a lighter, more haunting X showed two dead on the ground level. Someone had attempted to scrub it away, to remove the memory of the killing wind, the way the water deformed the foundation and window frames, the lives it took. I start descending the poorly lit staircase to the basement of Cox, where the geology department is – fittingly – located. The atmosphere down in the office of the department’s chair Harold Wanless, or “Hal”, is more in keeping with my mood. Perhaps it’s also in keeping with Hal, whose decades of research on sea level rise have earned him a reputation for cataclysmic prediction. He is wearing the same taupe suit as the week before. The skin below his eyes is the color of charcoal, and the rest of his face sags, too. Still he manages a smile. Up close it is hard to imagine that the media has nicknamed this good-natured septuagenarian “Dr Doom”. Hal pushes some of his scattered papers aside so I can set up my recording device. I have my question, just one, prepared: “What single event woke you up to the reality of sea level rise?” “You know, 20 years ago I never thought I would end up seeing the rise because everything, all the projections at that time, really didn’t ramp up until well into the 21st century. But then I started going out to Cape Sable.” Cape Sable is the southernmost part of the mainland; it reaches into the Florida Bay like a swollen hook. “Out there the beaches were disappearing, mangroves were moving in, tiny channels turned into huge rivers in a matter of years. Even the roseate spoonbills started abandoning their nesting grounds. I had never, in my life of studying the geology of the coast of Florida, seen anything like it. That is when I knew in my gut that the early predictions were wrong and that sea level rise was unfolding a lot faster than any of us ever imagined.” “What comes next?” I ask. “We have to start relocating the things we value,” he says. “Like the Smithsonian Institution, which is sited on top of an old marsh. We have to make seed banks, a global archive for the future, and we have to move our power plants, in order to maintain a functioning society. We have to start lining the trash dumps that line our shores, we have to start preparing for inundation. Remember, the last time carbon dioxide levels were the same as they are today, the ocean was one hundred feet higher.” The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high was during the Pliocene epoch, 2.6 to 5.3 million years ago, when megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high, the tectonic plates beneath India and Asia collided, forming the Himalayas. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high, California’s Sierra Nevada rose up and tilted its granite face west. The Alps folded and thrust their splintered rock toward the sky. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high, armadillos migrated north across a newly formed land bridge between today’s North and South America. Dogs headed in the opposite direction. But no one can remember these things, because humans didn’t exist. I leave Hal’s office and drive back across the bay. That night the moon is big and full, making the ocean weightier. The salt water unspools in the streets and continues drowning, by degrees, the low-lying land that lines our shore. Soon, I think, if Hal is right, all of this will be underwater, not just temporarily, but for good."
"Many of those MPs who marched through the lobbies to vote in favour of expanding Heathrow this week – Labour parliamentarians among them – will speak eloquently, if pushed, about the threat of climate change. Unfortunately their words have been rendered meaningless by their vote. You cannot truly fear the impact of climate change and then opt to raise Heathrow’s emissions by 7.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide – a figure that, as Greenpeace notes, is equivalent to the annual total output of Cyprus. The talk of promoting jobs and economic growth that swirled around the vote is self-destructive short-termism. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the floods, droughts and heatwaves that climate change will bring will cost the economy tens of billions of pounds, as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs, by 2050. By focusing on high-carbon infrastructure as a means to create jobs, we distract ourselves from exploring how we can create hundreds of thousands of skilled, well-paid, secure jobs in the renewable energy sector, as Germany has done. A disastrous vote then, but also one that offers a revealing insight into what the Tory approach to Brexit means. According to her spokesman, Theresa May believes that expanding Heathrow “sends out an important message about global Britain and making the most of the opportunities which lie ahead of us”. The airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, echoed the government rhetoric, lauding a “real Brexit bonus”. Clearly a hard Tory Brexit – grievously damaging economic relations with our nearest trading bloc – means a Trumpian hell-for-leather dash for growth at any cost. Who benefits from that growth, or what it means for the environment, are not high-priority questions. Indeed, on the same day as the Heathrow vote, the government rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, another potential source of jobs and growth that would help to counter global warming. As the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warns today, the Tory obsession with scrapping what David Cameron infamously called “green crap” will saddle us all with higher costs in the future. As for the “green Brexit” cynically trumpeted by Tory leadership wannabe Michael Gove, that was clearly yesterday’s soundbite. Yes, climate change can seem like an abstraction – too technical, too distant. I admit my own brain tends to fade out when I hear about it. History may judge that one of the most disastrous consequences of the financial crash was that it distracted from the imperative of dealing with climate change: here-and-now crises of falling living standards, a lack of secure jobs and public sector cuts suddenly became more pressing and urgent. Brexit, too, sucks in all the political oxygen, starving other crises of attention and giving the Tories a pretext to bet the farm on making departure from the EU look like it can work. But our government is legally bound to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, meaning our aviation emissions must be at the levels they were in 2005 – 37.5m tonnes – by mid-century. A Department for Transport report reveals we will already have hit 43m tonnes by 2030 after Heathrow expansion. Because we are signatories to the Paris agreement, we are obliged to limit a rise in global temperatures to well below 2C. But as Lord Deben – a former Tory minister and chair of the CCC – put it to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, regarding Heathrow expansion: “We were surprised that your statement to the House of Commons … on 5 January 2018 made no mention of either of these commitments.” If we’re going to abide by our targets, as well as expand Heathrow, that means deeper cuts in emissions in other parts of the economy. Where? As Deben has wryly noted, the CCC “has limited confidence about the options [for achieving the compensatory cuts needed]”. Who will benefit most from this expansion? More than half of Britons don’t fly at all in any given year. Just 15% of Britons – disproportionately the most affluent – take more than 70% of all flights. House of Commons research suggests that having a second home and a household income of more than £115,000 are the best indicators of whether or not you are a frequent flyer. And as Labour’s Clive Lewis points out, many of the beneficiaries of a bigger Heathrow will be international transfer passengers whose money will never even make it into the UK economy (except maybe by buying the odd bottle of whisky in duty free). Is bulldozing communities, increasing noise pollution and noxious fumes, and above all accelerating climate change, a price worth paying for that? Consider the challenges we must confront. Greenpeace’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, tells me: “We’re looking at scale-ups of water shortages, heatwaves and extreme weather across the world.” The Tories might laud their approach to Brexit as paving the way for Britain’s resurrection as a global trading nation. But the damage inflicted by climate change on our trading partners means we will suffer too. The impacts in Britain will be felt on agriculture, road and rail, electricity, water and sewage systems – all hit by rising temperatures. Look at the fire on Saddleworth Moor: other factors are at play, such as how the land is managed. But we can be sure that climate change will increase the likelihood of such disasters. This week, our political elite sent a message to the future that will not be forgotten. They could have championed an ambitious route: one that invests in skilled green jobs as part of a new just and sustainable order. Instead a decision was taken to play Russian roulette with our planet for short-term, limited gain. In two generations’ time, what will those yet to be born make of a reckless decision taken when there was still time to act in the face of coming catastrophe? The Heathrow vote was a wanton act of vandalism and we will all suffer from this particular “Brexit dividend”. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"
"The UK government’s approach to both this week’s Nato summit (Report, 7 July), and the visit of President Trump, is symptomatic of its counterproductive stance on national and international security. Recent efforts by the Ministry of Defence to use the Nato summit to secure further budget increases are misguided. Instead of increasing our safety, heavy spending on aggressive military capabilities and power projection is exacerbating global tensions. By the same token, turning a blind eye to Trump’s abusive and degrading rhetoric and actions in the hope of shoring up a superpower alliance deepens global insecurity.  If the UK wants to make a genuine contribution to security, the government needs to invest far more in addressing the underlying causes of global insecurity, such as economic inequality, climate change and poor governance. It should be using its diplomatic clout to increase international focus on these issues, as well as supporting local actors in concerted efforts to bring about durable political resolution of the conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Israel-Palestine and elsewhere. Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are not soft options; failure to make progress on these critical challenges of our time only results in more insecurity for everyone, both in the UK and overseas. We therefore call for an urgent and comprehensive rethink of the government’s approach to security and international relations, based on systematic commitment to its declared values of human dignity, human rights, freedom, democracy and equality.  The UK’s security alliances need to work for the common good of all the world’s people.Celia McKeonCoordinator, Rethinking Security • Mrs May is surely right that the majority of British people understand the “importance of the UK-US alliance” (Report, 7 July).  However, that is certainly not an alliance with the opinions and actions of the current president and his administration. Thousands of British people would want to be aligned with those in the United States who are protesting against the huge arsenal of nuclear weapons which the US not only maintains but which is being developed; those fighting to preserve the Environmental Protection Agency and stand up against the destruction of the environment by the climate change-denying president; with those working against the money and resource being put into developing and producing more and more advanced technological weapons to line the pockets of the huge military manufacturers. Our sympathies are with those women and men in the US who are prepared to take non-violent direct action to stem the tide of racism, misogyny, militarism and cruelty of their current leaders.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater Manchester • You report that President Trump will be spending only a couple of days in London, meeting the Queen and prime minister, before being flown to Scotland for a “private visit”, for the remainder of his trip. The Foreign Office may be following precedent. Almost exactly 47 years ago, on 12 July 1971, a close British ally with a somewhat unsavoury reputation visited the UK, and was given two days in London, including talks with the monarch and PM.  He then flew to Scotland for two days including some shopping, sea swimming and military ceremonies. His name? President Idi Amin Dada of Uganda. Mark LeopoldHove, East Sussex • Mr Trump has been invited to this country by our government. He should therefore be treated with civility. He has, however, shown himself to be self-serving, ignorant, vulgar and mendacious. He does not deserve our attention. Many of his actions and statements deserve contempt. The best response is to ignore him as much as possible, with minimal publicity and absolutely no demonstrations. He feeds off adulation and will enjoy the attention which demonstrations will provide.Chris OsmanOxford  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Australia’s emissions over the past year were again the highest on record when unreliable data from land use and forestry sectors are excluded, according to new data from NDEVR Environmental. If the country’s greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, Australia will miss its Paris target by a billion tonnes of CO2, which is equal to about two years of Australia’s entire national emissions.  NDEVR replicates the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports, but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR reports’ figures have been within 1% of the official figures when they are eventually released. The latest figures include the first three months of 2018 and show Australia’s national emissions up to March were the highest since records began in 2002. It projects that emissions for the year to March, excluding land use emissions, will be 556.9 m tonnes. Even with land-use data included, it projects emissions would continue their upward trend, taking Australia further away from its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels by 2030.  Although emissions from the electricity sector had fallen in the previous three quarters, the report identifies a slight increase of 1.7 m tonnes of CO2 in the most recent quarter, due to an increase in fossil-fuel based electricity generation throughout the national electricity market states. The report also finds that fugitive emissions due to increased gas production and exports are at their highest levels ever. As debate over the government’s proposed national energy guarantee continues, NDEVR projects that the Australian electricity sector would meet the proposed Neg target of a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, five years ahead of schedule, simply if business as usual continues. The reason for this is the ongoing investment in renewable energy developments as well as the impending decommissioning of large coal plants. “Our indicative analysis shows that electricity emissions in a business as usual sense are decreasing faster than what the Neg projects anyway,” the NDEVR environmental managing director, Matt Drum, said. Drum said while the government’s focus was on the electricity sector, emissions were rising across other areas of the economy in the absence of a working climate policy. “The numbers speak for themselves. They’re heading in the wrong direction,” he said. “It’s one thing to focus on the electricity sector – it’s 36% of our emissions. But that leaves 64% of the economy that is essentially untouched by policy or mitigation.”"
"Pope Francis urged governments on Friday to make good on their commitments to curb global warming, warning that climate change, continued unsustainable development and rampant consumption threatens to turn the Earth into a vast pile of “rubble, deserts and refuse”. Francis made the appeal at a Vatican conference marking the third anniversary of his landmark environmental encyclical “Praise Be.” The document, meant to spur action at the 2015 Paris climate conference, called for a paradigm shift in humanity’s relationship with Mother Nature.  In his remarks, Francis urged governments to honor their Paris commitments and said institutions such as the IMF and World Bank had important roles to play in encouraging reforms promoting sustainable development. “There is a real danger that we will leave future generations only rubble, deserts and refuse,” he warned. The Paris accord, reached by 195 countries, seeks to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change by curbing global greenhouse gas emissions via individual, non-binding national plans. President Donald Trump has said the US will pull out of the accord negotiated by his predecessor unless he can get a better deal. Friday’s conference was the latest in a series of Vatican initiatives meant to impress a sense of urgency about global warming and the threat it poses in particular to the world’s poorest and most marginalised people. Recently, Francis invited oil executives and investors to the Vatican for a closed-door conference where he urged them to find alternatives to fossil fuels. He warned climate change was a challenge of “epochal proportions”. Next year, Francis has called a three-week synod, or meeting of bishops, specifically to address the church’s response to the ecological crisis in the Amazon, where deforestation threatens what he has called the “lung” of the planet and the indigenous peoples who live there On Friday, Francis also thanked aid groups that rescue and care for migrants and denounced the “sterile hypocrisy” of those who turn a blind eye to the world’s poor seeking security and a dignified life. Francis celebrated a mass for migrants and those who care for them in St Peter’s Basilica, calling attention to their plight as Europe, the US and other countries increasingly closing their doors, ports and borders to them. The intimate service marked the fifth anniversary of Francis’ landmark visit to Lampedusa, the Sicilian island that for years was the primary destination of migrants smuggled from Libya to Europe. During that trip, Francis’ first outside Rome after his 2013 election, he denounced the “globalisation of indifference” that the world showed migrants fleeing war, poverty and climate-induced natural disasters. Speaking in his native Spanish, Francis thanked the representatives of aid groups in the pews for embodying the Good Samaritan “who stopped to save the life of the poor man beaten by bandits”. “He didn’t ask where he was from, his reasons for travelling or his documents. he simply decided to care for him and save his life,” the pope said.  "
"The homebuilding and carmaking industries “should be ashamed” of their efforts to tackle global warming, according to the UK government’s official climate change adviser. Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), said housebuilders were “cheating” buyers with energy-inefficient homes and that motor companies were holding back the rollout of clean cars.  The CCC’s annual report, published on Thursday, found the UK is on track to miss its legally binding carbon budgets in 2025 and 2030, due to lack of progress in cutting emissions from buildings and transport. It also said ministers were spurning low-cost options, such as onshore windfarms, home insulation and tree-planting, meaning people would end up paying more than needed to fight climate change.  Home insulation installations are among the cheapest carbon cutting measures but the cancellation of government incentives has caused a 95% drop since 2012, the CCC said. “It is really shocking,” said Chris Stark, CCC chief executive, who noted that such measures cut energy bills by £100 a year on average. The government, which also cancelled plans to make new homes zero-carbon, must produce new policies and stick to them, said Stark. The big emissions cuts seen in electricity production, as renewables replace coal, shows action can be taken, he said: “We have seen what happens when the government takes an enlightened view and steps in.” Deben severely criticised the homebuilding industry: “The industry should be ashamed of itself that it is still producing homes that are cheating the people they sell to. If you don’t produce a properly insulated home, you put a burden on the purchaser and the next purchaser for the rest of time in terms of their energy bills.” “It is ridiculous,” he said. “You can provide the homes people need – well-insulated, low-energy cost homes – at a price which is very little different from the price today.” Deben also attacked carmakers: “The car industry should be ashamed of itself too but I make a distinction because they have [at least] claimed they are repenting. Frankly, I don’t see any reason to be very hopeful that it is going to behave from the highest motives, given the history that we’ve had with Volkswagen and the rest.” The CCC said the government must set tough new CO2 reduction targets for cars and vans. Furthermore, Deben said: “The government has got to make sure the car industry doesn’t try to avoid new regulations in the way that it has the old regulations. It is necessary to ensure the cleaner cars come forward more quickly, instead of being held back while dirtier cars are sold by the industry.” The government’s pledge to end the sales of pure petrol and diesel cars by 2040, which is reportedly being watered down, is far too unambitious, Lord Deben said. “We think that to move much closer to 2030 is essential, because the figures don’t add up otherwise.” Other countries, including the Netherlands and Norway have already set such a date. A spokesman for the Home Builders Federation said: “Lord Deben’s comments are ill-judged and are not borne out by the facts. House builders have met every government environmental target such that new homes are considerably more energy efficient than existing homes.” Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the industry had delivered on challenging carbon reduction targets but recognised more needs to be done. “We need a strategy with realistic ambition levels that supports industry’s efforts, allows manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and which provides the right incentives to take the consumer with us.” Paul Morozzo, at Greenpeace, said: “The car industry has a lot to answer for. Emissions and pollution from cars are much higher than billed, yet the government still fears to act.” The CCC noted the UK’s success in cutting emissions in the decade since the Climate Change Act set legal targets, down 43% compared to 1990 levels. The government had set out the right direction in its Clean Growth Strategy published in October, Stark said, but urgently needed to put words into action: “The government knows how to do this – they just have to get on and do it.” A government spokesman said: “As the Committee on Climate Change has recognised, we’ve made huge progress in cleaning up the power and waste sectors and through our ambitious Clean Growth Strategy we’re confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth.”"
"Your editorial warning that extreme events are likely to become a new and dangerous normal (The heatwave in Britain is part of a large and dangerous pattern, 10 July) highlights that what the UK can most effectively do in response is to plan to adapt. While decarbonisation across our economy and society is vital and the UK must improve its commitments on a range of fronts, we are also a highly populated island exposed to diverse and complex weather and climate risks from storms and floods to heatwaves and drought. Tuesday’s report by the National Infrastructure Commission makes the economic case for early, planned adaptation clear: it is way cheaper than responding to emergencies. This summer the government publishes its latest national adaptation programme. The first programme was spread too thinly and progress against it was hard to quantify. The latest version must establish an ambitious, targeted and measurable plan of action which ensures society is resilient to the worst the weather can throw at us in coming decades.Alastair ChisholmDirector of policy, Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management • You shouldn’t waste time criticising Donald Trump. He has had little effect on greenhouse gas emissions. China is producing twice as much carbon dioxide (CO2) as the USA, and is also pumping out illegal greenhouse gases, like CFC-11, which were banned by the Montreal protocol (China is source of illegal CFC-11 eroding ozone, 9 July). Since everyone agreed that atmospheric CO2 had to be kept below 450 ppm, China has gone from producing 10% of global emissions to producing 28%, and intends to continue increasing its output until 2030.Robert McCartneyFarnborough, Hampshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"It felt as disorienting as forgetting my pin number. I stared at the caterpillar, unable to attach a name to it. I don’t think my mental powers are fading: I still possess an eerie capacity to recall facts and figures and memorise long screeds of text. This is a specific loss. As a child and young adult, I delighted in being able to identify almost any wild plant or animal. And now it has gone. This ability has shrivelled from disuse: I can no longer identify them because I can no longer find them.  Perhaps this forgetfulness is protective. I have been averting my eyes. Because I cannot bear to see what we have done to nature, I no longer see nature itself; otherwise, the speed of loss would be unendurable. The collapse can be witnessed from one year to the next. The swift decline of the swift (down 25% in five years) is marked by the loss of the wild screams that, until very recently, filled the skies above my house. My ambition to see the seabird colonies of Shetland and St Kilda has been replaced by the intention never to visit those islands during the breeding season: I could not bear to see the empty cliffs, where populations have crashed by some 90% in the past two decades. I have lived long enough to witness the vanishing of wild mammals, butterflies, mayflies, songbirds and fish that I once feared my grandchildren would not experience: it has all happened faster than even the pessimists predicted. Walking in the countryside or snorkelling in the sea is now as painful to me as an art lover would find visits to a gallery, if on every occasion another old master had been cut from its frame. The cause of this acceleration is no mystery. The United Nations reports that our use of natural resources has tripled in 40 years. The great expansion of mining, logging, meat production and industrial fishing is cleansing the planet of its wild places and natural wonders. What economists proclaim as progress, ecologists recognise as ruin. This is what has driven the quadrupling of oceanic dead zones since 1950; the “biological annihilation” represented by the astonishing collapse of vertebrate populations; the rush to carve up the last intact forests; the vanishing of coral reefs, glaciers and sea ice; the shrinkage of lakes, the drainage of wetlands. The living world is dying of consumption. We have a fatal weakness: a failure to perceive incremental change. As natural systems shift from one state to another, we almost immediately forget what we have lost. I have to make a determined effort to remember what I saw in my youth. Could it really be true that every patch of nettles, at this time of year, was reamed with caterpillar holes? That flycatchers were so common I scarcely gave them a second glance? That the rivers, around the autumn equinox, were almost black with eels? Others seem oblivious. When I have criticised current practice, farmers have sent me images of verdant monocultures of perennial ryegrass, with the message: “Look at this and try telling me we don’t look after nature.” It’s green, but it’s about as ecologically rich as an airport runway. One reader, Michael Groves, records the shift he has seen in the field beside his house, where the grass that used to be cut for hay is now cut for silage. Watching the cutters being driven at great speed across the field, he realised that any remaining wildlife would be shredded. Soon afterwards, he saw a roe deer standing in the mown grass. She stayed throughout the day and the following night. When he went to investigate, he found her fawn, its legs amputated. “I felt sickened, angry and powerless … how long had it taken to die?” That “grass-fed meat” the magazines and restaurants fetishise? This is the reality. When our memories are wiped as clean as the land, we fail to demand its restoration. Our forgetting is a gift to industrial lobby groups and the governments that serve them. Over the past few months I have been told repeatedly that the environment secretary, Michael Gove, gets it. I have said so myself: he genuinely seems to understand what the problems are and what needs to be done. Unfortunately, he doesn’t do it. Gove cannot be blamed for all of the fiascos to which he has put his name. The 25-year plan for nature was, it seems, gutted by the prime minister’s office. The environmental watchdog he proposed was de-fanged by the Treasury (it has subsequently been lent some dentures by parliament). Other failures are all his own work. In response to lobbying from sheep farmers, Gove has allowed ravens, a highly intelligent and long-lived species just beginning to recover from centuries of persecution, to be killed once more in order to protect lambs. There are 23 million sheep in this country and 7,400 pairs of ravens. Why must all other species give way to the white plague? Responding to complaints that most of our national parks are wildlife deserts, Gove set up a commission to review them. But governments choose their conclusions in advance, through the appointments they make. A more dismal, backward-looking and uninspiring panel would be hard to find: not one of its members, as far as I can tell, has expressed a desire for significant change in our national parks, and most of them, if their past statements are anything to go by, are determined to keep them in their sheep-wrecked and grouse-trashed state. Now the lobbyists demand a New Zealand settlement for farming after Brexit: deregulated, upscaled, hostile to both wildlife and the human eye. If they get their way no landscape, however treasured, will be safe from broiler sheds and mega dairy units, no river protected from runoff and pollution, no songbird saved from local extinction. The merger between Bayer and Monsanto brings together the manufacturer of the world’s most lethal pesticides with the manufacturer of the world’s most lethal herbicides. Already the concentrated power of these behemoths is a hazard to democracy; together they threaten both political and ecological disaster. Labour’s environment team has scarcely a word to say about any of it. Similarly, the big conservation groups have gone missing in inaction. We forget even our own histories. We fail to recall, for example, that the 1945 Dower report envisaged wilder national parks than we now possess, and that the conservation white paper the government issued in 1947 called for the kind of large-scale protection that is considered edgy and innovative today. Remembering is a radical act. That caterpillar, by the way, was a six-spot burnet: the larva of a stunning iridescent black and pink moth that once populated my neighbourhood. I will not allow myself to forget again: I will work to recover the knowledge I have lost. For I now see that without the power of memory, we cannot hope to defend the world we love. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Record high temperatures have been set across much of the world this week as an unusually prolonged and broad heatwave intensifies concerns about climate change. The past month has seen power shortages in California as record heat forced a surge of demand for air conditioners. Algeria has experienced the hottest temperature ever reliably registered in Africa. Britain, meanwhile, has experienced its third longest heatwave, melting the roof of a science building in Glasgow and exposing ancient hill forts in Wales.  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the rising temperatures were at odds with a global cyclical climate phenomenon known as La Niña, which is usually associated with cooling. 28 June Glasgow 31.9CBelfast 29.5CDenver, US 40.6C 2 July Montreal, Canada 36.6CYerevan, Armenia 42C 4 July Tbilisi, Georgia 40.5C 5 July Ouargla, Algeria 51.3C 9 July Tianxiang, Taiwan 40.3C 11 July  Saih al-Salem 51.4C  “The first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year to date on record,” said Clare Nullis of the WMO. Taiwan is the most recent place to report a new high with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang on Monday. This followed a flurry of other anomalies. Last week, a weather station at Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara Desert, reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C on 5 July, the highest temperature reliably recorded in Africa.  Even when the sun goes down, night is not providing the cooling relief it once did in many parts of the world. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world. Downtown Los Angeles also saw a new monthly July minimum overnight record of 26.1C on 7 July. Globally, the warmest year on record was in 2016, boosted by the natural climate cycle El Niño. Last year, temperatures hit the highest level without that amplifying phenomenon. This year, at the other cooling end of the cycle, is continuing the overall upward trend. Swathes of the northern hemisphere have seen unusually persistent warmth due to strong, persistent high pressure systems that have created a “heat dome” over much of Eurasia. “What’s unusual is the hemispheric scale of the heatwave,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “It’s not just the magnitude in any one location but that high temperatures are being seen over such a large area.” Northern Russia’s exceptionally sunny weather – seen on TV by billions thanks to the World Cup – has caused wildfires that affected 80,000 hectares of forest near the Krasnoyarsk region, which reported daily anomalies of 7C above average. The Western Siberian Hydromet Center has issued storm warnings after temperatures of more than 30C for five days. Climate watchers fear this will accelerate the melting of permafrost, releasing methane – a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. In California, daytime records were also set last week at Chino (48.9C), Burbank airport (45.6C) and Van Nuys airport (47.2C). In Canada, at least 54 deaths have been attributed to the prolonged heatwave and high humidity in Quebec. Montreal saw a new record high temperature of 36.6C on 2 July. In Europe, the WMO has warned of droughts, wildfires and harvest losses after the second hottest June on record. Over the past two weeks, records have been set in Tbilisi (40.5C), Shannon (32C), and Belfast (29.5C)  Britain has cooled slightly in the past two days, after 17 days of temperatures over 28C. This was the third longest heatwave on record, following the record 19-day run in 2013 and the famous summer of 1976, when there were two prolonged spells of 18 days and 15 days. Dean Hall of the UK’s Met Office said Britain’s temperatures were forecast to rise again over the coming week. The concern is that weather fronts – hot and cold – are being blocked more frequently due to climate change. This causes droughts and storms to linger, amplifying the damage they cause. This was a factor in the recent devastating floods in Japan, where at least 150 people died after rainfall up to four times the normal level. Paolo Ruti of the WMO said it was difficult to ascribe any one weather event to climate change, but that recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts were in line with forecasts of how rising emissions will affect the climate. “Recent analysis suggests that anthropogenic forcing might indeed affect the characteristics of summer blocking events in the Euro-Asia sector, in particular leading to longer blocking episodes,” he said.  Extreme weather events have buffeted much of the world over the past 12months, from the “Day Zero” drought in Cape Town to the abnormally powerful hurricanes Harvey and Irma that buffeted the east coast of the US and Caribbean.   Underscoring the link, a new report from scientists at the World Weather Attribution group indicates that manmade climate change and its effect on rainfall made the recent Cape Town drought three times more likely."
"The United Nations Special Rapporteur on indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, has released a report highly critical of the global conservation movement and calling for indigenous peoples and other local communities to have a greater say in protecting the world’s forests. Titled Cornered by Protected Areas and co-authored with the US-based NGO Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI), the report is an explicit condemnation of “fortress conservation.” What exactly is meant by that? It is “the idea that to protect forests and biodiversity, ecosystems need to function in isolation, devoid of people,” the Rapporteur told the Guardian. “This model - favoured by governments for over a century - ignores the growing body of evidence that forests thrive when Indigenous Peoples remain on their customary lands and have legally recognised rights to manage and protect them.”  The report effectively consists of an open letter by the Rapporteur, a brief by her and two former RRI employees, and five case-studies on India, Indonesia, Panama, Peru and the Republic of the Congo written by other researchers. It was made public during the recent Oslo Tropical Forest Forum. Here are 10 of the most fascinating take-aways: 1 Vast areas. The global network of “protected areas” such as national parks expanded by 80% between 1970 and 1985 - the majority in so-called “developing” countries - and today they cover 15% of global land surface excluding Antarctica. Expanding the network is integral to meeting the aims of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Such areas are seen as a fundamental way of combatting anthropomorphic climate change and protecting the world’s forests, biodiversity and ecosystems. 2 Devastating impacts. Huge areas of indigenous peoples’ and other local communities’ land have been overlapped by “protected areas”, according to the Rapporteur, and the impacts are alleged to have been devastating. They include an estimated 250,000 people forcibly evicted from their homes and land between 1990 and 2014 according to one study, houses burnt down, access to land and important sites denied, extrajudicial killings, social conflict, access to justice obstructed, and food sovereignty eroded by bans on subsistence hunting and the “vilification” and “criminalisation” of “slash-and-burn” agriculture. “Protected areas” have caused - and continue to cause - “chronic patterns of abuse” and “large-scale human rights violations.” 3 Lots of words, little action. Despite commitments by “the world’s most influential conservation organisations” to respect indigenous peoples and other local communities’ rights, it is argued that “little has changed” in practice over the last 14 years. Which conservation organisations exactly? The Rapporteur doesn’t say, but she footnotes a 2014 report summarising commitments made by Birdlife, Conservation International, Fauna and Flora International, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, The Nature Conservancy, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature.  4 Local peoples’ contributions. Indigenous peoples and other local communities are described as “effective biodiversity and conservation managers”, and the “primary custodians of most of the world’s remaining tropical forests and biodiversity hotspots.” Tree cover loss is reported to be less than half on land that is indigenous- and/or community-run when compared to elsewhere, and when rights to own their land are legally recognised “the difference is even greater.” 5 Not enough rights or money. Despite such contributions, the Rapporteur argues that there has been “no or limited recognition of rights” and that indigenous peoples and local communities receive “only a small percentage” of official “protected areas” funding, which is roughly estimated at $6-6.5 billion a year and called “consistently inadequate.” However, indigenous peoples and other local communities themselves are reported to be “substantial investors”, and represent better value for money than official conservation funding by achieving “at least equal results with a fraction of the budget.” 6 Tigers v tribes. The India case-study focuses on tiger reserves - reportedly comprising 50 of 617 “protected areas’” but capturing 70% of the national conservation budget - and one in particular now called the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve. Many people - mostly Soliga adivasi - have been forcibly relocated, denied access to land and important sites, and banned from hunting, “shifting cultivation” agriculture and traditional forest management using controlled burning. There was some good news in 2011 when 32 Soliga settlements were granted rights under the 2006 Forest Rights Act - reportedly India’s first case of rights being given to a community in a protected area under that law - and another 10 communities were granted rights earlier this year, but financial and state support for community-run conservation “has not been forthcoming.” Some settlements still face relocation. 7 Indigenous peoples in “isolation.” The Peru case-study focuses on the Manu National Park in the Amazon where the situation is made even more complicated by the presence of indigenous peoples living in “isolation” or “initial contact.” Despite some advances, a system to protect them is reportedly “yet to be developed”, while four “stable” - effectively “contacted” - indigenous communities remain without title to their land and have had their collective rights “infringed upon.” The park was established “on the basis it would be inviolable and free of human interference”, but the heart of it was - and remains - indigenous territory. 8 Connection to nature. One point emerging from the report is the importance of their land to indigenous peoples and other local communities. This is emphasised in the case-studies on Indonesia, which describes forests as “forming the basis” of indigenous peoples’ “existence and identities”, and India, which describes the landscape in the tiger reserve as “alive with meaning and connection” for the Soliga - “none of which is recognised by protectionist conservation.” The Rapporteur puts it like this: “In indigenous worldviews people are seen largely as intrinsic parts of nature rather than as distinct and separate from it,” and “many share an ethical interconnection with nature through their languages, beliefs, and practices” which reflects “a commitment to respecting and caring for the natural world.” 9 Culture clash. Another point that emerges is how indigenous peoples’ and other local communities’ worldviews differ to that of governments and the global conservation movement. The India case-study reports that the Soliga think a “good” forest means an “open-canopy savanna woodland”, but for the government and conservationists the “ideal condition” is a “closed forest.” In the Indonesia case-study, one Kasepuhan leader is quoted as saying: “conservation has different meanings for people with or without education. For local people, we are doing conservation, we are taking responsibility for what is alive and what has died. But for people with education, conservation means that we do not do anything: when forest is green, people can only look at it.” 10 What to do - now and urgently. All the case-studies make country-specific recommendations, but the Rapporteur’s brief issues a rallying-cry to “take down the wall of fortress conservation” and calls for a “new approach” to conservation in general. It lists four things that urgently need doing now: 1) create a global “monitoring and grievance mechanism; 2) establish national “accountability and reparation mechanisms”; 3) ensure the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is fully integrated into all future conservation and climate change mitigation measures; and 4) spend more conservation finance on “community-run conservation initiatives” based around an “emerging suite of approaches such as co-management, indigenous-managed protected areas, and indigenous territorial governance.”"
"The year 2018 is on track to be the fourth warmest on record, beaten only by 2016, 2015 and 2017. In other words, we have had the warmest four-year run since we started measuring. According to data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), June 2018 is the 402nd consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average. The UK’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that we could see summer temperatures reaching 38C by the 2040s, leading to a potential 7,000 heat-related deaths a year. One hot summer does not a changing climate make, but the trend in the global data is now irrefutable. When Michael Mann published the “hockey stick” graph back in 1998, there was vociferous public pushback, yet the observed temperature rises match what Mann had predicted. Today’s hockey stick graph isn’t a forward projection but a historical record. The world has been getting hotter, and it will continue to do so. The only question now is how much hotter it gets.  The mechanisms behind this are not difficult to understand. Over a period of millions of years, carbon became trapped in deposits under the Earth’s crust, as coal, oil and natural gas. As the great engines of industrialisation came online across the planet, humanity developed an insatiable hunger for this trapped carbon. Burning it powered the machines that drove economic growth and development, which in turn raised the demand for more machines and more carbon. Carbon that took millions of years to trap has been released into the atmosphere at a rate that is, in geological terms, almost instantaneous. We have known about the probable impact that this sudden release of carbon into the atmosphere would have on the Earth’s climate since the middle of the last century. However, we have been unable and unwilling to do anything about it. To pull that carbon out of the ground we created giant corporations whose sole role was to find it, mine it and sell it. Our demand led to vast profits for these companies, and unfathomable riches for the people running them. This meant that when the research showed that our insatiable carbon demand needed to be curbed for the good of the planet, there was a very powerful interest group in place with a vested interest in keeping it going. We know now that the fossil fuel extraction industry has known about climate change since at least 1977, when James L Black, a scientist at Exxon, gave a presentation to the company’s board detailing his research into global warming. A year later, in 1978, Black would write a memo saying: “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.” But by the time this 10-year window closed in 1988, the energy companies had been pouring money not into reducing carbon but into denying the reality of climate change. Through well-orchestrated media campaigns and lobbying efforts, a standard narrative of denial had been firmly entrenched as common knowledge. Climate change isn’t happening, they said, and even if it is happening it’s nothing to do with us, and even if it is something to do with us it would be too expensive to change it. The fossil fuel lobby managed to convince lawmakers and huge swaths of the broader public that this was a battle between “business” on the one hand, and a coalition of corrupt scientists and hippies on the other. But not all businesses are energy companies. Every business and every person lives on the planet now, where costs will rise because of climate change. A study by the Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) working group found that losses due to climate change could reach up to 19% of GDP in some parts of the world by 2030. For all our talk of climate denial being the “business” position, we’ve strangely ignored the insurance industry, especially the climate research branches of the major reinsurance firms. Swiss Re is part of the ECA working group, and Munich Re’s geo risks research department has been in place since 1973, four years before Black wrote his memo. This is not because reinsurance is some enclave of liberal hippies nestled in the bosom of capitalism, but because their industry, by definition, can’t rely on kicking the can down the road and letting someone else pick up the pieces. If we get floods, famines and droughts leading to mass migration events, they’ll be among the ones paying out. It was easy to let ourselves believe that what was good for energy companies would be good for us all, because the immediate upsides of the cheap carbon windfall were so compelling. There was no problem that couldn’t be solved by throwing more fossil fuels at it, and the reality of climate change threatened to tell us what it cost. The fossil fuel industry told us that we could take out an interest-only mortgage against the future of the planet and prices would always go up, interest rates would always go down and there would never be a reckoning. We now find ourselves facing repayments on the scale of trillions of dollars. That does not even cover the human costs that these dry figures obscure: the lives lost, the homes flooded, the farms wasted away to drought. It is impossible to map the path not taken. Perhaps a commitment to reducing carbon consumption could have spurred innovation in alternative sources of energy. Or maybe the path we are on is an inevitable result of an economic system that cannot stop unless it crashes. We’ve seen the “Minsky cycle” of speculation leading to crash play out time and again in the financial sector; perhaps climate change is a centuries-long Minsky cycle we could never hope to stop. Maybe we are destined to become the civilisational equivalent of Monty Python’s Mr Creosote, a man who gorged himself until he literally exploded. Regardless of the alternative histories and the might-have-beens, it may be too late to stop it, but we still need to learn an important lesson. If a CEO tells us that it would be bad for business if they weren’t allowed to pump poison into the air and water, then that’s too bad for them: one business is not an economy, and it certainly isn’t a biosphere. We’d have survived the crisis of an oil CEO missing out on his fifth yacht, but many won’t survive the consequences of letting them lead us by the nose into disaster. • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"
"Women around the world who are leading the fight against climate damage are to be highlighted by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and UN high commissioner, in the hopes of building a new global movement that will create “a feminist solution for climate change”. Perhaps more revolutionary still, the new initiative is light-hearted in tone, optimistic in outlook and presents positive stories in what the originators hope will be seen as a fun way.  Called Mothers of Invention, the initiative will kick off with a series of podcasts showcasing the work of grassroots climate activists at a local level, as well as globally resonant initiatives such as the legal challenges under way in numerous jurisdictions to force governments to adhere to the Paris agreement goals. Scientists and politicians feature alongside farmers and indigenous community leaders from Europe, the US and Australia to India, Kenya, South Africa and Peru. The podcast is a first for Robinson, who has focused on climate justice for the last 15 years through her charity, the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, and as one of the Elders group, after seeing at first-hand as UN commissioner for human rights the danger that global warming presents to women whose lives are already precarious. “Climate change is a manmade problem that requires a feminist solution,” she said ahead of the podcast launch. “What we are hoping to do is create a movement. Climate change is not gender-neutral – it affects women far more. So this is not about climate change, it is about climate justice.” The movement, she added, would grow organically from the women who feature and the women who join in: “It will be happening in an unstructured way, which is all the better, because we are not prescribing what a feminist solution should look like, we are listening – we want women to tell us what they want. That to me is more interesting.” Robinson has paired with Maeve Higgins, an Irish-born comedian based in New York and self-styled “sidekick”. They jointly introduce their female guests through a series of informal conversations larded with backchat and jokes – an unusual way of presenting the often gloomy subject of climate damage, Higgins admits, but one she hopes will reach people more effectively than the standard models of climate communication and male-dominated discourse. “There is a lot of doom and gloom – this is not like that,” Higgins said. “This is for people like myself who feel stuck, knowing there are actions they should be taking but paralysed by despondency. The capitalist patriarchy is not going to solve this. We need to.” The internet provides the means to reach women all over the world, she said: “This is democratic, this is available to as many people as possible.” The series will bring in issues of colonialism, racism, poverty, migration and social justice and how these are bound up with feminism and the effects of climate change, and will include related environmental issues such as plastic pollution. Podcasts are new departure for Robinson. “This is taking me way beyond my comfort zone,” she said. But “I’m willing to go there – I am so urgent about the fact that we need to do more.” The first five episodes in the series, which is funded by philanthropic foundations, focus on women, but Robinson promised the initiative would not exclude men’s voices. “We will include men in the future,” she said, “but we have started with women, who have found it hard to be heard. A feminist solution to climate change involves everyone.”"
"The wildfires in Lancashire and Greater Manchester are a disaster, not least because of the blot on the landscape they will leave behind once the flames are out. Although the hot dry weather is clearly to blame, so too is damage over the years from drainage that dried out the peat and turned it into a powder keg. Peatlands may not look glamorous but they are a hugely important national treasure. They help prevent floods by soaking up rain like a sponge, and can hold about 20 times their own weight in water. And more than 70% of Britain’s drinking water comes from peatlands, feeding into supplies for 28 million people. The plants in peatlands absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking away staggering amounts of carbon – about 5.5bn tonnes, more than half the country’s entire carbon storage – and that helps curb climate change. In comparison, British forests store only 150m tonnes of carbon. However, damaged moorlands do the opposite, releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases, made even worse when smoke particulates enter the atmosphere. Britain has some of the finest peatlands in the world, but they need protection. They need to be kept wet and prevented from being drained for farming or development, or dug up for garden compost."
"The Queensland and Victorian governments will be hit with a new television advertising campaign in an effort to persuade them to torpedo the national energy guarantee at a critical meeting in early August. The activist group GetUp has combined with Greenpeace to bankroll what it describes as hard-hitting television advertisements targeting the two Labor-held states ahead of a meeting of energy ministers in August that will make or break the Turnbull government’s signature energy policy.  Opponents of the national energy guarantee have been frustrated that the Victorian government thus far has been muted in its public criticism of the scheme, and fear the Australian Capital Territory – which has been persistently critical – won’t sink the Neg at the Coag energy council unless one of the larger states is also on board. With the Queensland energy minister, Anthony Lynham, calling in key stakeholders on Thursday to take soundings on the policy, GetUp’s national director, Paul Oosting, told Guardian Australia the activist group “expects all states to use their veto power” in August and fight for a national energy policy that would cut pollution and assist the transition to renewables. The Australian Conservation Foundation echoed GetUp’s stance, declaring the current policy “unsupportable” because the emissions reduction target is insufficient to see Australia meet its commitments under the Paris agreement, and the policy as drafted makes it difficult to adjust the level of ambition. The ACF’s Gavan McFadzean said: “What every state and territory government needs to understand is that if they sign up to this Neg, they own it and its woefully inadequate 26% pollution reduction target, locked in to 2030. “It won’t be just Malcolm Turnbull’s Neg, or Tony Abbott’s, but Daniel Andrews’ and Annastacia Palaszczuk’s as well.” The Turnbull government needs the backing of states that are in the national electricity market to implement the Neg, with any one jurisdiction possessing the power to kill the scheme. Business groups have lined up in support of the Neg, urging a truce in the decade-long toxic political battle over climate and energy policy. They want a settled policy mechanism to give energy market participants certainty to invest. Privately, some business stakeholders would also be relaxed about the commonwealth legislating a scheme that would make ramping up the level of ambition in the emissions reduction target easier to achieve – understanding that could help get the Labor states over the line on the mechanism. But adding that flexibility could sink the policy when it returns for consideration by the Coalition party room, assuming the states don’t end it first. The energy policy fight has been complicated in recent weeks by a renewed push by some Nationals and conservative Liberals to make ongoing support for coal part of the quid pro quo for supporting the Neg. The states are also processing a new report this week from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which recommended major changes to the electricity market, including the commonwealth underwriting new generation projects in order to get more competition into the system and lower prices for consumers. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has added the new ACCC report to the agenda for discussion at the critical August meeting. Nationals this week have attempted to front-run the debate and shape public perceptions of the report by claiming the ACCC investigation supports government backing of new coal generation, when the relevant recommendation is clearly technology-neutral. The ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, told Guardian Australia the report was being used by Liberals and Nationals “shamelessly to back up each of their internal arguments about the Neg”. He warned: “Unless the Coalition sorts out what the Neg will finally look like, it will be impossible for Coag to endorse or reject it.” Frydenberg and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have both said the proposed government underwriting would apply to all technologies that met the criteria, including, potentially, coal projects, as well as gas and renewables with battery back-up. But Turnbull has also pushed back against the Nationals. On Thursday Turnbull said: “We are not in the business of subsidising one technology or another. We’ve done enough of that. I mean, frankly, too much of that has been done.” He said subsidies for various forms of energy were in the process of winding down “and we should simply allow the technologies to compete”. Turnbull said the outcome the government was seeking was lower energy prices. The shadow federal climate change minister, Mark Butler, has declared it is a “fantasy” that anyone would seek to build a new coal-fired power station underwritten by the commonwealth, and he warned government MPs against hijacking a useful investigation by Australia’s competition watchdog. Butler said the idea of the government underwriting new market entrants with generation projects was an idea “very worthy of consideration, but unfortunately it’s already been hijacked by these ideological zealots in the Coalition party room”. “Everyone in the industry has recognised that building new coal-fired power stations, one isn’t suitable for the nature of the market in the future; it’s not sufficiently flexible, it’s more expensive than other power options, but also there is very substantial carbon risk, regulatory risk, price risk, associated with building new, high polluting, or high emitting assets,” Butler said. “That’s why the industry won’t go near it, investors, bankers, won’t go near it, because they understand quite how risky it is.”"
"Roger Gray has lived in his suburban subdivision in a quiet California city for 30 years. On Thursday, it was struck by a jaw-dropping geophysical phenomenon. Gray had defied orders to evacuate Redding, in the far north of the state, which was threatened by the fast-growing Carr fire outside town. He and his neighbors wanted to defend their homes. A navy veteran, Gray worked 10 hours preparing his house and was already exhausted when he saw plumes of smoke in the distance. “Then they started to swirl together, and I’m going, ‘Oh, we’re in trouble,’” he said.  His wife evacuated without him, driving through a maelstrom of smoke and burning tree limbs. Not long after, “it was raining fire”, Gray said. He could hear exploding paint cans and ammunition in the distance; he guessed the flames were 100m tall. “Are we going to die?” his neighbor asked him. The firenado, a huge rotating whorl of smoke, flame and ash, was upon them.  Recent wildfires in California are notable for their ferocity. At least six people have died, including two firefighters, in the past month in fires that continue to blaze, and 44 died as a result of last year’s wine country fires. The conflagrations have also spawned bizarre pyrotechnics, from firenados to towering pyrocumulus clouds that evoke a nuclear detonation. These events are not aberrations, say experts. They are California’s future. As of Monday morning, the Carr fire had burned more than 98,000 acres, and containment stood at 20%, with more than 5,000 structures threatened. In the evening, Cal Fire officials began lifting evacuation orders, allowing residents mostly on the east side of the fire to return home. Awareness of fires “is not just because the news is covering it more”, said Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “More acres are burning. That is almost certainly due to climate change.” As the climate shifts, so does fire behavior. Summers are longer and drier. Sometimes the winter rains are meager for years, as in the recent five-year drought. Sometimes, like this year, they are torrential, producing explosive plant growth that, several months later, desiccates into prime accelerant. The needle is moving, but where it will stop is anybody’s guess. “Climate change is continuing to unfold,” said Anthony LeRoy Westerling, a professor of management of complex systems at the University of California, Merced. “The impacts from it will probably accelerate. There won’t be a new normal in our lifetimes.”  He said the Carr fire is one of “a bunch of large fires which have behaved in uncharacteristic ways” in recent years in the west.  More acres are burning. That is almost certainly due to climate change Gabriel Lauderdale, a firefighter from Redding, said the rhythm has changed even during his 10 years fighting fires. When he started, sometimes years passed without fires so big that his company was called to help outside their county. “Now, it doesn’t just happen every year, it happens multiple times every year,” he said. He hasn’t been home since 25 June because he has been helping fight fires all over the state. Of the firenado on Roger Gray’s homey street, he said: “A lot of people have said they’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve never seen anything like this. We can’t look at this as a one-time incident. We have to look at it as: what if it continues to happen?” Lauderdale said he worried about the way these fires strain resources when they get too large, as well as lack of public awareness among city residents – like those in Redding or last year in the wine country city of Santa Rosa – who might not think they are at risk during wildfire season.  Most of all, though, he said he worried about firefighters getting worn down and becoming unable to do their jobs at this intensity for long periods of time, as California’s fire season grows longer. Departments are emphasizing family time and a firefighter’s mental and physical health, he said. Sometimes they bring peer counselors or therapy dogs to especially difficult fire sites.He hesitated to link the recent firefighter deaths – four in recent weeks, including two at the Carr fire – to fatigue, since each death occurs under different circumstances. But “in 12 months, this is the fifth firefighter death on a fire I’ve been on”, he said. The fire inspector who died earlier this week in the Carr fire, Jeremy Stoke, was Lauderdale’s friend and teacher, which has made working on the Carr fire especially painful. “There isn’t a way to rationalize it other than – he made a sacrifice for his community and the city he lived in,” Lauderdale said. “There is not easy way to wrap your head around it. I can’t let myself think about it too much. I don’t know if I’d be able to continue if I did.” Scientists emphasize that climate change is not the only way humans are implicated in California’s astonishing fires and should not be used to “relinquish local or individual responsibility” said University of Oregon researcher Mark Carey. Increasingly, people are building in risky areas, and forest managers have allowed stands to grow too dense.  The most recent victims are still shocked by what they witnessed. Gray was lucky: he was able to defend his Redding home. “We know we’re vulnerable,” said Bernadette Coe, who has lived in a nearby town since 1985. “But there’s never been a fire this close or this fierce”."
"I had the same “crossed line” experience (Letters, 26 July) in 1977, during the run-up to the ABC official secrets trial. I was on the phone to my MP (another of his constituents was Crispin Aubrey, the A of ABC) when we heard an echoey recording of what had just been said. “Don’t worry,” he said. “It’s only the secret services; they’re not very good at it.” I suggested the MP might have a word about it with his older brother, who happened to have been foreign secretary and deputy leader of the Labour party, George Brown.Christopher GordonWinchester, Hampshire • As a nine-year-old passenger in his Morris Minor (Letters, passim), I was intrigued to see the then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Sir Trenchard Cox, a colleague of my father, brandishing a wooden-handled washing-up mop as he drove to remove the condensation that formed on the windscreen as a result of the inadequacy of the car’s heater.Stephen MusgraveDanbury, Essex  • Zoe Williams’s piece (The beach: my idea of an existential crisis, G2, 26 July) brings to mind Bill Hicks’s reason for preferring to lounge in his bath at home rather than going to the beach, “where water meets dirt”: “That way I can listen to music I like.”Bob LambChester • We’re in the middle of a heatwave, yet in my street the only people who hang washing out to dry are the Greek family that were here pre-gentrification.

"Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on an anti-carbon tax Resolution. The Resolution was introduced by Steve Scalise (R-LA) with essentially the same language as he introduced in 2013 and 2016. On those past versions, every Republican House member voted against carbon taxes. This time, six Republicans rejected the Resolution and one abstained, voting ‘Present.’ However, 97% of the House Republicans on the floor voted against carbon taxes.  House Democrats have been fairly consistent in their votes on these Resolutions as well. In 2013, 94% voted against the Resolution, and in 2016 and 2018, 96% voted ‘Nay,’ with six to seven pro-fossil fuel Democrats voting ‘Yes.’ The text of the Resolution claims that carbon taxes are necessarily bad for America: Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy … [and] to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. This week’s Resolution ironically came right on the heels of a comprehensive study showing that a carbon tax whose revenues were returned to taxpayers either via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes would have a negligible impact on the economy – significantly less than the cost of unchecked global warming. In fact, research has shown that it’s global warming that will seriously slow economic growth. We already pay a ""carbon tax"". It's the extra money we pay on electricity to run our air conditioners; it's the price increases due to agricultural impacts of heat and precip. changes; it's the cost of sea level rise; 1/2 https://t.co/D6OyvPmXeY Simply put, the only way to protect the economy is to stop global warming. Accomplishing that will require that virtually every world country implement climate policies aimed at curbing carbon pollution. That was the purpose of the Paris climate accords. Disgracefully, the Trump administration made America the only country in the world whose leadership rejects that international climate agreement. But a carbon tax would be one of the most effective and efficient ways to cut America’s carbon pollution.  The text of the Resolution has it exactly backwards – a carbon tax would help protect the American economy by slowing global warming and its detrimental effects on economic growth. Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) Executive Director Mark Reynolds characterized yesterday’s vote as progress, saying: The fact that six Republicans voted ‘no’ on an anti-carbon tax resolution is an indication that there are cracks in the wall separating Democrats and Republicans on climate change. At the CCL blog, Flannery Winchester also noted that the number of co-sponsors on Scalise’s Resolutions dropped from 155 in 2013, to 82 in 2016, to just 48 in 2018. That’s a nearly 70% decline over five years and an encouraging sign that the number of vehement anti-carbon tax members of Congress is dwindling. Given that the share of the Republican vote against carbon taxes only dropped from 100% in 2016 to 97% in 2018, the cracks are still small, but a crack is better than an unyielding wall of denial. Nevertheless, it’s frustrating that just four of the 43 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus voted against the Resolution (with one more abstaining by voting ‘Present’). Especially given the conditions under which yesterday’s vote happened: It really should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and yet only a handful of Republicans voted the right way. Climate Solutions Caucus member Darrell Issa (R-CA) explained his ‘Yes’ vote, saying a “carbon tax isn’t the solution” and that the Caucus should focus on policies that can generate bipartisan support, like energy efficiency programs and keeping nuclear power plants open.  Those are indeed valid climate policies. They’re also wholly insufficient to tackle global warming, and if Republicans can only support inadequate climate policies, they’re unbefitting the role of governance. The cracks in the wall should be much bigger by now. A new study by Robert Brulle identified why the CCL volunteer lobbying on this Resolution was relatively ineffective: Professional lobbying organizations are a permanent presence on Capitol Hill. Thus, the vast expenditures and continuous presence of professional lobbyists limit the impact of volunteer climate advocates. Brulle found that over $2bn has been spent lobbying Congress on climate change legislation since 2000 (an average of $125m per year). And an analysis by the Center for American Progress found that in 2009–2010 leading up to a vote on a cap and trade bill, the fossil fuel industry spent over $500m lobbying against it. In Washington DC, money talks, as Brulle noted: We seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then it’ll happen. My answer to that is, gee, well, we should have gun control legislation then. Fortunately, Americans have an opportunity to remedy this problem in less than four months, when every House member will be up for election in the 2018 midterms.  If we agree that climate change poses an existential threat (it does), that this should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and that Republican members of Congress are beholden to the fossil fuel industry rather than voter preferences, then the answer is simple. In November, Americans should replace all members of Congress who voted in favor of the Resolution and who face opponents that aren’t in bed with the fossil fuel industry."
"An unusually dry winter, with less than average rainfall interspersed with localised flooding in some areas, is emerging as a major contributing factor to the wildfires that are ravaging the mainland of Greece. Lack of the expected steady rainfall in the winter months meant groundwater sources failed to recharge and left vegetation unable to recover fully from the high temperatures of the 2017 summer. As a result, when temperatures topping 40C hit some areas during this summer’s heatwave and drought, the conditions were already in place for wildfires to take hold. Strong winds then fanned the flames and spread the fires widely before stretched fire-fighting teams could gain control. The fact that the fires took hold on land close to densely inhabited and resort areas was largely a matter of chance, but one that led to a death toll of more than 70 people and wrought devastation on homes. These are widely regarded as the short-term causes of the fires, but experts are also concerned that the conditions experienced in Greece in the last two years are likely to be replicated more often in future, owing to the changing climate. Nikos Charalambides, executive director of Greenpeace Greece, said: “As the death toll rises and the full size of the disaster is still to be recorded, it would be premature to attribute these [fires] to either climate change or the failures of the fire prevention and fire-fighting mechanisms.” However, he said the contributing factors included drought, strong winds and unusually high temperatures, all of which are likely to be aggravated by climate change. The current heatwave across Europe and much of the northern hemisphere could be seen as “a foretaste of what weather extremes we are threatened by as the climate crisis progresses”, said Charalambides. Growing more trees and managing forests properly would help to make the land more resilient to droughts, heatwaves and fires, he added. Forests also act as a cooling factor on the local climate and support a range of biodiversity. Charalambides also called for a greater focus on the prevention of fires in Greece in place of a traditional focus on boosting firefighting capacity. Alongside this, there should be more emphasis on drawing up plans for evacuation in the case of disaster, particularly in areas where pine forests are near to human habitation. Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The immediate priority must be to tackle the terrible fires, and to support the people whose homes, lives and livelihoods have been put at risk or devastated.” But she said the longer-term impacts must also be taken into account when the immediate danger has passed: “Extreme heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent as climate change takes hold, meaning drier forests and countryside, and a greater risk of fire. Politicians must wake up to the extreme weather battering the planet and take tough and urgent steps to slash the climate-wrecking pollution being pumped into our atmosphere.” Ray Rasker of Headwaters Economics, an expert on wildfires and the built environment in California, said buildings in high-risk areas could be made more resistant to fires in future, often through relatively simple measures. He cited nonflammable roofing material and siding for houses, not using wooden decks, installing fine mesh screens on roof vents, and planting fire-resistant vegetation close to houses. He also warned that in the aftermath of large fires there is often a temptation to waive or loosen high building standards in order to rebuild as quickly as possible, which he said would be a mistake. The short-term Met Office forecast for Greece is for temperatures from around 26C to around 30C, with some localised thunderstorms and a small amount of rainfall in a few areas."
"Some things are, to use Caroline Lucas’s word, “unforgivable”. The decision by MPs to put commercial interests ahead of the needs of our planet when it came to vote on the third runway at Heathrow represents a final, catastrophic betrayal. I had just finished a 14-day hunger strike, along with other Vote No Heathrow campaigners, to try to get across our objection to the idea. We are committed. Boris Johnson – supposedly an avowed critic of the plan – couldn’t even be bothered to turn up.  For 30 years scientists have been making clear the catastrophic and inevitable consequences of climate change. CO2 emissions are altering our planet, and it will lead to humanity’s destruction unless we do something about it. It’s real, it’s happening – our politicians must face facts. At present temperatures have risen 1.2C. Another 0.6C of warming is locked in from already emitted carbon which has yet to increase temperatures. The arctic will likely be ice-free in the summer within the next decade and ice-free all the year round within 10 years after that. The resultant dark earth and water that will replace the reflective ice and snow will create an estimated additional half a degree of warming. These precise numbers are important, because death is not linear but binary. At a certain point you cross from life to death. So where is the line? Two degrees is the answer. As we pass this point, it is no longer possible to grow grains at scale in the centre of Russia and North America, where temperatures will increase twice as fast as the global average. Millions will starve, tens of millions of climate refugees will be heading in our direction, and the world economic system will collapse. We are hurtling towards this moment of truth. We were told by scientists not so long ago that we should not go over 350 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. We are now on 403.3 parts per million. Only a few years ago it was increasing by 2ppm a year. Now it is 3ppm. The rate is increasing exponentially. Never before in its four billion-year history has the Earth experienced such a massive rate of increase. The level of 450ppm is the equivalent of a 2C increase in temperature. We are set to pass this in about 10 years’ time – a blink in geological time. Shortly afterwards we are set to pass 500ppm, after which, in the words of Professor Peter Ward, “all bets are off”.  He can say that because the science is now done on the fundamentally unstable dynamics of the Earth’s geophysical system. CO2 release brings on rapid mass extinction. It has happened 15 times in the geological record. The gas warms the Earth and melts the ice caps. The resultant loss of temperature difference between the poles and the equator leads to loss of wind and ocean currents. The seas become stagnant. They stop producing oxygen and emit hydrogen sulphide instead. The latter is a poisonous gas, and kills all living creatures at 200ppm in the atmosphere.  Scientists have been telling politicians this information for three decades. It is clearly laid out in thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers. Continue to emit CO2 poison, and the world will become toxic. There is no planet B.  When the British public wake up to the fact that all that they cherish and love will soon be destroyed, they will turn on the politicians that allowed this to happen. In the meantime some of us have been working for some time on saving our society. We are preparing to rebel. The Heathrow vote demonstrates that our political system is in the grip of short-term commercial interest, even though it will lead to devastating results. It cannot be reformed from within. John Locke, our greatest political philosopher, laid down a clear response – in such circumstances citizens have a right and indeed the duty to rebel. We have done it before in our history and we are going to do it again. • Rising Up is coordinating a rebellion against the UK government for this November • Roger Hallam is a PhD researcher on effective radical campaign design at King’s College London"
"A Republican lawmaker has proposed that the US introduce a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, in a departure from the party’s decade-long hostility toward any measure aimed at addressing climate change. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, considered a moderate GOP member of Congress, said a carbon tax would avoid “saddling young Americans with a crushing environmental debt” and expressed his belief that “this bill or legislation similar to it” will become law one day.  Curbelo’s bill has virtually no chance of becoming law, however, due to the serried ranks of Republicans in Congress who instinctively reject any sort of government intervention, particularly taxes, to help stem the increasing heatwaves, floods, fierce storms and social upheaval caused by a warming planet. Last week, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a resolution denouncing the idea of a carbon tax as “detrimental to the United States economy”. Of the 43 Republicans who are members of the Climate Solutions Caucus – a bipartisan group formed to help craft climate policy – only six voted against the motion.  Curbelo, one of the six Republicans to vote with Democrats in favor of a carbon tax, has now unveiled his own proposal. Curbelo represents a district that takes in the southern tip of Florida – an area extremely vulnerable to sea level rise – and faces an uphill battle in this year’s midterm elections. His plan would tax industrial carbon dioxide emissions $24 a ton from 2020. It would also scrap federal excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as kill off the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era strategy to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants.  According to Columbia University, Curbelo’s plan would cut the US’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to a third by 2025, putting it on course to meet its commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It would also raise at least $57bn in 2020, growing to at least $63bn by 2030 as the tax increases. Curbelo wants to use this cash to upgrade infrastructure, particularly roads. “While there are still some deniers out there, most Americans today understand that climate change caused by human activity is a reality that must be addressed,” he said.  “I remind my conservative colleagues who often decry our nation’s growing debt; saddling young Americans with a crushing environmental debt – meaning an unhealthy planet where life is less viable – is at least as immoral as leaving behind an unsustainable fiscal debt.” Republican hostility to any sort of action on climate change has hardened over the past decade, despite increasingly urgent warnings from scientists. Donald Trump, who has called global warming “bullshit” and a Chinese-inspired hoax, has taken an axe to various climate regulations and said the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accords. Curbelo’s plan has received a mixed reaction from environmentalists. Some green groups have derided it as an empty re-election gesture that could actually increase emissions in a major sector – transportation – by funneling money into road construction and slashing fuel taxes. Others, though, see it as a sign the American political conversation around climate change is slowly evolving, given a backdrop of increasing public confidence in climate science. “It’s a breakthrough to see a serious Republican proposal take aim at the central environmental threat of our time,” said David Doniger, senior strategic director of the climate and clan energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.  “But this carbon tax plan is only a conversation starter. It falls far short of what’s needed to protect our climate. We must deploy all available tools, not limit them as this bill does, to head off the worst damages from climate change.”  Cities and states have sought to fill the void left by Trump’s retreat from climate change, with several attempting to sue major oil companies for damages.  Last week, a judge tossed out New York City’s claim against five oil giants, stating that the issue should be dealt with by legislation. Similar climate legal action has been launched in recent weeks by Rhode Island and Baltimore."
"In Cairo people swim in the Nile and absorb the heat in their homes with sacks of rice. In Tokyo they carry parasols. Farmers in Bukhara fear for their future, while in Jordan, refugees cover themselves with wet towels. And anyone who can relies on air conditioning (AC).  Around the world, people are trying to cope with the intense and prolonged heat. As always, the most vulnerable in society – the homeless, the elderly, the poor or disenfranchised – are suffering the most. Guardian Cities is investigating heat in cities for a special week of journalism next month. Tell us how heat has affected you.  I live in a house on Waraq Island, in the Nile, with my uncles, their families and grandparents. When we were kids we used to swim in the Nile, and some of us still do to overcome the heat.  The family saved up and bought one AC unit for the living room; now that’s where everyone spends their day – preparing food, watching TV, playing or studying. But it doesn’t always work because the electricity is very weak. My grandmother used to put the bedsheets in the fridge or the cooler, or hold a bag of cold water against our backs. My mother used a trick from Upper Egypt: using sacks of rice and buckwheat to absorb the heat. I plan so that I can spend the day in air-conditioned offices at university or work, only returning home at night. I take the metro every day: when it’s hot, everyone is sweaty and smells. And sometimes the metro breaks down due to the heat. Reported by Ruth Michaelson with Adham Youssef in Cairo It’s much worse this summer than last year. The reflected heat off the ground has been much more intense compared with the last few years. I use a parasol but it doesn’t really help me,because the heat from the ground is so hot.  I try to walk in the shade and also take lots of water, and then use AC in my home during the night. In past summers I used a timer to switch it off two hours after I fell asleep; now I leave it on through the night.  When I leave the office to get lunch, I try to go somewhere nearby. On weekends I try not to go out when the sun is really high. Sometimes I try to escape from Tokyo to cooler areas, but even there it’s too hot this year.  When I was a kid I could sleep with the window open but lately I can’t. I’m concerned about temperatures getting hotter in the future due to climate change; I hope America will stay signed up to the Paris agreement. We rely on AC more and more, which uses electricity, so I think it will get hotter because of that. Reported by Daniel Hurst in Tokyo There have been days when I couldn’t really go out for very long. It’s always been hot in Montreal for a few weeks here and there, but now it feels like it’s double the amount of time we have intense heat. I’m living at the Old Brewery Mission [a non-profit supporting the homeless in Montreal]. I’m also helping some kids on the street; they’re not in as good a situation as me because they don’t have AC. The water situation is not that great. The mission give you popsicles [with electrolytes] … so that replenishes the salts and whatever you need. We dehydrate ourselves and we don’t even know it. Then all of a sudden you’re dizzy; that’s when accidents happen. You don’t have to buy water, you just have to buy one good water container and carry it with you. But we need more water fountains in the parks.  I have bronchitis and pneumonia. I go from here to Saint Denis and Sherbrooke [an intersection about 2km away]. I do it in two or three blocks at a time and I have to find an air-conditioned place and sit down and relax – or sit down and cough – because of the pollution and the heat. There’s a lot of coughing when it starts. Try to find a friendly tree in the city and give it a hug. You have to find some AC, so shopping centres are good and large stores. People should be aware that other people need AC and water. Give them the time of day and a smile, and pass along a little water. Reported by Jillian Kestler-D’Amours in Montreal The prosperity of our whole region depends on the quality of cotton that we produce. Because of the extremely dry climate, we have to keep the soil as wet as possible during the summer to get a good crop in the autumn. This becomes very complicated because the available water evaporates faster as the temperature rises. A lot of local farmers get into debt just keeping the cotton fields watered.  A new channel was created several years ago to get water to Bukhara’s fields from the Amu Darya, the river between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A couple of smaller rivers near Bukhara had dried out. Only 20 or 30 years ago the temperature did not rise too high, farming was easier, there was more rain in the summer.  We have to take this issue seriously now. Life will be really harsh if the temperature keeps rising. Reported by Sevil Khikmatova I work two jobs, like most of the people who sell produce at the laikes [farmers’ markets]: two days a week growing fruits and vegetables in the fields of Marathonas [a town about an hour’s drive north-east of Athens], where I live with my family, and five days selling them at different laikes across Athens. Working outside is always worst at the beginning of a heatwave – as it goes on, the body adapts as much as it can, and you begin to get used to it. Here in the market, working during the afternoon is bearable because we have umbrellas above each stall. Working in the fields is much more difficult: there is no shade, you are constantly in the sun. We start working at 6am: it is light outside but not yet too hot. We rest from 11am and start work again after 4pm until it gets dark. It is also vital to dress properly for the Greek sun – light, light-coloured clothing and hats. Reported by Clea Skopeliti in Athens This year’s heatwave has been remarkable, coupled with rare humidity on consecutive days – like living in a sauna. A colleague recalled that, five or so years ago, he could have cooled himself down in the shade at midday on a summer’s day; now he’s soaked with sweat as soon as he steps outside, and AC is the only remedy. As a northern city in China, Beijing typically has low rainfall and humidity. Clothes could be dried quickly after washing; this year it takes weeks. There are regular heavy downpours, I felt as if I were living in a coastal city. In the past only record-breaking temperatures have captured public attention in China. My home city of Wuhan is famous for its melting weather in summer. But my mom could still jog even on summer days. The highest temperature in Wuhan lately has been 38C, on July 21, and it stayed around 37-38C in the following days. It’s a matter of time before it reaches 40C or higher. Nowadays, people resort to spending their summer holidays in the mountains, where the temperature is lower. In the city, lots of concrete buildings spring up with limited ability to absorb the heat. The ecosystem possesses its own ability to adjust the temperature and to balance living conditions. We need to find a way to rebuild the ecosystem, to restore the balance. Submitted online to Guardian Cities It’s a desert area, and we’re suffering. It is summer so it’s dusty. We live in a caravan, and it’s so hot because they are made of metal. We have different ways of coping. We wake early and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves. Most of the time we soak towels and put them on our heads. In dust storms, we can’t go outside. They are sudden and frequent. We have to close the windows, it’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them. We have issues with asthma. My son has respiratory infections on a regular basis. There is limited electricity in the camp. We have power from six in the evening until four in the morning. But we need it for electric fans during the peak temperatures in the day. We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with an operational water network, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water. Reported by Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem     This summer has been extreme, we went over 40C in July, which has had an average of 30C historically. For the first time, I installed AC in my house. My wife is pregnant, we simply couldn’t survive at home with the unbearable heat. We try to avoid using it because it’s not environmentally-friendly, we tried to get by with fans but we couldn’t. People who can afford to do so usually leave Tbilisi in August, to go to summer houses in one of the surrounding small villages. But because there was such heat, everybody tried to get out of the city earlier. There’s such smog, people don’t go out in the daytime anymore. The city feels empty.  My impression is that, for the last five years or even longer, it’s been getting hotter and hotter every year. It is worrying. The local government is trying to improve air pollution, but it’s targeted at the use of private vehicles. It’s not only about cars, it’s also about the people who live in the city. We need more awareness, but it seems that the issue of climate change is low priority. People are more worried about other things.

"The government’s official climate change adviser says politicians and policymakers are failing to rise to the challenge of a rapidly warming planet and will be judged harshly by future generations unless they act now. Lord Deben, chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC), said “anyone who read the news” could see mounting evidence of alarming trends – from melting polar ice to record heatwaves and rising sea levels. He called on politicians to “make the connections” between these events and act with more urgency. “The thing that I want to bring home to policymakers is that this is increasingly urgent and that these things will be laid at your door if you don’t recognise that and act accordingly.” Deben compared the threat posed by climate change to the black death, adding: “With the black death, where one in three of the population died, we did not know how it happened, how it spread, so we were not responsible.  “With climate change we do know and so we are responsible. So it is no good saying ‘oh well, it will all work out one way or another’. We are responsible, and if we don’t take on that responsibility we are shoving it on to our children and no parent should do that in any circumstances.” Lord Deben’s intervention comes as record high temperatures are being set across much of the world, intensifying concerns about climate change. In the UK the heatwave has contributed to wildfires but environmentalists have expressed exasperation at the government’s environment policies – especially the decision to push ahead with Heathrow expansion and, on the same day, the cancellation of a huge tidal lagoon project in south Wales. Critics said it revealed that much of the governing class – including those Labour MPs who supported the government’s Heathrow expansion plans – had failed to grasp of the scale of the threat posed by climate change Lord Deben praised some politicians, including climate change minister Claire Perry, but warned there was a widespread lack of urgency. “Anybody who has been reading the newspapers will know there is a serious issue about Arctic ice, there are serious issues about Antarctic ice … the current hot period we are experiencing in Britain at the moment does remind us that we have had most of the hottest years we have had in the past 10 to 15 years. “If you add all that to the rising of the sea levels and what is happening to the permafrost, you put those things together – [you] can’t put down any one of them to this year’s global warming, but you can put all of them down together to climate change in general.” The CCC’s annual report, published last month, found the UK is on track to miss its legally binding carbon budgets in 2025 and 2030, due to lack of progress in cutting emissions from buildings and transport. It also said ministers were spurning low-cost options, such as onshore windfarms, home insulation and tree-planting, meaning people would end up paying more than needed to fight climate change. Climate scientists have warned that there would be more wildfires like the one on Saddleworth Moor across northern Europe because of climate change. Deben said that while no one individual weather event could be attributed to climate change the signs of a planet in crisis were undeniable. “This is extremely urgent because these things are now happening much more often and – in aggregate – it is clearly because of climate change.”"
"Over the course of Britain’s sweltering summer, the landlord of the building inhabited by the Observer periodically informs us that our air conditioning is undergoing an “automated controlled shutdown” because the weather has become so hot and humid that the system is at risk of damaging itself. So just when you really need cooling air, you can’t have it. One to be filed under: you couldn’t make it up. This is not uncommon. The offices, factories, homes, roads and railways of Britain were designed on the assumption that it is a country of blessedly temperate conditions, immune to extremes of heat and cold. When people say that Britain is not built to withstand a sizzling summer, this is more literally true than they may know.  We can avoid thinking about what this intense heatwave could mean for the future of the planet by taking careless refuge in the consolation that others are having it much worse. The devastating wildfires in Greece have killed at least 87 people and ignited national fury about the state’s inadequate response. Japan has declared a national disaster after more than 20,000 people were taken to hospital in a week. Algeria has reported the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa: 51.3C. That’s hot. Forests are blazing within the Arctic Circle. That’s not usual. Scientists tell us to expect weird weather to become more familiar. The fiery conditions we have seen this summer are the result of the jet stream stalling, an effect caused when the poles heat up more than the equator does. There is further broad and deep scientific consensus that climate change is at the heart of it. The jet stream has been hinky in the past. The consequences are more severe this time because global warming has raised baseline global temperatures. This is a glimpse into a frazzled future, a warning every inhabitant of the third rock from the sun would be wise to heed. Extreme weather events – ferocious heatwaves, epic floods and violent storms – are going to happen with increasing frequency. The most catastrophic consequences will be felt by other, often much poorer countries, but Britain won’t be unscathed. You can’t run from climate change and you can’t hide. Not absent the ability to get to another planet suitable for human life. The question then becomes a political one: what, if anything, are we going to do about it? There is a school of thought that contends that politics is fundamentally incapable of addressing this challenge. It is just too overwhelming for politicians and electorates to handle. The problem is so complex and so global that it induces fatalism in the leaders and the led. I find this view to be self-defeating and self-harming. There are things that governments can do and they have even managed to achieve some of them. There are now days when Britain meets all its energy needs without burning any coal, something that hasn’t happened since before the Industrial Revolution and a development that would have astonished earlier generations. We produced more electricity from renewable and nuclear energy in 2017 than from gas and coal, making it the first year that low-carbon resources met most of the country’s demand for power.  That is a legacy of good decisions made by earlier governments. This is progress. It is not sufficient progress, but it does demonstrate that there are things that can be done to mitigate climate change and there are smarter responses to this threat than burying your overheated head in your sweaty hands. Political engagement has fluxed depending upon who is in charge, how much pressure there is from the public and what else is happening. It was on the agenda of Labour governments after 1997. David Cameron then positioned the Tories as a party that liked the planet. He once campaigned with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, which rather gave away that rebranding his party was his primary motive. More voters and opinion-shapers have become engaged. Witness the pressure to do something about plastics. Michael Gove’s positive response can be welcomed, even while recognising that the greening of Gove is another attempt at a rebranding, in this case of himself. The past decade has seen a compelling accumulation of frightening data about what is happening to the planet, but the world and its politicians have been distracted by other threats that seemed more immediately menacing, especially the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent austerity. George Osborne, who was blue but never green as chancellor, strangled the budget for developing carbon capture and storage. Theresa May has never been animated enough by climate change to make a major speech about it. Her government recently scrapped the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon power scheme, dashing hopes that Britain could lead development of a new source of renewable energy. Scrubbing a planet-friendly project followed the decision to press ahead with Heathrow expansion. The international picture has deteriorated. Global warming has been crowded out as a subject energising international leadership and the push to tackle the danger has lost momentum. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2016 was supposed to commit more than 170 countries to measures to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels. What it lacks is any mechanism for holding the signatories to their promises and not one of the major industrialised nations has published a full and plausible strategy for meeting their targets. A growing number of the scientists of climate change fear that global warming is going to be in excess of 2C. Donald Trump, who dismisses climate change as a hoax made up by the Chinese to hurt US industry, has ripped up the commitments made by his predecessor. American withdrawal is a double disaster. The Paris agreement is much less of one without the signature of the world’s most profligate emitter of greenhouse gases. Absent a commitment from the US, other countries are likely to feel less incentive to make good on their pledges and less shame when they break them. This disappointing international picture is something to lament, but not an excuse for Britain to do nothing. We live on a windy island inhabited by a lot of clever people and surrounded by a lot of sea. With the right levels of public investment and well-targeted incentives for the private sector, this country could be a world leader in tidal and wave power. There are changes that will be simply forced on Britain as the heating planet has an increasing impact on the way we live and work. MPs on the environmental audit committee have just offered some useful, if largely remedial, suggestions. These include making buildings and transport systems more heat-resilient and using water more efficiently. Such recommendations are, of course, measures to relieve the symptoms of global warming. They do not address the causes. Stronger action will require politicians ready to drive global warming up the agenda, lead public opinion and take bold decisions, many of which will be tough and some of which will not be popular with everyone. This politicians will do only if they genuinely care about climate change or are made to care because a critical mass of their voters tell them that they want something done. The most recent British Social Attitudes survey reports that more than 90% of Britons agree that climate change is a fact, but the rub is that only around a quarter describe themselves as very worried about it and only a minority feel a responsibility to reduce it. Climate change struggles to get into the top 10 of issues that voters tell pollsters that they are most bothered about and almost never reaches the top three. This means that, while most Britons appreciate that there is a threat, not enough grasp its scale or think that it ought to be a serious priority for the government. That could change. It certainly ought to change and is more likely to change as extreme events become a more regular occurrence. Britons have been accustomed to the weather forecast coming after the news. For most of us, for most of the time, the only information we required was whether we needed to take a brolly with us. Britons may adjust their attitudes and demand a lot more leadership and action from their politicians, when the weather leads the news. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"
"Partly, it’s just the luck of the weather. The jet stream – the west-to-east winds that play a big role in determining Europe’s weather – has been further north than usual for about two months. A stationary high-pressure weather system has left the UK and much of continental Europe sweltering. Iceland, by contrast, has been hit with clouds and storms that would normally come further south. The jet stream’s northerly position may have been influenced by temperatures in the north of the Atlantic, which have been relatively warm in the subtropics and colder south of Greenland. “The current hot and dry spell in the UK is partly due a combination of North Atlantic ocean temperatures, climate change and the weather,” said Len Shaffrey, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading. The influence of climate change on the jet stream is still being explored. The heatwaves in the northern hemisphere are undoubtedly linked to global warming, scientists say. “There’s no question human influence on climate is playing a huge role in this heatwave,” said Prof Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. On Thursday the university will publish an analysis of how much more likely climate change made Europe’s current heatwave. Similar heatwaves have happened in the past when the planet was cooler – the world was two-thirds of a degree celsius cooler in 1976, a notably hot year in the UK. But climate change made them happen more often, Allen said. Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the Met Office, said global warming of 1C since the industrial revolution was clearly making extreme heat more likely. “It is increasing quite significantly the risk of such a heatwave. The temperatures of 30C (86F) and above this week have gone from being a very rare occurrence to, not a frequent occurrence, but much more likely,” he said. The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, also points to global warming as the culprit. “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change,” Stott said. Britons are only somewhat worried about climate change, according to the British Social Attitudes tracker. Wildfires, such as those that have occurred recently in northern England, are one reason to be more concerned. “The moorland fires is an example of an impact that comes with such prolonged heatwaves,” Stott said. Older people are vulnerable to extremes of heat, with 20,000 people believed to have died across Europe in the 2003 heatwave. Transport infrastructure suffers, with rail lines buckling. The other major short-term impact is on agriculture. Shaffrey said the hot, dry spell was wreaking havoc on farming. Heatwaves in other countries will probably cut yields of crops that the UK imports, pushing up prices. Longer-term, the green and pleasant landscape of the UK may vanish if rainfall patterns change because of global warming. “People might like a Mediterranean climate but it will be very different. For wildlife, a change of that magnitude could be very traumatic because it has nowhere to go,” said Allen. Yes. “It’s a warning of what we will have to deal with,” said Stott. Michael Mann, a US climate scientist, tweeted: “What we call an ‘extreme heatwave’ today we will simply call ‘summer’ in a matter of decades if we do not sharply reduce carbon emissions.”"
"Rising temperatures are linked to increasing rates of suicide, according to a large new study. The researchers warn that the impact of climate change on suicides may be as significant as economic recessions, which are known to increase rates of self-harm. The links between mental health and global warming have not been widely researched but the new work analysed temperature and suicides across the US and Mexico in recent decades. It found that the rate of suicide rose by 0.7% in the US and by 2.1% in Mexico when the average monthly temperature rose by 1C.  The analysis was done at county level and took into account seasonal variation, levels of poverty and even the news of celebrity suicides that can lead to more deaths. The scientists found that hotter periods resulted in more suicides irrespective of wealth and the usual climate of the area. “Determining whether or not the rate of suicide responds to climatic conditions is important, as suicide alone causes more deaths globally than all forms of violence combined and is among the top 10–15 causes of death globally,” said Prof Marshall Burke, at Stanford University in the US, and his colleagues, who published their research in the journal Nature Climate Change. “Even modest changes in suicide rates due to climate change could [lead to] large changes in the associated global health burden, particularly in wealthier countries where current suicide rates are relatively high,” the researchers said. Record high temperatures have been recorded around the world in recent weeks and are likely to have been driven by climate change. This kind of study cannot prove a causal link between rising temperature and more suicides. But the results show “remarkable consistency” over time and in many different places, according to the scientists. It is also supported by recent research that linked climate change to 60,000 suicides in India in the last three decades.  The researchers also analysed more than 600m messages on Twitter and found that the use of depressive words, such as alone, bleak, lonely and trapped, increased as temperatures rose. “This further suggests that mental wellbeing deteriorates during warmer periods,” said the scientists. One possible way in which this might happen is that when the body cools itself during warmer conditions, the blood flow to the brain is altered. If current carbon emissions are not curbed, the scientists estimated that between 9,000 and 40,000 additional suicides could be expected by 2050 in the US and Canada due to climate change. That number of deaths is significantly more than would be expected from a 1% rise in unemployment due to an economic recession, the researchers said. Other research has already clearly shown that rising heat increases violence between people. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here."
"The Golden State is in danger of becoming the “Cinder State”. New research reveals that cloud cover is plummeting in southern coastal California, increasing the chances of bigger and more intense wildfires.  Since the 1970s Californian airports have monitored cloud cover, for navigational safety. Park Williams, from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and colleagues studied these records and discovered that over the past 40 years low-lying summer clouds have decreased by up to 50% in the greater Los Angeles area. Typically moist ocean air brings stratus cloud along the coast in the morning, and as the heat builds the clouds dissipate. But now the clouds are higher and don’t hang around as long. “Clouds that used to burn off by noon or one o’clock are now gone by 10 or 11am, if they form at all,” said Williams, whose findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters. A combination of global warming and increasing city sprawl (the urban heat-island effect) are the main drivers behind the reduction in cloud cover. And less cloud cover means drier vegetation and greater chance of fire. To date firefighters have been swift to deal with summer wildfires, but the increasing danger means they will have their work cut out."

"  Out in the bush, far from the ritualised political jousting in Canberra, attitudes are changing. Regional Australia has turned the corner when it comes to acknowledging the reality of climate change, says the woman now charged with safeguarding the interests of farmers in Canberra.  Fiona Simson, a mixed farmer and grazier from the Liverpool plains in northern New South Wales, and the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, says people on the land can’t and won’t ignore what is right before their eyes. “We have been experiencing some wild climate variability,” Simson tells Guardian Australia’s politics podcast. “It’s in people’s face”. “While we are a land of droughts and flooding rains, absolutely at the moment people are seeing enormous swings in what would be considered usually normal. They are getting all their rainfall at once, even though they end up with an annual rainfall that’s the same, it’s all at once, or it’s in so many tiny insignificant falls that it doesn’t make any difference to them. “And the heat. We’ve had some record hot summers and some weird swings in seasons”. Simson acknowledges there are “always going to be some outliers who are going to have some wild ideas” in farming or in any other sector of the Australian economy but she says “overwhelmingly, I think it’s got to the point where the science is very acceptable”. The shift under way in the bush has filtered through to lobbyists lane in Canberra. Only a few years ago, when the then Labor government put a price on carbon, legislating a market mechanism to drive emissions reduction at least cost, the NFF rose in full battle cry against the heresy. But now, the NFF stands at the front of a phalanx of business groups trying to support the Turnbull government through the deeply fraught business of landing the national energy guarantee. Simson isn’t trying to pretend black is white. She acknowledges the Neg looks a whole lot like the emissions trading scheme that her group shouted down only a couple of years ago. “I think the Neg for us is some sort of ETS potentially. It certainly talks about carbon and putting a value on that. There will be a price on that and there we go.” She says it’s time to see the climate change-driven transition under way in the energy market as opportunity, rather than something to resist. “I think farm representation and farmers generally have come quite a long way in their attitude to climate, and climate change and climate variability and dealing with all of these things, and accepting some of the facts behind the science.” “We have turned quite a corner ourselves, and our approach now to this is quite different than it was in those days [when Labor pursued emissions trading], when the [previous NFF] leaders chose that path.” She is supportive of the efforts of the agriculture minister, David Littleproud – a next-generation Queensland National – to reset the resting disposition for the Nationals on climate change and energy. Littleproud is happy to acknowledge that climate change is happening and he characterises the shift to renewables as “exciting”. But the Nationals are lagging their communities on the issue. The party remains split on climate change and energy, and on the Neg. Some are trying to cook up a coal transition fund as the price of supporting the policy, but if that’s the price of entry, Labor federally and the Labor states might veto the framework before it can ever get off the ground. Simson says dissenters need to get out of the road of a settlement. Consensus needs to be reached because the damage inflicted by the last decade of policy warfare is going to take time to unwind, and the key to unwinding the destruction is policy certainty. “I have some sympathy for [the Nationals] because I know that our sector has had some wide-ranging discussions to come to the agreement that we have.” “But at the end of the day, that’s their job”. She says politicians “need to stop picking winners. This is not about coal versus renewables ... it’s a bit like a farm, we are probably going to need a bit of everything. Surely, let the market decide is the best way rather than one politician thinking what’s going to be the technology of the future”. Simson notes that Australian farmers love markets. They are entirely comfortable with competition. So the same rules should apply to the energy market. “For us it is very important that the policy be technology neutral, and let the market decide.” She says politicians also need to understand that voters have had enough of the internal intrigues and the brinkmanship. “People are really frustrated at the moment with the politics, whether it is internal politics and infighting within the parties, or whether it is party against party. People are wanting now to have outcomes. People are facing skyrocketing energy prices. Some of my members are facing bills triple what they were a few years ago.” So while there are still questions to answer about the detail of the policy framework, the Neg must be approached as opportunity. Simson says affordability, reliability, technology neutrality is fundamental, and the farm sector needs a tailored solution where emissions reduction can be built into the core of the business. “We think there are a lot of opportunities for small-scale energy generation and it’s already happening”. “We would particularly like to take advantage of some of the heat generation that some of our intensive industries are using. For example, the pork industry has been amazing at capturing methane and then using that as energy generation – all the manure, the slurry going into the pits, having the methane captured and then driving a lot of the technology.” “Things like that on farm are amazing opportunities.” She says farms are often at the end of the power grid and are not well served by the status quo. She says the Neg framework could allow farmers to band together, and small communities to band together, to build their own energy infrastructure. “We can work with this general framework. There is lot of opportunity”."
"The government has been accused of dragging its feet on air quality improvements by a cross-party group of MPs. A partnership of four committees said serious concerns remained about the UK’s commitment to cutting pollution and its impact on public health.   The Commons environment, food and rural affairs, environmental audit, health and social care, and transport committees had made a series of recommendations to the government in the joint report in March. They included bringing forward a planned ban on the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars from 2040. In its response, published on Wednesday, the government maintained that the existing date would put the UK at the forefront of the global transition to cleaner road transport.  It said its overall strategy to cut air pollution would “help us achieve our goals of cleaner air, a better environment, zero-emission vehicles and a strong, clean economy”. MPs remain concerned about efforts to improve air quality. Mary Creagh, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “We need cities where people can move and can breathe, so it is worrying that the government is dragging its feet on air quality, even in the face of legal action by the European court of justice.  “It is also concerning that the government is not ready to demonstrate global leadership by forcing manufacturers to produce only clean vehicles before 2040.”  Lilian Greenwood, the chair of the transport select committee, said: “Our report called on the government to take action to reduce our reliance on cars and increase the use of public transport. We are disappointed, therefore, that the response does not include any substantial public transport or urban planning initiatives.” The government has previously been criticised for a lack of urgency in tackling the air pollution crisis. Several other countries including India, Norway, Ireland and the Netherlands have set much more ambitious targets for vehicle bans. The unprecedented joint inquiry was launched amid concerns over the government’s air quality plans, which have repeatedly been successfully challenged in the courts by environmental groups and found to be so inadequate as to be illegal. The UN’s special rapporteur on pollution said last year that the UK government was “flouting” its duty to protect the health of its citizens, while the problem was declared a public health emergency by a cross-party committee of MPs in 2016. Air pollution causes an estimated 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK and is linked to health problems from childhood illnesses to heart disease and dementia.  Concerns over nitrogen dioxide emissions have grown since Volkswagen was found in September 2015 to have cheated air pollution tests with 11m diesel vehicles worldwide.  A government spokesperson said: “Air quality has improved significantly but there is still much more to do. We have put in place a £3.5bn plan to reduce harmful emissions and will introduce primary legislation to clean up our air. By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040, we are acting faster than almost every other major developed economy.”"
"The British are parochial about weather. It is our cherished grievance, not to be shared with foreigners. Perhaps it is the fact that our weather tends to come from the west, across the Atlantic, and not from our neighbours in Europe (unless it’s a “beast from the east”) which reinforces the belief that our weather is a uniquely British problem. But though we cannot say definitively that the current heatwave is caused by carbon emissions, it fits the pattern of long-term changes that we call climate. It is part of a global phenomenon, even if not the most important part. The really significant change is happening in eastern Siberia at the moment, where a completely unprecedented heatwave is warming that Arctic coastline, with consequences that are unpredictable in detail but surely bad on a large scale. Siberia is a vulnerable point in the global climate system for two reasons. The obvious one is the Arctic ice. The more that melts, the less remains to reflect heat back into the atmosphere. Water, being dark, absorbs heat better so there is a feedback loop set up. That is worrying, but it may be less dangerous than the feedback caused by the melting of the layer formerly known as the permafrost. This releases carbon and methane – more methane will be released from under the warming sea – and both are powerful greenhouse gases. Instability in the Arctic affects the whole of the northern hemisphere, as it increases the chances that the northern jet stream, will stick for longer than usual in a particular pattern. When that happens, the weather stops changing in the affected areas. Heatwaves are prolonged and so are cold snaps. Extremes of every sort, such as the rains in Japan which have killed more than 100 people, become more likely. What seems to be happening at the moment is that a fixation of the jet stream has produced the heatwave in Siberia as well as ours here. Again, this is yet another feedback loop. This is a heatwave which makes further, hotter heatwaves more likely in the future.  Although there is enormous uncertainty about the exact progression of climate change, the direction of travel is entirely clear. This is a problem that demands coordinated global action. The Paris accords are an effort in that direction, but they are being sabotaged. British, or English nationalism about the weather is mildly comical but the selfish and ignorant attitudes of the Trump administration are purely tragic for the whole world. Still, there is more chance of changing the climate than there is of changing the mind of Mr Trump. While the US continues to sulk on climate change and to be driven by short-term imperatives of profit, the best any British government can do is to prepare for a change in the weather here. In 20 years’ time, the heat of the last week will no longer be news. It will be routine. The effect on old people, on schools, and on hospitals will be grim. A responsible government would be planning for this perfectly foreseeable outcome. Ours, however, is otherwise  preoccupied."
"Blaming China for climate change is a clearcut case of “yellow peril” hysteria (Letters, 12 July). On average, a person in China consumes less than half of the emissions of a person in the US (7.2 tonnes per capita annually compared with 16.5 tonnes). So why all the finger-wagging at China? There’s a blatant mistake recurring in carbon politics. Yes, as a nation, China emits the most carbon dioxide, but an astronomical volume of these emissions are to manufacture our goods in the west. Is it fair to maintain a voracious level of consumption in the US and UK while blaming China for producing the goods that we’re consuming? Don’t look at emissions in isolation. Look at them in tandem with consumption, and then we’ll see where to place the burden of blame. Also, China’s investments in renewables have caused the costs to plummet, from which the entire world can now benefit. China invests more than $100bn in domestic renewables every year – more than twice the level of the US, and more than the US and the EU combined.Marcus NieldClimate Change Adaptation Unit, UN Environment, Nairobi, Kenya • Your article (23 July) accurately sums up the excellent work done by the Global Footprint Network regarding our depletion of the planet’s ability to support us. What, unlike GFN themselves, the article did not acknowledge is that the number of people consuming those resources is a critical, if not the critical, driver of the unfolding crisis. In 1970, our global population was less than half of the 7.6 billion we have presently. In 1970, Earth Overshoot Day fell on the 29 December: in 2018, on 1 August. Can anyone credibly claim that those two changes are not linked?  Population is a solvable problem – family planning, lifting people out of poverty, education, empowering women and challenging cultural norms opposing small family size are vital, positive mechanisms to bring our human footprint back in line with with what our only home can sustainably provide.

"A British professional football club that is powered by renewable energy and serves vegan food to players, staff and fans has received a prestigious United Nations certification. Forest Green Rovers, which plays in League Two, announced on Monday that it has become the world’s first UN certified carbon-neutral football club.  Based in the Gloucestershire town of Nailsworth, the club has signed up for a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initiative called Climate Neutral Now for the 2018-19 season. FGR’s green credentials have been attracting attention around the world for several years. It claims to be the first vegan football club in the world after receiving the vegan trademark from the Vegan Society. The club says it became vegan because of the “huge environmental and animal welfare impacts of livestock farming”, as well as to improve player performance and give fans healthier, tastier food on match days. FGR is powered by 100% green energy from Ecotricity – the company founded by the club’s chairman, Dale Vince – some of which is generated by the solar panels on the stadium roof. The team plays on an organic pitch, which is cut by a solar-powered robot lawnmower, and all rainwater that falls on the stands or on the pitch is recycled to minimise the club’s use of mains water. FGR has electric car charging facilities at the stadium, to encourage fans to travel to games sustainably. FGR was promoted to the Football League for the first time in the club’s 129-year history last year and will start its second season in League Two – the fourth tier of professional football in England – next month."
"It was just another moment in this long, increasingly strange summer. I was on a train home from Paddington station, and the carriage’s air-conditioning was just about fighting off the heat outside. Most people seemed to be staring at their phones – in many cases, they were trying to stream a World Cup match, as the 4G signal came and went, and Great Western Railway’s onboard wifi proved to be maddeningly erratic. The trebly chatter of headphone leakage was constant. And thousands of miles and a few time zones away in Loudoun County, Virginia, one of the world’s largest concentrations of computing power was playing its part in keeping everything I saw ticking over, as data from around the world passed back and forth from its vast buildings. Most of us communicate with this small and wealthy corner of the US every day. Thanks to a combination of factors – its proximity to Washington DC, competitive electricity prices, and its low susceptibility to natural disasters – the county is the home of data centres used by about 3,000 tech companies: huge agglomerations of circuitry, cables and cooling systems that sit in corners of the world most of us rarely see, but that are now at the core of how we live. About 70% of the world’s online traffic is reckoned to pass through Loudoun County.  But there is a big problem, centred on a power company called Dominion, which supplies the vast majority of Loudoun County’s electricity. According to a 2017 Greenpeace report, only 1% of Dominion’s total electricity comes from credibly renewable sources: 2% originates in hydroelectric plants, and the rest is split evenly between coal, gas and nuclear power. Dominion is also in the middle of a huge regional controversy about a proposed pipeline that will carry fracked gas to its power plants, which it says is partly driven by data centres’ insatiable appetite for electricity. Clearly, then, the video streams, digital photographs and messaging that pour out of all those servers come with a price. I was reminded of all this by the recently published book New Dark Age, by the British writer James Bridle. He cites a study in Japan that suggests that by 2030, the power requirements of digital services will outstrip the nation’s entire current generation capacity. He quotes an American report from 2013 – ironically enough, commissioned by coal industry lobbyists – that pointed out that using either a tablet or smartphone to wirelessly watch an hour of video a week used roughly the same amount of electricity (largely consumed at the data-centre end of the process) as two new domestic fridges. If you worry about climate change and a cause celebre such as the expansion of Heathrow airport, it is worth considering that data centres are set to soon have a bigger carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry. Yet as Bridle points out, even that statistic doesn’t quite do justice to some huge potential problems. He mentions the vast amounts of electricity consumed by the operations of the online currency Bitcoin – which, at the height of the speculative frenzies earlier this year, was set to produce an annual amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to 1m transatlantic flights. And he’s anxious about what will happen next: “In response to vast increases in data storage and computational capacity in the last decade, the amount of energy used by data centres has doubled every four years, and is expected to triple in the next 10 years.” These changes are partly being driven by the so-called internet of things: the increasing array of everyday devices – from TVs, through domestic security devices, to lighting systems, and countless modes of transport – that constantly emit and receive data. If driverless cars ever arrive in our lives, those same flows will increase hugely. At the same time, the accelerating rollout of the internet and its associated technologies in the developing world will add to the load.  About a decade ago, we were being told to fight climate change by switching off our TVs and stereos. If the battle is now even more urgent, how does it fit with a world in which router lights constantly flicker, and all the devices we own will be in constant, energy-intensive communication with distant mega-computers? But some good news. Whatever its other ethical contortions, Silicon Valley has an environmental conscience. Facebook has pledged to, sooner or later, power its operations using “100% clean and renewable energy”. Google says it has already achieved that goal. So does Apple. Yet even if you factor in efficiency improvements, beneath many of these claims lies a reality in which the vast and constant demand for power means such companies inevitably use energy generated by fossil fuels, and then atone for it using the often questionable practice of carbon offsetting. And among the big tech corporations, there is one big focus of worry: Amazon, whose ever-expanding cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services, offers “the on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage … and other IT resources” and provides most of the computing power behind Netflix. This sits at the heart of data centres’ relentless expansion. Green campaigners bemoan the fact that the details of AWS’s electricity consumption and its carbon footprint remain under wraps; on its corporate website, the story of its use of renewable energy suddenly stops in 2016. Besides, for all their power, even the most enlightened US giants obviously command only part of a global industry. To quote from that Greenpeace report: “Among emerging Chinese internet giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, the silence on energy performance still remains. Neither the public nor customers are able to obtain any information about their electricity use and CO2 target.” Irrespective of the good work carried out by some tech giants, and whether or not you take seriously projections that the entire communication technology industry could account for up to 14% of carbon emissions by 2040, one stark fact remains: the vast majority of electricity used in the world’s data centres comes from non-renewable sources, and as their numbers rapidly increase, there are no guarantees that this will change. On the fringes of the industry, a few voices have been heard describing the kind of future at which most of us – expecting everything streamed as a right – would balk. They talk about eventually rationing internet use, insisting that people send black and white images, or forcibly pushing them away from binge-streaming videos. Their basic point, it seems, chimes with those occasions when the smartphone in your pocket starts to suddenly heat up: a metaphor for our warming planet, and the fact that even the most well-intentioned corporations may yet find that their supposedly unlimited digital delights are, in the dictionary definition of the term, unsustainable. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"
"We’re unlikely to find fixes to our global problems if we’re battling against our planet’s natural resources rather than making use of them. This week, some tales of harnessing the power of nature as we tackle man-made crises: climate change and our insatiable need for energy. Move aside, the sun – could the moon be the solution to our clean energy crisis? The power of our ocean tides, the only renewable source derived from the moon, might be able to provide huge amounts of clean, renewable electricity. Damian Carrington reports from France on the extraordinary inventions that could help to harness it. In the meantime, the sun’s not doing a bad job: a heatwave in the UK helped break solar power-generation records, with solar briefly eclipsing gas power stations as the top source of electricity.  Rising temperatures and dry spells in the US midwest are wreaking havoc with crop yields, as new pests and diseases emerge due to hot and arid conditions. But now an ancient Syrian grass that survived a civil war might provide salvation for stricken American farmers, as Mark Schapiro explains. Elsewhere this week, we are celebrating the 70th birthday of the UK’s National Health Service, the world’s largest government-funded healthcare system. Haroon Siddique brings us five fascinating innovations from health services around the world that could help the NHS to break new ground over the next 70 years. And in Gaza City, Oliver Holmes and Hazem Balousha report on the strip’s first ever coding academy, where 16 students (half male, half female), surrounded by boundaries, are breaking free online.   This New Yorker examination of universal basic income and this Wired tale of the French boat that’s circling the planet powered by renewables.  All these tidal sources are important and may contribute, but the main and cheapest contribution comes from efficient use. In other words: it is not sustainable to fly to remote destinations to board a ship that is supposedly cruising to important places that we must see. It is not sustainable to board a jet plane to watch a football match. And it is not sustainable to fly in food from faraway places out of season by airplane just for the kick of strawberries in winter or lamb from down under.

"The world’s second-largest national park is under threat from a destructive combination of climate change, oil and gas development and hydroelectric projects, according to a new report from the Canadian government. Wood Buffalo national park, which straddles Alberta and the Northwest Territories, is at risk of being placed on Unesco’s endangered list following a 2017 report, whereby Canadian authorities were given a year to develop a solution to stem the rapid deterioration of the park.  The UN body warned that inaction would “constitute a case for recommending inscription of Wood Buffalo national park on the List of World Heritage in Danger”. But before of a Unesco meeting in Bahrain this week, the federal government’s report has confirmed problems are only getting worse: “Desired outcomes for the world heritage values are not being met,” said the report.  The sprawling 4.5m hectare park has long been a home to the Cree and Dene indigenous peoples.  It is also critical habitat for the largest free-roaming buffalo population in the world, who walk its forests, and its watershed is the only untouched breeding ground for endangered whooping cranes.  Wood Buffalo – which became a world heritage site in 1983 – includes part of the world’s largest boreal river delta, formed by the Peace and the Athabasca rivers, which both run through the park and create the conditions for an extremely diverse ecosystem.  But in 2014, the Miskew Cree First Nation contacted Unesco over fears the ecosystem was rapidly deteriorating.  Community members no longer drink the fresh water from lakes or streams over fears of contamination and have reported that wild fish and game have developed abnormal flavours and deformities, said Melody Lepine, director of government and industry relations for the Mikisew Cree First Nation.  “The community has been seeing first hand the the way the Peace Athabasca Delta has been deteriorating,” said Lepine from Bahrain, where she is representing the First Nation as Canada delivers its report. While there is no clear explanation of what has caused problems in the food sources, the Canadian government’s environmental assessment report says high levels of mercury have been found in fish and bird eggs.  A 2016 study by Unesco researchers warned that the pace and complexity of industrial development around the park was “exceptional” and found the proper mechanisms to adequately study its impacts were absent.  The report also found that “the long-term future of the property’s two most iconic species, wood bison and whooping crane, remains uncertain and requires permanent attention”.  A 2017 report by Unesco and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature determined the problems facing Wood Buffalo were “far more complex and severe than previously thought”. The park’s diversity makes it particularly sensitive to upstream development projects. Two dams already cut across the Peace river and a new multibillion dollar hydroelectric project – known as Site C – has prompted warning from First Nations and environmental groups that river flows will continue to be weak in the delta.  Further complicating the situation, oil and gas operations in the northern reaches of Alberta continue to draw large amounts of water to sustain their operations. “Seasonal flows in the Athabasca river have declined over the past 50 years due to a combination of increased water withdrawals and (past) climate change,” said the Canadian government’s report. Experts on the UN committee also fear increased development in the region –including recently approved mining permits – creates near-unavoidable risks of chemical spills into the water system.  “Canada is responding to the 2017 request of the World Heritage Committee to develop an action plan for the site, and is taking concrete steps to address the recommendations of the recent reactive monitoring mission to Wood Buffalo national park,” said Parks Canada in an emailed statement, adding that the “work is well underway”. “Nothing Canada’s doing today is demonstrating they are really taking this seriously,” said Lepine. “Our health, our way of life and our culture depend on Wood Buffalo. We have the spiritual ties to that area go far deeper than Canada’s commitment to it.”"

"In 1890, just over six thousand people lived in the damp lowlands of south Florida. Since then the wetlands that covered half the state have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold. Over roughly the same amount of time the number of black college degree holders in the United States also increased a thousandfold, as did the speed at which we fly, the combined carbon emissions of the Middle East, and the entire population of Thailand. About 60 of the region’s more than 6 million residents have gathered in the Cox Science Building at the University of Miami on a sunny Saturday morning in 2016 to hear Harold Wanless, or Hal, chair of the geology department, speak about sea level rise. “Only 7% of the heat being trapped by greenhouse gases is stored in the atmosphere,” Hal begins. “Do you know where the other 93% lives?”  A teenager, wrists lined in aquamarine beaded bracelets, rubs sleep from her eyes. Returns her head to its resting position in her palm. The man seated behind me roots around in his briefcase for a breakfast bar. No one raises a hand. “In the ocean,” Hal continues. “That heat is expanding the ocean, which is contributing to sea level rise, and it is also, more importantly, creating the setting for something we really don’t want to have happen: rapid melt of ice.” A woman wearing a sequined teal top opens her Five Star notebook and starts writing things down. The guy behind her shovels spoonfuls of passionfruit–flavored Chobani yogurt into his tiny mouth. Hal’s three sons are perched in the next row back. One has a ponytail, one is in a suit, and the third crosses and uncrosses his gray street sneakers. The one with the ponytail brought a water bottle; the other two sip Starbucks. And behind the rows and rows of sparsely occupied seats, at the very back of the amphitheater, an older woman with a gold brocade bear on her top paces back and forth. A real estate developer interrupts Hal to ask: “Is someone recording this?” “Yes.” The cameraman coughs. “Besides,” Hal adds, “I say the same damn thing at least five times a week.” Hal, who is in his early seventies and has been studying sea level rise for over 40 years, pulls at his Burt Reynolds moustache, readjusts his taupe corduroy suit, and continues. On the screen above his head clips from a documentary on climate change show glacial tongues of ice the size of Manhattan tumbling into the sea. “The big story in Greenland and Antarctica is that the warming ocean is working its way in, deep under the ice sheets, causing the ice to collapse faster than anyone predicted, which in turn will cause sea levels to rise faster than anyone predicted.” According to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, rising sea levels are uncertain, their connection to human activity tenuous. And yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects roughly two feet of rise by century’s end. The United Nations predicts three feet. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates an upper limit of six and a half feet. Take the 6 million people who live in south Florida today and divide them into two groups: those who live less than six and a half feet above the current high tide line, and everybody else. The numbers slice nearly evenly. Heads or tails: call it in the air. If you live here, all you can do is hope that when you put down roots your choice was somehow prophetic. But Hal says it doesn’t matter whether you live six feet above sea level or sixty-five, because he, like James Hansen, believes that all of these predictions are, to put it mildly, very, very low. “The rate of sea level rise is currently doubling every seven years, and if it were to continue in this manner, Ponzi scheme style, we would have 205 feet of sea level rise by 2095,” he says. “And while I don’t think we are going to get that much water by the end of the century, I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that we could have something like 15 feet by then.” It’s a little after nine o’clock. Hal’s sons stop sipping their lattes and the oceanographic scientist behind me puts down his handful of M&M’s. If Hal Wanless is right, every single object I have seen over the past 72 hours – the periodic table of elements hanging above his left shoulder, the buffet currently loaded with refreshments, the smoothie stand at my seaside hotel, the beach umbrellas and oxygen bars, the Johnny Rockets and seashell shop, the lecture hall with its hundreds of mostly empty teal swivel chairs – will all be underwater in the not-so-distant future. ****  One of the few stories I remember from the Bible vividly depicts the natural and social world in crisis. It is the apocalyptic narrative par excellence – Noah’s flood. When I look it up again, however, I am surprised to find that it does not start with a rainstorm or an ark, but earlier, with unprecedented population growth and God’s scorn. It begins: “When human beings began to increase in number on the earth.” I read this line and think about the 6,000 inhabitants of south Florida turning into 6 million in 120 short years. “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become.” I think about the exponential increase in M&M’s, Chobani yogurt cups and grande lattes consumed over that same span of time. The dizzying supply chains, cheap labor and indestructible plastic. “So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.’” And then the rain began. I do not believe in a vengeful God – if God exists at all – so I do not think of the flood as punishment for human sin. What interests me most is what happens to the story when I remove it from its religious framework: Noah’s flood is one of the most fully developed accounts of environmental change in ancient history. It tries to make sense of a cataclysmic earthbound event that happened long ago, before written language, before the domestication of horses, before the first Egyptian mummies and the rise of civilization in Crete. An event for which the teller clearly held humans responsible. **** Dig into geologic history and you discover this: when sea levels have risen in the past, they have usually not done so gradually, but rather in rapid surges, jumping as much as 50 feet over a short three centuries. Scientists call these events “meltwater pulses” because the near-biblical rise in the height of the ocean is directly correlated to the melting of ice and the process of deglaciation, the very events featured in the documentary footage Hal has got running on a screen above his head. He shows us a clip of the largest glacial calving event ever recorded. It starts with a chunk of ice the size of Miami’s tallest building tumbling, head over tail, off the tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Then the Southeast Financial Center goes, displaying its cool blue underbelly. It is a coltish thing, smooth and oddly muscular. The ground between the two turns to arctic ice dust and the ocean roils up. Next, chunks of ice the size of the Marquis Residences crash away; then the Wells Fargo Center falls, and with it goes 900 Biscayne Bay. Suddenly everything between the Brickell neighborhood and Park West is gone. The clip begins again and I watch in awe as a section of the Jakobshavn Glacier half the size of all Miami falls into the sea. “Greenland is currently calving chunks of ice so massive they produce earthquakes up to six and seven on the Richter scale,” Hal says as the city of ice breaks apart. “There was not much noticeable ice melt before the nineties. But now it accelerates every year, exceeding all predictions. It will likely cause a pulse of meltwater into the oceans.” In medicine, a pulse is something regular – a predictable throb of blood through veins, produced by a beating heart. It is so reliable, so steady, so definite that lack of a pulse is sometimes considered synonymous with death. A healthy adult will have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, every day, until they don’t. But a meltwater pulse is the opposite. It is an anomaly. The exception to the 15,000-year rule. From 1900 to 2000 the glacier on the screen retreated inward eight miles. From 2001 to 2010 it pulled back nine more; over a single decade the Jakobshavn glacier lost more ice than it had during the previous century. And then there is this film clip, recorded over 70 minutes, in which the glacier retreats a full mile across a calving face three miles wide. “This is why I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the largest meltwater pulse in modern human history,” Hal says. As the ice sheets above Hal’s head fall away and the snacks on the buffet disappear, topography is transformed from a backwater physical science into the single most important factor determining the longevity of the Sunshine State. The man seated next to me leans over. “If what he says is even half true,” he whispers, “Florida is about to be wiped off the map.”"
"The UK’s historic churches are at serious risk from the impact of climate change, including higher levels of rainfall and invasive pests such as termites, according to the National Churches Trust. Roofs, towers and spires are threatened by strong winds and more frequent storms. The trust saw a 26% year-on-year increase in applications for grants for urgent repairs, maintenance and development projects in 2017, its annual review says.  A total of 480 churches and chapels around the country sought financial help from the trust, which awarded 230 grants worth £1.7m – an increase of £300,000 compared with 2016. Claire Walker, the trust’s chief executive, said many church buildings had reached a tipping point due to the combined impact of climate change, cuts to Heritage Lottery Fund grants and the end of the government-funded roof repair scheme for listed places of worship. “The intensity of extreme weather patterns, including heavier rainfalls and storms, is putting church gutters and drains under strain, and systems designed in the past cannot cope,” she said. “Looking to the future, the impact of climate change could have a serious impact on the UK’s historic churches. Higher levels of rainfall in the UK, such as the 20% increase seen in Scotland since the 1960s, with more cycles of wetting and drying, will cause damage to timber and stonework. Stronger winds and more frequent storms will threaten roofs, towers and spires. “Climate change is also making the UK ever more vulnerable to invasive pests. The biggest danger for church buildings would be from termites, which are now widespread in France, with infestations being found close to the Channel coast.” Termites can cause extensive damage to structural timber. The pests excavate it from the inside, leaving a thin skin of unharmed wood which can conceal the damage being caused. The only colony of termites known to have become established in the UK was found in south Devon in the 1990s. It was eliminated after years of action by government agencies. Among the churches awarded grants by the trust last year were St Botolph’s in Boston, Lincolnshire, a Grade I-listed building and the UK’s largest parish church, which received £40,000 for roof repairs. The Grade II-listed St David’s Old Church in Llanwrtyd, Wales, which has a recorded history spanning more than 1,000 years, received £20,000 from the trust for urgent repairs to stonework and gutters."
"The extreme heatwaves and wildfires wreaking havoc around the globe are “the face of climate change,” one of the world’s leading climate scientists has declared, with the impacts of global warming now “playing out in real time.” Climate change has long been predicted to increase extreme weather incidents, and scientists are now confident these predictions are coming true. Scientists say the global warming has contributed to the scorching temperatures that have baked the UK and northern Europe for weeks. The hot spell was made more than twice as likely by climate change, a new analysis found, demonstrating an “unambiguous” link.  Extreme weather has struck across Europe, from the Arctic Circle to Greece, and across the world, from North America to Japan. “This is the face of climate change,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, and one the world’s most eminent climate scientists. “We literally would not have seen these extremes in the absence of climate change.” “The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” he told the Guardian. “We are seeing them play out in real time and what is happening this summer is a perfect example of that.” “We are seeing our predictions come true,” he said. “As a scientist that is reassuring, but as a citizen of planet Earth, it is very distressing to see that as it means we have not taken the necessary action.” The rapid scientific assessment of the northern European heatwave was done by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also colleagues in the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium. “We can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said. The current heatwave has been caused by an extraordinary stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice. Prof Mann said that asking if climate change “causes” specific events is the wrong question: “The relevant question is: ‘Is climate change impacting these events and making them more extreme?’, and we can say with great confidence that it is.” Mann points out that the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is a statistical one, which does not prove every cancer was caused by smoking, but epidemiologists know that smoking greatly increases the risk. “That is enough to say that, for all practical purposes, there is a causal connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer and it is the same with climate change,” Mann said. Other senior scientists agree the link is clear. Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.” It is not too late to make the significant cuts needed in greenhouse gas emissions, said Mann, because the impacts progressively worsen as global warming increases.  “It is not going off a cliff, it is like walking out into a minefield,” he said. “So the argument it is too late to do something would be like saying: ‘I’m just going to keep walking’. That would be absurd – you reverse course and get off that minefield as quick as you can. It is really a question of how bad it is going to get.”"
"Just like this year’s, the heatwave in 1976 arrived as Britain seemed to be approaching an economic and political abyss. During the spring and early summer, as the sun began to hammer down and the usual rain failed to fall, and the reservoirs began to shrink, the pound was lurching downwards on the markets. For almost three years, under Tory and Labour governments, the economy had been shrivelling alarmingly. Just as since the Brexit vote, a conviction had been building like a thundercloud among financial traders and business leaders, economists and commentators, in Britain and beyond, that the country was about to slip to a lower, less elite level, and stay there. “Goodbye, Great Britain,” said a much-read editorial in the Wall Street Journal in 1975, “it was nice knowing you.” If you remember the British summer of 1976 we'd like to hear from you.

To some pessimists about Britain’s prospects, the drought the following summer, which brought forest fires, crop failures, hosepipe bans enforced by policemen and vigilantes, and standpipes on street corners instead of mains water, was a further sign of crisis. In 1976, with impeccable timing, the American writer Paul Theroux published The Family Arsenal, a bleakly satirical novel about terrorists on the loose in a sweaty, rundown mid-70s London, its “decay pushing towards ruin”. Some sort of apocalypse, predicted one of the characters, was “certainly coming”. But the Labour chancellor, Denis Healey, was not one of the worriers. In the summer of 1976, after several exhausting months trying to defend his economic policies and the value of the pound, he went on holiday for most of August. He left sticky London behind and drove unhurriedly through England and Wales and up to north-west Scotland. “Not a drop of rain,” he wrote in his memoirs, “even in the Highlands.” In the hidden away lochside town of Ullapool, Healey checked into a hotel on the quayside and began to relax. That night, he was repeatedly woken by phone calls from Whitehall. In the US currency markets, the pound was collapsing again. The hotel had only one phone, so the chancellor stood in a hallway with a coat over his pyjamas, authorising the Bank of England to spend “up to $150m” (about £750m now) to buy sterling. The intervention worked: the pound stopped falling. Healey went back to bed, and then continued with his holiday. Hot weather does contradictory things to British politics. In parliament, with its stuffy rooms and sweaty dress codes, it traditionally sparks revolts, plots, panics and flashes of temper – a sense that things are coming to a head – as it has this summer. Yet away from Westminster, a heatwave can make politicians, and even more so voters, worry less than usual about the state of the nation. In an overcast country, sunshine often means contentment and escapism – and procrastination. During July and August 1976, despite the state of the economy and a widespread disillusionment with centre-left politics (which had been deepening since the late 60s), the Labour government pulled level with the Conservatives in the polls. Healey was generally seen as a tough, capable chancellor. The prime minister, Jim Callaghan, had an avuncular, calming manner that seemed appropriate to the summer lull. Voters called him Sunny Jim. Theresa May has none of Callaghan’s sly charm. But her situation this summer is similar in some ways. As in 1976, a divided government in a weak parliamentary position, wedded to increasingly contested ideas – for Callaghan, postwar social democracy, for May, austerity and the free market – has somehow made it to the welcome shade of the recess, despite many predictions to the contrary. The main opposition party remains ominously strong, but it has an intensely divisive leader whom many voters see as odd and extremist: in this sense, Margaret Thatcher was the Jeremy Corbyn of the mid-70s. And, just as Callaghan did, May has managed to put off the most difficult political question of her government until the autumn. In 1976, this was whether Britain could afford to continue with its postwar levels of state spending; now it is how to do Brexit. Yet during what might be a once-in-a-generation summer – as the sun keeps shining, day after day, and the parks are full of impromptu skivers, the pubs are full of workers having cheeky afternoon lagers, and even supposedly earnest protest marches feel more like carnivals – such national dilemmas can feel very distant. In the summer of 1976, the sense of ease was not a total delusion. Twenty-eight years later, the respected New Economics Foundation created a measure for overall economic, social and environmental wellbeing, and concluded that 1976 was the best year in modern British history. For those invested in the idea that the 70s were a nadir for Britain – pro-Thatcher historians, and hipper archivists of the punk rebellion against the mid-70s status quo – the summer of 1976 has always been an awkward piece of counter-evidence. Yet as Jon Savage pointed out in his 1991 book England’s Dreaming, still the best, most nuanced study of punk and its political and social context, the heatwave actually helped the movement. After dark, the rare warmth gave the first British punks a sense of possibility, and a freedom, as they roamed between squats and nightclubs. In a normal British summer, it would have been hard to stay out all night in punk outfits full of holes. The summer of 2018 feels less carefree. We know more about climate change and skin cancer now. This week, forecast to be the hottest of the season, the Met Office is advising people to stay out of the sun. And the world beyond Britain feels more genuinely apocalyptic, and harder to ignore. We face Trump and a Europe increasingly controlled by far-right populists; in the summer of 1976, the continent was dominated by centrists, and the insurgent shaking up US politics was a mild, almost meek Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Even the cold war seemed to be abating, thanks to the disarmament treaties and subtle diplomacy of detente. But we shouldn’t idealise the summer of 1976 too much. Away from its unexpected pleasures, pressures were still building in Britain. In August the guitarist Eric Clapton near the peak of his fame, used a concert in Birmingham to make a speech defending the anti-immigrant prejudices of Enoch Powell. At the end of the month, the Notting Hill carnival in London turned into a battle between the police and black youths, a prefiguring of the many riots in the decade to come. Also in late August the heatwave finally disintegrated in a mess of thunderstorms. A soaking, grey autumn followed. The pound resumed its decline, the government’s finances deteriorated further, Whitehall panicked – or, some say, exploited the situation – and the government ended up drastically cutting its spending, and accepting a loan from the IMF. The reputations of Healey and Callaghan, their government, and postwar social democracy, never quite recovered. Once the summer interlude of 1976 was over, Britain changed very fast – and in many ways not for the good. Perhaps that’s something for Theresa May, and the rest of us, to ponder while we enjoy the sun. • Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian"
"MPs are to investigate the environmental impact of throwaway “fast fashion” in the UK amid growing concerns that the multi-billion pound industry is wasting valuable resources and contributing to climate change.  The inquiry, launched on Friday by the House of Commons environmental audit committee, will explore the carbon impact, resource use and water footprint of clothing throughout its lifecycle and supply chain.   Inviting evidence on how the influential sector should remodel itself to be both “thriving and sustainable”, it will look at how improved recycling rates of clothing could slash waste and pollution.  “Fashion shouldn’t cost the Earth” said Mary Creagh MP, chair of the committee. “But the way we design, make and discard clothes has a huge environmental impact. Producing clothes requires climate-changing emissions. Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain into the oceans. We don’t know where or how to recycle end-of-life clothing.”  Despite recent troubles on the UK high street, the fashion sector has continued to grow. According to the British Fashion Council, the UK fashion industry contributed £28.1bn to national GDP in 2015, up from £21bn in 2009. But the globalised market for fashion manufacturing has facilitated a “fast fashion” phenomenon; a proliferation of cheap and cheerful clothing, with quick turnover that encourages consumers to keep buying, the committee warns.  The raw materials used to manufacture clothes require land and water, or extraction of fossil fuels, while carbon dioxide is emitted throughout the clothing supply chain and some chemical dyes, finishes and coatings may be toxic. Research has found that plastic microfibres in clothing are released when they are washed, and enter rivers, the ocean and even the food chain. Last year the fashion designer Stella McCartney condemned her own industry as “incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment.” A report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation put the annual cost to the UK economy of landfilling clothing and household textiles at about £82m. It warned that if the global fashion industry continues on its current growth path, it could use more than a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget by 2050. Key to the inquiry is how consumers could be encouraged to buy fewer clothes, reuse clothes and think about how best to dispose of clothes when they are no longer wanted. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of fashion waste goes straight into landfill each year, despite growing efforts to encourage consumers to recycle their worn and unwanted clothing."
"Withdrawing from the Paris agreement is not an option for Australia, unless we want to suffer severe economic consequences as a result. Australia is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and it is in our national interest to support effective global action. The Paris agreement sets a common multilateral platform that allows for domestic flexibility to make contributions to emissions reductions acknowledging the scale of the challenge is greater than any one country’s capacity to act.  Critically, the rules are being written and formalised this year into a rulebook guiding how the Paris agreement will be implemented. Australia needs to have a seat at the table if we are to ensure the interests of our energy intensive, export-orientated economy are represented. Without active engagement in the process to negotiate and implement the Paris rulebook, Australia will suffer the consequences of not being able to optimise our national interest around how markets, technology, trade and finance flows develop in the transition to a low carbon economy. For example, the rules being negotiated around article 6 of the agreement involve how transfers and trade in emissions will occur between parties.  As our domestic policy settings will inevitably tighten, Australia’s large-emitting businesses will want access to international permits and conversely our world class domestic offset market will want to export credits to a world short in supply. Accelerated clean energy and technology transfer and climate finance will also be part of expanded trade-related rules stemming from the Paris rulebook. Despite the mis-truths espoused regularly by some conservative politicians and parts of the Australian media, rapid developments are taking place in India and China to transform their economies and meet their increasingly ambitious climate change commitments. Our exports sit in the supply chain of global markets, where there is increasingly an explicit price on carbon. We don’t want to be locked out of these markets, or worse, penalised through trade and economic sanctions if Australia is seen to be out of alignment with global developments. When President Trump announced he was leaving the Paris agreement, US businesses and state and local governments rallied and formed a “We are still in” coalition. More than 2,800 organisations have signed a commitment that they stand by the Paris agreement and are committed to its goals. The message from this powerful grouping has been loud and clear: that participation in the Paris agreement helps strengthen competitiveness, create jobs, markets and growth and reduces business risks. Australian businesses and financial institutions are also attuned to the business risks and opportunities climate change presents. There is increasing recognition at board and executive management levels that climate change poses material financial and strategic risks. Leading businesses are starting to adopt the new framework issued by the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to assess and disclose the emerging risks, opportunities and financial implications climate change poses for their business. The primary driver for this initiative is to protect shareholder value. Australian companies are starting to build resilience and play their part in supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon emissions economy. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, should be commended for her forthright unequivocal support for maintaining commitment to the Paris agreement. She was spot on when she announced at the time of Australia’s ratification of the Paris agreement in 2016 that: “The Australian government has determined that ratifying the Paris agreement is in our national interests and will provide great opportunities for Australian businesses.”  She went on to say, “The global low emissions economy is estimated to be worth around $6tn and is growing at some 4-5% per annum. We believe that through the use of technology and research and science and innovation, there will be many opportunities for Australian businesses, Australian jobs in a low emissions economy.” In Australia, climate change has impacts and economic consequences across infrastructure, property, regional security, disaster management, agriculture, fisheries and forestry, tourism and importantly, but not well documented, the health and wellbeing of communities. Any ill-informed opinion that it is in Australia’s interest to leave the Paris agreement is economically, environmentally and socially irresponsible. As far as Australian business is concerned, “We are still in”. "
"A new report by Richard Jones and James Wilsdon invites us to question the biomedical bubble - the slow but steady concentration of research and development (R&D) resources in the hands of biomedical science. A provocative case, it’s already generated some discussion. Here, I want to pick up a point that might be easily missed amongst fights over the role of biomedicine: the all-too-small amount of resource being put towards decarbonising energy.  As the Nesta report points out, we’ve seen changing priorities for UK research over the last 25 years. Defence-related R&D fell by more than half between 1995 and 2015, to 16%. Health-related research was a key beneficiary of this ‘peace dividend’, now accounting for just under a quarter of total expenditure. In contrast, research into energy received only 2.5% of the pot in 2015. Like Jones and Wilsdon, I don’t want to argue against health R&D. It’s clearly a major priority. But decarbonising our energy system must also be another, especially in the rapidly-closing window of opportunity we have to avoid catastrophic global warming. Tackling climate change is, in all seriousness, the fight of our lives (the word “moonshot” doesn’t cover the half of it). Of course, dealing with climate change isn’t just about R&D. Indeed, it can feel silly to be talking about how the UK should invest more in low carbon innovation when there is currently a ban on something as basic as onshore wind (a British innovation of the 1880s). There were, for example, some wonderfully warm words from energy minister Claire Perry about the Q-Bot insulation robot at the Parliamentary Sustainable Energy Group conference last week. But it did also feel like a distraction from last month’s Committee on Climate Change report, which criticised the government’s “shocking” lack of action when it comes to simple and low cost options like onshore wind, home insulation and planting trees. We also need to invest in infrastructure and public engagement with low carbon technology if we’re going to make the transition to those technologies happen, and happen fairly. We should be wary of assuming the private sector is going to be sufficient here, just as we should be wary of assuming it can pick up the bill for innovation, or regulate itself (or that crowdfunding or community energy - though powerful levers for change - are enough).  The rise of electric cars is a good example. Like many low carbon technologies, these may well prove to be unstoppable - to use a term favoured by climate action evangelists - but it’s hard to see how the market acting alone will be anywhere near fast enough, or evenly distributed. Elon Musk fans might be one part of the puzzle, but the shiny innovation fairy - powerful as she is - shouldn’t distract us from any of the other vital work required.  It’s a good time to start worrying about UK R&D though. As Jones and Wilsdon’s timely report emphasises, how we fund UK R&D is about to shift, and with that comes opportunities. Earlier this year, the PM announced the government aims to invest 2.4% of GDP in R&D by 2027, up from its current level of 1.7%. We’ve also seen our cohort of research councils - currently split loosely by discipline into medicine, physics, earth science etc - brought together with Innovate UK into a new larger body, UK Research and Innovation, with a combined budget of more than £6.5 bn. It’s a shift that many people working in universities seem obsessed with - complete with its own parody twitter account - but few people outside the research bubble seem to have noticed. If you’re interested in UK politics, you should be interested in what we spend on R&D. 2.4% of our economy is no small change. There’s a hackneyed old CP Snow line about scientists having the future in their bones, but the future is far too important to leave to such a small (and, let’s admit it, rather closed) community. So it surprises me that there isn’t more complaint from the climate movement when it comes to issues like the makeup of the UKRI board. Not only is it dominated by biomedicine, but two of its 16 members - Alice Gast and John Browne - have direct links to the fossil fuel industry. There are some impressive names on that board, but if we’re talking about people with “future in their bones”, I’m not convinced the future they are brewing is a low carbon one. Maybe in time for the government’s “Green Great Britain” week in October we might hope to see some climate leadership coming out of UKRI?

"In a tragicomic photograph to be found on the internet, a hydrogen balloon lies sideways on the sea ice, somewhere north of Svalbard. Still inflated, it clings to its spherical dignity, while the ropes that connect it to its upended basket describe elegant catenaries. It is a dark silhouette against a horizonless surround, in which the white ice of the foreground grades into a lightly greying sky. The two men posing by the basket and the one behind the camera don’t have long to live. They will make it across the ice back to land but, with inadequate provisions and equipment, will die there. It will take some decades before their remains and their camera are found. Such was the fate of the 1897 expedition, brave to the point of idiocy, in which the Swede SA Andrée tried to fly to the north pole. He used a steering system that was almost certain not to work, and he set off in his newly made balloon without final checks for leaks.  Andrée was driven by national pride, a desire to prove the virility of Sweden. In this he was not alone. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, urged on by excitable press coverage, explorers risked their lives to prove their own and their nations’ superiority. Two different Americans, Frederick Cook in 1908 and Robert Peary in 1909, said they were the first to reach the pole, and in 1926 another, Richard Byrd, claimed he was the first to fly there. All their claims have since been cast in doubt. In the 1920s Mussolini used the airship exploits of the Italian Umberto Nobile to promote his regime. When Nobile went missing in 1928 the great Norwegian Roald Amundsen, although he didn’t care for fascism, would die in the internationally publicised race to find him. The Arctic can have this effect on people: its function in the imagination of the world is as a place to test or define, to look for some truth about existence by viewing it from its limit. The challenge of its otherness might explain why Mary Shelley chose to open Frankenstein in the Arctic wastes, and why the Soviets built the showcase coalmining town of Pyramiden more grandly and formally than its function required. Now the significance of the Arctic is above all about climate change, its effects there being particularly visible, significant and dangerous. The belief that the Arctic has something to tell us motivates the Arctic Circle residency, a programme whereby artists, scientists and writers can, for half the actual cost, take part in expeditions aboard a tall sailing ship, around the coasts and islands of Svalbard. Feeling the need for new perspectives on life, I applied – and in early June joined 28 other participants, plus guides and crew, on the three-masted barquentine Antigua. Two weeks without night or internet, ignorant of World Cup results and the latest Trump eruptions, voyaging between 78 and 81 degrees north, going where the wind suggested, marvelling at glaciers in shades of blue beyond the power of words or cameras to capture – cobalt? cerulean? sapphire? “Are you going to find yourself,” teased a friend, “under an iceberg?” There is an element of the mythical about Svalbard. Its mention can draw blank looks, except from readers of Philip Pullman who know it as the land of armoured bears but who still don’t know much about the nonfictional version. It is better known as Spitsbergen, the name given by the Dutch navigator Willem Barents when he discovered it in 1596, more than a century after Columbus reached America. Norwegian patriotism led to its renaming in the 20th century: through the optimistic reading of an ambiguous medieval account, it was decided that the Vikings had got there first and called it Svalbard. It is, in any case, an archipelago far north of Norway, a bit smaller than Scotland, the last bit of Europe before the north pole. The name Spitsbergen is still applied to its largest island. Svalbard’s shape on a map, a splat of kelp upon a rock, may be the least familiar in Europe. It occupies the zone where Mercator’s and other projections dissolve into absurdity, with Svalbard becoming either nonsensically big or weirdly distorted, sometimes getting left out altogether. On globes it can disappear beneath the black plastic cap that holds the object in place. An azimuthal projection, the kind that puts the north pole at the centre of concentric circles of latitude, reveals it to have more to do with the cold family of Arctic lands – Greenland, the islands of north Russia and Canada – than with the European mainland. Human history has a shallow grip on Svalbard. Before Barents (or those Vikings) arrived, there were no indigenous populations, no equivalent of Inuit in north America, nobody at all. It wasn’t until the 20th century that people started living there permanently, and such life has been extreme, framed by tales of endurance and danger: explorers stuck in the ice through long winters, stranded travellers surviving in snow holes for months, whalers taking insane risks in pursuit of profit, the appalling working conditions and mortality rates of miners. Animal and plant life, too, looks like something that could easily be scraped off the surface of the land. Springy moss, purple and yellow saxifrage, and a type of buttercup stay within centimetres of the ground. There are no trees, except for low, flat willow and birch that take decades to reach the size of dinner plates. There are no butterflies or bees. Whereas the polar sea is abundant in life, vertebrate species on land are few, if memorable: polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, ptarmigan. Instead there is naked geology, exemplary sedimentary mountains whose layers were formed by hundreds of millions of years of shifting land and sea, back to a time when what is now Svalbard was located south of the equator. On one edge, where plate movements pressed it against what is now Greenland, they twist and buckle. Elsewhere equally exemplary igneous rocks, formed in intense heat and pressure in the earlier history of the planet, create the hard, spiky skylines that gave Spitsbergen (“pointed mountains”) its name. Formations that in other lands would be worth a journey by themselves are here commonplace. They are unforgiving, even tedious, in their sterile magnificence. Animation comes from the clarity, luminosity and subtle alterations of the famous Arctic light. Because the light reflects in all directions off snow and ice, and because sunshine comes (especially around midnight) at a low angle, you are suspended in it. At the same hour, when the shadows deepen and when a light meter would register a lowering of levels but all still looks dazzling, there is a bright-dark quality comparable to that of a solar eclipse. Along with rock and light, the landscape is made of four other elements – ice, snow, cloud and water – all, of course, variants of the same substance. Their changes and interactions are infinite. You know them underfoot, hard or collapsing, as well as by sight. Above all, there are the glaciers, one after another, covering much of Svalbard, crackling and growling with their internal forces, crumbling into pillars and pinnacles with the unsteady and unlikely beauty of the about-to-collapse. One in particular, the currently surging glacier of Wahlenbergbreen, resembles an army of orks, ranks of ugly upright giants marching to their collapse into the sea, where they will turn into glistening floating ornaments, whose cute technical name is “bergy bits”. You see clearly that everything is in inorganic motion, if at different speeds – waves, ice, strata, continental plates, weather. There are similarities of patterns: a field of moss looks like a mountain range, ice floes drift like clouds, glacier ice behaves like rock, only speeded up. All landscapes are temporary, as the architect Cedric Price said of buildings, but some are more temporary than others. The Arctic’s absence of measures like trees and houses makes it hard to read the scale of a glacier – 100ft high? 400ft? More? Dry haze-less air makes distance inscrutable, removing the aerial perspective that helps us read depth. The sun’s 24-hour, 360-degree path messes with time and orientation. It is otherworldly. It is a sketch of another planet. It is not greatly bothered about human presence, even though human presence has the potential to be devastating: whatever the poltroons who deny it might say, this ice is indeed retreating and, quite apart from its effects when it turns up in melted form in a town or field near you, a world of beauty will be destroyed. So there we were, a group of strangers collectively categorised as creative, industriously trying to make sense of it all. We were mostly from the anglosphere – Canadians, Americans, British, Australians – with a Peruvian and a Norwegian. The guides and crew, some of them artists and writers themselves, some former participants in the residency who liked Svalbard so much that they came back, were part of the collective exploratory society. “Don’t get eaten by a polar bear” was common advice before I left, but Other People were scarier. What if we couldn’t stand each other, on this vessel alone on icy seas? Agatha Christie would have loved the scenario: a confined space, multiple personal histories, several ways to die. It didn’t seem auspicious that my allocated cabin-mate greeted me with a box of earplugs and the warning that he snores. But I slept, partly by imagining that his occasional rumblings were the sounds of glaciers or walruses. Collectively we participants got along well, not only because it was clearly dumb not to, but also because this was a group of likable and dedicated people. There were irritations, to be sure, and occasional outbreaks of what might be considered madness, but the overwhelming experience was the pleasure of encountering people we wouldn’t have met otherwise, and making lasting friendships. We were conscious of a precedent – in 2005 a group called Cape Farewell organised a residency in Svalbard that included Ian McEwan and Antony Gormley, that formed the basis of McEwan’s novel Solar. We were a less starry bunch but possibly we had a better time, not least because they went in the harsh month of March. It helped that we were lucky with wildlife – two blue whales within an hour of leaving port, six bears in three sightings, an extended viewing of an ugly of walruses, plus seals, arctic fox, reindeer and an array of birds. (And, yes, according to some contested sources an “ugly” is a collective noun for those large brown sea beasts.) If it would be nice to tell daring tales of narrow escapes but the truth is that dangerous places have to be highly managed. On land, you can’t leave the protection of the guides, who are armed with rifles as a last resort against polar bears (although there was a mildly alarming moment involving a grounded boat and a curious bear). You could swim in the extremely cold water or go up the ship’s foremast in a safety harness, but these are hardly epic adventures. Rather, we busied ourselves with our personal attempts to respond to the Arctic. Two artists, Adam Kuby from Portland Oregon and Shohei Katayama from Pittsburg, collaborated on filling a crack in ice with gold-coloured fabric and photographed it. Emma Hoette, one of the crew, who is currently studying at the Laban centre in London, reprised a performance where she sits on a cold rock, naked but for a woollen neck warmer that she slowly unravels. Philip Kanwischer, from Calgary, made a digitally altered photograph of our anxieties: that curious bear multiplied several times over. All had to observe the same rule: you may leave nothing behind on the islands and beaches and take nothing away. Any manmade objects that might be older than 1946 – barrel hoops, shoes, broken bottles — are designated as cultural artefacts and must not be touched. Writers took notes for future poems and essays. I read an account of the 1873 expedition of the explorer Benjamin Leigh Smith, who happens to have been my great-great-great uncle, and traced the intersections of his routes with ours. In Mosselbukta, where he found a Swedish expedition that had spent the Arctic winter trapped by ice, I saw the ruins of a flatpacked house these pre-Ikea Swedes had built. It later collapsed; its timbers are miraculously preserved by the dry, cold air. As a writer on architecture, I had imagined that the appeal of the Arctic would include its lack of my usual subject matter, but there are buildings there too, all the more poignant for their survival in hostile places. There are the structures of coalmining, mineheads perched on near-cliffs and long-legged conveyor systems that recall the inventions of HG Wells or the Walking Cities of the 1960s architectural group Archigram. There are trappers’ huts, researchers’ cabins and tiny refuges for travellers, all solitary specks in the vast landscape. There is the steel mast from which in 1926 Raoul Amundsen and Umberto Nobile, at that point collaborating with each other, flew in an airship to the north pole. These structures are to the point. They waste no energy. They combine flimsy-looking tarpaper with oversized driftwood because that is what is to hand. It would be lost effort to cut up the wood into more proportionate pieces. Decorated at most with reindeer antlers or a bear’s jawbone, they have the striking aesthetic of buildings that don’t have time for aesthetics, their unusual asymmetries of lightness and mass being responses to unusual conditions. The same cannot be said of Pyramiden, a piece of the Soviet Union on foreign soil, made possible by international treaty that gives certain countries additional to Norway rights to Svalbard. It is now a frigid modern Pompeii, where guided tours can visit the dead 1990s house plants, the idle kitchen equipment, the northernmost grand piano and the increasingly quaint office machines that were left behind when, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it the withdrawal of the town’s state support, Pyramiden was abandoned. The black coal fields, striking after all that pure ice, are apocalyptic. In its 1970s heyday it was an exhibition town, a sought-after posting for Soviet citizens, with model apartment buildings and the world’s northernmost bust of Lenin gazing down an avenue nicknamed the Champs Élysées. It has the only turf in Svalbard, imported from the Ukraine, on which the only dandelions sometimes flower. It has a shed where strawberries were grown. Its buildings are higher than anywhere else in the archipelago, and its mining structures more elaborate and massive – as much to make them impressive as out of necessity. As an exercise in pitting man against nature, with the associated effects of hubris, it has something in common with the Swedish balloon. Svalbard architecture exposes with special lucidity the heroism and foibles of human life, which is what the Arctic does more generally. It doesn’t give a damn about us. If it could have a preference, it would want us dead. But its very implacability makes us want to read ourselves in it and enables us to do so. The message of those sedimentary mountains is that, over a scale of tens of millions of years, nature will probably shrug off whatever monstrosities we inflict on it, as it has previous catastrophes like meteorites and volcanic explosions, but that will be much too late for us. This realisation makes climate change more urgent, not less. We made this problem and it is down to us to fix it. There is no one and nothing else to help us. It’s a little preposterous to seek the meaning of the Arctic, but if it has one it’s in what it reflects. One of the strangest sights was, after 10 days’ sailing, of a man we hadn’t met before. Wonders included the rediscovery, over a return via Oslo airport to Britain, of crowds, summer warmth, trees, trucks, streetlamps, passwords, football results and new Trump eruptions much like the old ones, of a snail trail and a mulberry bush in the garden. Some of these things seemed inconsequential, some repulsive, some precious. A possibly obvious truth was vividly reinforced, which is that there is no fundamental reason why any of them are here. We’d miss them, some of them, if they weren’t. This article was amended on 29 July 2018 to add the name of an artist."
"Burlington in Vermont has already given the world Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and provided the political launchpad for Bernie Sanders. Now the city’s successful switch to 100% renewable electricity is spurring US mayors to fill the gaping void on climate change action left by the Trump administration. Burlington didn’t make a fuss when it switched on a new hydropower plant in late 2014 and became the first US city to run entirely on clean power. “We didn’t have parades. I don’t know why in retrospect we didn’t make more of it,” says Miro Weinberger, the wire-haired mayor of Burlington.  The achievement has since been thrown into sharp relief by the election of Donald Trump, who has attempted to squash any sort of national response to climate change. The Paris climate agreement has been disavowed, policies to lower emissions from coal plants and vehicles have been wound back, adaption to the rising seas has been binned. Amid this national crisis, dozens of US cities, states and businesses have strained to ameliorate the president’s agenda. More than 60 cities have now pledged to shift their electricity generation from fossil fuels to cleaner sources such as solar, wind and hydro. Burlington, a progressive bastion of 42,000 people an hour’s drive to the Canadian border, represents the vanguard. “The job of every elected official in this country changed the day Donald Trump was elected,” says Weinberger, a liberal Democrat who has held the office since 2012. Weinberger drives an electric car – a Nissan Leaf – but is fresh from a bike ride when we meet.  “It’s not acceptable that America has completely retreated from the climate change conversation,” he says. “I think leaders realised that we are going to have to make progress on this even when the federal government has checked out.” Burlington keeps the lights on thanks to: the McNeil Generating Station, a hulking woodchip processor and furnace; a hydro plant situated next to an old wool factory that has its turbines spun by the Winooski River; a small array of wind turbines perched on nearby Georgia Mountain; and a bank of solar panels at Burlington airport.  The city managed the transition to fossil fuel-free electricity within just a decade, but the roots of its transformation go back further. A coal plant that now lies derelict was shuttered in 1986 amid local concerns over pollution and its reputation as an eyesore on the shoreline of Lake Champlain.  The McNeil plant was opened two years before – a plaque marking the occasion bears the name of one Bernard Sanders, the then mayor. It has since carried much of the burden, supplying around half of Burlington’s electricity needs by burning around 400,000 tonnes of waste wood a year that’s purchased from businesses in the region.  Burlingtonians also bring their own unwanted crates, pallets and tree branches to the plant, where they are diced, stored in huge piles of woodchips, placed on conveyor belts and fed into a Hades-like furnace that reaches around 2,000C. The resulting steam turns a huge turbine that generates the electricity.  “We have to shift the woodchip piles around so they don’t get overheated and self combust,” says Dave MacDonnell, power generation manager of the plant. “There was a small fire on one of the piles when we first opened. That was a PR nightmare.” The path to 100% renewable energy was smoothed by an engaged, progressive populace concerned about diminishing snow on nearby ski runs and heatwaves triggering algal blooms on Lake Champlain. Crucially, the city owns the local utility – the Burlington Electric Department, whose logo looks like it belongs on a 1950s-themed diner – and has managed to keep rates steady over the past decade for bill-payers. “Bernie started getting more people involved and out of the woodwork came ideas,” says Will Raap, who moved to Burlington from California in the 1980s and set up a not-for-profit organization that facilitates local food growing.  “The city council began to shift to reflect a progressive point of view and they brought along the private sector. Now Burlington is the most sustainable city around and the national government has got its head up its butt. Cities are where it is happening.” Other, larger cities are also looking to push ahead. Last year Atlanta became the largest city in the south to pledge 100% renewable energy by 2035. San Francisco hopes to achieve this feat five years before that. The skiing playground of Aspen, Colorado, has already got there. Some Republican-led cities such as San Diego have also thrown their weight behind the goal. Carmel, in Indiana, has installed 116 roundabouts, a rarity in the US, in recent years in order to improve safety and also cut emissions from cars idling at traffic light intersections. “We had to have a lot of public education at the start – some people complained,” says James Brainard, a Republican who has been Carmel’s mayor since 1996. “But now people are proud and we have fights over where we are going to have the next one. Climate is a big part of that.” Cities can make major progress in cutting emissions, according to Stanford academic Mark Jacobson, who has devised a roadmap for US cities to go 100% renewable. “The only obstacle really is knowledge,” he says,. But even if the political will and resources are there, the contours of ambition are still influenced by states and the federal government. Recent research suggests the US is struggling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level it promised in the Paris agreement, at precisely a time when it and other countries would have to accelerate cuts in order to avoid punishing sea level rises, storms, heatwaves and societal unrest. Cities can only do so much to quicken the pace.  “When you can only set policy within a 15 sq mile area, it’s much harder to move the needle,” says Weinberger.  “It takes leadership and political will in thousands of jurisdictions when the federal government isn’t doing its job. It can be frustrating but I think it’s still worth doing. It’s a lot better than doing nothing.” In Burlington, the next stage of the masterplan to become fully carbon-free is to electrify its transport, a trickier proposition as the city doesn’t fully control this area. The regional transport authority will run four electric buses by the end of the year, while the city is offering rebates of up to $1,800 (£1,363) for anyone wishing to buy an electric car. So far, 44 residents have done so. “The irony is for many years we were inviting people to leave the grid because it wasn’t clean,” says Jennifer Green, Burlington’s sustainability chief. “Now that it’s clean we want people back.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
"A 100-metre (330ft) high iceberg has drifted close to a tiny settlement on Greenland’s west coast, prompting fears of a tsunami if it breaks up. Authorities have told residents of the Innaarsuit island settlement living near the shore to move to higher ground. “We fear the iceberg could calve [break apart] and send a flood towards the village,” said Lina Davidsen of Greenland police. Susanne Eliassen, a member of Innaarsuit’s council, said it was not unusual for large icebergs to be seen close to the community. “But this iceberg is the biggest we have seen ... and there are cracks and holes that make us fear it can calve anytime,” she said. “Nobody is staying unnecessarily close to the beach and all children have been told to stay in areas that are high up.”  The village’s power station and fuel tanks are located close to the shore.  Police have moved a search-and-rescue helicopter closer to the remote community, which has a population of about 170.  The incidence of icebergs breaking free from glaciers is likely to become more common, said William Colgan, a Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland researcher. “Iceberg production in Greenland has been increasing in the past 100 years as climate change has become stronger,” he said, while the rising number of icebergs were in turn “increasing the tsunami hazards”. Last year, four people died and 11 were injured after a landslide caused a tsunami off another island settlement called Nuugaatsiaq, sending several houses crashing into the sea. The latest incident comes after scientists at New York University released a time-lapse video of a massive iceberg breaking free from a glacier in eastern Greenland last month. Denise Holland, of NYU’s environmental fluid dynamics laboratory, and David Holland, an expert in atmospheric and ocean science, had camped by the Helheim glacier for weeks to collect data to better project sea level changes due to global warming. David Holland said it was “the largest event we’ve seen in over a decade in Greenland”.  The video, which is 20 times faster than real time, shows 3% of the annual ice loss of Greenland occuring in 30 minutes. “It sounded like rockets going off,” David Holland said, describing it as “a very complex, chaotic, noisy event”. While the couple is studying Greenland, he said that “the real concern is in Antarctica, where everything is so big the stakes are much higher”."
"Boris Johnson’s team wanted to uncover them for Londoners. The Environment Agency explored turning them into wildlife paradises.  Now campaigners are targeting London’s lost rivers, water courses that have been gradually buried over the centuries, as a source of fossil fuel-free heat.  Rivers better known by the streets named after them – such the Fleet and the Strand – offer an inspiring way of cutting the capital’s emissions, the climate charity 10:10 and the social enterprise Scene said. The refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which includes plans for a new heating system and boilers, could be given a low-carbon boost by tapping the nearby Tyburn, according to an analysis by the groups. The river could provide more heat than the palace uses even on the coldest day, they said. The art deco Brockwell Lido in south London, meanwhile, could harness the heat in the adjacent river Effra. Extracting just a tenth of its energy would keep the pool – which dips to 2C in winter – warm all year round.  Another possibility highlighted by the groups is a new future-proofed heat network for four housing estates at Somers Town, north London, which could potentially one day draw heat from the river Fleet. Leo Murray, the director of campaigns at 10:10, said: “The mayor has set ambitious targets for phasing out gas burning in London over the coming years and we are going to need every bit of low-carbon heat we can get our hands on to meet these goals.”  Water-source heat pumps, which in effect work as a reverse refrigerator, would be used to extract the heat. This could in turn be sent to housing estates and large buildings via heat networks, which the government has been backing as a way to decarbonise heating. However, the study made no assessment of whether the pumps would be financially viable for projects and they are yet to be used at scale in the UK.  The royal borough of Greenwich has been exploring the possibility of using water-source heat pumps to provide green heating for 100 homes at the refurbishment of the Ernest Dence estate but is still finalising its plans."
