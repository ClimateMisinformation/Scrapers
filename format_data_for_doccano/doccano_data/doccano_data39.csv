German daily Bild, which has more readers than the WSJ, USA Today and NYT combined,  reports that cats leave huge carbon paw-prints and so make a significant contribution to climate change. Each househiold cat is repsonsible for the emissions of 2.2 tons of CO2 annually.
The information is based on a story appearing in health magazine Healthy Living and on a study from climate company ClimatePartner.
According to Bild, internet portal utopia.de tested the impacts of five different pets on climate. Bild writes:
Catfood, cat litter, waste… every cat leads to 2.2 tons of CO2 emissions annually. No other house pet leaves such a terrible ecological paw-print.
Just the manufacture of cat food and its packing leads to about one ton of CO2 per cat. The waste disposal of food cans and cat litter burdens the climate with an additional 1250 kg of carbon dioxide. Then you have to include the water consumption for cleaning the cat potty.”
The house cat is an even bigger climate sinner than a dog, says Bild.
What pet ought one keep if concerned about impacting the climate? The study says the canary bird is the ideal pet to keep, emitting only 0.028 tons of CO2 annually.
According to Wikipedia: “Cats are a common companion animal in Europe and North America, and their worldwide population exceeds 500 million.” That comes out to a billion tons of CO2 just on the account of cats. That’s the same as 100 million Europeans. Time to call the exterminator. Hey – it’s either them, or us.
Of course Bild reminds us that cats themselves are not really the problem, but people who keep them. Bild writes: “Humans by far are worse for the climate”.

Today they can be burned more cleanly and efficiently than ever. Moreover, the science shows that they don’t have a significant impact on climate.To solve the poverty that still ravages many parts of the world, it is imperative that these impacted regions be supplied with the essential cornerstone of development: cheap ENERGY. It’s a fact: The more energy people consume, the more their standards of living improve. Take a look at the 2 following tables.
Per capita GDP, selected countries 
[US $]
1. Norway 55,000
2. USA 47,000
3. Australia: 41,000
4. Canada: 39,000
5. Germany: 36,000
6. Japan: 34,000
7. Russia: 16,000
8. Mexico: 14,000
9. China: 7,600
10. India: 3,500
11. Sudan: 2,300
12. North Korea: 1,800
13. Ethiopia: 600
Per capita energy consumption of randomly selected countries 
[kilograms of oil equivalent]
1. Canada: 8300
2. USA 7800
3. Norway 5900
4. Australia: 5700
5. Russia: 4400
6. Germany: 4200
7. Japan: 4000
8. Mexico: 1530
9. China: 1140
10. North Korea: 900
11. India: 510
12. Sudan: 480
13. Ethiopia: 280
Compare the position of each country in the 2 tables. What do you notice?
It should be no surprise that the countries with higher per capita energy consumption also have higher per capita GDP, i.e. far better standards of living. On the other hand, countries that consume very little energy have impoverished standards of living and much misery. It’s almost 1 to 1. No country that consumes lots of energy is living in poverty, and no country that consumes little energy is living in prosperity. Of course there are other factors that come into play, such as education and freedom.
Depriving people of energy is not going to allevaite poverty, period. To the contrary, it will only make it worse.  Moreover, making the supply of energy more expensive by mandating costly renewables is only going to result in yet a further reduction in energy consumption in the third world – one they simply cannot afford. Expensive alternative energy sources there will only make the catastrophic living conditions there even worse.
Preventing the construction of power plants and the drilling of gas and oil will also have the same devastating effects.
An extreme example is Somalia. There even the fundamental source of energy for human life – FOOD – is now in short supply. The big problem there is not that there is a global shortage of food, but rather it is that huge amounts of the global food stocks are being converted into biofuels to combat fantasized AGW. That criminal kind of energy-deprivation enacted by the west needs to stop – and soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst, regrettably, while I was on holidays in the US, Joe Bastardi sent me something he wanted posted and it wasn’t until this morning that I discovered it in my spam. So I’m a little late getting this out, and maybe this already got published at other sites in the meantime. Oh well, in any case, without further ado, here it is. Joe has got some questions.
==================================================

How Do The AGW People Get Away With This?
by Joe Bastardi
A few graphics make the position of the AGW people completely absurd. It’s why I am so confident as to my position on this matter, and by the way it does have something to do with the weather because if you know where the weather has been, you have a better chance to know where it’s going.
Exhibit one, from my co-partner here at WeatherBell Joe D Aleo ( I wonder if we will share the same cell when the warmingistas come to get us. And will they let us have the same tattoo artist to brand us deniers?)

PDO and AMO are strongly correlated to the earths temps…now watch CO2 vs temps over the past century:

Even more damming than this, look at the past 10 years:

Or the last 15 years:

Which leads to the question: How do these people have any credibility? How do they get away with this?  It’s mind boggling that its gotten to a point where the EPA is dictating policy based on what is an obvious fraud, or if you want to be gentle about it, creates enough doubt to back off.
Here is something to consider.
Over a year ago I advised a client of mine at the time to purchase less air conditioners than for  2010 because the summer of 2011 would be cooler than the summer of 2010. Now there is talk that this is going to turn out like last summer, but assuming it won’t, the forecast was made. BEFORE LAST SUMMER. The client had to put in their order for air conditioners a year beforehand because they were ordering them FROM CHINA.
Now every red blooded American gets up in arms because all those jobs should be here in USA, right?  But why aren’t they? Well  in large part because of policy that is based on absurdities like this, a factory making anything here is now being clamped down on by the EPA so hard, so why bother? Its like Obama said:  ” So, if somebody wants to  build a coal plant, they can, it’s just that it will bankrupt them because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that will get emitted”.
That is a direct quote and is like his energy Sec saying that they seek to take away choices that people waste their money on. Astounding that things like that are being pushed by people in control,  or that they even got control in the first place. That is our fault, based on what is obviously flat out nonsense. But combine that with labor costs, and the fact the that the corporate tax rate in the US is higher than China, which few people in our nation seem to get, and this is what happens.
Now let’s say we wanted to make sure that a person here working in an air conditioner factory can make a decent wage from a helping hand ( how do like my populist line…from the Ghost of Tom Joad?)  Well, get rid of the EPA  running roughshod over factory owners, and lower the corporate tax rate to below China’s  ( it is so hard to believe that Chinese tax rates are lower) and you will find that companies will stay here and pay a decent wage to build air conditioners, But not if you are clamping down on people based on questionable, don’t-have-a-leg-to-stand-on ideas about co2 warming the planet.
Again, it defies logic as to how they got to where they did with this issue, and the facts are there for all to see.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back I sent an e-mail to the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), who we all know provide us with the fascinating 80°+N Arctic temperature charts.
With the Arctic being a crucial indicator of global warming, so we are told, I thought surely they must also have a plot of the annual 80°+N mean temperatures. Astonishingly they wrote back and said they don’t – but sent me the data and said I was welcome to have a go at it.
Ed Caryl volunteered to crunch the numbers and to do a little extra digging on the side. Here’s what he came up with.
====================================================
+80°North
 by Ed Caryl
Since 1958 the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) has been reporting temperatures above 80° North, the North pole and environs, using a gridded model, but basing the data on all available temperature measurements in the area. Pierre obtained all the daily data since 1958 from DMI, and asked me to reduce it to an annual mean temperature plot. Figure 1 is the result.

Figure 1: The annual temperature anomaly for the Arctic above 80° north. From DMI data.
One observes that since 1958 the annual average mean temperature has varied across a range 1.5° C wide, until 2005, when it warmed by just over 2°C above the long term average. One then asks, why?
Figure 2, the Dipole Anomaly in June 2010. —Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center courtesy NOAA/ESRL Physical Sciences Division
The first suspect named by the warmists is a phenomenon called the Arctic Dipole Anomaly. The dipole is high pressure over the Arctic regions on North America, the Beaufort Sea, and low pressure over the Asian Arctic, the Kara Sea. This causes winds from the south along the Siberian coast, pushing ice to the north, and north winds in the Fram Strait, pushing ice out of the Arctic and into North Atlantic. See Figure 2 for the conditions in June 2010. The reduced ice cover has resulted in higher annual temperatures. Many writers echo a claim that this pattern is new, and not seen prior to 1990, blaming it on “climate change”.
The Dipole Anomaly was only noticed this last decade, but I suspect that the phenomenon has been happening all along as a part of the regular AMO and NAO cycles, it is just that there was not sufficient instrumentation in the high arctic to bring it to notice, especially during previous warm periods in the 1920s and 30s. But there were measurements made at a few locations, and many ship logs, and written discussions of these earlier times. But those have been forgotten or ignored by present-day researchers. The failure to recognize and investigate the cyclic nature of nature, especially the interactions of cycles tens and hundreds of years long, has been the failure that has spawned the modern hysteria about “climate change.” (Please excuse the digression.)
The warmest year for most Arctic stations is 1938. Figure 3 is from A Light In Siberia, showing the average of isolated stations in the high Arctic rim, most of them on the coast of Siberia. These temperature records just catch the edge of the 1920 temperature rise.

Figure 3: The average temperature of 9 high Arctic weather stations.
Figure 3 also shows a rapid warming from 1935 to 1938, as well as the recent warming from 2004 to 2007, just like the DMI measurements. The same phenomenon is likely the cause of the temperature rises then and now. This reference was found here:
See: Overland, J.E. (2005) and Muyin Wang; ‘The third Arctic climate pattern: 1930s and early 2000s’, when saying: “The period from 1928–1935 also had a dipole structure in SLP, which contributed to the interdecadal arctic-wide warm temperature anomalies in the first half of the 20th century.”
So much for the Arctic Dipole being new.

“Meridional flows” from the north at Spitzbergen (Svalbard) are also mentioned in that reference. These are a result of an Arctic Dipole. They also write of an average annual increase of shipping access to the island from 94 days to 157 days over the period from 1918 to 1939. The year with the most southern sea ice was 1917, with no access to Spitsbergen’s coast. But there was a great warming in the interval from 1917 to 1922. The following was published in the journal Monthly Weather Review October 10, 1922 (emphasis added).
Dr. Hoel, who has just returned, reports the location of hitherto unknown coal deposits on the eastern shores of Advent Bay – deposits of vast extent and superior quality……The oceanographic observations have, however, been even more interesting. Ice conditions were exceptional. In fact, so little ice has never before been noted. The expedition all but established a record, sailing as far north as 81o29′ in ice-free water. This is the farthest north ever reached with modern oceanographic apparatus…..
“In connection with Dr. Hoel’s report, it is of interest to note the unusually warm summer in Arctic Norway and the observations of Capt. Martin Ingebrigtsen, who has sailed the eastern Arctic for 54 years past. He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1918, that since that time it has steadily gotten warmer, and that to-day the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of 1868 to 1917.
“Many old landmarks are so changed as to be unrecognisable. Where formerly great masses of ice were found, there are now often moraines, accumulations of earth and stones. At many points where glaciers formerly extended far into the sea they have entirely disappeared.
“The change in temperature, says Captain Ingebrigtsen, has also brought about great change in the flora and fauna of the Arctic. This summer he sought for white fish in Spitsbergen waters. Formerly great shoals of them were found there. This year he saw none, although he visited all the old fishing grounds.
“There were few seal in Spitzbergen waters this year, the catch being far under the average. This, however, did not surprise the captain. He pointed out that formerly the waters about Spitzbergen held an even summer temperature of about 3o Celsius; this year recorded temperatures up to 15o, and last winter the ocean did not freeze over even on the north coast of Spitsbergen.”
Here is a chart (Figure 4) of the winter warming at Spitsbergen. The chart begins at 1912, so the full extent of the warming is shown. There was over 10° C of warming in winter from the 1910’s to the 1930’s.

Figure 4: Winter temperature (December, January, and February) at Isfjord Radio weather station, Svalbard/Spitsbergen. Data from GISS.

Figure 5: +80° North Winter temperatures (in degrees Kelvin, as reported by DMI). This is also from DMI data. The bold line is the average of the monthly figures, and is charted in the December year. One more year is shown over Figure 1 because we have full data from last winter through February.
Any warming in the far north is mostly seen in the winter. Note that the winter warming in Figure 5 is more than twice the annual warming seen in Figure 1 in the same period. But also note that the current warming at +80° North is less than half the warming that was seen at Spitsbergen (Figure 4) in the early 1900’s. Figure 6 shows the modern warming at Jan Mayen, Svalbard airport and Bear Island. The modern and the 70’s warming is not nearly as dramatic as that in the early 20th Century, and that happened without the assistance of CO2.

Figure 6: Winter temperatures at Jan Mayen, Bjornoya (Bear Island) and Svalbard airport.

Figure 7. The winter AMO index, 1856 to the present. The bold trace is the average of the monthly data.
So what caused the warming, then and now? One answer, found here (Sergei Rodionov, Climate Logic), is that a shift to the east in the position of the Icelandic low, into Siberia, becoming the “Arctic dipole,” is responsible. This along with a high NAO index, a rising AMO, and ocean currents, makes the Barents Sea warmer than normal. Will this continue? S. Rodionov predicts that the warming will end in 2012, and a cooling trend will last until 2023. The short-term trend is already down. In Figure 5, the warmest winter was 2008. In Svalbard, Jan Mayen, and Bear Island, the downturn began earlier, in 2006. See Figure 6. I strongly recommend reading Rodionov’s article, which goes into great detail.
In the 1920’s the AMO was rising sharply, (see Figure 7) encouraging a dramatic temperature rise in the high Arctic, while currently the AMO is near or past it’s peak, stopping the temperature rise. The 1970’s cooling and warming tracked the AMO. This is all cycles. From the sun to the oceans, some cycles are long, like the Dansgaard/Oeschger
and Bond events, some are irregular like the ENSO cycles, some are tens of years long and regular, like the AMO cycle, some are short and regular like the sun. The sun also has
several long cycles. When these cycles get “in phase,” all encouraging heating or cooling at once, strange things can happen. (For more on Bond Events, google Bond Events Chiefio. He has some very interesting things to say.)

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe scene of the accident occurring earlier today looks as grisly as a war zone.
Motorists were blinded by a sandstorm on the A19 motorway near the German coastal port city of Rostock. In all, almost 50 cars were involved in the massive pile up, with 10 dead and almost 100 injured. 17 cars and three trucks caught fire.
The online Der Spiegel has a spectacular video here that gives you a good idea of the zero-visibility conditions drivers had to contend with – with little warning – causing them a nightmare. The online Bild daily also has a photo gallery here.
This is what a sandstorm can look like. This one in Iraq, from Wikipedia (Photo credit: US Marine Corps)
Though speed limits are being imposed increasingly on Germany’s famous autobahns, there are still many sections that have no speed limit. Cars traveling 120 miles per hour and more are not uncommon.
At the scene of this accident, that particular section of autobahn also had no speed limit, and high-speed drivers were caught by off guard as the sudden sandstorm cut visibility across the motorway to almost zero with little warning, causing drivers traveling in both directions to slam on the brakes and resulting in the deadly pile-up. Bild newspaper reports:
Cars crashed into other cars with such force that some were found 50 meters off the autobahn in a field. At this location on the autobahn there is no speed limit. But you could see the sand coming, it should have been possible to brake’, said truck drive [Ralf] Schulz.“
Der Spiegel says “an unusual weather phenomena is suspected to have triggered the chain of crashes”, saying that hurricane force winds whipped up the sand and formed tornado like conditions. But when one views the film footage, one sees that the dust cloud is no more than a few meters above the ground.
Actually, as reader Ron de Haan points out, this is a dust storm from plowed agricultural fields in the area. The German press though are calling it a sandstorm.

“Climate science is the new replacement religion”
In contains a plea for calm and a reminder that global temperatures have gone nowhere over the last 13 years. DIE WELT writes:
Even one of the biggest prophets of climate catastrophe, Englishman Phil Jones, had to admit after the disclosure of thousands of e-mails from the IPCC a few years ago that the current temperature development is comparable to two other periods occurring in the last century.”
Moreover, DIE WELT writes that a real discussion and debate is constantly torpedoed by the global warming protagonists, and that they have a habit of ignoring inconvenient facts: DIE WELT writes:

The IPCC has ignored an entire field of science…
Very few people have recognised that in the research that Vahrenholt und Lüning are referring to has nothing to do with the irradiative heating of the sun, which indeed does not fluctuate much, but with the soilar winds which are increasingly shown to have an indirect impact on cloud formation, and thus influence the climate.
The IPCC has looked at this on the fringes and have determined that this research – which the renwoned CERN institute and others are carrying out -– is not far enough to allow conclusions to be drawn.
That may or may not be the case. But the fact remains that the IPCC, which is responsible for bringing the scientists together, still has not gotten the idea to invite these scientists for its large climate reports. Why not? After all it’s the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and not the Intergovernmental Panel on CO2.”
The positive feedbacks ASSUMED for CO2 with respect to water vapour are also very poorly understood. Yet the IPCC has no problems inflating those and including them in their climate reports.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRichard Wagner at the German site Die Achse Des Guten  (The Axis of Good) takes an excellent look at the feasibility of powering society solely with renewable energy (sun, wind, biofuel) and through energy savings. It’s a challenge many engineers are grappling with.

All images here are from: http://wattsupwiththat wind-turbines-video/.
But earlier a reader here at NTZ (DirkH I think) commented that many young German engineers naively come into the industry, as if on a religious mission to rescue the planet from the Biblical catastrophe of climate meltdown, in search of that all-elusive energy supply that is both cheap with no adverse effects, or to find ways to go without.
That engineers come into the industry with such religious mindsets is already a very troubling sign. It tells us they have not even taken the first step of checking the “problem” to see if the proposed solution itself could be much worse. Have the “green” engineers really looked at the data that supposedly underpins the “climate problem”?
The answer is “no”. If they had, they would not be proposing the expensive solutions they are now being proposed (unless it’s all about making money and the future be damned).
A good engineer checks the data behind the “problem” and does not make up problems just to give himself something to do. Good engineers have a good sense for economics. Bad ones do not.
Green engineers are among the worst and most dangerous
Overall, German engineers are second to none in many fields such as petroleum, chemicals, automotive, machine building, project management and so on. But in renewable energy, they are careless, naive, ideological and ignorant -and so have become a hazard to society – particularly economically and with respect to the risks their solutions pose down the line. It’s our children and grandchildren that will have to inherit the mess they leave behind.

This generation of “green” engineers will likely be the first to cause far more problems than they solve. When data is recklessly and maliciously neglected, it’s inevitable.
Already we have seen their solutions turn into disasters. Some examples: biofuels on the food supply and monoculture, windmills and solar panels with respect to aesthetics, supply consistency and cost. Think about the impacts of mercury-laden energy saving lights in our landfills. Nobody really thought about these impacts. It was all driven by blind government policy.
In all cases it’s: “Whether these solutions work or not, it won’t be our problem – so take the money while you can, and run”. We see it at GE, Siemens, the solar industry and a host of others. The list is too long to get into.
These opportunists and swindlers never stopped once to think that the science could be wrong, or couldn’t care less. They don’t want to know it’s wrong. “It’s to save the climate (and make tons of money guaranteed by government policy).” This is selfish opportunism – not engineering.
So will it work?
Richard Wagner at Die Achse Des Guten provides us the answer using an example.
Because I accused the Greens of being hostile to technology, one reader asked me the clever question of whether or not the green technologies of sun and wind power systems were products of engineering, and thus of technology.
The question where technology begins and where it ends is certainly an intriguing issue. One can discuss it all evening long, both in the limelight or by candle light. But it would not address the core of the issue. Also the production of bicycles is a significant part of our economy. Yet, nobody has ever seriously asked if it would be possible to replace commercial jets with flying bicycles.
But this is precisely what the Greens are attempting in the energy issue. This is, and will remain, a question of technology and resources needed for the technology at hand. The objective of every energy debate should be the creation and the assurance of the energy extent that we need in order to progress further.”
And not finding ways to force others to go without. And saving energy is a waste if the costs of doing so far exceed the savings and benefits. Green engineers need to broaden their scope of analysis and depth of thinking. They need to get away from ideology, and to get back to art of engineering.

By Matti Vooro
The headline on recent news clipping reads Toll from Europe Freeze tops 220, see here and here. Reading news clips about the current weather in Europe and Asia and then comparing that to what IPCC said in its 2007 report about what Europeans should expect for future winter weather is as if the IPCC was predicting the climate for another planet.

Fig. 1: European winter temperature deviations from the 1961 – 1990 base for the years 1998-2010. Blue = Europe winter temp, black line = linear trend.
The latest death count is over 300 now. You just cannot be this far off in your forecasts and claim that this is based on any credible climate science supported by most climate scientists. If it is supported by most climate scientists, then we have serious science credibility problems here for Europe.
Here is what the IPCC predicted earlier (emphasis added):
Assessments of projected climate change for Europe:
Annual mean temperatures in Europe are likely to increase more than the global mean. The warming in northern Europe is likely to be largest in winter and that in the Mediterranean area largest in summer. The lowest winter temperatures are likely to increase more than average winter temperature in northern Europe, and the highest summer temperatures are likely to increase more than average summer temperature in southern and central Europe.

Annual precipitation is very likely to increase in most of northern Europe and decrease in most of the Mediterranean area. In central Europe, precipitation is likely to increase in winter but decrease in summer. Extremes of daily
precipitation are very likely to increase in northern Europe. The annual number of precipitation days is very likely to decrease in the Mediterranean area. The risk of summer drought is likely to increase in central Europe and in the Mediterranean area.
Confidence in future changes in windiness is relatively low, but it seems more likely than not that there will be an increase in average and extreme wind speeds in northern Europe.
The duration of the snow season is very likely to shorten in all of Europe, and snow depth is likely to decrease in at least most of Europe.”
This is now the fourth of such cold winters for Europe depending on the individual country.  Europe’s and Berlin‘s winter temperatures show a linear decline since 1998 (See Figure 1) and more seriously with very cold winters since after 2007 and 2008, See the two charts at the bottom of this article.
Other scientists have noted that Northern Europe and Asia have had cooling winters since 1988 or for two decades now as noted below. So this is not just a new development but that the cooling has been coming now for a decade or more. So how could IPCC be so wrong only a few years ago? 
A recent technical paper called Arctic warming, increasing snow cover and widespread boreal winter cooling, Judah L Cohen1 et al:
Record cold snaps and heavy snowfall events across the United States, Europe and East Asia garnered much public attention during the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11 (Blunden et al 2011, Cohen et al2010). Cohen et al (2009) argued that the occurrence of more severe NH winter weather is a two-decade-long trend starting around 1988.”
So it is heartening to read just recently in the news that some German mainstream media have finally seen the light and have exposed the IPCC science as being flawed and no longer credible for planning our future and are beginning to ask the type of questions that should have been asked all along. It is unfortunate that hundreds of people had to die before we start doing proper planning for the colder winters that may lie ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe fundamental human right of scientific freedom gets trampled on in Germany. European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Vice President Michael Limburg was denied making a climate science-critical speech at the University of Leipzig.  Are we slipping back into the science Dark Ages in Europe?Press Release from EIKE:
“University of Leipzig censors critical climate conference*. Fundamental freedom of science gets trampled.
Blatant censorship of dissenting scientific opinions on the subject of climate change and its causes is the post-modern trend. After recent attempts to ban the scientifically undesirable paper by renown scientists Spencer & Braswell (details here) and the ban of the climate-critical conference at the Belgian Society of European Engineers and Industrialists (SEII) by IPCC Vice Chair Prof. J. van Ypersele (details here), the Faculty for Physics and Geosciences of the University of Leipzig is the next to suppress open scientific debate. University of Leipzig Dean Prof. Dr. Jürgen Haase Tuesday barred a climate seminar organized by geography professor Werner Kirstein, as wells as the use of the University auditorium and participation by European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Vice President Michael Limburg as the main speaker.Fortunately the ban was later relaxed and the seminar was allowed to go ahead.
The reason for originally having banned the seminar was a dissertation authored by Michael Limburg, which was critical of climate-science and was submitted to the faculty in March 2010. Two reviewers rejected the dissertation claiming, among other points, that it was inadequate. This is why Limburg was not welcome as a speaker, according to a letter from the Dean. The fact that the same dissertation had been recommended for acceptance by 4 other renowned professors went unmentioned by Haase. Limburg immediately challenged the ban.
What was so inconvenient about Limburg’s dissertation?
Under the supervision of Prof. Werner Kirstein, Limburg had written a dissertation that examined the quality of historical global temperature and sea level data in detail. His conclusions were damning. Using accepted rules for science and measurement, Limburg’s results showed that the datasets did not allow sea level and temperature change over the last 120-150 years to be determined anywhere near the alleged accuracies of millimetres or tenths of a degree Celsius respectively as claimed by the IPCC. The range of uncertainty, in both global mean temperature and sea level, is considerably greater than the total respective changes given by the IPCC. Every factor in attributing the possible causes of the changes was, at best, scientifically questionable.
Naturally, the faculty searched – and found – the “right” reviewers for assessing Limburg’s dissertation. In his decision to ban Limburg from speaking, Haase quoted only the objectively unfair and negative assessments. The fact that four other university professors had recommended the dissertation be accepted got no mention by Haase. Limburg officially contested the assessment delivered by the two reviewers, but they have taken their time to respond. Up to today there is still no response. Now a legal battle appears inevitable. Science has again been cast aside.
The high point of the whole affair is the open attempt by the University of Leipzig to silence Lim¬burg – even though he had been officially invited by a full professor. The Leipzig University faculty appears to be completely oblivious to this unworthy conduct.
Open debate is essential for the progress of science
This brings up Voltaire, the most famous philosopher of our time, and his words to his harshest opponent: ‘Sir, I do not agree with your opinion and I fully oppose you. But I would give up my life to assure that you will always be allowed to publicly express your opinion’. At the University of Leipzig, there has to be some colleagues among the philosophy faculty who are familiar with those words. But it looks as if the University leadership is not among them.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you wish to bail out someone in dire financial straits, then you’ll want to make sure that the party receiving the bailout funds will break its old spending habits and not continue its wasteful ways.
This is the case with insolvent Portugal, as the IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank prepare a bailout package for the country. These bailout institutions are demanding that Portugal, among other measures, take a hard look at all its renewable expensive energy subsidies.
The author of the climate website Ecotretas informs us that the offical Portugal-bailout Memorandum Of Understanging (MOU) has been released by the above-named institutes. You can read it HERE.
Here we have the de facto financial branch of the European Union certifying that renewable energies are financially non-sustainable – a waste of money. Yes, so-called sustainability helps lead to fiscal non-sustainability.
The relevant parts on energy are on pages 24 and 25. Under Additional costs associated with electricity production under the ordinary regime; the conditions call for (emphasis added):
5.6. Take measures in order to limit the additional cost associated with the production of electricityunder the ordinary regime, in particular through renegotiation or downward revision of the guaranteed compensation mechanism (CMEC) paid to producers under the ordinary regime and the remaining long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs). [Q4-2011]
And written under Support schemes for production of energy under the special regime (cogeneration and renewables):
5.7. Review the efficiency of support schemes for co-generation and propose possible options for adjusting downward the feed-in tariff used in co-generation (reduce the implicit subsidy) [Q4-2011]
5.8. Review in a report the efficiency of support schemes for renewables, covering their rationale, their levels, and other relevant design elements.[Q4-2011]
5.9. For existing contracts in renewables, assess in a report the possibility of agreeing a renegotiation of the contracts in view of a lower feed-in tariff. [Q4-2011]
5.10. For new contracts in renewables, revise downward the feed-in tariffs and ensure that the tariffs do not over-compensate producers for their costs and they continue to provide an incentive to reduce costs further, through digressive tariffs. For more mature technologies develop alternative mechanisms (such as feed-in premiums). Reports on action taken will be provided annually in Q3-2011, Q3-2012 and Q3-2013.
5.11. Decisions on future investments in renewables, in particular in less mature technologies,will be based on a rigorous analysis in terms of its costs and consequences for energy prices. International benchmarks should be used for the analysis and an independent evaluation should be carried out. Reports on action taken will be provided annually in Q3-2011, Q3-2012 and Q3-2013.
In a nutshell, for Portugal to stop wasting money on renewables, as the IMF, EC and ECB request, the country really ought to stop renewables altogether. Obviously renewable energy are for rich countries who have money to burn. But when you’re broke – then you ought to stop using it.
After all in the end, what good is “energy sustainability” if it leads the world to real financial ruin?

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s something the alarmist warmists can put in their pipes and smoke.
A new paper titled El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability from the Late Cretaceous Marca Shale of California authored by Andrew Davies, Alan E.S. Kemp, Graham P. Weedon, and John A. Barron shows that a permanent El Nino did not exist during that particular greenhouse episode.
The latest Cretaceous laminated Marca Shale of California permits a seasonal-scale reconstruction of water column flux events and hence interannual paleoclimate variability. The paper’s abstract continues (emphasis added):

Time series analysis of interannual variability in terrigenous sediment and diatom flux and in the degree of bioturbation indicates strong periodicities in the quasi-biennial (2.1–2.8 yr) and lowfrequency (4.1–6.3 yr) bands both characteristic of ENSO forcing, as well as decadal frequencies. This evidence for robust Late Cretaceous ENSO variability does not support the theory of a “permanent El Niño,” in the sense of a continual El Niño–like state, in periods of warmer climate.”

In the paper’s conclusion we find:

There is therefore little support for the existence of a ‘permanent El Niño’ in the Late Cretaceous, in the sense of the continual El Niño state depicted by Fedorov et al. (2006). […] there was robust ENSO variability in past “greenhouse” episodes and that future warming will be unlikely to promote a permanent El Niño state.”

This is not the first paper to suggest that. You can read about an earlier paper here.
So much for the scare that the CO2 emitted by man would propel the planet into a permanent El Nino burn-up, as Ray Pierrehumbert and climate models suggested here at RealCrock:
How will the El Niño phenomenon be affected by a global warming?
…how ENSO will respond to a global warming is still not settled. However, it seems that one common trait among some climate models is the indication that a global warming may result in a more a general El Niño-type average state (eg. Collins et al. 2005, Climate Dynamics, 24, 89-104. 19 and here).”
So much for “settled science”.

By Ed Caryl
Because pilots need to know the local weather conditions, most temperature-measuring sites are at airports worldwide. Airports, in turn, tend to be where the airport users are, near cities. As cities grow, so do the airports. As the airports and cities grow, the number of aircraft and aircraft operations grow. As operations (take-offs and landings) grow, more kerosene (Jet fuel, JP-1 and JP-4) is burned. It is widely recognized that large airports near large cities are in urban-heat-islands (UHI), but is it the local population or the amount of fuel burned that causes the UHI? And what is the error in temperature measurements?
Twenty airports in the central United States were found with long, continuous, temperature records. They ranged in size from the small airport at North Platte, Nebraska, to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International airport. The local populations ranged from 24,000 to 3.2 million. When counting aircraft operations, only multi-engine jet and turbine engine operations were used, commercial and military. General aviation aircraft operations were ignored. A Cessna 172, after all, burns about as much fuel on take-off as a Boeing 727 auxiliary power unit uses while sitting at the gate, that is, in comparison, not much.
The 20 airports were: Albuquerque NM, Bismarck ND, Cheyenne WY, Duluth MN, Eau Claire WI, Eppley Field (Omaha, NE), Lincoln NE, Memphis TN, Minneapolis MN, North Platt NE, 0klahoma City OK, Peoria IL, Pueblo CO, Salt Lake City UT, Sioux City IA, Springfield IL, St Louis MO, Topeka KS, Urbana IL, and Wichita KS.
The temperature trend used in Figure 1 is the linear trend over the 66-years from 1934 to 2000, inclusive, to include both the hottest year in the previous cycle to the hottest years in the current cycle. Temperatures are from the GIStemp web site here. The default (raw) annual data was used for each location.

Figure 1. This is a plot of the Temperature Trend for 20 U. S. airports versus local population and number of daily jet aircraft operations. The vertical scales are both logarithmic, thus the linear trends are seen as log curves.
The twenty airports in this plot sort themselves into three groups. The first group of eight seems the least contaminated by local heat sources, and plot along linear trends with R2 values of 0.862 for population and 0.7876 for operations. It makes sense that the population and aircraft operations should track closely, because the percentage of people that fly should be somewhat the same everywhere.
The second group of eight is smaller cities with fewer flights, and seems slightly more contaminated by local heat sources. Some sources were identified, and proved to be airport facilities like Instrument Landing System (ILS) equipment and runway approach lighting. The same rough ratio of people and flights holds, though the number of operations warms the environment slightly more than the people.

At the remaining four airports, the UHI from population completely breaks down, and only air operations have any significance. These four were examined closely. All had local heat sources within 50 meters of the temperature sensors. At three, what appear to be ILS buildings are close by, at the fourth; a generator building was the culprit (Figure 2).




Figure 2. This is the site at Cheyenne, Wyoming airport. The generator building is downhill about 40 meters from the temperature sensor A (heat rises). The image is from Google here.
It is clear from Figure 1 that in the absence of population and burned jet fuel, the temperature trend in the mid-U. S., from 1934 to 2000, has been cooling by about one degree C. It is also clear that the UHI affect in the vicinity of large cities and their airports, is about 1.5°C. Yes, fossil fuel use leads to warming, especially at airports. But if those are the only places being measured, it is like a blind-man describing an elephant touching only the trunk.

Figure 3. This is the cooling trend at 56 rural sites in the U. S. since 2000.
Since 2000, the U. S. has cooled one further degree, for a total since 1934, of 2.5°C. It is time for Messieurs Jones, Hansen, and Mann to switch back to global cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the book out 6 days, parts of the the German mainstream media and green activists are finding the the whole affair really tough to digest. Some of the reactions have been downright nasty and Medieval.
The left wing German online TAZ here has a weekend article called “Climate Skeptics Are Like Viruses“, which looks at the controversy swirling about Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s new skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne“.
TAZ’s message is clear: In climate science, scientific scrutiny and enquiry are mental disorders coming from viruses. We all know what needs to be done with viruses.
IPCC lead author: skeptics no longer need to be heard!
In the TAZ piece, IPCC lead author Petra Döll is quoted as saying that skeptics don’t need to be heard. Lüning and Vahrenholt respond at their Die kalte Sonne site:
The attitude of refusal by the IPCC with respect to open scientific discussion and debate is now conspicuous. This is demomstrated by IPCC lead author Dr. Petra Döll in the German online taz in claiming that “climate skeptics” no longer need to be heard. Indeed it is questionable just how long this weird scientific approach can be maintained. Should we not expect a professional demeanor from scientists who are paid and supported by German tax revenue? Döll’s dubious reasoning: The climate skeptics ”just keep repeating the same arguments”.  Could it be that the so-called climate skeptics are forced to keep repeating because the current climate science establishment has yet to provide a satisfactory answer? There’s a lot that indicates this is the case. An assessment of the media one week after the launch of the book “Die kalte Sonne” has clearly shown: The media are relying on a hand-full of prominent experts whose arguments are showing to be everything but scientifically convincing. The statements of many experts and activist editors are characterized by misrepresentations, intentional omissions and errors.
Politicians have become aware of this problem. SPD socialist party Chairman writes in the the Sunday edition of the TAZ sonntaz that in all cases we have to hear the climate skeptics out, ‘and even if it is sometimes very difficult to do so.’ Perhaps he’s beginning to realize that something is amiss within the IPCC. Politicians have blindly relied on the IPCC for too long. Whatever the IPCC said, was law. When one considers how high the stakes really are in the climate debate, then one has to conclude that an independent review of the IPCC’s basic assumptions is essential, even just for the sake of transparency reasons. To avoid conflicts of interest, such a review should be conducted by neutral parties who are not involved in the climate debate. Of course this should be done by scientists, but the more they are from outside of climate science, the better. Climate science is not rocket science. An independent review by a commission is possible with independent scientists. In the event members come from a large research facility, then it must be assured that there is no sister institute that is dependent on climate science funding. The most important tool of such a commission is natural science common sense, which has been increasingly missing in the climate sciences over the last years.”

That’s a reasonable response. A commission to conduct a review of the IPCC is long overdue, as it is well-documented that the IPCC house is a mess.
But scrutinizing science is mentally ill – the TAZ wants to tell us
There’s another part of the TAZ report, which Lüning and Vahrenolt did not respond to (probably because of its sheer absurdity). Here’s what the end-of-the-world-obsessed TAZ adds:
Also psychologist Marius Raab asks that climate skeptics be listened to. Their ‘house of thoughts’ in the end fulfill many criteria for conspiracy theories, which Raab studies at the University of Bamberg. ‘A conspiracy theory is foremost a good story,’ he wrote to the sonntaz, “in structure and argumentation it is especially compelling and holds the invitation to get involved and thus to spread the word. Argumentation is one-sided, not scientific.'”
Reminds me of the old Soviet tactic of admitting political opponents to mental institutions in order to eliminate them. With the TAZ’s “virus” remark and adding the comments from shrink Raab, it’s clear that the TAZ has no interest in arguing the science and is perfectly content to engage in gutter journalism.
Finally, here’s an objective radio report (in German) Inforadio rbb on the book “Die kalte Sonne” .

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Voice Of Russia website has an interview with John Ritch, Director General of the World Nuclear Association, based in London, UK. The interview starts as follows:
What kind of consequences could the decision by the German government have, both in political and economical aspects?
Well, let us return to the basics of what has occurred here. To be successful, democracy requires leadership rather than politician desperately chasing the latest polls. Missus Merkel’s desperate chase has now produced an act of monumental irresponsibility both for the global environment and for Germany’s economic interest. Germany will now pollute more, function less efficiently and depend more on imported energy…
Continue reading (with audio)“
Ritch doesn’t hold back in blasting Germany’s hysterical knee-jerk move away from nuclear power, adding comments as follows:
…excellent companies are being made to bear the burden of this political imbecility…will actually have little effect on the momentum of the world’s continuing shift towards nuclear power…they have become victims of a German experiment in the environmental ideology…has taken a serious step backwards into a dark yesterday…an example of misguided ideology…unfortunate to see such a sophisticated nation falling pray to this kind of ideological illusion…”
And here’s how Ritch views “green” technology industries and a German future based on them:
…they will benefit from it but only to the degree that the government is willing to create subsidies, because they operate technologies that cannot actually succeed in a competitive market…eventually the burden of such heavy subsidies will show up in the tax burden of the ordinary German citizen, and…will begin to notice that their government has led them down a completely silly path.”
In German there ‘s a saying that describes the country’s plan to reach this utopia: “Sie sind auf dem Holzweg!”
This is just the latest sequel to a bad film by Germany’s latest political directors. Call it: Germany Commits Suicide III.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper has been published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestrial Physics, authored by Nicola Scafetta, 2012: Testing an astronomically based decadal-scale empirical harmonic climate model versus the IPCC (2007) general circulation models. Entire paper available here.
Solar system (public domain graphic -NASA)
It’s not a secret that the IPCC models are all rigged to make CO2 look like the culprit for the last 150 years of warming. We say this because we now know their models completely ignore, or selectively distort, the potency of an array of drivers and amplification mechanisms.
In the paper, according to the abstract, Scafetta compares the performance of a recently proposed empirical climate model based on astronomical harmonics against all CMIP3 available general circulation climate models (GCM) used by the IPCC (2007) and finds that the climate appears to be resonating with, or is synchronized to, a set of natural harmonics that have been associated to the solar system planetary motion.
According to the abstract:
…the GCMs fail to reproduce the major decadal and multidecadal oscillations found in the global surface temperature record from 1850 to 2011. On the contrary, the proposed harmonic model (which herein uses cycles with 9.1, 10–10.5, 20–21, 60–62 year periods) is found to well reconstruct the observed climate oscillations from 1850 to 2011, and it is shown to be able to forecast the climate oscillations from 1950 to 2011 using the data covering the period 1850–1950, and vice versa.”
What does Scafetta conclude from this (emphasis added)?

We show that the IPCC GCM’s claim that all warming observed from 1970 to 2000 has been anthropogenically induced is erroneous because of the GCM failure in reconstructing the quasi 20-year and 60-year climatic cycles.”
In the conclusion of the paper, Scafetta also writes:

Consequently, the IPCC projections for the 21st century cannot be trusted.”

In light of this new information and all the new findings we’ve seen since 2007, the IPCC has no choice but to recognize and admit that their models are totally inadequate and in need of a complete overhaul.
Should the IPCC continue to ignore new findings and claim their models are accurate and correct (when they know they are not), then it will be de facto entering the territory of scientific fraud. The next assessment report, due in 2013 or 2014, must include the new scientific findings. Anything else would be willful fraud. That’s what it is when there’s intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual.
There’s no way the IPCC will be able stick to its current climate models in its next report without opening themselves up to lawsuits for scientific fraud. No more excuses.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper titled High-resolution sea surface reconstructions off Cape Hatteras over the last 10 ka appearing just recently in the AGU Paleoceanography Journal authored by Caroline Cléroux et al provides further, clear evidence of a major solar impact on climate during the Holocene. Hat/tip: http://kaltesonne.de/.
According to the paper’s abstract, the study presents high-resolution foraminiferal-based sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity and upper water column stratification reconstructions off Cape Hatteras, a region sensitive to atmospheric and thermohaline circulation changes associated with the Gulf Stream.
Now if I recall correctly, this was the region that Stefan Rahmstorf deemed not long ago as good enough to be used to represent sea level trend for the whole world.
The above authors focused on the last 10,000 years to study the surface hydrology changes under our current climate conditions and looked at centennial to millennial time scale variability. To do this, a seabed core was extracted off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina at a water depth of 620 m.
They observed opposite evolutions between the conditions off Cape Hatteras and those south of Iceland, known today for the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern. Around 8.3 ka and 5.2–3.5 ka, they reconstructed positive salinity anomalies off Cape Hatteras. For the 5.2–3.5 ka period they demonstrated that the salinity increase was caused by the cessation of the low salinity surface flow coming from the north.
What’s behind the anomalies? They found that variations were in sync with total solar irradiance. The abstract states (emphasis added):
Wavelet transform analysis revealed a 1000-year period pacing the d18O signal over the early Holocene. This 1000-year frequency band is significantly coherent with the 1000-year frequency band of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) between 9.5 ka and 7 ka and both signals are in phase over the rest of the studied period.”
The paper’s introduction has a few sentences that the IPCC really needs to take note of (emphasis added):

The last decade of paleoclimate research has shown that the Holocene is not the stable, climatic event-free period as previously thought: both external and internal (oceanic) forcings have caused major climatic changes. […] On a shorter time scale, observations over about the last 50 years show interannual and decadal climate change. These fluctuations probably persisted throughout the Holocene, together with centennial to millennial variability.”
Dr. Sebastian Lüning writes at the Die kalte Sonne site:
The new findings once again clearly underscore that the last several thousands of years are characterized by natural temperature cycles that are controlled by fluctuations in solar activity (see p. 68-75 in ‘Die kalte Sonne’). The logical continuation of these natural cycles through today shows that an important part of the warming of the last 150 years has to be attributed to the increase in solar activity. It is not a mere coincidence that the last decades have been the most solar active of the last 10,000 years.
The climate models used by the IPCC are not able to reproduce these millennial cycles because they assign only a very small climate impact to the sun. Also the recently introduced new climate model from the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg suffers from the same deficiency, and thus the results of that model are essentially unrealistic.”
In layman’s terms: crap in, crap out.
Once again yet another study that emphatically shows that climate changed in the recent past (while CO2 was stable), and that these changes were in sync with solar activity. We’ve said it a thousand times before, and we’ll probably have to say it another thousand times:
“It’s the sun, moron!”

Recently I happened to look through some scientific papers and articles on global warming and the various forcing factors that affect our climate.
One that caught my eye was a paper by N.A. Krivova and S.K. Solanki [2003] called: Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850.

http://www.solen.info/solar/cyclcomp.html, web page prepared by Jan Alvestad
In the conclusions of the paper they state:
We have shown that even in extreme cases that solar variability caused all the global climate change prior to 1970, it cannot have been responsible for more than 30% (50% for the intercalibration Willson, 1997) of the strong global temperature rise since 1970.”
WUWT also reported the authors saying (emphasis added):
However, it is also clear that since about 1980, while the total solar radiation, its ultraviolet component, and the cosmic ray intensity all exhibit the 11-year solar periodicity, there has otherwise been no significant increase in their values. In contrast, the Earth has warmed up considerably within this time period. This means that the Sun is not the cause of the present global warming.”
While I agree that the sun was most likely behind all the warming since 1850 and earlier, I cannot agree that the sun was not behind the warming since 1970. The link may not be immediate or short term but a lagged connection nevertheless. The average decadal sunspot number during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s were 84.2, 67.2 and 49.6 respectively. The average mean global temperature anomalies during the same decades (HADCRUT3GL) were +0.079°C, +0.235°C, and +0.411°C respectively.
I went back and crunched the numbers for UAH satellite global temperature data and got mean temperature anomalies of -0.135°C, -0.0295°C and 0.0178°C. So on a decadal basis the sun and the global temperatures seem not to be correlated when measured by satellite or ground stations during the last 3 decades. Was Solanki correct then after all?
No. And there may be a logical explanation. Let’s take a decade at a time. The two graphs at the end of this article illustrate the average decadal sunspot numbers and average global temperature anomalies (hadcrut3gl) for the period 1900- 2010. But first the last 3 decades:
2000-2009 average decadal sunspot number was 49.6, down from 67.2 the decade before.  The average decadal mean global temperature anomaly was 0.411°C up from 0.235°C the decade before.
* The actual solar activity was naturally down since solar Cycle No. 23 was declining to its minimum.

Bob Tisdale in his blog and his article called Can El NINO events explain all of the global warming since 1976 parts 1 and 2 explains how a series of El Niños events could account for the major changes in global temperatures since 1976 through certain key El Ninos . The more significant El Nino in effect were 1997/1998, 1991/1992 and 1994/1995 and 1987/1988. See the graph below from Bob’s blog.
From my own analysis, during positive or warm phase of PDO and AMO, there are significantly greater number (2.5 times) of strong El Ninos than strong LA Ninas and more El Nino months compared to La Nina months .There were less La Nina’s in total as well .
Strong ElNinos seem to follow about 9-11 years after the previous strong solar maximum. 2009/2010 El Nino followed about nine years after the solar maximum period (4 months) of Cycle No. 23. The El Nino of 1997/1998 followed the very active solar maximum period (5 months) of Cycle No. 22. The same happened with the biggest El Nino ever recorded in 1878 which followed the solar max of 1869-1872.
PDO index tracks a spatial pattern of SST anomalies that, when it is cold in the western and central part of the North Pacific and warm in the eastern part of the North Pacific, the index has positive values. A more positive PDO index is typically a result of both more positive and warmer SST anomalies in the NE Pacific in combination with more negative or cooler SST anomalies in the NW and Central Pacific.
The AMO has been basically warm or positive mode during the period 1995-2012. So we have both the PDO and AMO as positive correlating with more warmer water along the coast of North East Pacific ocean and the North Atlantic ocean.

Summary
There appears to have been a correlation between solar activity and global temperatures going back for thousands of years as given by many peer reviewed papers, some of which have been posted on this blog very recently. In my graphs, the correlation appears to be there for the decades 1900 to 1940′s as the decadal average sunspot number and
the decadal average mean global temperature anomalies seem to rise together. In the 1950′s  solar activity and global temperature anomalies went in opposite directions when we had major solar activity (91.7 average decadal solar sunspot number) but the decadal global temperature anomalies were flat or slightly down as the PDO was negative correlating with more  cooler water in Pacific North East than in the Northwest and Central  Pacific. Also global SST were cooler in the 1950s. Scientists have been looking at
various lag factors and other concepts to get a better handle on the sun/ocean/atmosphere link.
In my judgment the reason why sometime global temperatures and solar activity do not correlate is that the ocean cycles are out of sync with solar effects during certain decades. This was apparent during the cool period of 1950’s to 1970’s where colder ocean cycles in the Pacific and Atlantic as correlated by negative PDO and negative AMO reduced the “lagged” warming effect of some strong solar cycles especially the strong solar maximum around 1956 -1960. Ocean cycles seem to overide or nullify decadal solar effects in certain decades.
Yet during the period 1980-2010, the solar activity was slowly  declining but both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were both  positive correlating with a warm mode (AMO and PDO both positiv)], resulting in the global surface temperatures going up while the sunactivity was declining. It is no coincidence that during this last decade when the lagged
effects of the decline of last solar cycle# 23 and the decline of the ocean cycles as reflected by AMO and PDO indices, both of which are now in sync, that global temperatures should  also  decline. This makes sense to me and it disproves claims that solar effects were not responsible for the 1980 to 2010 global warming.

What follows is the mean global temperature anomaly for each decade. Note overall it correlates with sunpsot activity:

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman public radio Deutsche Welle has a recent online report about climate skepticism here titled: Scientists Request Honest Dialogue, which quotes two experts from the fields of climate and meteorology: Professor Hans von Storch and Sven Plöger. This post here focuses on the views of Professor Hans von Storch.
Exaggeration damages credibility
The Deutsche Welle writes about the growing loss of credibility in climate science and quotes: Professor Hans von Storch, Director of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht and the Climate Campus of the University. Deutsche Welle writes:
On the loss of credibility, climate science itself is to blame. The science has stirred up scientifically unfounded expectations, says von Storch. The demand that the public has to rapidly accept instructions on how to act in order to save the planet has blurred the boundaries between policy and science. As a result, science has not become something that has to do with “curiosity”, but rather gives the impression that it’s all about pushing a pre-conceived value-based agenda: “As scientists we have become political tools who are to deliver sought arguments to get citizens to do the right thing.”
If anything confirms this claim, it is the WBGU’s master plan unveiled by PIK Director Hans Schellnhuber to radically transform society in what he calls “The Great Transformation”. Indeed von Storch is right. Some elitist scientists are all about changing the current socio-political system, and so distort science in order to get the needed arguments.
Skeptics not taken seriously enough

What does von Storch think about the attitude of his colleagues with regards to skepticism? Here, von Storch, who is a warmist, expresses dissatisfaction with his climate colleagues and expresses his displeasure that they do not take the questions and arguments from skeptics seriously (emphasis added):
The problem is not ‘that the public is is too stupid, or uneducated’, but that science has failed to deliver answers to legitimate public questions. Instead they have said, “believe us – we are scientists’. There are many questions among individuals and they have only gotten a ‘stroppy reply,’ Storch finds.”
One example is a recent presentation round between bitter adversaries: skeptic scientists at the European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) vs warmist scientists of the alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), and the Max Planck Institute on April 20, 2011. The presentation was organised tooth-and-nail. According to the German online Bild der Wissenschaft here, the warmists made a presentation with EIKE scientists in attendance, who in turn challenged many of the warmist assertions. Bild Der Wissenschaft writes:
Both presenting scientists quickly left after the presentation. Obviously they had little interest to go beyond there presentation obligations and to speak with the climate skeptics.”
Unfortunately, Bild der Wissenschaft did not give the names of the two warmist scientists in the article it posted. I imagine EIKE will post something about it at their website in the near future. One has to say that the act of fleeing from tough skeptic questions does give the impression of warmist cowardice and insecurity. And no publicity had been made by the PIK  (where the presentation took place) to promote that particular event beforehand.

We recall the climate discussion that had been planned to take place at the European Society of Engineers and Industrialists (SEII) in Brussels on September 1-2, 2011, and how IPCC vice president Jean-Pascal van Ypersele attempted to suppress it. Eventually it was relocated and took place somewhere else not far away.
The following is an uneditted raw clip of the discussion (sorry, not a professionally made film). It features distinguished scientists S. Fred Singer and Claes Johnson (see outline below in case you wish to skip to other parts).

Fred Singer: “IPCC is finished!”
What follows is a general outline of the clip of the presentations/discussion. Unfortunately I still have not had the time to view all of it. I especially recommend the segment of 31 min to 69 min. Here Singer considers the temperature data of the last several decades to be statistically selective.
0.00 – 10.00:
Introduction (you can skip this)
10.00 – 31.00: 
Tropospheric hot spot, models vs. observations.
31.10 – 48.30:
Hockeystick, Climategate, 20th century temperature, “1976 – 2000 warming is fake”
48.30 – 61.00:
Ocean temperature measurement
61.00 – 69.00 
Michael Mann, the Hockey Stick, proxies:
Singer’s 3 Conclusions (69.00 min.):
No. 1: IPCC data and models contradict each other.
No. 2: IPCC models cannot be validated, too few runs
No. 3: No evidence of recent warming. “The IPCC is finished”
69.00 – 93.00 min

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming movement is all about energy starvation – with the aim of denying humanity access to the cheapest and most readily available forms of energy.The restriction of energy eventually makes whatever energy that is left on the market so expensive that it risks becoming unaffordable to the large majority of the world’s poor people. The result: Many of the poor will simply die because of the consequences of energy deprivation.
After all, it was Hans Schellnhuber who called determining that the “carrying capacity of the planet to be less than a billion people” one of the triumphs of science, read here.
One way to help deny energy to humanity is to deny populations the use of the huge reserves of the now easily extractable tar sands in Canada. Activists are now gearing up to pressure Obama stop this supply of fuel.
This is what German alarmist site klimaretter.de (which means “climate saviour.de” in German) here encourages, namely blocking the Keystone XL continental pipeline extension that is in the works to transport the valuable tar sand petroleum product from Canada to US markets. Klimaretter labels the pipeline: “Pipeline for climate killer oil”.
Solid bitumen in the sands
Tar sands are heavy bitumen found in the soils of northern Canada. Anywhere else, bitumen oozing openly in the environment would be considered an environmental hazard and any efforts to clean it up would be welcome. But not if the clean-up means supplying the USA with cheap and reliable energy. Klimaretter claims tar sand “is considered extremely environmentally and climate-damaging” and that “studies presume that its oil causes 5 times more greenhouse gases than conventional oil”.

Activists demand that it all be stopped. One way to stop, at least hinder, tar sand extraction would be to shut down the planned pipeline extension from Canada to Texas. Klimaretter says that the USA is greedily wringing its hands as it eyes these riches, claiming that the “fatal impacts on climate change are being gladly ignored”.
James Hansen, says klimaretter, warns of these “fatal” consequences. Klimaretter quotes the eccentric NASA scientist:
The known climate scientist James Hansen emphasizes that the extraction of tar sands would increase the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by 50%. ‘When the development of the tar sands continues, then it means “game over for the climate,’ says Hansen.”
Bill McKibben chimes in saying that Obama could stop the pipeline expansion. Klimaretter quotes:
‘In this matter the President has full control in that he can issue permission or refuse it,’ says Bill McKibben, founder of  350.org.”
With the US economy still in shambles and Obama looking out for the poor folks, it’ll be interesting to see what Obama decides. Poor people desperately need cheap and reliable energy –  so does prosperity. And looking at the climate, the scientific data clearly shows that CO2 has only a minor impact, if any, on the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI know some Danes are not going to like my tone here, but too bad. Why is it the government needs to tell you how to eat?Have you never learned?
As long as you full grown Danes are unable to feed yourselves, then you deserve all the ridicule the rest of the world can muster. How much more possibly incompetent can one get? This story is from T-Online. Hat-tip DirkH.
Denmark has become the first country in the world to tax fat in foods. According to the law, a fat tax of €2.15 per kilogram is now being levied.  The tax is designed to keep the people from eating too much unhealthy food (and to put more money into government coffers).
I ask myself just how incompetent and stupid must the Danes be to not know how to eat. Do they they really need the government to spoon-feed them? Have they been potty-trained yet? I wonder.
It’s coming to your country soon
We may joke about this, but it surely is coming to your country too. Note how the tax is all for our own protection. The Danes ought to throw this law back up.
According to reports, Danes are now rushing to the food markets and buying up fatty foods in bulk. T-Online quotes Sören Jörgensen:
‘We have to fill our stores with tons of butter and margerine in order to be able to serve our customers,’ said Sören Jörgensen Konzern Arla creamery.  Christian Jensen, manager of a supermarket in Copenhagen, spoke of a chaotic week: ‘There were many empty shelves. People have filled up their freezers.'”
Many don’t believe this will change eating habits. People will buy what they want to eat no matter the price. But it sure will transfer lots of money from the citizens to government coffers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve noticed that German skeptic sites who were vigorously publicizing the rap video (here with English lyrics) yesterday (like Achse des Gutens) have abandoned ship today, and removed the story. I’m told that Kilez More is indeed very controversial, and is into all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories, and thus ought to be avoided. Tell me which artist isn’t!

Kilez More is a very young man who is obviously going through a growing-up stage – one that many people go through at one time or another in their lives, especially in their late teens and early 20s. It’s a stage of rebellion and questioning. That’s what most young people do.

He also has the talent of rap, and so is using it to express his doubts and to question society – just as many artists do. He provokes. Oh the crime of being young! What the warmists are trying to do is to suppress his questioning – asserting authority and insisting the discussion is over. It’s a shame even the skeptics have turned their backs on him. It’s a tune by a rapper, and nothing more.
Of course I probably don’t agree with most of More’s ideas (haven’t looked into them) but I do agree that he has the right to pose questions, especially about climate science, and that his encouraging young people to ask questions is correct. He makes climate assertions. Let his viewers hear them, and let them make up their own minds. Maybe he is wrong on every other subject. So what!
The only wrong questions are the ones that never get asked.
His Climate Swindle video is only telling young people to be careful, and to look deeper into the issues before accepting them at face value. Claims to authority aren’t good enough. That’s important. Young people eventually will do their own research and decide for themselves what the truth is. I haven’t looked at the content of his other music videos – no doubt some may be very controversial – but that’s another discussion.
Questioning authority cannot and must not be criminalized, and must not be a right that is exclusively reserved for a few. 
I get the feeling he is increasingly being viewed as a dangerous man for doing just that. The attempt to shut him up will backfire. Keep rapping, Kilez – they’re scared.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming movement really started up in the late 80s. Even back then blowhard scientists were telling us that the science was settled. And because the science was in fact not really settled and poorly understood, many fell into the trap of making downright stupid predictions.Today, 20 to 25 years later, it is good time to go back and look at how all these “settled” predictions are turning out. Most, we will find, were the sort of thing one typically hears from fortune-tellers.
One example is Hartmut Grassl, who was director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg until 2005, and a harsh critic of Die kalte Sonne book. Hat tip: Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s excellent “Die kalte Sonne” debunking site.
As we will see, instead of bringing prestige to the once renown institutes, many blowhard, the-science-is-settled fortune tellers will wind up being dark, embarrassing chapters that these once prestigious institutes will certainly be ashamed of in the future.
Maybe I’m being a bit too hard saying this. But scientists who succumb to dogma, politics, or just pure money, deserve no less. With each passing day they are beginning to appear more and more like arrogant, inflated ego scientists who thought they could win the day by claiming an authority that had obviously been misbestowed.
Working for insurer that rewards top performers with sex orgies
Today Hartmut Grassl, who was once director of the UN World Climate Program in Geneva from 1994 to 1999, is also a foundation board member of reinsurer Munich Re – a major beneficiary of the climate catastrophe scare (and promoter of sex orgies for top performers). Although Grassl’s fortune telling and predictions of doom are paying huge dividends for the insurance industry, they are turning out to be completely wrong.
Grassl predicted temperature would increase up to 2°C in 30 years.
Grassl made a stunning prediction back in 1990, Die kalte Sonne website writes here:
In 1990 Hartmut Graßl sounded the alarms with his book “Wir Klimamacher” (Us climate makers) predicting a terrible climate catastrophe. On page 61 he wrote with co-author Reiner Klingholz: ‘Already in the next 30 years the temperature of the Earth will increase, with a high probability, by one or two degrees Celsius.’
Today, 22 years later, we can check how well this prediction is doing so far. The result ought to be sobering for anyone concerned about a warming catastrophe. Well, they can all breathe a sigh a relief. Here’s what actually happened since 1990:
Temperature increase since 1990: 0.25°C.
Temperature increase over the last 10 years: ZERO!
And for Grassl’s crystal ball fortune to be correct, with eight years left to go, the global temperature would have to increase 0.75°C just to reach the lower limit of his prediction, and a whopping 1.75°C for his most pessimistic vision to come true. The chances of that happening, given the current phases of the the sun and oceans, are next to nothing. Good luck finding a climate scientist willing to bet Grassl will be right.
The question to Grassl is: What happened? Please explain it to us. Settled science you said?

To keep things in perspective, the entire climate discussion today is the nitpicking over a 0.8°C temperature rise  – over the last 160 years!
“The debate is over,” Grassl said in 1994
In 1994 Grassl was so convinced of his predictions that he declared the climate debate to be over. According to Die kalte Sonne site, Grassl wrote:
From the scientific side of it, the indication process concerning the topic of the greenhouse effect is over and the guilty verdict is in. It’s no longer about gathering more evidence, but solely about alleviating the punishment. The global mean temperature will increase over the next decades by one to two degrees Celsius. Each global change in climate magnitude, also including the mean temperature, forces new weather extremes at almost every location. We will see floods here, droughts there and storms at other places like we have never seen before.“
Reference for that quote: Graßl, H.: Technik München, Mitt.-Bl. Techn.-Wiss. Vereine München, 1994; 3,4. quoted e.g. in: Heinrich Röck Klima und Politik“ 2001.
Obviously today we see that much of what Grassl was saying was pure baloney. The temperature increased only a small fraction of what he predicted, thus indicating that CO2’s predicted effect had been completely over-estimated. Moreover, weather extremes have not increased at all. Today’s weather events are well within the boundaries of natural variability, see here and here, as well as page 202-208 in Die kalte Sonne. What has radically changed is our ability to record weather events. We have satellites, radars, computers, and almost everyone today walks around with a mobile phone that can make good video clips for the evening news.
This means that Grassl in his climate equation had foolishly neglected the other fundamental climate factors, namely the sun and oceans. An astonishing accomplishment for a scientist of his rumoured caliber. If a college professor were to grade Grassl’s work behind his prediction, he would certainly have to give him an “F”.
Die kalte Sonne website writes:
It is high time to admit to these errors and to make fundamental corrections to the climatic world view. Instead Grassl shifts into obstinate mode and refuses to depart at all from his now obsolete views.”
In his book Klimawandel – Was stimmt? Die wichtigsten Antworten“  (Climate Change – What’s Correct? The Important Answers) of 2007, Grassl simply avoids using terms like the Roman Warm Period, Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age when discussing the climate of the last 10,000 years. He believes in the bogus hockey stick.
On page 15 Grassl describes the good correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 750,000 years, and from this he postulates, like Al Gore did in in movie, that CO 2 was the driving climate force.
Let history judge Grassl as a scientist on that alone.
Other scientists who made dumb predictions, behaved arrogantly, and today refuse to admit their gross errors have to expect the same scrutiny and treatment. Be warned that history will not look upon you positively.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJeez…can’t these guys make up their minds!
Here’s Der Spiegel writing about global warming in 1948, just 26 years before it warned the planet was cooling (1974), read that here, which was only 12 years before they again warned of warming (1986), read it here!
The 1948 piece is titled: It’s getting warmer on the planet. Below are a few of the excerpts. See if it all sounds familiar to you.
First Der Spiegel starts by telling us that “the Governor of California has declared an emergency in 28 counties of his state” and that the current drought there is “likely the most extreme in the last 500 years.”
Weather extremes, and Spitzbergen 7°C above normal
Back in 1948 Spiegel authors wrote of “unusual weather over the past year in Central Europe” and fears that “the climate of the old continent will not remain the same.”
And what would climate predictions be without a consensus of scientists? Der Spiegel wrote:
The scientists say: What is certain is that we now find ourselves in the middle of a large climate change. And it is the biggest in many parts of the world. Not only an increase in air temperatures, but also an increase in water surface temperatures in the oceans.
The most plain to see is the warming in the northern polar regions. Winter temperatures at Spitzbergen during the 1930/39 decade were 7°C over the 1926 measured mean.”
I don’t have my PDO and AMO chart here at my fingertips, but weren’t they at about their positive peaks back then?

Melting Arctic
There was also plenty of Arctic melting going on back then too, just like today! Der Spiegel wrote:
The “Northeast Passage” (the seaway north of Siberia) is like the “Northwest Passage” around Canada, which were earlier virtually impassible, have since become much easier. Amundsen needed 3 years to get through the Northwest passage at the start of this century. In autumn of last year, Canadian Larsen needed less than three months to overcome it. And Larsen had none of the impassable ice that Amundsen had to deal with.
“Catastrophic consequences” wrote Der Spiegel:
The polar climate improvement and the appearance of warmer waters in the northern seas are causing profound changes in plant and animal life.
The glaciers in Greenland, Spitzbergen and Nowaja Semlja, as well as the ones in the European mountains, have been retreating considerably for quite some time now. The complete melting of all glaciers would have catastrophic consequences: sea levels would rise about 55 meters.”
Warming causes both mild and cold winters, just like today! Der Spiegel wrote in 1948:
Warming has led to increased meteorological unrest. That means a tendency for more extreme climate, e.g. very mild and very harsh winters. In Frankfurt December 1934, January 1921 and February 1926 were the three mildest, and January 1940 and February 1929 were both the coldest winter months in over 100 years.”
Now get a load of their hypothesis for the cause!
Also cosmic causes, which are still mysterious to science, could be at play – changes in solar radiation and its composition. It appears to be much more than just a coincidence that the extreme weather year of 1947 just happened to be the biggest sunspot year in over 200 years. Periods of 80 and 110 year respectively have been detected.”
Message to scientists today: It’s the sun, stupid!

This brings up our Climate Bet here with warmist Rob Honeycutt, who boldly bet $5000 that the 2011-2020 decade will be even warmer than the previous 2001-2010 decade. So far the first three months of the new decade are slam dunks for the COOLIST column, and have opened up an early lead 3 – o.

2011 03 -0.099 -0.073 -0.126 -0.345
The status of the bet has not changed since the last update here.
Sure there are still another 117 months to go before the bet is concluded, but I’m not in hurry for these months to pass by. So far ocean cycles are showing that they run the place, and not a trace gas. As the negative PDO takes hold and AMO heads south, more cooling is in the pipeline. The weak solar cycle also bodes ill for the warmists.
That cracking noise you hear is not the spring ice beaking up – it’s the sound of AGW science breaking apart.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLots of lip service, but governments worldwide are getting cold feet about really reducing CO2 emissions. Commitment is clearly fading.German news magazine Stern has a short interview here with climatologist Mojib Latif, who provides us with a very encouraging confession with respect to the climate science swindle, i.e. it has reached “an absolute low point”!
Latif claims to be a warmist and insists that man is able to regulate the global climate simply by regulating the amount of greenhouse gases that gets emitted into the complex, extraterrestially-driven climate system.
Latif first tells Stern that Germany’s accelerated phase-out of nuclear power will mean more CO2 emissions because of more power generation from fossil fuel plants, e.g. read here, 2 German coal power plants approved.
This of course all undermines the idea of getting the planet to reduce its CO2 emissions, for which countries and global organisations earlier concocted and attempted to implement emissions trading schemes. Latif here is not convinced by these efforts, and comments:
So far it all has been quite a toothless tiger. If it were today what it had been originally designed to do, then it would be a very different story. But there have been exceptions after exceptions, especially in Germany with the energy-intensive industries. That’s not how it’s supposed to work.”
Of course governments have given industries so many exceptions because the perceived problem is not really serious enough to be taken seriously. And no country is actually going to commit suicide for the sake of solving a phony problem (except maybe Germany, which has moved onto the ledge and is now threatening to actually jump).
Stern then asks the question on every body’s mind:

Just how intensely is the community of countries fighting climate change?”
In other words: Just how committed are they? Latif answers (emphasis added):
We’ve reached an absolute low point. Actually at the UN-level we were further Along in the early 1990s. Today we see only word acrobatics. Heiligendamm, Copenhagen or Cancun all have not brought us further.”
Commitment has cooled to the lowest point in 20 years, i.e. since it got started. On CO2 trends, Latif warns:
The trend is alarming: Since 1990 CO2 emissions worldwide have risen 40 percent.”
40%? That corresponds roughly to the rise in the level of worldwide democracy.
Mojib Latif is a Professor at the former Institute for Ocean Sciences and the now Leibniz Institute for Ocean Sciences at the Christian Albrechts University in Kiel.
In 2009 he was awarded the Deutsche Bank-IFM-GEOMAR Ocean Research Prize.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline FOCUS magazine interviewed German historian Wolfgang Wippermann on the subject of the WBGU and Hans Schellnhuber’s “master plan” for transforming global society: World in Transition – A Social Contract for Sustainability.The WBGU acts as Angela Merkel’s science advisory board (believe it, or not). Schellnhuber, its director, is also director of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).
The Wippermann interview is the latest in a series of intense criticisms by German mainstream media aimed at the worrisome anti-democratic and authoritarian views expressed by factions of the German scientific community such as the PIK, WBGU and the German government lately, see here, here and here.
Wippermann, who is an expert on authoritarianism, fires extremely harsh words at the WBGU and its seemingly out-of-control Professor Schellnhuber, calling the authors of the WBGU social contract “fanatics” and the language “worrisome”.
What follows are summarized excerpts of the FOCUS interview.
=========================================
FOCUS: What does the language in the paper remind you of?
Wippermann: The language is scary and it makes me afraid. Those who speak like that behave the same way. It is a negative Utopia, a dystopia. When Utopian minds are at work, it is always dangerous.
FOCUS: What world view do you see in the text?
Wippermann: Here we are dealing with scientific fanatics who want to assert their ideas. It makes me wonder that we are discussing this for the first time, and how little it has been discussed in the public up to now.

FOCUS: What about the role of science in politics?
Wippermann: First off: the German government should have distanced itself from the WBGU long ago. It just cannot be. In short, you just cannot say that you demand some other democracy, a different state and a different world order. It is unacceptable.
FOCUS: How could scientists write such a paper?
Wippermann: I’m afraid this is not just thoughtlessness. It goes a lot further than how to make the world a better place. The authors are suggesting a climate dictatorship, the Climate State – and one that is truly extensive and far-reaching. For example, they want to abolish national states.
FOCUS: But this paper was written by leading scientists.
Wippermann: Also a science can become a religion. When they demand a transnational democracy – whatever that may be – it’ll be a dictatorship.
FOCUS: But they claim it’s for democracy
Wippermann: From history we know of enough people who wanted to make the world a better place after having prophesized the end of the world and bringing an undemocratic system that forces others to accept their views. And why is it that the Germans again have to save the planet, and not only prophesize its downfall? Does the world always have to be measured using a German yardstick? Who do the authors think they are? Such arrogance.
FOCUS: What spirit does the call to action radiate?
Wippermann: The paper disastrously follows the tradition of “Revolutionary Messianism“, which was analyzed by Norman Cohn. There’s a line of “Revolutionary Messianism“ from the Medieval Times to modern totalitarian movements.
FOCUS: Aren’t humanists more prone to all this than natural scientists?
Wippermann: Natural scientists deal directly with people. Think for a minute what emerged from “eugenics”. These scientists here can actually do politics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wrote about this not long ago here, on why the conservatives in Germany, under Merkel’s leadership, have been getting clobbered in the polls. In a nutshell:
It’s your constant endorsement of the opposition Greens, stupid!”
You don’t get more votes by endorsing the silly green positions of your opponents – you get votes by attacking and exposing them.
Yesterday the online Die Welt reported here (FRONT PAGE!) that the youth of the once-conservative CDU party is taking a second look at the greenshirt movement and Angela Merkel’s weird direction. Finally they are showing signs of having had it with all the green crap pasted on the party platform.
For example the leader of Germany’s Young Consevatives Philipp Mißfelderis speaking up and taking Merkel to task. Die Welt titles the story:
Mißfelder Aims Massive Criticism at CDU Leadership”

High time. Everyone should now be standing up and hollering at the top of our lungs in support. Foremost he calls the orientation with the Greens as a mistake and adds:
A CDU ‘that orients itself with the Greens’ underestimates the people’s fundamental will for liberty, says Mißfelder. Also in the big cities the CDU ought not to fix iteself on issues like climate change and integration, like the party leadership thinksn: safety, order and cleanliness are also issues that mobilize voters more than we sometimes think.“
Of course, Mißfelder has a long way to go before he can expect to capitalize politically. If he really wants to score points, then he’ll just come out and call climate science and policy what it is: just a huge scam that is defrauding the public and taxpayers of their money and liberty.
The tough comments from Mißfelder come at the heels of CDU faction chief in the state parliament of Hesse, Christean Wagner, read here, also launched a screed against Angela Merkel and the party’s overall direction, which he dubbed as being void of any profile. “The blame rests on Merkel – she has watered down the party”.
Wagner added:
She has to delineate more clearly from the Socialists, Greens, and Communist parties for self-responsibility and work for the majority of the people – for freedom and social market economy, for Christian values and the nation, for domestic and foreign security, for the homeland, family and tradition.”
Focusing on these things sure would be nice – instead of wasting money and resources on the fantasy of rescuing the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language online The Local, here, brings us an example of how overzealous and authoritarian greens masquerading as concerned environmentalists can be. Hat-tip DirkH.
Winfried Kretschmann, the newly elected green governor of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, has not only announced that he will decide the course of the southern German state, but also the course of the two luxury car makers Mercedes Benz and Porsche headquartered there.
Just forget the top managers at the world’s leading luxury car makers, whose expertise and managerial skill have made Mercedes and Porsche gold plated brand names over the last decades. Forget companies writing their own mission statements and producing their own visions for the future. And forget companies navigating through the uncertainties of the future and drawing up middle-term and long-term business plans. All this now has been taken over by the supremacist Greens, at least in Baden-Württemberg.
No longer will Porsche and Mercedes engineer and manufacture the world’s top luxury automobiles and sports cars on their own terms, but rather they will have to content themselves with ignoring the wishes of their markets and shift to building cars that suit the expectations of a few green masterminds. Kretschmann says:
I expect that premium producers create energy and resource-efficient product lines. That could be a little more expensive, as most of those who buy limousines can take it. Above all, Daimler and Porsche should see themselves as mobility companies in five years’ time – and no longer just as car factories.”
You got that? Your cars aren’t expensive enough. Personally, I drive a modest Mercedes C-Class, and if Mercedes bends to the will of these enviro-Stalinists, then it will definitely be the very last one I buy. I have no interest in buying a car from a company that hands the management reins over to a bunch of arrogant dogmatist zealots. The Local writes:
‘Petrol-greedy luxury limousines are not the future,’ he said. ‘We should no longer only export cars, but also a new idea of what a chic car is in the future. I believe that the companies think this way too’.”
Getting people off the streets and autobahns
The target of all this is to restrict people’s mobility. According to The Local, this green Burgermeister-Meisterburger has also announced an array of decrees, much to the delight of his green, spear-carrying, attack-hungry warriors. The Local writes:
The incoming Green-led state government of Baden-Württemberg has unveiled plans to introduce a speed limit on the autobahns and replace vehicle tax with road tolls. It also wants to build wind farms in the region.”

The Local adds:
The road tax should apply to all roads, he said, and should be, ‘as individualised as possible, thus related to time, place, length of road use and type of car.’ This should reduce traffic in total, he said.”
This is shorthand for: “We’re going to put the screws to poorer people and those living out in the countryside (in nature), and make mobility affordable only for the well-heeled.
Industrialising the Black Forest with windmills

The windfarms he mentions above of course will be built inland, and not offsore in the North or Baltic seas where the wind blows enough for them to reach just over 20% of their rated capacity. Inland, however, they’ll have to be content with reaching just over 15% of their rated capacity. This means they will have to put up about 7 times more wind generators to deliver 100% capacity – that is when the wind blows hard enough. And when the wind doesn’t blow, then it doesn’t matter how many you install – you’ll be forced to import nuclear power, from across the border, from France.
Where exactly will the windparks go? The Local writes:
‘Wind farms would also form a part of the state’s future,’ said Kretschmann. ‘There will be completely new windparks – large, modern facilities – above all in the Mittelgebirge, on the Schwäbisch Alb and in the Black Forest,’ he said.”
Citizens in these areas, organise, and fight this onslaught on your landscape and heritage. These pseudo-greens are going to industrialise your landscape with ugly moving white giants. They did it in my hometown in Vermont, and the beauty there is now gone. Like in Vermont, big, profiteering industrial bastards are behind it all, and they will profit handsomely from it. It has nothing to do with environmentalism.
What does Dear Leader Kretschmann say about windmills polluting the landscape?
‘A change of the industrial society changes the landscape; that is the price that we have to pay for progress. One cannot discard nuclear power, damn coal-generated electricity, want to maintain living standards and at the same time demand that the landscape should not change.’
Interesting times are ahead.
All of it, we will recall, is based on the loony proposition, floated by charlatan scientists, that man controls the climate. Germany pursues yet again another version of the 1000-year empire. Time to present this guy with a cuckoo-clock – because cuckoo is where he’s headed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEver wonder how climate change in the past could ever have been posible without CO2 changes? Some people, like Prof. Michael E. Mann, think it wasn’t possible and that climate was always steady back then.Mann even fabricated a hockey stick chart to precisely show that – until 1850 that is. Then man got smart, industrialized, and everything went to hell.
Well, there’s yet another temperature reconstruction out there showing once again Michael Mann was wrong, and that the climate often went to hell in the past too.
The latest proxy reconstruction comes from a German peat bog and goes back 2000 years. And in case you haven’t guessed it by now, temperatures were all over the place. So much so, that the researchers themselves even express they can’t believe their own results.
A new paper by Moschen et al appearing ain the journal Climate of the Past presents a high resolution reconstruction of local growing season temperature (GST) anomalies at Dürres Maar, Germany over the last two thousand years.
In 2007, a 5.5 m long core was recovered from the centre of Dürres Maar peat bog in the mountainous West Eifel Volcanic Field in southwestern Germany.
According to the paper’s abstract (emphasis added):
The temperature reconstruction is based on the Sphagnum δ13Ccellulose /temperature dependency observed in calibration studies. Reconstructed GST anomalies show considerable centennial and decadal scale variability. A cold and presumably also wet phase with below-average temperature is reconstructed between the 4th and 7th century AD which is in accordance with the so called European Migration Period marking the transition from the Late Roman Period to the Early Middle Ages. At High Medieval Times above-average temperatures are obvious followed by a temperature decrease.
I got a copy of the paper from a source, who wrote: “The ex-hockey team will hate it”.  The paper’s Figure 6 tells quite the story. Indeed there was a lot of climate change in the past when CO2 was more or less stagnant. Look at the huge variations 1000 years ago! Obviously natural factors truly do exist. The Medieval Warm Period is shown again to be just as warm, if not warmer than today.
As reader DirkH points out in a comment, even the researchers have great difficulty coming to terms with their own results.

Face it, they’ve been spoiled over the decades by cushy, protected conditions and have grown arrogant – so much so that they feel it is their duty to politically upbring viewers. Call it unfair and unbalanced television in almost every respect.
It was just the other day that I happened to watch the evening news on ARD the first time in about 3 years. And I decided it will probably be another 3 years before I watch it again. I haven’t seen the lovely Mariette Slomka on ZDF in over 5 years. I just can’t take these people anymore.
So with the haughty, orthodox-green public networks profusely bleeding red, the private ones like RTL are left to plunder the spoils of the ratings war. Unless you live in Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela, privately run and financed TV is the trend.
How bad is it for ARD and ZDF? According to Stern:
Even more dismal are the numbers for the segment of 14 to 49-year olds: Here ARD and ZDF rank only in 5th and 6th behind RTL, ProSieben, Sat.1 and Vox. Should this trend continue, public television will stop playing any role in the future.”

Why the fall? Like anything that gets royally subsidized up the wazoo, it’s just a matter of time before the organization gets old, crusty, and uncreative. Like a fat cat on a cold rainy day, the management settles comfortably down onto its warm cushion for a long peaceful slumber. While the rest of the free market innovates and creates, the public networks eventually wake up and wonder what happened.
So, what will the public networks do now that they are forced to face the horrors of the free market? The first solution of course will be to first deny reality, and to make demands for more money in the form of higher mandatory, much-hated GEZ fees that citizens are all forced to cough up. “We just need a little more money to improve the quality,” they’ll insist.
Their hemorrhaging is both wonderful and bad. Bad because we’ll likely have to pay higher fees.
And they’ll probably start a massive media campaign to remind public how great they are, and that viewers really ought to come back. For example, this is already happening on NDR public radio.
What are the chances of a private network like Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News getting a foothold in Germany? Are you crazy! Oh horrors! A Fox News Deutschland would be 10 times worse than any Fukushima. The last thing the old media guard is interested in is “fair and balanced”, let alone an alley cat like Fox News.
Readers, how is public TV faring in your country?

Share this...FacebookTwitterPrivate meteorologist Dr. Carsten Brandt of donnerwetter.de here predicts a hot and dry barbecue summer for Central Europe.
Donnerwetter.de's summer forecast looks great for barbeques.
Graphic from: www.donnerwetter.de news, click here
But don’t worry, his forecast does not come from the Met Office, and so there is a good chance it’ll be more or less right. Indeed many of Brandt’s seasonal forecasts have been spot on – on par with Joe Bastardi’s track record. For example back in October, 2010, he predicted a cold winter – and it happened. In February, 2011, donnerwetter.de announced a nice and warm spring dominated by high pressure systems  – and that happened too.
Donnerwetter.de predicts the warm and dry conditions will persist through July with a probability of 80%. According to donnerwetter.de, this is all due to a pattern of stubborn high pressure systems taking hold over Germany over the last months, writing:
For about one year now we have been observing a change in patterns in the atmosphere over Europe. Normally the weather over Germany is characterised by powerful low pressure systems which bring lots of rain and temperature fluctuations with them. The high pressure systems are hanging out more and more often over the Mediterranean or over Eastern Europe. Over the last months there have been extremely many high pressure systems settling over Germany and Central Europe.”
Though Germans may enjoy the beautiful weather in the weeks ahead, the low amounts of precipitation are going to wreak havoc on agriculture and pose serious threats of forest fires.
What is behind the spell of dry, warm and sunny weather?
Brandt doesn’t say. From donnerwetter.de, we don’t get the “it’s yet another sign of climate change” crap that we often hear from the AGW hucksters. We can be thankful for that.

But do expect the climate alarmism hatchery that is the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK) to chime in soon, claiming that a new model had predicted it all along. Producing an after-the-fact model is the tactic they used to explain the past cold winter. So expect crap from them in the weeks ahead.
Is low solar cycle activity inducing a cooling trend?
Since solar activity has wound down over the last years, there really does seem to be some new patterns forming. Is it just a coincidence? Maybe it’s a harbinger for a climate change that most of us have not been expecting – cooling. The PDO has also gone negative and the AMO is headed in that direction. Sounds to me like cooling increasingly can’t be ruled out. Let’s watch how long the La Nina conditions persist.
Accuweather, without Joe Bastardi, botched its Europe spring forecast
Interestingly, Accuweather’s spring forecast for Germany/Central Europe, made on March 18, looks like a real Met Office act, i.e. COMPLETELY  WRONG! In March Accuweather predicted:
U.K., Ireland and Germany to be Stormy, Unsettled
The overall position of the jet stream with a ridge over Spain and North Africa this spring should tend to steer storm systems into the U.K., Ireland and Germany.”
Actually, pretty much just the opposite has and is occurring. Makes you wonder if they’ll be begging Joe Bastardi to come back. According to the latest World Meteorological Organisation report:
The United Kingdom had extremely dry conditions in March and April especially in its southeastern parts and experienced its driest March since 1953. The other parts of western and central Europe all had a dry February, March and April. 2011 was up to now one of the driest 10 years in nearly whole Switzerland since 1864.”

It’s enough to make any normal person sick. These Greenpeace fanatics are losing it.
We saw it with the TAZ in their recent headline “Skeptics are like viruses“.
Now Greenpeace has declared war  on Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning. Why? Because they chose to exercise their democratic right to free speech and to do what good science involves: practice a little scrutiny, and to get a dialog going – a dialogue that activists have been trying to shut down for years.
But for Greenpeace, no one has any business questioning global warming science or delivering good news like: the climate catastrophe is not coming. Greenpeace insists that a catastrophe is coming, and it intends to make sure no one threatens that prospect. They misrepresent any data that shows to the contrary. Greenpeace thinks everyone needs to remain in fear, if not of climate change, then of Greenpeace itself. No one must begin to doubt.
Greenpeace latest, highly emotional report released today is titled:
Fritz Vahrenholt: Der eiskalte Leugner
Fritz Vahrenholt: The Ice Cold Denier
In it Greenpeace claims that all the science in “Die kalte Sonne” is already debunked, cites their friend and ally Gavin Schmidt, and then tells everyone that the science is settled and that we should just believe them. Then GP portrays Vahrenholt as some kind of callous carbon monster who doesn’t care about people. Near the end GP writes:
As already today millions of people are dying or losing their homes because of increasing weather extremes, his cancellation of the ‘climate catastrophe’ comes across as being spiteful to humans.”
Ice cold denier? Millions dying? Welcome to the tolerant green Germany.

Solar Activity Shows Precipitation In Maine Over the Last 7000 Years
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Geoscientist Jonathan Nichols and Yongsong Huang of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, published just days ago  a new study in Geophysical Research Letters, which shows an impressive synchronocity between the development of precipitation and solar activity for the investigated area. The study is based on a 5-meter long sediment core extracted from a peat bog just off the coast of Maine. The layers of the core cover the climate history going back 6800 years. Nichols and Huang reconstructed the precipitation development in the region by using biomarkers and hydrogen isotopes, and then documented pronounced fluctuations where periods of drought alternated with wet periods. Moreover the two scientists discovered that the development of moisture was in sync with solar activity. Wet periods occurred during weak phases of solar activity. Especially the 210-year Suess/de Vries cycle could be seen in the precipitation patterns of the Maine peat bog (this is also discussed on pages 58-59 in “Die kalte Sonne”).
Also storm activity was in sync with this development. This was shown by the analysis of storm sediment layers from some New England lakes. Especially during the moist, inactive solar periods did storms occur with increasing frequency. Because of this, Nichols and Huang assume that the solar climate signal was intensified by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or the Arctic Oscillation (AO). More evidence of this is also provided by various European peat bog studies. Because of the reduction in solar activity now projected over the upcoming decades, the authors assume that precipitation over the US Northeast will rise and lead to more frequent flooding.
The study underscores the great importance of solar cycles on our climate – especially their impact on precipitation. Prominent examples of the sun’s impact on precipitation amounts are illustrated by the lake levels of the east African Lake Victoria, as well as the discharge rates from South America’s second largest river, the Parana (see p. 58 and 67 in “Die kalte Sonne”).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNatural Cycles
by Ed Caryl
Solar and ocean cycles indicate that cooling times lay ahead over the coming decades.
One argument against the CAGW hypothesis is the influence of natural cycles controlling weather and climate. In nature, there are many phenomena that are cyclic.

Figure 1. This is solar cycle variation 1975 to 2005, the recent solar maximum. Source: Wikimedia Commons.
The sunspot cycles are particularly obvious. Do these cycles influence the earth’s climate? Here is a table of documented cycles. They range from the shortest cycle found in sunspot numbers, 3.7 years, to the ice-age repeat-time of 100,000 years.

Table 1. This is a list of known cycles and data sources. The links are to the source documents. The background colors suggest related cycles.
The problem with pinning down the exact lengths and relationships of these cycles are two-fold. First, the signal is noisy…very noisy. Some of the noise is due to measurement inaccuracy, and some due to the fact that the real signal is noisy and chaotic. Second, there is modulation present on the signals; they vary a great deal in frequency and amplitude. Some of the modulation is regular, producing predictable effects on the main frequency (the “side-bands” noted in Table 1), and some is noisy and unpredictable.
The sunspot Schwabe cycle varies from 8 to 14 years. The thousand-year long cycles also vary by hundreds of years. But there are still patterns one can see in the lengths. The 3.7-year cycle is one-third of the 11.1-year Schwabe cycle. The 22-year Hale cycle is two Schwabe cycles. The wet/dry cycles observed in the western U. S. and other places are one Schwabe cycle or two Hale cycles. The AMO is three Hale cycles. The Gleissberg cycle is four Hale cycles. These are all related to the sun’s magnetic cycles.
The longer period cycles are also sun cycles; the periodicity is reflected in carbon-14 and other isotopes detected in ice cores, tree rings, and other sources. The primary periods seem to be 210, 420, 710, 1500, and 2200 years, with variation around each of those lengths caused by frequency and amplitude modulation, the shape of the waveform, and “beats” with the Hale cycle. (When you mix two frequencies you get third and fourth frequencies that are frequency 1 minus frequency two and frequency 1 plus frequency two). The Suess/deVries cycle is the spacing between the various named solar minimums: Dalton, Maunder, Sporer, etc. The longer 420-year cycle is twice the 210-year cycle. The 710-year cycle is a half-D-O/Bond event cycle and one-third the Hallstatt cycle.

Do we see these cycles in climate? Yes, of course. As mentioned above, wet/dry cycles, the AMO, and the cooling during solar minimums, are well known. The 200-year cycle discussed in the Lui et al paper, and here, is seen from Tibet to Antarctica. The D-O and Bond event cycles are climate-warming cycles that occur during ice ages and in interglacial times like the present. S. Fred Singer thinks that the recent warming was a Bond event. So does the Chiefio. So does this author. But the warming is over. Vahrenholt is correct, though he may have not gone far enough in his predictions.
Can predictions be made? Where are we in these on-going cycles? Nicola Scafetta uses the cycles from the 20 – 22-year Hale cycle and the 60 to 66-year AMO cycle to predict
much less warming in this century that the IPCC predicts. Dr. Scafetta makes passing mention of the longer cycles but does not factor them into his prediction. We are 210 years from the Dalton minimum of the early 19th century, and 400 years from the Maunder minimum. We are due.
Predictions for solar cycle 25 have it at Maunder minimum levels with a sunspot count under 10. This is a Grand Minimum. The solar cycle length is also getting longer. There seems to be a relationship between solar cycle length, sunspot number, and global temperature. If this relationship holds, we will see cooling of 0.5°C or more in the coming
decades.
This cooling has already begun in the Atlantic Arctic and interior continental areas. See Temperature History – Part 2 and BEST Fails to Account…, Figure 10.
Habibullo I. Abdussamatov of the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia predicts a reduction in Total Solar Irradience (TSI) of 0.5% by the mid-21 st century and another Little Ice Age lasting until 2100. S. Duhau and C. de Jager of the University of Buenos Aires and the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, respectively, also forecast a Grand
Minimum in exactly the same time frame and “of the long type”.
Matthew Penn and William Livingston say that sunspots will disappear completely by 2016 to 2022, due to the magnetic fields reducing to a point to low to reveal them.
Counting Vahrenholt and Lüning, the above are seven predictions by seven different methods. All predict cooling in the coming years.
Some of the temperature trend predictions are for cooling to begin in 2014. After examining many temperature records all over the world, I believe that the cooling has already begun.

Figure 2. This is the annual global temperature trend for 2010 to 2011, Note in the upper right corner a figure indicating a global cooling of 0.12°C. Source GISS.
Figure 2 shows a global cooling year over year for last year of 0.12°C. Much of that is Canadian Arctic, Southern Russia, Africa, South Asia, Oceana, and the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Arctic Ocean has yet to accumulate ice to cool Northern Siberia late in the melt season, so that region still shows warm. This will soon change. Next year the cold will come to Europe and Russia earlier because there will be more and earlier ice in the Arctic Ocean. This will become more pronounced in future years. Don’t sell your thermal underwear!

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve often wondered why Germany remains so joined at the hip with the climate change movement when everywhere else it is collapsing. One reason may be because of the constant weak non-science-based reports like the one presented at N24 German television.
CLICK HERE TO SEE 4:40 VIDEO  (much is in English)
Hat tip: Ron de Haan
The video features the coastal Namib desert, which is supposed to be one of the oldest on the planet. The clip starts in German where the desert is introduced and it is claimed that its unique biodiversity is now threatened (by man-made climate change?). Because the biodiversity is highly adapted to the desert’s unique conditions, any change is all the more critical.
After 50 seconds, the video goes to English with German subtitles. Note how Joe Henschel claims that if anything there changes, then it means “something is really wrong”. The implication is that it is caused by man of course. Again it’s the unfalsifiable science of man-made climate change.
After the interview with the first man, the reporter says in German what climate change will bring for the desert, namely more storms, storm damage and erosion – and so everyone there is threatened. All the fault of man, I guess. The reporter says the Namib desert could act as an early warning system. Life forms from neighboring environments could begin invading.

50-year hockey stick
After 2 min 50 seconds, some observations are given in English by a specialist. The report I guess tries to say that any weather change in Namibia is due to global climate change, which is due to man. The man claims that the weather in the Namib desert has changed suddenly over the last couple years:
The earlier climate records only go back about 50 years, and in geological time that is a very short period. But if we do look at the records we have, we find that the climate has been relatively constant for most of the reported time. In the last few years though we have had a number of unusual events.”
This of course  is very weak science. Remember it is based on only 50 years of observation. I’m not knocking Mr Henschel, but look at how N24 spins the story.
Perhaps similar changes occurred sometime before that. As Steve Goddard points out almost daily at http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/, many of the “unusual” events we see today also occurred back in the not so distant past – more than 50 years ago.
So if anyone has observations, data or information from the Namib desert from more than 50 years ago, Mr Henschel may be interested in them.
(Note: The above hockey stick chart is my own depiction of the Namibian climate)

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman publicist Dr. Cora Stephan has a very worthwhile perspective on Hans Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Chancellor Merkel’s no. 1 climate advisor.Ms Stephan is concerned about Schellnhuber’s extreme views and has good reason for that. She begins by quoting Schellnhuber on freedom of science and democracy:
Core questions such as these, and questions on human rights, deserve a place in the Constitution. That would mean there would be judges who would vote against the majority when it is right to do so in regards to our constitutional consensus. This would require a very few ethical elites.”
Stephan puts Schellnhuber’s dictator-speak in plain language:
On the subject of climate change, democracy has to be switched off in favor of control by ethical elitists because most people are too removed from the long-term future (and its possibly dying children with whom Schellnhuber likes to threaten us.”
Schellnhuber claims that a few select elites (like his mates at the PIK) can see 100+ years into the future and to assess the impacts that our actions today will have. Either we do as he tells us, or millions of future children will die. (Ironically, much of what Schellnhuber proposes means millions of children would be denied birth, so I’m not sure how unborn lives could be saved).
Ms Stephan calls Schellnhuber’s type of climate activism an attempt at creating an “above the law state of emergency”, and involves a new climate religion operated by “high priests”:
The new religion promises the Last Judgement already today – that is we endeavour one last huge and dramatic effort to save humanity from a well-deserved downfall. As is the case with other religions, the best is repentance, humility and self-restriction – preferably through emission payments without end.”

Stephan writes that the new climate religion fills a void left behind by other religions, and tells us to feel guilty about prosperity.
Eventually, we fear, we’ll have to pay the price for our prosperity – be it to God or Nature, – with Biblical plagues such as storms, huge tidal waves, floods, fire-spewing volcanoes, in short: death and demons”.
Stephan warns us not to doubt the elite prophets who have the powers, tools and instruments to see deep into the future:
The new priests who proclaim these scenarios have attracted billions of followers with their announcements of world downfall. And, like all other prophets, they do not tolerate any doubts about their predictions. Those who dare express doubt are nothing more than egotistical wretches, appeasers and trivializers, block-headed deniers or worse, or to the least paid agents of evil.”
As the climate zealotry and hysteria spread though society, it’s only logical that the obstacles that prevent necessary action, like democracy, be removed and replaced globally by an “authoritarian regime of experts”. The “projected global downfall is the state-of-emergency that justifies every measure and it distracts us from every other unfinished business. There is no alternative.”
But all is not bleak in Germany. Cora Stephan writes that “the dire projections of global gloom and doom by the climate gurus have begun to crumble”. Clever citizens know where to check up on the facts.  Trust in those in high places is melting away along with their once assumed moral authority. Indeed they’ve squandered their authority – as is always the case with individuals who over-reach.

How many more of these are we going to need? I don’t know why there are still people out there who deny what ought to be obvious.
==============================
New Norwegian studies: A significant part of climate warming of the last 150 years is caused by the sun
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt (translated by P Gosselin with permission)

Three Norwegian scientists, led by astrophysicist Jan-Erik Solheim of Oslo, have taken a close look at the interaction between the temperature development on Earth and solar activity in the past. The scientists investigated the length of individual Schwabe solar sunspot cycles since 1850 until today and found a systematic correlation with the annual mean temperature of the subsequent cycle.
Here the scientists analyzed temperature data from Norway, Spitzbergen and other North European weather stations. Normally a sunspot cycle is about 11 years on average. If the cycle is longer, then it is a sign for a solar activity slumber. Solheim and his colleagues Kjell Stordahl and Ole Humlum have now been able to determine that the temperature lowered after a long and weak solar cycle. The temperature rose accordingly after a short and intense cycle. This points to a time delay of about 1 decade between the heat impact of the sun and the climatic reaction on Earth.

The length of individual Schwabe sunspot cycles correlates well with the annual mean temperature of the subsequent cycle (see diagram middle right). Example Tromsoe, from Solheim et al. (2011a).
Because the last Solar Cycle No. 23 was significantly longer (see p. 299-302, “Die kalte Sonne”) and by looking at the empirically obtained interrelation, the scientists expect an imminent cooling at Spitzbergen of several degrees Celsius (Solheim et al. 2011b). On a Norwegian and global scale, that could translate to up to 1°C (Solheim et al. 2011a, 2012). Moreover, using their correlation data, the Norwegian scientists estimate that about half of the warming since 1850 was caused by the sun.
In a parallel study, the Norwegian trio investigated the temperature history of the last 4000 years using the Greenland GISP ice core. Here the scientists found a characteristic temperature cycle with a period of about 1000 years. In the Greenland temperature curve it is plain to see the Minoic Warm Phase (3000 years ago), the Roman Warm Phase (2000 years ago), and the Medieval Warm Phase (1000 years ago) and today’s Modern Warm Phase. Cold periods occurred between these warm phases, with temperatures dropping more than 1°C. According to Humlum et al. (2011) the logical continuation of this natural cycle indicates that a large part of the 20th century warming is due to natural climate mechanisms (assumed to be foremost the sun).

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve had a number of things that have kept me from blogging over the last couple of days, and so I’m happy to have something quick today. Although it’s on the light side, it is profoundly true and insightful. This ought not be a surprise, though, as it comes from a profoundly insightful and critical mind.
Science cabaret artist and physicist Vince Ebert is featured in an interview at the online Schweizer Monat (Swiss Month) and gives his impressions on science, hypocrisy, and depressed polar bears. Hat tip: www.achgut.com/.
In a nutshell, Ebert claims Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger have got to be rolling in their graves as a reaction to how climate science is run today. The following are some excerpts of the interview from the part on climate science.
On the role freedom plays in science
Science is open to results. Experiments are made to refute theories and to improve. Someone can come along tomorrow and prove the theory of relativity is false. Suppose a biologist claps his hands near a fly, and it flies away. Then he takes a second fly, rips off its wings, claps his hands and discovers: Flies go deaf when you rip out their wings. Every new experiment can produce new knowledge. So a scientist can never say: “The problem is solved”.
On the gap between serious science and our daily perception

There are complex interactions that you simply cannot broadly explain. That’s why it annoys me when someone just comes along and believes he can explain such highly complex systems as climate change through the media, and trumpet it as irrevocable truth.”
On the “arrogance of science”
One should accept one’s own lack of knowledge and consider it as part of the process. Certainly many scientists are torpedoing this mindset. With climate change, many specialists and experts appear not as scientists, but rather as politicians. They come over, having studied physics, and actually claim: “The discussion is over.” And that when it is impossible to falsify their models! Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger have got to be rolling in their graves.”
On climate scientists and the public
Climate research is really a mine field here. Climate scientists get no funding when they say: “Actually, everything is not really that bad, and our models really are not able to predict the future”. On the other hand, a lot of money flows to those who claim: “Let us explain what your climate will look like in 20 years”. Many scientists are jumping on this bandwagon. Who can blame them!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Fritz Vahrenholt, author along with Dr. Sebastian Lüning of the skeptic German bestseller “Die kalte Sonne” had been invited to take part in the political talk show “hart aber fair” (tough but fair) on German public television, prime time Monday evening, March 12.
That was before the show caved in and disinvited the tough-debating Vahrenholt. That’s a pity because many viewers and I were really looking forward to this show. Instead we’ll have to be content with the boring topic of “electricity, gas, and fuel are getting more and more expensive – energy supply transition at our expense” with the usual blowhard dullard politicians blasting the same hot air we’ve been hearing for years.
The global warming religion is no longer able to withstand scrutiny. That’s how weak the whole science has become. Now the lock-stepping publicly-funded media have to shield the issue from public debate. They don’t fear the climate itself – it is debate itself that they truly fear. This is not the first time Vahrenholt gets disinvited from a major event. Last month the University of Osnabrück disinvited him, saying that his claim that the climate is 50% driven by the sun is “too provocative”.
I called hart aber fair studios in Cologne to get an explanation, but all I got from these publicly funded employees was “Nobody knows…I can’t tell you why” and “Maybe  because Vahrenholt is ill and can’t make it.” and “The person who could tell you is not available”. Unfortunately, they could not give me any names.  This is all absurd, of course. Perhaps German readers will have better luck. You can call the studios at 0221 2200, ask for “hart aber fair Redaktion”.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) published the news of the dubious disinvitation yesterday, but did not provide details as to why. The public is only left to speculate. The following are some reactions from readers:
Don Carlos writes: “Cancelled. Aha. Why am I not surprised?”
Friedrich Wildhagen writes: “They are afraid of the callers during the show. The Warmies show they are afraid. Hats off to Prof. Vahrenholt, Dr. Lüning. Job very well done!”
Alfred Casimir writes: “This report shows the insecurity that has arrived in the media. Take the disinvitation as a victory.”

Dear Mr. Gosselin,
Thanks for your interest in ‘hart aber fair’.
On the March 12, 2012 edition of ‘hart aber fair’, we will look at the topic of ‘electricity, gas, petrol are getting more and more expensive – energy transition at our expense?’ A change in the topic here is simply not the case, rather it is more of an adjustment based on editorial reasons.
The experience of many ‘hart aber fair’ editions has shown that with six participants it is not always possible to get a word in sufficiently. Moreover, there are quickly overlaps and doublings in the argumentation, which we naturally wish to avoid. In the concrete case this would likely have happened with Roland Tichy and Prof. Vahrenholt. Therefore we decided to reduce the number of participants to five guests, contradictory to the original plan.
You see: The preparation of a current talkshow like ‘hart aber fair’ is a constant development process which, for various reasons, can lead to topic changes and changes in the participants even right before the show begins.
We would be pleased if you tuned in on Monday to follow the discussion even without Prof. Vahrenholt.
Best regards,
 Matthias Radner
 Producer
 ‘hart aber fair’ (ARD/WDR)”
========================================
What I read from this is that they decided to make the show totally boring by presenting the same stale and moldy bread that everyone is sick of being served. Vahrenholt is the only one among them with a best-selling book with fresh new issues. Don’t bother watching. We’ve seen this crap dozens of times already.

Eventually the sham is going to give, and the latest letter signed by 50 NASA experts, with more than 1000 years of combined professional experience, is a sure sign the gig’s about over.
…..unproven remarks…..not substantiated…..hundreds of well-known climate scientists…..tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief…..science is NOT settled…..unbecoming of NASA’s history…..advocacy of an extreme position…..damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA…..even the reputation of science itself…”
Letters to the top don’t get any more blunt than that.
And how many tens of billions have these crackpots at GISS cost the taxpayers?
Here’s the letter:
March 28, 2012
The Honorable Charles Bolden, Jr.
NASA Administrator
NASA Headquarters
Washington, D.C. 20546-0001
Dear Charlie,
We, the undersigned, respectfully request that NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) refrain from including unproven remarks in public releases and websites. We believe the claims by NASA and GISS, that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data. With hundreds of well-known climate scientists and tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief in the catastrophic forecasts, coming particularly from the GISS leadership, it is clear that the science is NOT settled.
The unbridled advocacy of CO2 being the major cause of climate change is unbecoming of NASA’s history of making an objective assessment of all available scientific data prior to making decisions or public statements.

As former NASA employees, we feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate. We request that NASA refrain from including unproven and unsupported remarks in its future releases and websites on this subject. At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself.
For additional information regarding the science behind our concern, we recommend that you contact Harrison Schmitt or Walter Cunningham, or others they can recommend to you.
Thank you for considering this request.
Sincerely,
(Attached signatures)

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnjoy it while you can. I have no way of knowing if it will stay that way.Yesterday I was sure the German media were gearing up for yet another assault on science, getting ready to turn the US tornadoes into a Katrina-type event.
For example on Friday NDR public radio linked the tornadoes to man-made climate change. And there were some other similar reports from the fringes. Expecting to see more stories on tornadoes due to climate change today, I’m a bit astonished that I can’t find much in the mainstream media – amazing.
Some reports – from the fringes
Some kooky websites, like the one I mentioned yesterday, or klimaretter (“climate saviour”), who rarely bother checking scientific data and history, have chimed in. Klimaretter here for example wrote:
More than 130 tornadoes swept across the USA South and triggered the worst tornado catastrophe in decades.”
Here the author tries to make it sound like an event of Biblical proportions. Then he continues on the cause of the tornadoes:
Climatologists warn that global warming will lead to significantly more frequent and extreme weather events like heavy rains, powerful storms or droughts. This is physically based on the fact that warmer air has considerably more energy and water than cooler air.”
Another example of kooky science comes from geographer Jürgen Schönstein here at scienceblogs, who partly blames the death toll on the South’s faith in God (and Roy Spencer?), writing:
And I wouldn’t be surprised if a certain, uncontemplated and fatalistic religiousness played a role, which I observed the most often in the American South: It’s God’s will – if HE wants, then he’ll protect his sheep, and if not, then it is no use resisting His will. And whoever nurtured doubt in (climate) science from the highest positions in the USA certainly did not help to overcome this situation…”
And, though saying no one can be certain about the cause, he writes:

Still I’ll wager that we will be seeing more and more such killer storms in the USA in the coming years.”
Keep up the faith Jürgen (and keep ignoring the data).
Unlike these few nutty reports by outlets desperate for anything and everything, the mainstream media on the other hand has been remarkably SILENT. Maybe we ought not hold our breaths – that may change. The “climate masterminds” at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are likely concocting new tales for the media. Maybe the hysteria will break out in earnest tomorrow.
But it could also be that the media and charlatan scientists have grown much more cautious with their dubious claims, which in the past have been increasingly and deservedly attacked and ridiculed by a growing number of science and social blogs and sites, e.g. here, here, here, here, here, or here. Maybe they are finding out that all their fear-mongering has been backfiring in their faces lately.
All is quiet in the mainstream media this morning
Germany’s flagship ARD television reported on the tornado in an amazingly balanced way. In its news video here the report attributes the cause of the tornadoes as follows:
Meteorologists are searching for the reason behind the scale and strength of the tornado series. On thing is clear: the weather phenomena La Nina, cold stable winds over moist cold air provided the ideal conditions for creating tornadoes.”
So tornadoes are fuelled by La Ninas (cold) and not global warming. We’ve all seen the charts- tornadoes and accumulated cyclone energy have been trending downwards for decades, and appear to be linked more to oceanic cycles.
Der Spiegel reported on the tornadoes, but did not mention anything about climate change. I found nothing much at the FAZ, Focus, Süddeutsche, and others. A Google search also produced very little.
Is this the calm before the hysteria?

=========================================
The German Die Welt online here reports that veterinary and medical experts are now saying that biogas plants may be the source of the lethal E. coli bacteria now running rampant through Germany. Although the disaster is nowhere the scale we saw in Bhopal, India, so far we have seen 18 dead and over 500 hospitalized. And needless to say, millions of Europeans are spooked.
Die Welt writes:
Ernst-Günther Hellwig, director of the Agricultural and Veterinary Academy in Horstmar, warns that the bacteria likely comes from new sources, saying the epidemic is a house-made German problem. ‘It is possible that the EHEC contagion comes from biogas plants,’ he said.”
Die Welt also reports that Hellwig has long been critical of biogas plants. Yet biogas industry proponents claim there is no connection between the current E. coli outbreak and biogas plant operations.
Hellwig is not alone in this belief. Die Welt also writes that laboratory director Bernd Schottdorf, founder of the 1500-employee private medical laboratory Schottdorf MVZ in Augsburg, the biggest in Europe, also thinks the connection is possible. “Spores survive the biogas plants’ prescribed hygienization of 70°C without a problem“, he says. “We don’t know if the hygienization is properly carried out at all biogas plants.” When waste product from biogas plants is spread on fields, they can contaminate the vegetables.

North Germany’s unusual dry weather and drought conditions, where it did not rain for weeks during the springtime, may have played a role in the spread of the deadly bacteria. Spores can stay on plants for a long time, as they don’t get washed off by rain. The biogas plant substrate, which is a by-product and is used as a fertilizer, probably didn’t get washed off the crops by any rain. Currently there are 6800 biogas plants in Germany and their inspection is disorganised.
North German drought and dirty irrigation and “unwashed” crops
Manure slurry spreaders also used for irrigation.
Die Welt also writes that experts believe the unusually dry spring weather also may have led farmers to irrigate their crops using their liquid-manure spreaders. Farmers sometimes irrigate crops during dry spells using liquid manure spreaders, as this German manufacturer suggests here (scroll down to Liquid manure Distribution and irrigation systems).
The problem is that these liquid manure tanks are of course dirty and so contaminate the water, which in turn contaminates the crops. And then if it doesn’t rain for days or weeks, the crops stay contaminated through the time they are harvested.
Some points are clear: 1) The source of the E. coli is Northern Germany, which is home to many biogas plants and where agricultural manure fertilizer is widely used. The weather in the run-up to the start of the epidemic was very dry. Indeed, more detective work is needed to trace back the cause.
The online  FOCUS magazine here also brings up the biogas plant issue, hat-tip DirkH.
Biogas plants are also suspected of causing DEADLY BOTULISM in North German Agriculture, read here. Looks like all the well-intentioned green growing is leading to a trail of death and illness instead of natural health and cleanliness.

The gas platform, operated by French petroleum company Total, sprang a gas leak days ago and its crew had to be evacuated. According to Greenpeace chemist and activist Manfred Santen on Monday:
The greatest environmental impact is expected to be to the climate.”
That’s a green way of saying that there will be no significant pollution to water. Clearly he wants the public to believe that this small scale leak, which does not even come close to a volcano in magnitude, is going to have an impact on our climate. This is just plain silliness.
Santen is on board a Greenpeace vessel and is taking air samples near the defective platform.
The platform has been in the news in Europe, and activists are doing all they can to spin the gas leak into a sort of Deepwater Horizon scale catastrophe. This is a sign of desperation.

As no water is being polluted, all they are left to say is that it will impact the climate. Imagine that folks, one platform leak will impact the climate. This tells you something about the state of the climate movement today. Grabbing at any straws they can.
The warmist CO2 Handel here writes:
Gas has been flowing out above the water surface and into the air for one week. The gas contains climate-damaging methane as well as poisonous sulfur dioxide.”
According to the German news service DPA, Santen will measure the air near the platform using gas chromatography.

One big headline that Germany’s online tabloid Bild carries today is about the breaking off the Antarctic Pine Island ice chunk, which is the size of Berlin…880 sq km!

Bild calls it a “Monster Ice Berg!” and of course we are to believe that it is yet the latest sign of the coming climate apocalypse that we will all suffer unless we all run and hide under our beds and beg for mercy. According to Bild, the giant ice berg is about 60m high.
Simple mathematics tells us the volume is about 53 cubic km.
Bild mentions, quoting scientists, that such glacier calving of this magnitude is normal, and occur about every 10 years or so. But normalcy is not the message that Bild wants the reader to get, and so warns that the “monster iceberg” could pose a threat to shipping, and to animal life! Bild also says that scientists are deeply worried and writes:
The Pine Island glacier is huge and unstable, and thus it is difficult to judge the risk for global sea level rise.”
Such stupidity – of course aimed at quite uninformed, clueless readers, to say it diplomatically. How much global sea level rise should we expect? From various sources we can read that a large part is already underwater. But let’s assume that none of it is under water just for the calculation.
Sea level rise estimation:
Area of oceans: 362 million sq km
Volume of Pine Island chunk: 53 cu km
Sea level rise: 53 km3 divided by 362,000,000 km2 = 0.000000145 km = 0.000145 m = 0.145 mm = 145 microns
Given that much of it is already submerged in sea water, we can safely assume that sea level rise will be less then a tenth of a millimeter.
Quick – head for the hills!

====================================================
Alternative Energy Wind Power?
By Ed Caryl
Wind power in the U. S. is most available in harvestable quantities in the Great Plains states just east of the Rocky Mountains.

Figure 1: Brazos Wind Farm, Texas. Source: Wikimedia Commons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GreenMountainWindFarm_Fluvanna_2004.jpg

Figure 2: Wind power in the United States. Source: Wikipedia Commons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Wind_Resources_and_Transmission_Lines_map.jpg
This is advantageous, as those states have vast areas with little population, flat terrain, good transportation for the long components, and lots of open, privately owned land that can be leased for wind farms and still be used for cattle grazing or farming.
At 30% Gross Capacity Factor, with 80 meter tower height, according to the U. S. Department of Energy, the limit for harvestable wind power in the 48 contiguous U. S. states is 38 PetaWatt-hours (38 X 1015 watt-hours [wh]). In the US we need to generate at least 30 PetaWh from all sources of energy (30 X 1015 wh), just to keep the U. S. current standard of living. So wind will generate all of what is needed. About 14% of all the energy used is electrical power. Last year, the United States used 4.1 X1015 watt-hours of electricity. Harvestable wind power would be almost 10 times the electrical power we currently use. But, the land area used would total over 22% of the land area of the United States, and would require 11 million 1 MegaWatt turbines.
Lets look at some real world examples of high-density wind farms. In California, power is generated in three high wind locations: Altamont pass east of San Francisco, Tehachapi pass east of Bakersfield, and San Gorgonio pass near Palm Springs. The largest wind farm field is San Gorgonio.
Figure 3a
Figure 3b
Figures 3a and 3b: San Gorgonio Pass, south and north sides of Interstate Highway 10, Palm Springs, California. Photos by the author.
The wind farms at San Gorgonio Pass cover 70 square miles. There are over 4000 wind turbines at this location. In all of California, there are over 12,000 wind turbines. In 2004, output totaled 4.258 GigaWatthours of electricity. In 2007, this had increased to 6.8 Gwh, 2.3% of the electricity generated in the state. This is approaching 7% of what can be generated by wind in the state of California. These three locations are the prime wind locations in California, and the best spots at each are taken. The rest of the wind power locations in California are on the coast, in very scenic locations. (For a sneak-peek at today’s California electrical use and the renewables availability see this site.)
In California, a transmission line from the nuclear plant at Palo Verde, Arizona to Los Angeles passes through the San Gorgonio wind farm area. The wind farm thus supplements the nuclear power. San Gorgonio generates less than 0.03% of the power generated at Palo Verde. Most Southern California electrical power comes from Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Out of state generation accounts for 31% of California’s electrical power, 24% from other Southwest states, and 7% from the Pacific Northwest. Southern California has also imported power from the Cerro Prieto geothermal plant in Mexicali, Baja California Nord, in Mexico.
In the U. S. as a whole, 94.65 Twh were wind generated in 2010, also 2.3% of the electrical power generated (over 4,100 Twh or 4.1 X 1015 watt-hours). Two states, Iowa (15.4%) and North Dakota (12.0%) generate more than 10% of their power from wind. Minnesota (9.7%), South Dakota (8.3%), and Kansas (7.2%) are not far behind. (Source: Wikipedia) In these states wind power makes sense because the resource is available, the amount of power needed is low relative to the area, the power is used locally, and wind power is competitive with other sources. The percentage of wind generated power has not reached the point where backup power when the wind stops is a problem.
What are the downsides to wind generated power? There are several.
Wind power tends to drop when you most need it.
During the last few cold winters in the U. K. wind power generation dropped to very low levels during the coldest days. This happens everywhere. Wind power cannot be depended on to supply heating electricity when it is most needed. It must be remembered that all heating systems require some electricity to move the heat within the system. In California, wind power generation has a definite daily pattern, low in the morning and ramping up during the afternoon. But this pattern doesn’t happen every day. See A Grid Manager’s Nightmare. To provide power when the wind dies, a grid manager must have an equivalent amount of other generation available, usually fossil fueled, or the lights will go out. The U. K. solves this problem by importing nuclear power from France. Denmark imports hydroelectric power from the rest of Scandinavia. If all the euro-zone countries continue to expand wind power, there will come a point where sufficient backup power will no longer be available.
In California, a report by KEMA Inc. written in June 2010, states:

//-->




Researchers concluded that accommodating 33 percent renewables generation by 2020 will require major alterations to system operations. They also noted that California may need between 3,000 to 5,000 or more megawatts (MW) of conventional (fossil-fuel-powered or hydroelectric) generation to meet load and planning reserve margin requirements.”
Wind turbines are dangerous
There are several ways one can get killed by a wind turbine. Bird kills are just one downside. In the U. S. state of Montana, a study found that three times as many bats were being killed as birds. One reason is that bats don’t need be struck by the blades to be killed. A bat’s lung structure is such that the pressure change as the blade passes by ruptures lung tissue and kills the bat from the “bends”.
A wind turbine is a tall tower first of all. Falls from a tower higher than 20 meters usually has a bad outcome. This means that to work on a turbine requires a safety line. This leads to another problem. Outside the turbine nacelle there are the rotating blades and a shaft. If the line gets tangled in either, the wearer is pulled off the nacelle and into the blades or shaft… Not good. Inside the nacelle, there is the rotating shaft, gears, and the generator. If a safety line, clothing, or a hand, gets caught in the rotating machinery, the resulting escalating injuries are inexorably and agonizingly fatal.
One worker was killed inside a tower by falling ice. The falling sheet of ice nearly cut him in half. Ice throw by the turbine blades has been documented to 150 meters. Calculations have predicted ice throw to half a mile (nearly 1 kilometer). Blade failure throw has been documented to 1300 meters. The recommended distance to occupied housing due to blade throw, noise, and shadow flicker from blade rotation through sunlight, is 2 km. Shadow flicker can trigger epilepsy in sensitive individuals.
There have also been many fatal accidents during the transportation and construction process. Erecting a large wind turbine requires moving very long loads on the highways, and using very large cranes to erect the components. Both processes are hazardous. There have been a total of at least 78 people killed in the wind industry as of March 31st of 2011.
Wind turbines are noisy
Small wind turbines hum. Large wind turbines, as the blades pass the tower, make a low frequency thump as well as low frequency “swish – swish” sounds that can travel for miles. One reference mentioned that the Nazis used similar sounds for torture. Farmers near wind farms in the U. K. and Taiwan have reported livestock losses reportedly from lack of sleep.
Fire is a hazard for wind turbines
Electrical components can short out, overheat, or otherwise fail causing fire. Gearboxes can leak lubricants, overheat, and catch fire. Lightning can cause fire, and a wind turbine is a tall object that attracts lightning. A wind turbine contains many gallons of flammable lubricant and hydraulic fluid. To reduce weight, a wind turbine nacelle is often fiberglass or other plastic that can burn and melt, dripping flaming material onto the surroundings. Local fire departments usually respond to a wind turbine fire to simply watch it burn and control any spot fires on the ground, because they cannot fight a fire 50 or 80 meters in the air. Note in Figure 3b, above, that several towers no longer mount turbines. Their fate is not known for certain, but fire or “king-pin” failures (the shaft around which the turbines rotate to face the wind) are the likely reason. The “king-pin” is the only support that keeps the turbine on the tower.
Wind turbines are different from other generation methods in a way that exacerbates danger. There are no on-site operators. If something goes wrong that is not monitored and/or controlled electronically, a problem can spiral into disaster faster than remote operators can physically respond to the scene.
Eric Rosenbloom wrote an excellent paper in 2006 that details much of the danger from wind turbines. See his paper here.
What to do when the turbines wear out? 
The usual annual funds planned for maintenance and repair for a wind farm is 4 or 5% of the cost of installed equipment. The planned life is usually 20 to 30 years. This should be thought of as the half-life of a wind farm. In this period, half of the turbines will have catastrophically failed. Usually in older wind farms, after half have failed, the others are decommissioned and eventually abandoned. If the permitting agreements have not called for removal, old wind farms are often just abandoned by owners. This is happening in Hawaii and California as this is written.
The economics of wind power, or how do we make money on this?
In Texas and Denmark, wind farm operators often pay the grid operators to take their generated power. They can do this because the subsidies they receive from the government allow a small profit. This happens because the wind power is distant from the cities that need it, and transmissions costs are higher than what the power is worth. In Texas, the power is in the “panhandle” in the north, and the power is needed in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Houston in the central and south of the state. In the U. S., Subsidies include a 5-year accelerated depreciation schedule, as well as tax rebates, and Renewable Energy Credits. The accelerated depreciation schedule means that operators will sell the wind farm after five years, the next owner will take the depreciation for another five years, and sell it again. If the new owner is a European company, they get “carbon offset” credits for an additional subsidy.
In Denmark, wind power is backed by hydroelectric power in Norway and Sweden. When the wind is blowing, Norway and Sweden will back off their hydroelectric power production to save water in the reservoirs. Hydroelectric power is cheap, so Denmark gets little or nothing (sometimes less than nothing) for the wind power they are exporting. When the wind stops, Denmark then imports power from Norway, Sweden, and the rest of Europe at the spot price. As in the U. S., subsidies allow this to work, giving the operators a profit, no matter which way the wind blows.
Wind power is a huge scam. There is no other way to describe it. If it were not for subsidies, no one in their right mind would build a wind farm. To learn more, this author recommends following the links in this article for as long as your nausea level will allow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people view environmentalist groups as friendly folks who only want to protect nature. The reality, however, is that many are very powerful, intolerant, and have the means to bully, intimidate, and criminalize people just for having a different opinion.Take for example Hubert Weiger of the powerful German environmental group BUND (Bund für Natur Deutschland). At eco-website Klimaretter (Climate Rescuer) here, Weiger fumes at Canada and wants the UN to start a legal process because the country backed out of the completely useless Kyoto treaty. Klimaretter writes:
In 2012, the United Nations should introduce a breach of contract process against Canada because the country backed out of the Kyoto contract. This is what the Chairman of the environmental association BUND, Hubert Weiger demands. ‘Also the German government must apply pressure,’ said Weiger in a interview with klimaretter.info.”
Still not clear to you? Well you listen, and you listen good! Klimaretter continues:
‘The community of nations cannot stand by and simply let a country throw this kind of crucial human rights binding contract into the dustbin,’ he believes.”
There are plenty of German eco-kooks within the government, and so Canada ought not take these threats too lightly. Canada can reckon with a massive smear campaign from the intolerant environmentalists in Europe. Weiger then adds:
“Not only did Germany reach its targets without any problems, but also did so reaping economic benefits. Climate protection is a central innovation driver for the economy and creates considerably more jobs than it destroys.”
In addition to scientific papers, Herr Weiger also obviously hasn’t been reading the financial papers. The reality is quite to the contrary. Germany’s energy sector is nearing a meltdown of unprecedented dimensions (soon to appear in English). This year the country went from being a major net exporter to a major net importer of energy. Germany’s solar companies are drowning in red ink and teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Moreover, conventional power companies have announced the sackings of thousands of well-paid workers. Also read here, Green Economy 2011 in a Nosedive.

And in the wake of Fukushima, Germany elected to wipe out an entire industry in which it was a global leader when it came to safety and innovation: nuclear power. For some, the shutdown of nuclear plants can’t come soon enough. Klimaretter writes:
Weiger is demanding that the nuclear exit be moved up to 2012 or 2013.”
Shutting down all of Germany’s nuclear reactors might be tough to explain to the public. No problem though, Weigner has a solution for that too:
What we need is a ‘comprehensive information and motivation campaign, beginning with kindergarten and extending through to seniors, on TV, radio, Internet at all levels – from the federal government on through to the municipalities and local communities.”
Talk about scary. Sounds like something from the old playbooks of authoritarian regimes. It wouldn’t be scary if this was just from an obscure green kook from a fringe organization. But these are the recommendations of an organization that is widely quoted by the media daily and is well-connected to Germany’s top government levels.
Canada, beware! They hate you because you have a different opinion and you refuse to fall to your knees before them. And you’ve been making too many plans for your damn dirty tar sands.
One final note: One of the main contributors to Klimaretter is centre-left SPD honcho Michael Müller. I can only surmise that he condones this type of highly intrusive, authoritarian-style of global and local interference.

SkySails kite-towing technology fails to deliver. (Photo: SkySails)

The German FAZ reports here that Hamburg-based SkySails will lay off half of its workers. Managing director Stephan Wrage, an industrial engineer, blames reluctance by shipping companies to invest in his “innovative technology”. The FAZ also adds:
 There’s no support from the banks. He expects the difficult situation to continue for another 1 to 2 years.”
I can’t understand the lack of interest. Maybe it has something to do with high costs and low benefits? Damn customers – always expecting performance for their money.
What the company has to do now is ask the government to pass a law requiring ships be outfitted with towing kites. You see, the shipping companies are too stupid to recognize the benefits of this “innovative technology”. They need the government to decide it for them. After all, according to the company’s website, “40 employees representing a wide range of disciplines and specialties – from aerospace engineers, to software developers, shipbuilders, management professionals and CNC operators – all help to develop, manufacture and market the worldwide patented SkySails technology.” They can’t be all wrong, can they?
The company, established in 2001, also boasts:
SkySails kites are the key technology for capturing the vast potential of high-altitude winds, and SkySails is the first company in the world that has succeeded in developing towing-kite technology into an industrial application. […] Some 50 million euros have been invested in developing the SkySails technology and establishing the manufacturing capability.
50 million euros! And high altitude? Since when do ships fly? And they claim they have succeeded?

SkySails won many awards
There are also promotional videos for the award-winning company’s products at its website. One shows how the huge kite is deployed (to high altitudes). It requires that the ship be outfitted with a giant crane for hoisting the large kite into the air before releasing it. The crane itself has got to cost a fortune.
I majored in mechanical engineering, and only a couple hours of simple calculations would tell anyone that this technology makes no sense. I’m beginning to wonder what German engineering students are being taught at their universities.
The FAZ also writes:
The shipping companies are hesitant to invest a million euros for a towing kite. So far SkySails has sold about 10 towing kites, but not all have been installed.”
A million euros! Ten kites – in 11 years.
My advice to the management is that they speak to an old engineer, the kind that still uses a slide rule and was never brainwashed by green religion, and listen to what he says. If he says ha ha ha – it means the idea won’t work, and start designing a better diesel engine instead.
I’m sure there were a number of politicians who made the obligatory tour of the “innovative” plant, followed by a speech on how this was the “future of energy” – blah blah blah. Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lünings’s book “Die kalte Sonne” did not hit the bookstores a minute too soon.

This video is the work of Kilez More, see http://www.kilezmore.com/.  The politically misfitted rapper in the video tells us that warmist climate science is a hoax, is all about money and control, and that the science is cooked up at the CRU and other institutes. I don’t know who is behind the video – could even be some renegade fringe types, who knows.
So are the youth turning against the Great Hoax? Looks that way.

Kilez More – Climate Change Lyrics in English)
You thinking of climate change and you’re screaming for laws
You’re thinking about CO2 and saying “let’s stop it”
Global catastrophes happening all because of man
We did too much driving, now the planet is too warm
If we don’t do something soon then the ice will melt
A flood is gonna kill us and the future’s gonna fall
No it aint…I’m telling you you’re off the wall
Man aint causing climate change, yeah you
think I’m crazy and making no sense
But just look at the climate institutes and you’ll see
what they do, they’re fudging the data making it hot
We just found out…their studies are made up
A hacker got in the computer and the database
Now read the mails from the CRU – they’ll make you laugh
They’re cooking the numbers, the temperature is up
Listen to me! It’s all a fraud and enough is enough
Ref
Climate change was not made by man
No… It’s only to keep the world in fear
All those who are pimpin it are being called experts
And the brothers who diss it are getting labelled sick
Climate change was not caused by man
No…it’s only to keep the world in fear
But I don’t believe it, and so I’m getting labelled sick
But it’s the price you pay when you think for yourself
II
Climate change is normal, it’s always been around
We aint done a thing, history shows us so
History books show in 1100 the planet was warm
In North England people were pickin grapes and making wine
And that wasn’t because of factories run by knights and
The shield industry driving the climate up
Then in sixteen hundred the Baltic froze over and it
Wasn’t because they stopped CO2 with ‘reform’
That’s pure arrogance when man thinks he’s got the power
To control the whole climate on the entire globe
Truth is only 1 to 3 percent comes from man
Comes from processes that are natural – so they’re lying
Inside the brainless walls of these fear-mongering crackpots
They want more power, more money, more control, more global tax
And every skeptic is getting branded by them
Being defamed and compared to Holocaust deniers
Ref
Climate change was not made by man
No… It’s only to keep the world in fear
All those who are pimpin it are being called experts
And the brothers who diss it are labelled sick
Climate change was not caused by man
No…it’s only to keep the world in fear
But I don’t believe it, and so I’m getting labelled sick
But it’s the price you pay when you think for yourself

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a new paper out called A model-data comparison of the Holocene global sea surface temperature evolution by G. Lohmann, M. Pfeiffer, T. Laepple, G. Leduc, and J.-H. Kim. Hat-tip: a reader.
This is an important study because scientists need a way to check the reliability of their models. If the models can recreate the past, then there’s a chance they can be used for the future.
We have about 150 years worth of reliable instrumental records that can be used to check models. Beyond that, scientists have had to reconstruct temperatures using proxy data. That’s the only way to check models that go way back. But we also know that using proxies as thermometers is not an exact science. Yet, with enough of them, you can get a pretty good idea of how climate behaved in the past. So it should be possible to use them to test models.
In the paper’s introduction we find:
Information beyond the instrumental record covering the last 5150 yr can be obtained mainly from two strategies: on the one hand by deriving from proxies which record past climate and environmental conditions, and on the other hand by simulating climate, using comprehensive models of the climate system under appropriate external forcing.”
Relying on models to tell us what the past climate was? Sounds rather dubious. So, according to the abstract, the authors compared the ocean temperature evolution of the Holocene as simulated by climate models and reconstructed from marine temperature proxies.

The proxy dataset comprised a global compilation of marine alkenone and Mg/Ca-derived sea surface temperature (SST) estimates. The authors write what they observed (emphasis added):
Independently of the choice of the climate model, we observe significant mismatches between modelled and estimated SST amplitudes in the trends for the last 6000 years. Alkenone-based SST records show a similar pattern as the simulated annual mean SSTs, but the simulated SST trends underestimate the alkenone-based SST trends by a factor of two to five. For Mg/Ca, no significant relationship between model simulations and proxy reconstructions can be detected.”
The authors later in the abstract add:
…when modeled temperature trends are set up to allow drastic shifts in the ecological behavior of planktonic organisms, they do not capture the full range of reconstructed SST trends. These findings challenge the quantitative comparability of climate model sensitivity and reconstructed temperature trends from proxy data.”
Most of us know that determining the “appropriate external forcings” (mentioned above) has been elusive in climate science, and has involved many dubious assumptions and downright hanky panky – all to make CO2 appear as the dominant driver.
Proxies will always be the superior way of determining how climate behaved in the past. Eventually models will be able to reproduce the past, but that will not mean they will be capable of predicting the future. One can use many different combinations of forcings in models to reproduce the past climate. But finding out which one was in fact correct, if any, will remain quite the challenge.

Not again! Early forecasts point to another cold winter for Europe. (Photo credit: NOAA)
I’ve found some early winter prognoses of what Central Europe and Germany. I used to rely on Joe Bastardi for the euro winter forecasts, and he had a habit of being  correct. But he’s busy with his new Weatherbell now, and I’m not aware of him making euro-forecasts.
So I’ve had to look at other sources, and so far preliminary forecasts are signaling a snowy and cold Central European winter.
killikus.de here makes a comprehensive analysis for central Europe (in German) and presents its prognosis in its introductory box:
Prognosis for the winter weather and Christmas weather for Winter 2011/2012
Snow and water without end! Winter 2011/12 will be wetter than summer 2011.”
Killikus.de writes that the North Atlantic stream assured us warm and mild winters over the last decades, but since 2008 that situation has changed.
So since the year 2008 it is increasingly colder in the winter months and also wetter. As it appears now, the cold wet climate will pick up in the coming winter months.”
That means we ought to think about having snow shovels and road salt ready. And don’t put off the winter tyres. Killikus.de also cites an old North German farmer’s rule:

‘There are always 7 fat years that get followed by 7 lean years.’ The 7 fat years ended on 31 December 2008, and so ‘the 7 lean years will end on 31 December 2015’.  Until then, expect lots of rain and very cold winters.”
Killikus.de then explains how this is due to natural variations in northern hemisphere.
wetterprognose-wettervorhersage.de writes that the period September-November will be too cold and at times “considerably too cold”, and adds that eastern Europe and Scandinavia will lack precipitation. For the winter months of December – February:
…Eastern and Northern Europe will be significantly too cold. In Germany the 2011/2012 winter prognosis today looks as follows: mainly normal, but with cold spilling in at times from the east or north – considerably too much precipitation in January and February, whereby January 2012 will be rated too cold (January is the coldest winter month). The probability for a normal to cold 2011/2012 winter is higher than a winter that will be too warm.”
www.duessel-wetter.de does not make a winter forecast, but offers a fall forecast. First it writes that things dont’t look good for late September: Hope for a nice late summer in the middle of September has significantly diminished.
Only southeastern Germany will temperatures get above average! Otherwise things don’t look at all good. It looks like so-so autumn weather.
For Germany that means cool and wet. Duessel-wetter.de’s autumn forecast calls for a 32% chance the fall will be cooler, 30% chance it will be around normal, and a 38% chance it will be too warm. It should be pointed out that 38% chance is very low in these global warming times. Often  in the past chances of a warmer-than-usual winter were pegged at 70% or 80%…because it was thought CO2 was such a dominant driver.
Finally the National Weather Service  chart also indicates to cold for Europe in the months ahead:

But what we have to remember is that many of these “experts are not reliable spend their time sitting in air conditioned offices in Zurich, London, or Manhattan and never really have gone out in the field and taken real scientific measurements. Many in fact just spew crap in the form of alarmist press releases to the gullible media. Hat-tip: International Business Times.

Der Spiegel above brings a report on the Sahel Region of Africa, interviewing Dutch geographer Chris Reij of the University of Amsterdam. Reij says the opposite is occurring: the Sahara is shrinking. It is not expanding.
Reij has been visiting and documenting “the greening of the Sahel Zone” for decades. According to Reij at the the 0:28 mark:

The Sahara is not expanding. Sure there are still some areas of drought. But it is a popular myth that is gladly spread by the media that the Sahara is creeping southwards more and more every year. Also serious organizations claim this agaian and again. But it’s not true.”
As Der Spiegel shows at 0:58, trees are growing where 20 years ago there was only sand. And people are learning to manage the land and to reforest the area. “Here there’s more success than what people believe,” says Reij.
Der Spiegel concludes:
The Sahel zone is called the ground zero of climate change by UN officials. But now it’s getting green because of people on site have learned to help themselves.”
Thanks, Der Spiegel, for this bit of reality from Africa.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Augusto Mangini of the University of Heidelberg in Germany is an expert for temperature reconstructions using stalactites and stalagmites.
He was allowed to speak a whole 15 minutes at the World Extreme Weather Congress in Hamburg last moth, where he presented some sobering results. These in turn were reported by the print edition of a leading German science news magazine Bild der Wissenschaft.Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne website.
His presentation was called: “Climate Curves in Comparison– Why There Are Such Large Differences“.
In the current April 2012 issue of Bild der Wissenschaft, Klaus Jacob has a report “Klima in Kalk“ (Climate in Limestone) where he describes the method and climatological relationships of stalactites that Mangini uses. Jacob writes:
[Mangini] has been working with stalactites and stalagmites for 15 years – and has come to an amazing conclusion: The natural climate fluctuations are greater than what the science has previously assumed. This has consequences for the future as the fluctuations will superimpose the human impacts. Thus the continents will not necessarily always become warmer, rather the trend could take a break, or even a temporary cooling is possible.“
Don’t you love how the main stream media, after years of being stuck on CO2, are finally waking up to REAL SCIENCE. Jacob continues:

[Using stalactites and stalagmites] Mangini has reconstructed the central European climate over the last 9000 years. Clear to see are the stark ups and downs with differences of about 2°C. […] Already on multiple occasions over the last 8000 years the temperature shot up 1°C within just 200 years. The temperature appears to fluctuate naturally more starkly than what the IPCC shows in its reports […] Mangini’s curves now show […] the start of a cooling phase.“
Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne site writes that Jacob’s article addressed some important points, which other German journalists are unfortunately too spineless to write about:
(1)  The pre-industrial, post Ice Age period was characterized by natural climate fluctuations without the involvement of CO2.
(2)  These natural fluctuations today still play a major role on our climate, which up to now has been played down.
(3)  The IPCC models are thus not as perfect as they are often claimed to be.
(4)  The warming stop since 2000 could continue, and even bring a modest cooling with it.
(5)  Ocean cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) will suppress the temperatures over the coming decades.
Die kalte Sonne site then expresses some disappointment that Jacob did not mention the likely cause of these past, stark climate fluctuations – cyclic solar activity. Here skeptics will have to be patient with the mainstream media. We cannot expect them to change overnight. Rome, after all, was not built in a day.
Prof. Mangini’s presentation coincides with a recently released study that adds yet another straw to the camel’s back. The study Holocene climate variability in North-Eastern Italy: potential influence of the NAO and solar activity recorded by speleothem data, authored by Scholz et al (co-authored by Mangini) concludes from the data:
This suggests that climate variability in Northern Italy was influenced by both solar activity and the NAO during the Holocene.”
There we are once again: the sun and oceans dominate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChris Horner made a great presentation at the European Institute For Climate and Energy’s (EIKE) 4th Climate Conference, Munich, in November, 2011. A must-watch, recently posted video!

Hat-tip: Reader DirkH
Horner starts by focusing on the real aim of the green movement, which is to make energy expensive, and so we have to expect fuel poverty in the future to go up. Horner says, “Green jobs will mean pink slips, red ink, and dark times.”
At the 6:40 mark, Horner zooms in on the IPCC, transparency, and the FOIA.
Horner reminds us that the FOIA is an act designed to allow the taxpayer “to know what the government is up to”. But for the IPCC and climate scientists, it represents a real problem that obstructs “the cause”. So the IPCC proceeded to exempt itself from FOIA law and even acted criminally to skirt it, “organising a campaign to obstruct and to delete records” and “creating safehouses to evade FOIA laws,” Horner says.
First (10:10 mark) they used excuses for not disclosing the records, claiming they were “personal, lost, deleted“. In the UK, the excuses were even “getting absurd”. They “organised an effort to delete e-mails”, in a “very deliberate, very thoughtful” way. It “wasn’t rash”. “They really didn’t want these things out.”
At the 21:00 minute mark, Horner sums up the scientists reluctance to release documents, and their scheme to destroy records.
There was an admitted, agreed, written campaign to delete e-mails, to get around, to circumvent FOIA. So that is legally, deliberately and lawyerly drafted.”
Horner said, “The e-mails exposed the Team for the reasons pointed out. They were politicising, they were perverting peer-review. They were perverting the IPCC process. And they were creating falsely tidy stories.” For what? “For the Kyoto cause.”
The inquiries conducted to exonerate the Climategate scientists were whitewashes. They were designed not to find any wrongdoing.
At the 24-minute mark, Horner tells how the IPCC records are public records and how the IPCC was actively dodging FOIA obligations.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




FOIA has always been a thorn for the IPCC scientists, who, as Horner shows, had plenty to hide. Much effort was expended to circumvent FOIA requirements.
Horner explains the more recent tactics at the 33.50 mark. For example senior officials were given “handles” to conceal their identities. They ran third party activist websites to make it appear they had support. They set up safehouses at non-governmental websites to circumvent FOIA laws and to keep taxpayers from gaining access to documents.
John Holdren took control of the IPCC process after the president had been innaugurated. Horner shows an IPCC letter from IPCC official Thomas Stocker, who wrote that FOIA problems “require urgent attention in order to meet the challenges of modern methods of working and communication and given the experiences during and since AR4.” He then suggests establishing a “closed electronic discussion fora”.
By October 8, 2010, Horner shows in a slide that “IPCC’s Stocker had in fact already established a ‘closed electronic fora’ for WG1 evading e-mails and national FOI”.
Horner then says the IPCC enlisted to Obama Administration to create offline, non-governmental electronic fora, while stonewalling requests for records. He says:
So the White House Office of Science and Technology policy led a government-wide effort to enable the UN to pull this off, expressly to frustrate national FOIA laws.”
Horner concludes that “there will be fallout, there will be a price to pay. It is the institutions of science that are going to suffer the most.”
By now the readers will ask: “For what?” The answer is: “the cause”.
What is “the cause”?
Recall what Horner said at the beginning of his presentation. As societies get richer, they become more focused on keeping things clean and orderly.
I’ll expand on Horner’s assertion, and add that once a certain level of affluence is reached, the advanced society begins to get individuals who turn radical and intolerant, and eventually view the poor masses as excess population and as a threat to the planet. Think of Holdren, Ehrlich and Schellnhuber who have in one way or another expressed that the ideal human population on the planet is around a mere billion, or less.
Is this “the cause” that these individuals are really alluding to? Indeed some do view the green movement as the latest final solution.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Werner Weber of the Technical University of Dortmund is the author of that infamous, consensus-shattering article “The CO2 Lies” appearing in Bild newspaper on Monday – also see here – which featured the new skeptic book that is causing an uproar in German climate science, written by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning.
Now he is throwing in a few more shots of dissent, as he answers a message he received from another (seemingly indignant) North German professor (see below).
Naturally he has since received lots of mail, and not all of it friendly. For example here’s the message from the “indignant” professor, who wrote:
Dear Prof Weber,
I’m completely shocked by your article in Bild. What do you expect to accomplish with this?”
Here we see that in climate science, some professors have completely forgotten how science really works, and so need to be reminded. Here’s Professor Weber’s reply, which he published at “Die kalte Sonne site“. I’ve translated it in English with permission (slightly edited for clarity, emphasis added):
Dear Prof. [Completely Shocked],
I assume you belong to the climate scientists who subscribe to the assessments that the IPCC well represents. But to me you are not known as one of the protagonists of the IPCC’s opinion, like the directors and employees of the PIK [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research], whom I’ve collided with before.
I came from the outside, after about 40 years of experience in the highly competitive field of condensed matter physics that involves the intense interaction between experiment and theory, a field with a culture of discourse that takes all controverisal and divergent opinions seriously.

The field of climate science appeared to me as being very dogmatic right from the start, at least concerning the fundamentals. In no time flat, the motto became: “the science is settled”. Those who now challenge the fundamental statements on climate are, in the best cases labelled as dimwits, and in the worst case they get labelled as “deniers”, analogous to a “Holocaust denier”. Let’s take Al Gore for example, admittedly a politician, or Pachauri, the IPCC spokesman, admittedly an engineer. But the statements made by leading representatives from the PIK were hardly different.
In the meantime I’ve worked myself halfway into the field of climate science. Even the most fundamental principles hold no water when truly subjected to closer scrutiny, and much, which doesn’t fit the overall narrative, is flat out ignored – and much involving key, central issues. In my guest piece in the book by Vahrenholt/Lüning “Die Kalte Sonne”, I clearly illustrated an example of this.
I’d be happy to present my arguments in a seminar presentation at your location if you wish.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Werner Weber
Technical University of Dortmund

Hat-tip: reader J. James
You’d think the Council would have its plate full with all the unrest in the Middle East, the real threats of terrorism, Iran, Afghanistan and global financial crises. Not Germany. The country prefers not to deal with these pressing problems, and chooses to ignore reality and make believe it is rescuing the planet from a fantasy destruction hundreds of years in the future, and hopes the world will regard it as some kind of action hero for it.
I’d regard such behaviour as not that of a hero, but of a mental patient. Worse, the lives of millions is in the hands of that mental patient.
Germany last held the Chairmanship in 2003 in the run-up to the Iraq war. So what urgent topic of debate has Germany decided to focus on in the midst of all the other world’s real crises? Sea level in the year 2200 of course! Deutsche Welle writes.
Every presidency holds an ‘open debate,’ and Germany has selected climate change as the topic of their debate. It will be about the security implications of climate change, said Ambassador Wittig.

“Key points of the debate will be about the rise of sea levels and the disappearance of entire states,” said Wittig. “From the United Nations 192 states, for the first time several states could completely disappear,” he added.
The issue is not exactly new, but fits in with Germany’s profile within the United Nations as a pioneer of environmental and climate protection.
Seriously, if you look at the sea levels, you see it would take hundreds of years before some coastal countries would begin to disappear. In fact sea levels are dropping at many locations.


Chart above shows regions with sunken sea level (blue) for the period 1958-2007 (in cm) in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean. Graphic from IFM-GEOMAR.
Meanwhile terrorists are plotting now, today. Fortunately the chairmanship gets rotated to saner minds from time to time, and as Deutsche Welle writes:

Only a small portion of time will actually be dedicated to the issues specifically put forward by Germany.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes the old wisdom turns out to be the better one – that is wisdom from the analog world, during a time when there were neither bits nor bytes, nor model calculations to explain the world to people. One of these wisdoms is: The search for missing persons using concentric circles around the last known position. Had the French aviation authority BEA followed the old wisdom, the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 would have been located within just a few weeks after it crashed off the Brazilian coast on June 1, 2009.”
This is how an online story here appearing in Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) began its story on the recent discovery of the wreckage of doomed Air France Flight 447, an Airbus 330-200 with 228 on board, which crashed into the ocean en route to Paris – almost 2 years ago.
Hat tip NTZ reader: Marcus K
So why did it take so long to find the wreckage in the Atlantic Ocean, in an area where the water is 4000 meters deep? The FAZ explains why. Instead of using the old concentric circle search method, authorities opted to rely on mathematical models from oceanographers and mathematicians. The result: they searched in the wrong area for almost 2 years.
In this case here, claiming the methodology was flawed but the answer is correct isn’t going to wash. Officails still don’t know why Flight 447 crashed. To find out, it is important to recover the flight data recorder. The sooner it is found, the quicker you can find the cause of the crash and implement possibly crucial technical modifications to the rest of the fleet in order to prevent the accident from happening again.
Unfortunately in this case, although the plane was found just recently, almost 2 years time was wasted – thus possibly put passengers in subsequent flights at needlessly higher risk.
The FAZ story writes that once a plane crashes, the flight recorder’s beacon sends out a signal for 30 days to make it easier to pinpoint its location. Already on June 10, 2009, an entire fleet of ships was searching an area, one was even equipped with Towed Pinger Locator, but there was no success. After 30 days, i.e. around July 1st, the flight recorder’s power ran out and the signal stopped. The first attempt to find the wreckage failed.
A second search attempt began on July 27, 2009, and included a French oceanography ship of the Ifremer Research Institute which used an ROV to search the ocean depths. But that search attempt also ended in failure on August 17, 2009.

Computer models send searchers on a wild goose chase
So what next? According to the FAZ (emphasis added):
Still in the summer of 2009, the French BEA contracted renowned oceanographers and mathematicians from France, Great Britain, USA and Russia to calculate the probable crash area. The task was to back-calculate the drift of the bodies and pieces of the wreckage that had been found north of the Last Known Position (LKP) on June 6, and trace it back to the time-point of the crash, taking currents, wind and waves into consideration. The highly complex calculations of the Drift Group were then summed up in a 2000 sq km probable crash area and presented in January 2010. The calculated area extended 60 km north of the last known position [LKP]. The 3rd phase of the search began on April 2, 2010.
This calculated search area is shown on the diagram, click here. Note how the mathematical computer model calculation produced an area all around where the wreckage was actually located. The last known position (LKP) is denoted by the green dot. The actual site of the wreckage is marked with an “X” and is only 10 km from the LKP!  The initial search area of 2009 is denoted by the light blue box at the top of the graphic. Finally, the computer modelled mathematical calculated search area is denoted by Phase 3.
Needless to say, the models sent the rescue efforts on a wild goose chase from April 2 to May 24 2010. The computer-model guided Phase 3, too, ended in failure.
Eventually, it wasn’t until officials had spent €30 million and almost 2 years time (and gotten a stroke of luck) that they were able to claim success in late March 2011. The French Marine had placed electronic buoys and monitored them for weeks and found out that currents behaved unpredictably and changed very often. The modelers had made wrong assumptions.
They couldn’t even model a 2000 sq km area for 5 days
Keep in mind that the modellers here only had to calculate the dynamics of one grid cell on the planet – and that for only a period of 5 days – and not the entire planet for 100 years (which climate modellers now claim they can do). A relatively small area for a only few days – and they still got it all wrong! (I’m not making fun of the mathematicians here – I’m just saying the task is extremely complex, and so you have take results cautiously).
This really ought to be a lesson for people and policymakers who rely on computer models to tell them what the climate is going to be like for the entire planet 10, 50 or 100 years into the future. Folks, it’s nothing more than wild guessing.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt wasn’t all that long ago when a number of climate scientists were projecting the Earth would soon fall into an almost permanent, increasing El Niño mode, where the surface temperatures of the equatorial Pacific would always be like what we saw in 1998 – all man-made.

Sea surface temperature chart September 2011. Source: NASA.
Today a number of German-language papers are reporting that Norwegian scientist Tore Furevik of the Bjerknes Centre of the University of Bergen says he expects the opposite to happen at least this year. Furevik says that La Niña may come back for third straight year. “The situation is simlar to the previous year,” he says.
Die Welt here writes that “there are no signs that La Nina is going to disappear anytime soon” and that according to Norwegian experts “it will occur even more strongly than in 2011”.
The Wiener Zeitung of Vienna, Austria adds:
The La Niña phenomena has been persisting since 2010 and there are no signs of it going away. We had this strong cooling in 2010 and instead of getting warmer, we stayed in a long cold phase’, said Furevik. “And it appears as if an even stronger La Niña will occur.'”

Furevik’s La Niña forecast contradicts the experts’ forecast, where an ensemble of models show the trend towards an El Niño for the 2nd half of the year:

Since about 2005 the PDO phase has gone negative and is projected to stay that way for another 15-25 years – meaning cooler global temperatures.
If Furevik is right, it means that 2012 and the first half of 2013 will end up being cold. That’s bad news for those betting the Earth will warm further this decade. That means that the first quarter of the 2010s decade will be much cooler than the average of the last decade.

Negative PDO favors more frequent occurrence of cooling La Niñas.  Source: http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/. The overall 60-year cycle shows we are now at the start of a cool phase.

Share this...FacebookTwitter If you ever wondered why people in the Green Movement often seem to take on an air of arrogance, condescending superiority, to be masterful at propaganda, spiteful of human population, preoccupied with lebensraum, intolerant of other views and just plain bossy, journalists Michael Miersch and David Harnasch tell us what is probably behind it.
It turns out that National Socialism is the biological father of modern environmentalism. As you shall read, green naturally appeals to brown, and vice versa in many respects. This is so because much of green ideology was inherited from the browns to begin with.
Miersch and Harnasch write how this is so in the latest print edition of news magazine FOCUS, in an article they’ve reprinted at their website here: Ökonationalsozial.
What follows are FOCUS excerpts I’ve translated in English.
The National Socialist Party has a long green tradition, it turns out. Today Germany’s brownish NPD Party, for example, marches against nuclear power and gene technology. It demonstrates for organic food and bio-farming. The word “nature” appears everywhere in its party literature. “Man is part of nature. That’s why nature is simply not only the environment around man. Materialism of the last decades has driven the destruction of the natural life’s base in an irresponsible way.“ This is not a quote from Greenpeace literature, but from the party program of Germany’s brownish NPD party.
During Green Week at the end of January in Berlin, thousands of animal activists, gene-technology opponents and organic farmers protested. Many among them were “Autonomous Nationalists“ who held signs that read “Against plant food patents“ and “Against capitalist slavery“. The browns are infiltrating the greens.
Michael Miersch
Because Neonazis are hanging out increasingly within the Green scene, non-brown greens have become alarmed. One state official went through the trouble of authoring a 36-page information guide titled “Nature Protection Against Rightwing Extremism“ in order to curb the growing brown flood within the Green Movement.
Brownish organisation Midgard not long ago distributed a green-brown propaganda magazine in South Germany. The magazine called “Environment and Active“ has the motto: “National policy is environmental policy.“ In the 1930s the Nazis shared the green ideology, and had the Weltanschauung “blood and soil”, which revered healthy eating, idealized rural agrarian life and German forest romanticism.
For the Nazis in the 1930s, sustainable living was a primary aim of the regime. There was a huge interest in renewable raw materials and alternative energies. Back then wind turbines were called Reichskrafttürme (Reich’s power towers). Later in 1959 Germany published a novel that warned of man-made climate change: Der Tanz mit dem Teufel (Dance with the demon). The book’s author was Austrian Günther Schwab, a Nazi SA stormtrooper. He went on to be viewed as a “green visionary“.
Former Nazis were active in environmental groups and went on to become the grandfathers of the Germany’s modern greens. They became very much involved in Germany’s early Green Party, thus exposing the myth that the Green Party was “a new movement”. Green Party honcho Jürgen Trittin warns at his website of “the many commonalities“ between brown and green.
August Haußleiter in 1980 was one of the German Green Party’s first leaders. It was discovered that the concerned environmentalist was also an anti-Semite. He resigned and in 1986 joined the Bavarian Greens.

Joseph Beuys, a green leader in the 1980s, was involved with the Volks National Revolutionaries. Baldur Springmann was connected to the SA, SS and NSDAP. In 1982 he left the Green Party and joined the new Ecology-Democratic Party.
In 1983 Werner Vogel was one of the first Green Party parliamentarians. He happened to be an SA Sturmführer and NSDAP member as well.
In 1984 Luise Rinser wrote poetry about Hitler, and in 1981 vaunted over dictator Kim Il-sung.
Alfred Mechtersheimer was at first a prominent green, but then left and became a brown.
It is not only the Green Party that had brown streaks, so did many of Germany’s earlier environmental groups, which later transformed into groups known today as NABU or BUND. Lina Hähnle, Chairman of what today is NABU, once pledged allegiance to Hitler.
Also the Association for Nature Protection in Bavaria sympathized with Nazi causes. From 1958 to 1963, Alwin Seifert was National Director of the Association For Nature Protection. Seifert in 1940 had a high level position in the Nazi regime as Reichslandschaftsanwalt (Reich’s Counsel For Landscape). Here he occupied himself with such matters as planning the future of the conquered lebensraum in Eastern Europe. He was instructed by Heinich Himmler to make it so that “the German folk could feel at home there”. Twenty five years later Seifert authored the book: Gärtner, Ackern – ohne Gift (Gardens, Meadows – Without Toxins), which today is still a bestseller and, according to Amazon, ‘a Bible of the Green Movement’.”

My comments: To me this is astonishing. But when you think about it, so many parallels jump out at you. Think for a minute about the 10:10 No Pressure fiim. Think about Schellnhuber’s “Great Transformation masterplan” or Michael Mann’s “the cause”. Think about how environmentalists feel about 7 billion people on the planet. Think about all the science and media manipulation going on to fool the public to promote the obvious lie of CO2 dominating the climate. Think about those who want to change the planet so that “they can feel at home there”. Recall what Hansen said about China’s regime. The list goes on and on. These people are not brown, but they really ought ot think about what they look like. Actions speak volumes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome news that may help European meteorologists with their seasonal forecasts in the future. We know that last fall many predicted a hard winter for Europe, and just the opposite is now occurring. What I find interesting is how the new paper reminds us of the proper way to build a model.
A team of climate scientists  led by Dr. Daniela Matei and Prof. Dr. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and Prof. Dr. Johanna Baehr from Hamburg University’s Cluster of Excellence “CliSAP” have shown for the first time that the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) at 26.5 °N can be skillfully predicted for up to four years.
This can be important because, according to their press release:
The AMOC – known as “Gulf Stream” – transports warm surface waters into the high latitudes, where they cool, sink and return southwards at depth as cold North Atlantic Deep Water. Variations in AMOC can significantly affect the northward ocean heat transport and therefore the European and North Atlantic climate. Through its influence on sea surface temperature (SST), AMOC can further impact climate phenomena such as Sahel droughts or the frequency of Atlantic hurricanes. Therefore, it is of outmost importance to be able to predict these climate variations on a time horizon from years to decades.”
“Climate variations” here is the key. The authors explain the proper approach for making mid-term climate predictions in general:

In the near term (inter-annual to decadal timescales), climate variations are influenced by both anthropogenic forcing and natural variability. […] The skill of any prediction system is assessed retrospectively, by performing the so-called “hindcast” or “retrospective forecast” and comparing them with observations.”
Oh really! This is almost what the IPCC does with its famous climate models, but with a small difference of course. In the IPCC models, there are always huge discrepancies between the hindcast and observations. No problem though. The IPCC modellers simply apply the ever so versatile aerosol fudge factor wherever needed, and presto! CO2 is always the big driver and the significant natural cycles are reduced to nothing.
I don’t know if Drs. Matei and Marotzke of the MPI-M produce models for the IPCC, but if so, all they have to do now is take the same approach they mention above and include the other (very well-known, at least to the rest of the world) natural cycles like the PDO, AMO, NAO, solar, etc. in their climate models. If they did that, they would quickly discover that they could do away with the massive aerosol fudging and actually produce a multi-decadal model that works. Of course, the IPCC may not be happy with the result.
If they don’t make climate models for the IPCC, then they should at least give their climate modelling colleagues a hint or two.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMedia jubilation in the wake of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. And there should be.
But back in 2006, under a different President, the media reacted much differently when the US forces whacked another equally brutal and cold-blooded killer – Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He’s the butcher who taped the decapitation of Nicolas Berg (a video so chilling that I have refused to watch it). Abu Musab al-Zarqawi carried out numerous viscious acts of terrorism, beheadings and murder throughout Iraq.
You’d think the media would have rejoiced in the same way back then when al-Zarqawi was terminated?
Not a bit. Instead they sniffed and, openly accused our equally heroic US forces of brutality, cover-up and inhumane treatment – even depriving the poor butcher of his Miranda rights. Take for example the pathetic Democratic Underground website, which wrote:
U.S. troops arriving on the scene wrapped the man’s head in an Arab robe and began beating him, said the local man, who refused to give his name or show his face to the camera. His account could not be independently verified. The U.S. military made no mention of any physical contact between U.S. troops and al-Zarqawi other than an attempt to provide him with medical attention.
Here’s my theory: The US found Zarqawi still alive and he died/killed in custody. Then they called in the fighter jets to bomb his house after he was dead to cover up their deeds. In the process they killed 6(?) civilians including at least 1 child. If this is true then all 7 deaths should be considered murder.”
Or look at the equally pathetic CBS, who had no qualms about floating the allegations of excessive use of force by US forces – quoting some dubious witness named Mohammed:
‘When the Americans arrived they took him out of the ambulance, they beat him on his stomach and wrapped his head with his dishdasha, then they stomped on his stomach and his chest until he died and blood came out of his nose,’ Mohammed said, without saying how he knew the man was dead.”

Oh my God – such brutality. Even if it were true, I’d say good for them.
Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert with RAND Corp.,  couldn’t find anything positive in the killing of al Zarqawi, and is quoted in USA Today as saying:
Americans ‘take a kind of ‘Wanted’ poster approach” to the fight against terrorism and ‘therefore believe that if another desperado bites the dust, the war is over and we can ride off into the sunset’. In fact, Jenkins said, the long-term effect of Zarqawi’s death is likely to be slight, because the main players in Iraq’s violence — Baathist hard-liners, Shiite militias and Iraqi organized crime elements — remain.”
The AP and MSNBC here  gave Al Qaeda a voice to spread encouragement among their followers, quoting an Al Qaeda website:
We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow often do we hear screams “head for the hills, sea levels are rising fast!” from alarmists like James Extreme Hansen of GISS and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)?
Yet, study after study show that there is no evidence of accelerating sea level rise. All sea level fluctuations are within the normal range of variation. Nothing unusual is happening.
The latest study is by Albrecht et al 2011, Determining sea level change in the German Bight appearing in the journal Ocean Dynamics 61: 2037-2050. Hat-tip: http://www.co2science.org.
The study focused on regional mean sea level (RMSL) in the German Bight of the North Sea. Albrecht et al based their work on homogenized annual mean sea level data for the period 1843-2008 acquired by 15 tide gauges.
According to CO2 Science, the authors determined that “regional mean sea level increased at rates between 1.64 and 1.74 mm/year with a 90% confidence range of 0.28 mm/year in each case.”  As for an acceleration in RMSL rise within the past few decades, CO2 Science writes:
…they note that in terms of 20-year trends, the most recent rates are ‘relatively high.’  However, they report that these rates “are not unusual and that similar rates could also be identified earlier in the record.”

I don’t recall seeing anything about this in the papers on on TV. The authors also note:
…the same conclusion concerning a possible acceleration in the recent past was drawn by Haigh et al. (2009) for the North Sea region of the English Channel.”
A press release by the Institute of Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht, Germany also said the same 2 months ago, based on the same data I assume (emphasis added):
A group of Geesthacht coastal researchers, together with engineers from the University of Siegen, has recently carried out an analysis of the rise in sea levels in the German Bight. All reliable water level measurements were evaluated for the first time, in order to determine how the mean sea level of the German Bight has changed. According to this evaluation, the sea level rose by approx. 20 centimetres in the last century, in recent times higher than in the years around 1960. However, similarly high increases in levels also occurred in the first half of the 20th century. They are, therefore, not unusual.”
There seem to be natural cycles at work here.
And strange on how all the models show acceleration, but the real data do not.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been interesting reading some of the reactions from the green, warmist sites. Of course they are all seething in rage and resignation as their unclean movement collapses.None of them up to now have presented any scientific arguments refuting the claims made by Lüning and Vahrenholt.
Indeed many forget that geologist and climate-paleontologist Lüning is also one of the authors and brings more expertise to the book than many of those who reside in bloated “climate institutes” and call themselves climate scientists. The book is not written by just an “RWE boss”.
The very green Financial Times Deutschland (Germany) has been running a reader poll here since February 8.
The results? The FTD may be green, and maybe many of its readers, but FTD’s readers are also obviously open-minded, or just downright skeptical.
Survey: The climate view of Fritz Vahrenholt is…
Answer 1: humbug – 10%
 Answer 2: rhetoric of a lobbyist – 20%
 Answer 3: good food for thought – 28%
 Answer 4: 100% right on! – 42%
Number of votes: 4800
I suspect that a number of readers really don’t see any real changes in the climate, except that we are back to cold winters here in Germany, which of course flies in the face of projections of warming. And I suspect that many see through the scam. They see who’s making money, and where it is all taking us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a good overview explaining why the measurement of Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is fraught with much uncertainty and so subject to substantial error. Michael Limburg of the European Institute for Climate and Energy tells us why.



Tide gauge system (Credit: University of Colorado)


Source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/tide-gauge-sea-levelOn
On Determining Global Mean Sea Level
by Dipl.-Ing. Michael Limburg
An exact determination of GMSL is a very difficult if not a fundamentally impossible task. Even more difficult is determining sea level rise (or drop) over time. Different authors using the same datasets arrive at completely different results. It’s little wonder sea level expert W. Siefert in Hamburg recently said in an interview: “When examined closely, sea level is being exposed more and more as a pure mathematical prop, inadequate and, foremost, not very meaningful. Especially when it is to be used as a sole standard of measure, or used to derive horror scenarios…(1)“
This is also confirmed by researchers like Douglas [Douglas, 1994], who illustrated in great detail why e.g. Barnett (1984), Emery and Aubry (1991) Pirazzoli (1993) concluded:
…the determination of a single sea-level curve of global applicability is an illusory task.”
Douglas hoped that improved research instruments would bring better and more reliable results in the years ahead. And with the possibilities presented by satellite altimetry, these results may now be at hand. But so far mostly controversial results have been produced and no really reliable findings have been gained.
And later, in spite of the many new instruments and techniques that can now be used to find the much sought signal of global warming on GMSL, they say…
…these tools seem to have raised more questions than they have answered.”
Obtainable accuracy
It must also be allowed to say that a claimed measurement accuracy of a few tenths of a millimetre per year for the (only measurable) Relative Sea Level (RSL) and the GMSL are not possible with the available historical data. Only the newest satellite altimetry tools may allow this in principle. Therefore using the unit of measure “mm” is grossly misleading. The IPCC,  many experts, publicly informed media, and laymen are hence falsely claiming an accuracy that simply cannot be reached. These figures are computed values only.
In reality sea level changes can be measured accurately only to centimetres, and often only to within several centimetres – and very often not even that. Munk [Munk, 2003] (3) confirms this writing that…:
“…the jury is still out on the interpretation of the tide gauge records.”
For sea level and for trends from global historical temperature data, the old saying of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) – known as a great inventor of many basic statistical principles and algorithm – remains true:
Nothing shows a lack of mathematical understanding more than an exaggeratedly accurate calculation.”
Therefore the only thing certain is that the statistical construct of GMSL over the last 120 years indicates a rise of between 10 and 20 cm/century. The error lies in the scale of the calculated value, and likely may be even higher. While Mörner expects a mean rise of 10 cm/century, the IPCC (AR4) sees approx. 19 cm/century. Today IPCC experts see an increase in the rate of rise over the last 20 years, while others explicitly exclude such a rate increase.
Why all the uncetrtainty?

It is due to built-in systematc errors. Many of these errors are widely unknown in their historical size, appearance and direction. They are included in the data and they involve an array of factors such as: dtermination of sea level measurement reference points, datasets of various lengths, contaminated datasets, rapid shifting of tectonic plates and their vertical components, barometric pressure, density of water, etc, etc.
A close analysis of all these error factors indicate that the errors are of a systematic nature and, because they are mostly subtle, they cannot be determined on the scale of the sought local sea level rise. Therefore they have to be indicated using error bars in accordance with good scientific practice. But this has very rarely been done. Credible figures regarding the attainable accuracy are as a rule the exception, e.g. Mörner +10 ± 10 cm by the year 2100 (or + 5 ± 15 cm) [Mörner, 2004] (2). Anything else has to be taken with much caution.
Assigning the causes of sea level rise
Detailed attempts to determine GMSLR are made by authors of the IPCC and others by breaking it down into various components. But one has to keep in mind that that this approach is prone to failure. Cazenave et al [Cazenave, 2004] is quoted on this:
…for the past 50 years, sea-level trends caused by change in ocean heat storage also show high regional variability,” ´
and
..has led to questions about whether the rate of 20th-century sea-level rise, based on poorly distributed historical tide gauges, is really representative of the true global mean.”
The estimates for eustatic and steric components cannot be brought in agreement with the observed data. The movement of single tectonic plates with speeds in the range of more than 15 cm/year, the vertical components therein, which can decisively impact the volume of the ocean above it, is certainly a cause of the observed changes in RSL and thus GMSL. But recording these changes and quantitively attributing them to a source has been impossible up to now.
Also a potential temperature-dependency is not detectable over the last 1000 years, as clearly shown by Storch et. al [Storch, 2008] (5). In their model that looks back, they did not find any correlation between sea level trend and temperature.
For all measurement locations, sea level changes can be more easily attributed to natural changes (glacial isostatic adjustment GIA / post glacial rebound PGR or other tectonic shifts) or, similar to the UHI for temperature, attributed indeed to man-made social-economic factors, e.g. urban growth and thus sinking. A greenhouse effect is not necessarily needed to explain it. This means future projections of the GMSL are purely speculative because of the great lack of understanding of the involved processes and the lack of data.
Nothing makes this more explicit than the wide range of estimates among IPCC lead authors (e.g. Rahmstorf) and other specialists: Jevreva, Mörner or Singer. Rahmstorf [Rahmstorf, 2007a](4) believes a maximum of 140 cm is possible by the end of the century, James Hansen estimates up to 600 cm under certain conditions, the IPCC shows estimates between 14 to 59 cm (final), Singer only 18-20 cm, and Mörner [Mörner, 2004] a mere 10 cm. This might be the reason why the IPCC authors are unusually cautious ( see for reference AR4 of WG I Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level on page 410 Chapter 5.5.2.):
…there is an increasing opinion that the best estimate lies closer to 2 mm/yr than to 1 mm/yr…”
Conclusion
When basing conclusions solely on the ever-escalating opinions of a few scientists – some of them well known for blowing the horn of alarmism – political leaders should not decide on extremely costly measures to curb completely doubtful global sea leve rise, which is a mere statistical construct from the very beginning.
The only rational conclusion one can draw is: All global mean sea level rise claims with an accuracy of better than ± 10 cm/century have to be taken with great caution. Breaking down the rise into components and attributing a respective rise to each, especially to temperature rise, is not possible with today’s level of knowledge. Each assignment of factors is simply too speculative.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith great sadness Der Spiegel reports here reports that a 17-year old Briton was killed by a polar bear attack on the island of Spitzbergen in the Arctic. Also another 16 year old and a 17 year old were injured, and 2 group leaders age 27 and 29 years respectively. The victims were part of an expedition organised by the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES).
According to a BSES press release, the tragic death earlier this morning involved one of the members of its expeditions in Svalbard. In addition to his death, four other members of the expedition sustained injuries, two of them severe. They were evacuated to Tromsø hospital. No other members of the expedition were injured.
Der Spiegel writes:
The office of the island’s Governor explained that the polar bear’s attack occurred near the Von-Post glacier. The group had 13 participants and had set up a camp of tents located 40 km from Longyearbyen when the polar bear attacked in the morning. ‘The bear attacked the people inside their tents,’ said police chief Erik Nygaard, according to NTB-information.”
According to Der Spiegel, the island is inhabited by about 2500 people and 3000 polar bears.
The BSES is a non-profit UK-based youth development charity. Founded in 1932 by the late Surgeon Commander G Murray Levick, a member of Scott’s final Antarctic Expedition of 1910-13. BSES is one of the longest running organisations of its type.
Polar bear kills are treated like potential murders
Expeditions are normally provided with firearms for protection. But as Der Spiegel reports, shooting a polar bear is legally risky – no joke:

If a polar bear is killed on the archipelago, then it automatically leads to a trial. In this case the authorities assume the role of defence attorney for the dead bear.”
So who is going to want to shoot?
Who knows, maybe all the tenderheartedness and sympathy that had developed for polar bears over the years in their bogus climate-caused plight may have contributed to the death of the young man. Let’s all be nice to Mr. Polar Bear. The combination of getting too close and not taking the threat from the seemingly cuddly animals could have led to the group putting it guard down. This is pure speculation on my part, of course. Surely the authorities will conduct an intense investigation.
The BSES website explains its primary purpose:
Based at the Royal Geographical Society, BSES provides opportunities for young people of all abilities between the ages of 16 and 23 to take part in adventurous exploration that involves scientific research in wilderness areas. The expeditions can last for several months and the location tends to be different each year but could be anywhere from the Arctic to the Himalayas. The aim of BSES is to help the personal development of young people, through the challenge of living and working in remote and demanding areas of the world.”
The online UK Telegraph shows that close encounters with polar bears are not unusual and have occurred in the past. A disaster has probably been long in the works. Click here to see an incident that involved a BSES Expedition and a polar bear in 2006.
Finally, again speculation, the relatively youthful age of the expedition leaders also indicates to me that the group may not have had the experience needed to properly judge the risks and dangers involved. There are going to be lots of really tough questions in the days and weeks ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more that time runs out for the world to stop “dangerous climate change”, the more the world seems to drag its feet and postpone limiting so-called greenhouse gases. The disconnect between the supposedly imminent threat and the world’s reaction could not be more profound.
If anything, the world’s reaction confirms that global warming is nothing really but hot air.
According to Der Spiegel, a realistic new deadline looks to be 2014 or 2015. A new treaty would regulate CO2 emissions for 40 industrial countries. But Russia, Japan, Canada and the USA have already said they would not join in.
China, the world’s greatest CO2 emitter, and India are not bound to CO2 reductions in any treaty. Currently represenatives from 180 countries are meeting in Bonn in a half-hearted attempt to lay the groundwork for Durban.
Der Spiegel reports here again that the world will likely postpone in Durban signing a climate treaty to succeed Kyoto I. Speigel writes:
here also will likely be no new international treaty at the next climate conference in Durban South Africa at the end of the year. The United Nations no longer anticipates a successor treaty for the Kyoto Climate Protocol to be finished on time. The end of December deadline will be missed, said Christiana Figueres, UN Climate Chief said at a UN conference in Bonn.

Prospects look dim. Even WWF “climate expert” Tasneem Esso sees the writing on the wall, and says:
The current political framework is not favourable for a treaty. We cannot be optimistic.”
Speigel reports that the USA says it is in favour of a Kyoto 2, but only if nations like China are included. China, which is rapidly modernizing its economy, refuses to restict its CO2 emissions.
Officials and scientists are claiming the situation is urgent. Der Spiegel writes that the number of annual “reported natural catastrophes” has doubled over the last 2 decades from 200 to 400, and that:
The number of catastrophe refusgees jumped 2 and half times from 2009 to 2010. In total more than 90% of the catastrophes in the past year could be traced back to weather events.”
Der Spiegel does not provide any source for these statistics other than quoting “some scientists”.

Neil Cavuto however admits he doesn’t know what a “Trabi” is. Nothing wrong with that – not everyone can have the fortune of being brought up in communist East Germany – that state run socialist paradise that America now longs to be. So I thought I’d show Neil what he missed out on living in the capitalistic West.

Worse than Inspector Columbo’s car!
My first experience with a Trabi was back in early 1990, just after I had first moved from the US to West Germany and the Wall had fallen. With the border open and East Germans free again to travel unrestricted for the first time in 30+ years, many of them took a drive into West Germany for the first time. On the autobahns Beamers, Audis, and Mercedes Benzes were zooming by in the fast lane at 140 mph as the tiny two-stroke 25 hp Trabants could barely muster going 50 mph. The contrast between West and East could not have been more stark.

East Germans had to wait 15 years for delivery of a new Trabi. Not because demand for them was high – but because it took that long for the state-run factories to build and deliver them. In 1990, the Trabant was technically stuck in the 1940s. If you had an accident in it, the best you could hope for was a quick death.
East German TV spot
Here’s the Trabant 601 – with 600 cc air-cooled 2-stroke engine, fully synchronized 4-speed transmission, 28 mpg highway! Available in any color (as long as it’s beige).

So get your new Government Motors Chevy Volt today, and relive the good ol communist days! Folks, this is what the state-planned, government-run economy can deliver – if only you’ll just give it the chance.
So Neil was right about one thing: It was a real doozie.

German Green Party Chairwoman Claudia Roth called the latest figures “alarming at an extreme scale.” Eberhard Brandes, Chairman of WWF Germany, is outraged and said: “The data coming out of the USA are shocking and exceed the worst our fears and pessimistic scenarios.” While Halloween takes place one day a year in the USA, in Germany it’s a year-round affair.
In comic fashion, the German Press Agency DPA blasted and blamed the USA, but then added:
The international community of nations has failed miserably.” In the USA CO2 emissions compared to last year decreased – in Germany on the other hand they increased.”
Decreased? Who cares – let’s blame the capitalists any way.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Brown and Climate Ethics
By Ed Caryl
Donald A. Brown at Penn State writing in his blog here did the “Climate Skeptics” a big favor by gathering “The Hockey-Stick Team’s” arguments into one article. I am sure that Professor Brown was certain that no skeptic would have the temerity to actually challenge his assertions.
But his assertions beg for challenge. One of his techniques is to make claims about the skeptic side that are in fact much more true for the Team side. These techniques include:
Lying
One example of the Team’s use of lying is the assertion that “97% of Climate Scientists agree” that AGW is true. This figure is based on an on-line poll sent to over 10,000 “earth scientists” where the participants were self selected, and the actual numbers were 75 out of 79 answering the poll describing themselves as “peer-reviewed climate scientists”. See here. The actual questions on that poll were:
1. When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?
2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”
Nearly all skeptics would answer “have generally risen” to Question 1, and most would answer “yes” to Question 2. This loaded poll proves nothing. The whole argument revolves around “how much”. We don’t know if the above 79 participants were actually “climate scientists” or not. They could just as well have been kids down at the neighborhood Starbucks with laptops. But this assertion has been repeated countless times on the Internet as if it were Holy Writ and Peer Reviewed. (It was not.) The principle used here is that “If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth”. this according to one of history’s most infamous propagandist.
Professor Brown says that:
Some of the claims made by some of those engaged in the disinformation campaign have been outright lies about such things as the claim that the entire scientific basis for human-induced climate change is a hoax or that there is no evidence of human causation of climate change.”
This statement itself is not true. Most skeptics think that there is some human causation, just not the catastrophic kind claimed by the Team. In answer to Professor Brown’s citation of six books for his side, here’s my citation of six books for the skeptic’s side:
1.  Evidence Based Climate Science, Dr. Don Easterbrook
2.  The Hockey Stick Illusion, A. W. Montford
3.  Climategate, The CRUtape Letters, Steven Mosher and Thomas W. Fuller
4.  The Great Global Warming Blunder, Dr. Roy W. Spencer
5. The Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming, Patrick J.Michaels (Editor), Dr. Sallie L. Baliunas, Dr. Robert C. Balling Jr , Dr. Randall S. Cerveny, Dr. John Christy, Dr. Robert E. Davis, Dr. Oliver W. Frauenfeld, Dr. Ross McKitrick, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, Dr. Eric S. Posmentier, Dr. Willie Soon (Contributors)
6. Die Kalte Sonne, (The Cold Sun, Why the Climate Catastrophe is Not Taking Place) Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Luñing (In Press) For more on this one, read here
Focusing On An Unknown While Ignoring the Known.
The amount of the unknown on climate science is far greater than what is known, and thus impacts the known at every level. For example: although climate sensitivity, (the temperature rise due to CO2 doubling) has yet to be established, a number is used in all the general climate models. The IPCC “consensus” is that it is somewhere between 1.5°C to 4.5°C (IPCC, 2007, pp.798-799). Where do those numbers come from? They come from guesses by Michael Mann and Syukuro Manabe.
Here is the story (from Wikipedia):
The standard modern estimate of climate sensitivity – 3 °C, plus or minus 1.5 °C – originates with a committee on anthropogenic global warming convened in 1979 by the National Academy of Sciences and chaired by Jule Charney. Only two sets of models were available; one, due to Syukuro Manabe, exhibited a climate sensitivity of 2 °C, the other, due to James E. Hansen, exhibited a climate sensitivity of 4 °C. “According to Manabe, Charney chose 0.5 °C as a not-unreasonable margin of error, subtracted it from Manabe’s number, and added it to Hansen’s. Thus was born the 1.5 °C-to-4.5 °C range of likely climate sensitivity that has appeared in every greenhouse assessment since…”[16]
Many people have tried to develop more accurate estimates. The current range is anything from zero to 10°C, though the latter number is usually dismissed. As time goes by, the number seems to be dropping. Recent ice-age studies don’t change the old estimates by very much, but give a median value of 2.3°C. Even more recently, there have been efforts to calculate climate sensitivity from thermodynamic principals. Find the papers here, here, and here. These all suggest that the climate sensitivity is zero. Measurements from above the atmosphere all suggest that climate sensitivity is less than 0.6°C. See here, here, and here.
Specious Claims of Bad Science
In Dr. Brown’s paragraph here he cites no specific examples; this is a general childish name-calling type of attack. This list is offered as a rebuttal. Tom Nelson offers 250 examples of bad science, or scientists behaving badly, gleened from the Climategate 2 emails in the Team’s own words.
Creation of Front Groups
Both sides have created “front groups”. What is the IPCC, if not a “front group”? The Center for American Progress is a front group. This is a label intended to denigrate. For the figures on money spent by organizations on both sides see here. A summary is quoted:
Figure 1.1, I compare the spending of climate action opponents and advocates.  As the figure displays, the combined program spending of environmental organizations ($1.4 billion) is almost twice as much as the combined program spending of conservative organizations and industry associations ($787 million).  Specific to climate change and energy-related activities, environmental groups appear to have outspent conservative groups and their industry association allies $394 million to $259 million.”
Creation of Misleading Lists of Climate Sceptics [sic]

From Brown’s point of view, any skeptic will have questionable credentials. That’s part of the Team’s tactics to denigrate and marginalize any skeptic. There is a problem though. One of the better-known lists is the Oregon Petition. It currently has 31,487 signatories, over 9,000 of those with PhDs. Contrast this with the poll cited above with 75 anonymous positive poll responders. Also keep in mind that “The Team” has less than 50 people as core members. The Oregon Petition is simply too large to be dismissed. In the end, it only takes a single skeptic scientist.
PR Campaigns to Convince the Public There’s No Scientific Basis
Both sides have used PR firms. This is what you do when billions of dollars are at stake. The University of East Anglia used (and is still using) the BBC to convince the public of the opposite. What larger PR firm could they have used? It is very difficult for skeptics to match these large megaphones. That’s why so many are blogging.
Astroturf Groups
This is right out of the Nancy Pelosi playbook. I’m surprised he used the term. Notice that none are named. It is another dubious attempt to denigrate. His use of the terms “disinformation campaign” is also a handy term for denigration. Without investigation, anything written by a skeptic automatically gets labeled as disinformation, and any conversation between three or more skeptics will be labeled as an Astroturf Group. For Dr. Brown’s information, I am myself a group of one, funded by Social Security.
Cyber-Bullying Scientists and Journalists
Both of these groups have made themselves public figures. James Hansen, for just one example, delights in getting himself arrested on camera in front of the White House. Michael Mann regularly appears on TV talk-shows and news programs making claims that beg a response. When public scientists step outside of the peer-reviewed scientific literature, they are asking for trouble. When their public claims are demonstrably not true, they must be refuted. Here is a link to predictions made in the 1980’s by James Hansen.
Dr. Brown then gives skeptics some advice:
A few things we are not saying. We are not against skepticism in [sic] but skeptics must play by certain rules of science. That is skeptics should:
a) Publish conclusions in peer-reviewed literature.
b. Stop claiming that anything that is not fully proven is bad science.
c. Not lie about or overstate their scientific conclusions.
d. Not cherry-pick scientific evidence by focusing on what is not known while ignoring what is known.
e. Not repeat scientific arguments that have been fully refuted.
f. Publicly condemn cyber-bullying of journalists and scientists.”
For no. a, Dr. Brown may not realize that peer review has been tightly controlled by the Team. It has been difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get papers published in certain journals with conclusions that the Team does not approve, whether or not those conclusions are scientifically valid. Some discussion of the problem here, here, here, and here.
For no. b: “Stop claiming that anything not fully proven is bad science.” For it to be good science, define “fully”. As Einstein said, “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” The skeptic effort must be encouraged; the alternative is totalitarianism.
As for no. c, lies are easily detected. No skeptic knowingly lies. It is too easily found out. This statement is just another bogus denigration attempt.
No. d: “Not cherry-pick scientific evidence by focusing on what is not known…” This is a strange statement. All scientists focus on the unknown… and should. Only by focusing on the unknown can anything new be learned. New knowledge can overturn what we thought we knew. See Einstein, above.
No. e: “Not repeat scientific arguments that have been fully refuted.” See Einstein, above.
No. f: “Publicly condemn…” This cuts both ways. Stop condemning (cyber-bullying) skeptics. Also stop characterizing any critique of public statements by the Team as cyber-bullying. It all takes place in cyber-space as a matter of course. This is just another attempt to limit free-speech and discourse.
Calling this discourse an ethics problem is suspicious. I would ask Dr Brown to examine his own ethics in writing his piece. Who or what is he trying to protect? Both sides think they are saving the earth. Both sides have their extremists. Neither side has a lock on “the truth”.
Part of the problem is that the public loves a disaster, particularly the media, and the Team has played on that for political and funding reasons. If they are proved alarmist, the money dries up instantly.  Here is the first blog article this author wrote on the  subject. (Chicken Little was a Calamitologist.)

Call it a green embarassment of spectacular dimensions. Don’t expect national media coverage here.
Despite all the massive subsidies, incentives and bureaucratic favors, which were supposed to guarantee the venture’s long-term success, Fremont California-based solar cell manufacturer Solyndra still went bankrupt, read here.
Hat-tip: reader Freddie.
In May 2010 the plant was used by Obama in a photo-op to showcase the promised green prosperity that we were (and are still) supposed to openly embrace and expect for the future.
How many more Soviet-style grand failures of this scale are we going to need before policymakers wake up to this green mirage of prosperity?
Solyndra is bankrupt, and likely gone are its 1100 jobs and the hopes and dreams held by its workers and their families. According to the Swiss online bluewin.ch/:

Solyndra was a showcase for the government’s investment in environmentally friendly technologies. The company received more than half a billion dollars in state credit guarantees. Among others, President Obama, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Energy Secretary Steven Chu visited the plant.”
According to san francisco.cbslocal.com here/:
Solyndra said as a result of the suspension of operations, some 1,100 full-time and temporary employees were being laid off effective immediately.
Solyndra workers learned as they arrived at the office that the recently-completed Fremont factory where they worked would be closing immediately.”
I heard of this news from an obscure Swiss news outlet, and not a peep from the national MSM. The MSM we recall are too busy hyping up tropical storms into “monster hurricanes of the century” and propping up the climate change hoax, which in turn leads to mega-failures like Solyndra. So is the media today.
Meanwhile the US economy is falling apart and people are losing hope with every false promise politicians make. The green economy is total pie-in-the sky. Sadly 1100 employees and their families are finding this out the hard way.
======================================
UPDATE: Slowly some German MSM is getting around to revealing the news:
handelsblatt.com
FAZ (scroll down near bottom)

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German flagship national daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ)
has a piece on the hype surrounding hurricane Irene, which we recall was supposed to end up being the most super-charged hurricane to hit the Northeast US in a quarter century.
Hurricane hype blows back against the warmists. (NASA photo)
It ended up being a hurricane of hype, and nothing else. But the FAZ writes if Irene had been a mega-size hurricane, it would have been just what the doctor ordered for unlocking the climate politics gridlock in the USA.
There, interest in climate change has slid so deep into the basement that even ex-presidential candidate and climate protection activist Al Gore has to be really worried about the impact of his new campaign which will begin on September 14.”
For Al Gore, Irene could have served as the ideal climate wake-up call. He certainly would have seized the opportunity to exploit it in citing it as the latest example of climate catastrophe. Can you imagine his disappointment? Unfortunately for Gore and the warmists, Irene fizzled and is now ironically being used by skeptics to illustrate rampant climate hysteria and media hype instead. The FAZ writes:
Indeed the climate-political winds turned in the opposite direction. Instead of acting as a ‘harbinger of climate change’, as the New York Times had written on Saturday, the tropical storm worked massively against hurricane and climate science.
Half-assed, superfluous, and damaging – these are some attacks that scientists now find themselves having to deal with because, though they were correct with their time forecasts, they were nowhere near correct with the hurricane’s strength forecast.”
Here the FAZ doesn’t know that the forecasters were also incorrect with the projected route of the hurricane, as forecasters made huge adjustments with each route  forecast cone they issued. And by the time the hurricane made landfall it had degraded down to a mere Cat 1 hurricane, and shortly thereafter to a tropical storm. By this time, the entire US national weather and climate forecasting network and large parts of the media had become a laughing stock.
The alarmists are trying to argue back, sometimes with what appear to be quite dubious claims. Stefan Rahmstorf, citing Nature, claims that for every 1°C of temperature rise, there is a 31% increase in Cat 4 or 5 storms. The FAZ also brings up Kerry Emanuel:

At the Hurricane Conference, leading American expert Kerry Emanuel showed for the Atlantic that the correlation of sea temperature and hurricane energy has strengthened over the last five years.”
Really? Looking at the last fives years, one would have to assume the globe is cooling rapidly.
GLOBAL HURRICANE FREQUENCY
 
Source:  http://policlimate.com/tropical/index.html
What does expert Ryan N. Maue say about climate and hurricanes?
But, the overall trend is flat proving conclusively that there is NO “overall” global increase in hurricanes, minor or major. Since natural variability such as El Nino and La Nina is the primary driver of global hurricane variability, any discussion of “climate change” impacts on TCs is woefully incomplete without acknowledging the effects of ENSO on global TC activity.”
Politically, Irene has turned out to be the ideal storm – for the skeptics! Indeed attention has been drawn to where the alarmists least want it: facts and reality.

Anthony Watts also fills us in on that padded-room incident.

So this is as good a time as any to bring you the latest video of Marc Morano and his latest assessment of the global warming movement.
Some of the more notable quotes Morano makes:
…real world data are showing that the global warming alarm spread by Al Gore and the United Nations is in utter collapse…across the board what we thought we knew about climate just 4 or 5 years ago is now in utter collapse – we call it sub-prime science…UN scientists were trying to act as gatekeepers of peer review, they were trying to shut out people like Roy Spencer…peer review is still a corrupted process…It’s always been a political movement…akin to Nostradamus…”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDogmatism is a dangerous thing – especially when dealing with economics and when it attempts to dictate markets. Some examples follow below.
1.) EU climate policy leads to more CO2 emissions
German blog Oekowatch writes about a press release from the German Association of Energy and Power Economics (VIK), which concludes that ever stricter EU climate policies cause economic damage to Europe while resulting in increased CO2 emission.
The press release states that many studies conducted do not take an honest look at the CO2 picture. Shifting CO2-intensive industries away from Europe does not lead to a rescue of the climate, but winds up resulting in even more CO2 getting produced overseas instead. Here’s an example:
And so German CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2010 actually dropped 13%; but when CO2 emissions that are involved in the imported products are taken into account, the picture changes. Then the total net CO2 output rises by 23%. The picture is similar in other EU countries.”
The press release offered some stern advice for our action-hero climate-rescuing politicians in the EU:
The politicians in the EU really have to wake up and recognise that the unilateral leading position in climate position is producing completely false results.”
The press release summarises that EU draconian climate policy harms everything – environment, economics, and the basis for future generations:
The current climate policy in the EU and also in Germany harms the the environment and the people in Germany /EU. The EU cannot rescue the world’s climate alone. ‘It is also part of generational justice to not deny our children and grandchildren a functioning economic basis.’ says Dr. Annette Loske, General Managing Director of the VIK.”
2.) Biofuel deforestation, slavery, and hunger
Another brilliant example of how master plans to hypothetically rescue the planet turn into real death and destruction is described by warmist site Klimaretter here. Ethanol production from sugar cane  in Brazil has gotten so out of hand that it is leading to massive deforestation, slavery, inhumane work conditions, less production of food crops, and widespread hunger. Reuters warned  recently:
Surging global prices of basic foodstuffs raise the risk that the food crisis of 2007-2008 in developing countries will be repeated, the head of the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Monday.
And adds:
The FAO has asked developed countries to re-examine their biofuels strategies — which include large subsidies — since these have diverted 120 million tonnes of cereals away from human consumption to convert them to fuels.

//-->




Developed countries give $13 billion in annual subsidies and protection to encourage biofuels production, Diouf said. In the United States, corn stocks have dipped to near 15-year lows as more of the crop is used for making ethanol.”
3.)  200,000 deaths per year and more misery
Benny Peiser’s Global Warming Policy Foundation website here has a story on how U.S. and European policy to increase production of ethanol and other biofuels has added to global death and disease.
Research by the World Bank indicates that the increase in biofuels production over 2004 levels would push more than 35 million additional people into absolute poverty in 2010 in developing countries. Using statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Indur Goklany estimates that this would lead to at least 192,000 excess deaths per year, plus disease resulting in the loss of 6.7 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per year.”
4.)  500,000 kids going blind annually – because of green dogmatism.
Finally, we all remember how the activist banning of DDT led to the deaths of millions. Another example of how blind and dogmatic thinking leads to disaster is the ban of golden rice. EIKE features this video where Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore explains the disaster of Golden Rice (starting at the 2:05 mark):

Half a million kids go blind every year in the rice-eating countries because of vitamin A deficiency. Golden rice, which Ingo Potrykus invented 12 years ago, could cure this overnight, and yet the activists have prevented it from being planted in Asia and Africa.”
Read more here about golden rice: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice.
Clearly the people who are suffering the most from climate and green schemes are the poor in Africa, Asia and South America. These dogmatic policies are all concocted by folks in Europe and North America with the intent to preserve the planet – poor people be damned. Call it eco-colonialism.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf an “expert” sits down for an interview with a leading media outlet, he should at least know what he’s talking about.
Unfortunately this was hardly the case for Georg Feulner of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Eicke Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany, both giving recent interviews with leading German media outlets in an attempt to respond to Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s controversial book.
And both interviews ended with the scientists looking as if they lacked knowledge on climate change and the latest research.
In Feulner’s case, Lüning and Vahrenholt shred his claims in a report posted at WUWT, read here.
As far as Eicke Weber of the Fraunhofer Institute is concerned, in his interview here in Welt am Sonntag, he did himself no favors. The statements he made only revealed his knowledge has stunning deficiencies on the subject of climate science.
 ************************************************
The following is by Dr. Sebastian Lüning, which I translated from the German – some editing for clarity. (Original German here)
Weber confuses the Milankovitch cycles with the primary solar cycles
Already at the very start, Weber confuses the Milankovitch cycles with the primary solar activity oscillations. To put it simply: While the arguments of our book “Die kalte Sonne” focus mainly on the primary energy output from the sun, Weber in the interview speaks of changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters! These parameters lead to changes in the amount of energy reaching the Earth because of geometric reasons (see page 80-82). These so-called “Milankovitch” cycles are measured in time periods of tens of thousands of years, and so play no real role in today’s decadal-scale climate change.

Weber believes CO2 led temperature during the ice age / interglacial transitions
Weber commits another classic error – probably leftover damage from Al-Gore’s Film “An Inconvenient Truth”. Weber attempts to put the blame on atmospheric CO2 for the transitions between ice ages and interglacials. This falsehood has already been chalked up by Al Gore, and is one of the reasons why a British High Court forbade the AIT film to be shown in classrooms uncommented. If Weber had read our book on pages 129-131, then he would have learned of the correct correlation between the two. High resolution investigations of the last 600,000 years show that the temperature first increased, and then CO2 followed with a lag of 800 years. The CO2 increase was obviously caused by the temperature increase, and not vice versa.

Observe the last interglacial 130,000 to 110,000 years ago. Temperature plummeted even as CO2 stayed at about 260 ppm.
Weber believes in the 10,000-year hockey stick!
Contrary to what was suggested in the interview by solar energy expert Weber, during the Holocene (the last 10.000 years, since the last ice age) the climate was in no way stable. Here the ominous Hockey Stick was doing its magic. The fact, however, is that the climate was neither stable during the last 1000 years nor the last 10,000 years (see book p. 68-75). The climate was characterised by millenium cycles, where temperatures were for the most part in sync with solar activity. It is only by hiding these facts and correlations that climate science has succeeded in marginalizing the sun as a factor in the climate equations over the years. The models cannot in any way reproduce the climate of the last 10,00o years.
Weber simply dismisses all other climate factors
Then came Weber’s decisive statement in his interview: “To me it’s moot to discuss how the 0.75° Celsius increase observed over the last 50 years has come about when we see the record levels that CO2 concentrations have reached.” Eicke Weber obviously does not care about the individual natural and anthropogenic climate factors in the current climate development. This is a bit astonishing as it is precisely this knowledge that is important for making climate models and determining how temperature will develop in the coming decades.  For the Fraunhofer Director, it suffices to know that CO2 has reached a historical record level.
Here’s a short fact-check: Just how high is the current atmospheric CO2 concentration? Currently it is 0.039 percent. Over the greater part of the Earth’s history, CO2-concentration was significantly above that. This somewhat diminishes Weber’s use of the term “historical record high”. Here Weber suppresses the fact that the real climate discussion revolves around what is the correct value of the CO2 climate sensitivity (see book p. 220-225). CO2 by itself can produce a warming of only 1.1°C for each doubling. But the IPCC given values of up to 4.5°C, based on the poorly understood amplification effect of water vapour and clouds.
A normal reader of the interview most likely will not even notice Eicke Weber’s stunningly weak knowledge. But trust in our academic elite will however, be damaged for a long time to come.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to reviews of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s controversial best-selling Die kalte Sonne book, now sweeping across Germany, Dr. Peter Heller, think tank member and contributor at the German Science Skeptical blog, has published what up to now has been one of the most thoughtful and insightful essays – a welcome change from all the shallow and emotional reviews we’ve seen from the knee-jerk warmists.
One of Heller’s main points is that anyone claiming climate can be predicted and is now solely “created” by man is as scientific as the theory of finger-snap-and-behold creationism. The following is an excerpt translated from Heller’s essay (emphasis added).
Vahrenholt and Lüning do not assume the role of scientists, but that of science journalists. The demand to present the book’s assertions in an appropriate form using the appropriate tool (such as publication in a suitable journal) for scientific internal debate just proves once again the totalitarian demand of the climate creationists. Not only are they blind with respect to the already acquired findings that contradict their world view, but they are also no longer able to distinguish between a scientific activity, and the reporting of that activity.
Vahrenholt und Lüning led me to the term “climate creationist“. In the same way their book helps to put energy policy back on the track of rationality, it could also promote the return of reason in climate debate. In my view their main message is: We do not know what the future has in store for us. […] Somehow this simple knowledge has become lost in our society over the past decades.
Vahrenholt und Lüning deserve credit for thrusting the indefiniteness of our climatic future back into the public consciousness. They show us how natural factors could counter an anthropogenic warming.

Whoever refuses to permit such thoughts is acting unscientifically and against the pursuit of truth. And whoever opts to ignore these ideas, or even fights to create an environment that does not allow them to be even expressed, is also guilty of the same – just as someone who through religious fundamentalism is convinced of the creation of the world by a Creator, an Intelligent Designer. The theory of evolution describes the principles to which the development of life on Earth are subject. It neither provides a basis for the existence of mankind itself, nor for any other specific life form, nor does it provide any prognosis for the future. In fact it only tells us that random coincidences mutually interact. It’s completely open as what comes out as a product.
Where the conventional creationist sees a (supernatural) creator and designer behind the living environment, the climate creationist views man as the sole creator of the (future) climate. Die kalte Sonne holds up a mirror and shows us how they have meandered far away from science.
Particularly very important to observe is what Vahrenholt and Lüning only mention between the lines. Namely the question of to what extent does a possible warming of the lower layers of the atmosphere have whatsoever on man. Here the climate creationists see a huge danger and thus completely ignore possible adaptation strategies by human societies – completely in contradiction to the experiences of the last thousands of years.”
Neglecting strategies for adaptation is one way of creating your own eventual premature downfall. Unfortunately we are dealing with climate fundamentalists, zealots, and not scientists.
Anyone who knows the German language is urged to read Heller’s essay at Science Skeptical.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSkeptic book by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning “Die kalte Sonne” (see side bar) will begin its third week on the Spiegel bestseller list since it was first released on February 7.

 
It shot up to number 14 on the bestseller list for German hardcover non-fiction books just a week after it was released. Last week it was at number 15, and next week it will be at the 18th spot.
Die kalte Sonne also remains No. 1 on the Hoffmann & Campe list. Publisher Hoffmann & Campe, based in Hamburg, are now is discussions with publishers for an English version. I’m also informed that a second printing of the German version is now underway.
Die kalte Sonne is also No. 1 on the German Amazon list for books on environment and natural science.
The book’s success has unleased a wave of outrage among climate alarmists and activists. But most of the criticism has been emotionally charged, from people who did not even bother to read the book. German readers click here.

As  the skeptic book sweeps across Central Europe, its launch was accompanied by a nasty cold snap over the first half of February. The online Swiss magazine Blick writes:
February 2012 is among the 10 coldest February months since measurements began 150 years ago. The cold wave in the first half of the month was the most intensive in 27 years, MeteoSchweiz reported on Tuesday.”
The German Weather Service (DWD) reported that Germany had its coldest February in 26 years, saying that…
…at times February, 2012 could be compared to the harsh winters of 1963, 1956 or 1929.”
The cold snap was particularly harsh across Eastern Europe, with hundreds of people dying of the cold. According to the online Russian Ria Novosti:
The worst cold in Russia’s south for the past twenty-five years caused a disaster for the country’s vineyards, which is comparable to the damage inflicted by the anti-alcohol campaign initiated by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Argumenty Nedeli weekly newspaper reported on Wednesday. The temperatures, which plunged to minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in February, destroyed over a half the vineyards on the Taman Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi at WeatherBell here brings us two short reports that show cooling is in, and warming’s out. Bad news for Rob Honeycutt and the warmists who bet on a warmer second 21st century decade.
The cold of global warming. (Photo: NOAA)
2011 third coldest year of the decade.
First 2011 happens to have been the third coldest year in the last decade, according to satellite measurements and John Christy of the University of Alabama.
Globally averaged, Earth’s atmosphere was 0.15 C (0.27 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the 30-year average in 2011; That was less than half of the warming anomaly seen in 2010.”
USA was a full degree cooler than in 1999!
With constant nail-biting over warming, the media are obviously disconnected from reality, as data from the NOAA show that 2011 was cooler than 1999 and cooler than some of the years in the 1980s. Bastardi writes:
Despite claims that it continues to get warmer and warmer, this table from NOAA/NCDC indicates that 2011 was in the middle of the pack, going all the way back to 1980 (the start of the “global warming era”). Such remote years as 1981, 1986, 1987, and 1990 were hotter.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German-based European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) reports here on a paper just published by German scientists Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and Rainer Link appearing in the IJMPC Journal (International Journal of Modern Physics C), see here.
The full paper is available as a pdf file here in English.
The authors claim that CO2 does have a modest warming effect on the global temperature, but:
The effect is harmless (to the contrary, CO2-increases and slight global warming are beneficial for man and thus desirable) and show that the overly alarmist prognoses for future climate developments as fully inappropriate.”
The two authors applied a simplified model to determine a climate sensitivity for mean global warming for a hypothetical doubling of CO2 concentration to be 1.1 °C based on radiative flux without feedback effects.
The conclusion states (emphasis added):
This paper demonstrates that a basic 1-dimensional 1-layer model with different atmospheric and top of atmosphere long wave radiation fluxes and temperatures, and including the reflections of the long wave radiation at the surface of the Earth and atmosphere can reproduce with excellent agreement the observed global average surface temperatures and radiation fluxes. This requires that all emission and absorption processes are correctly introduced into the model. In particular the direct emission of long wave radiation from Earth to space and the temperature dependence of latent and sensible heat have to be taken into account. Our model yields a change in the surface temperature of the Earth of roughly 1.1°C for an additional radiative forcing of 3.7 W/m2 – caused for instance by a hypothetical doubling of the present CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is in good agreement with the appropriate IPCC value, if no feedback ampli cation (or attenuation) is considered.”
Debate papers welcome
Readers are encouraged to join the discussion at the EIKE website linked above. Comments in English are welcome as well. Anyone who believes to have good physical critical points to introduce against the publication and is prepared to join the IJMPC peer-review process is warmly welcome to present a debate paper to the IJMPC.
Sounds like just the thing for the publisher of the site Science Of Doom.

A reader who goes by the name of “renewable guy” and I had a recent exchange on the credibility of James Hansen and his crew at GISS a short time ago.  He gave me the following list of 9 observations to support Hansen and GISS:
1. “Observations show that the planet is changing in accordance with global warming theory.”
It is nice to see someone admit it is a theory rather than “settled science.”
2. “The evidence for global warming is being meticulously accumulated by scientists all over the world. This evidence includes the independent observations that paint a consistent picture of global warming. Our planet is suffering an energy imbalance and is steadily accumulating heat (Hansen 2005, Murphy 2009, von Schuckmann 2009, Trenberth 2009)”
Not quite. See here. All the papers in the list above depend on models. When actual data is used no heat accumulation is seen. For sea surface temperature changes see: read here.
3. “The height of the tropopause is increasing (Santer 2003, press release).”
Two related papers, the first one refutes Santer: read here and here. Figure 9 of the second paper by Hoinka shows no long term trend of tropopause height over the period 1979 thru 1993. There is however, great year to year variability.
4. “Jet streams are moving poleward (Archer 2008, Seidel 2007, Fu 2006).”
Not anymore. The ozone hole closing is counter-acting the warming affect. But this study is still using models, read here. The models depend on the temperature increasing. What if the temperature doesn’t follow the rules? And it has not over the last decade plus.
5. “The tropical belt is widening (Seidel 2007, Fu 2006).”
Same as above; two sides of the same coin. If the jets move poleward, the tropical zone gets wider.

6. “There is an increasing trend in record hot days versus record cold temperatures with currently twice as many record hot days than record cold temperatures (Meehle 2009, see press release).”
Have you heard of UHI? Here is an excellent compendium of the problem. Even NOAA knows the truth about that, and has known it for over 20 years, read here. There is also the increased reporting phenomenon; blame the Internet. This, and satellites, are responsible for much of the recent extreme weather reporting. NASA also knows.
7. “A shift towards earlier seasons (Stine 2009).”
I found this paper change was 1.7 days over 50 years. There are cyclic changes in temperature. The beginning year in this study was 1954, a relatively cool year for the twentieth century. If the study had begun 20 years earlier, the change would have been smaller, see here. The earth has been slowly warming since the end of the Little Ice Age. Seasons were much longer during the Medieval Warm Period, when grapes were cultivated in Scotland, as they can be cultivated now (with proper care, it’s still not as warm as southern England). In the last two thousand years, there have been two other periods when the growing season in northern Europe was as long as now: the Roman Warm Period, and the Medieval Warm Period. The cycle is now turning colder and will repeat learn about it here.
8. “Cooling and contraction of the upper atmosphere consistent with predicted effects of increasing greenhouse gases (Lastovicka 2008).”
Not quite, the sun has a much larger effect: read and learn something here.
9. “Lake warming (Schneider & Hook 2010).”
Sure, since 1985. Look again in another 25 years. All the above points have the same problem. If you look at a particular section of data, or a model, for just a few years, trends can be seen that disappear over a longer time interval. The sun and long ocean cycles last from 70 to several hundred years. Making judgements over shorter intervals is foolish.
Models have problems such as lack of spatial and time resolution, and assumptions that may or may not correspond to how nature actually works. Due to the complexity of the actual climate system, even a tiny piece of garbage in the input to a climate model will quickly make the output all garbage. If one knows anything about Chaos Theory, one will doubt any present or even future climate model.
The sun, ocean cycles, recovery from the little ice age, and urban heat island effects, account for all but about 0.2 to 0.3 degrees C of the recent warming. Climate sensitivity to CO2 is about 0.5 to 0.6 degrees C for CO2 doubling.

This is a follow-up article on GHCN and GISS changes to the temperature records for Reykjavik, Iceland.

Figure 1: Reykjavik, Iceland: Photo from Christian Bickel 
We now know that GHCN has changed data set versions from version 2 to version 3. Each of those versions has a history. Version 2 was made up by combining records from closely related stations, then “homogenizing” the combination to produce a data “product.” Version 3 presumably started from the Version 2 data set with revisions prompted by additional data. That presumption may not be correct.
As a first step, all the data from the Version 2 database were downloaded from GISS. There were four sets of station data, covering various years, but only one set that covered the period from 1901 to 1948. These are all plotted together in Figure 2, along with the combined dataset, and the “homogenized” result.

Figure 2: This is all the Reykjavik Version 2 data.
Three of the original data sets lie atop each other for the period from 1949 to the present. One set (the 4th one) is slightly warmer (!) in the years from 1982 to the present, and was ignored. However the homogenized data differs from the original data by a large amount early in the record, tapering down to no difference in the present, warming the past. Figure 3 is that difference.

Figure 3: This is the Version 2 homogenized data minus the Version 2 Combined data.
Each of those distinct steps in Figure 3 is exactly six years long. This arbitrary pattern cannot be anything but deliberate. It cannot be based on site changes, equipment changes, or any other factor that might change the real temperature. This is artificial.
The Iceland Meteorological Office has not moved since being built at this location in 1920. There may have been instrument changes, but no position changes.
GHCN describes their homogenization process:
Many surface weather stations undergo minor relocations through their history of observation. Stations may also be subject to changes in instrumentation as measurement technology evolves. Further, the land use/land cover in the vicinity of an observing site may also change with time. Such modifications to an observing site have the potential to alter a thermometer’s microclimate exposure characteristics and/or change the bias of measurements, the impact of which can be a systematic shift in the mean level of temperature readings that is unrelated to true climate variations. The process of removing such “non-climatic” artifacts in a climate time series is called homogenization.”
But Version 2 has been abandoned. We now have version 3. Figure 5 is a plot of both original and homogenized versions of both Version 2 and Version 3.

Figure 5: This is a plot of “original” and “homogenized” datasets for both Version 2 and Version 3.

Note that in Figure 5, from 1901 to about 1970, there is little agreement between the four datasets. Figure 6 is the difference between Version 2 after combining, and Version 3. (SCAR is not a factor in this data. SCAR is the acronym for Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. No Antarctic data was harmed in the production of Reykjavik data).

Figure 6: This is the difference between Reykjavik Version 3 and Version 2 after combining the data from 4 datasets.
It is not clear why these differences exist. Prior to 1946, there were no nearby stations to compare. The Keflavik airport station did not produce data until 1949, and then the temperatures there agree very well with the original data from the downtown stations. The variances are within a few 100ths of a degree. The warm years around 1940 are wiped out in Version 3. But the changes don’t end there.

Figure 7. This is the difference between Version 3 before and Version 3 after GISS homogenization.
In Figure 7 we see the arbitrary and regular stair-steps again. But note that the steps are different from the steps in Figure 3, and they are in addition to the changes by GHCN seen in Figure 6. These changes put back some (but not all) of the cooling that was arbitrarily introduced in Figure 6. The final result is the product of two homogenizing
processes, the first by GHCN, and the second by GISS. The result of all this is the graph that Paul Homewood produced (below) and the blue and bold-red traces in Figure 5.
The GHCN Version 3 data was supposed to be superior to version 2, filling data gaps, etc. If this is so, then why does Version 3 have gaps where Version 2 does not? Version 3 has gaps for 1926, 1946, 1966, and 2008 – 2009. The original data (Version 2 raw) does not have these gaps.

Figure 8: This is from Paul Homewood’s article How GISS has totally Corrupted Reykjavik’s Temperature, used by permission.
There have been many changes like this to the temperature records. Here is a list of stations that have had arbitrary stair-step or other changes, and the links to articles that describe them:
Darwin, Australia, here, by Willis Eschenbach.
Central Park, New York City, here, by E. M. Smith, the Chiefio.
Prague, Czech Republic, here, and here, by John O. Sullivan.
Russia, (scroll to the bottom for the article) here, RIA/NOVOSTI.
Matanuska Valley, Alaska, here, Willis Eschenbach.
Ostrov Dixon, Ostrov Kotel, Russia; Barrow, Alaska, and others, here, Ed Caryl
Many of those in the above list were changes imposed in version 2. We should revisit those stations using version 3 data. So many stations, so little time…

Share this...FacebookTwitterChanging the Arctic Climate
 By Ed Caryl
GISS and the GHCN are preoccupied with the Arctic, bestowing large “corrections” on the few and far northern stations. The raw data of the Arctic did not tell the story they wanted to hear, and so GISS took it upon themselves to rewrite it.
Let’s start with Figure 1 from Paul Homewood’s article How GISS has totally Corrupted Reykjavik’s Temperature, used by permission.

Figure 1: Corrupted Reykjavik’s temperature
In January of this year, Paul Homewood of Not A Lot of People Know That, wrote an article describing GHCN and GISS changes to the temperature data that resulted in early 20th century cooling in Reykjavik, Iceland. Because I had stored many annual temperature records for Arctic stations in preparing A Light In Siberia in September of 2010, this prompted an investigation into whether GHCN and GISS had pulled the same on other station data. The short answer…yes they had!
Last year in May, GHCN did a major revision of their historical temperature database. They changed the title of the database to GHCN-M version 3. GISS followed. They refer to the new data as GHCN_v3. The important thing to note is that GHCN_v3 already contains homogeneity “corrections” so there is in most cases now, no difference between
GISS “raw” data (after removing suspicious records), and “after GISS homogeneity adjustments.” As a result, we only get to see temperature data that has already been modified by the hand of man (or a computer under the direction of a man).
What has this done to temperatures? You get one guess.

Figure 2. This is a GHCN comparison of database version 2 and version 3. Land and Ocean Temperatures for January. Source: NOAA/GHCN here.
The chart is subtle in that the scale is chosen to hide the slope and amount of the change trend. But look closely. Note that the change trend is from cooler in the past to warmer in the present, even though the temperature trend is already in that direction. They just added another ~0.1°C to the century trend.
What did they do in the Arctic? Above the Arctic Circle, there are few weather stations.

Figure 3. This is the last ten years temperature trend. From GISS.
The red Arctic grids on the anomaly maps represent ten stations, most in Arctic Russia. It is a bit difficult to sort out specifically which stations these are. Eleven stations in or close to these locations were investigated. Many have quite large “corrections.” Ostrov Dixon is the red grid square on the left on the north coast of Russia. Barrow is the orange grid square at the top of Alaska. Figure 4 is the first example.

Figure 4. This is the temperature change and change amounts to the Ostrov Dixon (Dickson Island) station.
The mainstream climate scientists have always disliked the warming in the 1920’s, 30’s, and 40’s, and the cooling in the 1960’s and 70’s. At several locations in the Arctic they have sought to “correct” these years.

Figure 5. Ostrov Kotel (Kettle Island)

At Ostrov Kotel they simply warmed the whole series from just before 1950 to 1995 With obvious steps at each end of the change. At Barrow, (Figure 6) the change was a series of ramps. This makes little sense at Barrow. For all its history the measuring site has been at the airport. Barrow has a well-documented heat island, but the correction is in the wrong direction for that. Again, the correction takes away most of the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s cooling.

Figure 6. This is the temperature change at Barrow.
At most locations they were not so obvious. For 11 locations that seem to be the heart of the warm grids, here are the plots.

Figure 7. The GHCN/GISS corrections at 11 Arctic locations.
It is very difficult to see a pattern in Figure 7. Some stations have a wild pattern of corrections of several degrees. Some have just a few spikes here and there. Some have a definite pattern.

Figure 8. This is the average “correction” of all the stations in Figure 7 with a linear trend line.
Figure 8 shows the pattern: cooling of the distant past, and warming of the inconvenient 60’s and 70’s.
Figure 9 below shows the average anomaly for those 11 stations:

Figure 9. This is the average anomaly for the 11 stations before and after GHCN “corrections”, with trend lines.
In Figure 9, the “corrections” have doubled the warming trend from 0.7°C per century to 1.4°C per century. The pesky warming in the 20’s and 30’s, and the cooling of the 60’s and 70’s are now nearly on the same level, almost wiping out that inconvenient AMO cycle.
I had data from a dozen other Arctic and Northern Siberian stations from last year. Most of those had just a few minor changes. Here (Figure 10) is the average correction for all 23 stations. As one gets further from the extreme Arctic, the changes begin to average out. If all stations around the globe are included, the average becomes that slow warming “correction” seen in Figure 2.

Figure 10. This is the average of 23 Arctic stations.
GHCN seems preoccupied with the Arctic, bestowing large “corrections” on the few far northern stations. This is in line with the “climate scientists” belief system:

The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe.
Ocean cycles have little effect on the climate.
The present decade is the warmest.
CO2 rules.

This confirmation bias gets reflected in every evaluation step when reviewing temperature records. The result is that each new data release further confirms what they look for. Can we trust the GHCN and GISS temperature data? You be the judge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a great story at the English Der Spiegel that you’ll never, ever see or hear from the other drugged-up-on-green German media. It’s about how the drugged-up-on-green government assures failure – this one with potentially catastrophic proportions for Germany. Let it be a lesson for other countries.
Read about the entire bloody mess at:Germany’s Wind Power Revolution in the Doldrums.
Is Germany's renewable energy supply on the verge causing the entire system to crash and burn?
With its nuclear power reactors in the process of being shut down by government decree (done in a hysterical state of mind in the wake of Fukushima), Germany now needs to find an alternative supply for electricity, and real soon. The answer was to build huge offshore wind parks in the windy North Sea, for example like the one now being completed by energy giant RWE. However,
…when work is completed on the Nordsee Ost wind farm, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the island of Helgoland in the North Sea, the sea air will be filled with a strong smell of fumes: diesel fumes. The reason is as simple as it is surprising. The wind farm operator, German utility RWE, has to keep the sensitive equipment — the drives, hubs and rotor blades — in constant motion, and for now that requires diesel-powered generators. Because although the wind farm will soon be ready to generate electricity, it won’t be able to start doing so because of a lack of infrastructure to transport the electricity to the mainland and feed it into the grid. The necessary connections and cabling won’t be ready on time and the delay could last up to a year.”
In other words, before Germany can launch itself into the renewable energy era Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen so frequently hails, the country must first burn massive amounts of fossil fuels out in the middle of the North Sea — a paradox as the country embarks on its energy revolution.”
Read more at: Germany’s Wind Power Revolution in the Doldrums.
Wonderful government management: Multi-billion euro windparks are going to just sit there and literally make the wind blow. It gets worse, read on. Other quotes:
So far 86 applications have been submitted for North Sea wind farms, though just 24 have been approved — and only four are in operation.”
RWE’s managers warn that even the more modest target for 2020 could be “missed by miles.”

Because of the weather conditions, engineers could only carry out much of the work between May and September.”
Without a grid to plug into, the turbines can’t deliver any electricity to the mainland. And without the sale of “green” power, the multi billion-euro wind farms won’t be generating revenues any time soon.”
RWE alone could lose more than a hundred million euros.”
…private investors now have doubts once more.”
The delays on the high seas are a bitter blow for the German government’s…”
Got to feel bad for the energy power companies – ordered by politicians to do the virtually impossible.
Germany’s power system was once tops in the world. Now that the government elephant has been allowed to run wild through the china shop, the risk of a complete collapse is real.
Anyone for Desertec?

If there’s a growing consensus about anything, it is that the man-made climate catastrophe is not going to happen, and that the scientists who believe to the contrary are becoming an ever increasingly obscure, fringe minority. Call them the natural-cause denialists.
Maybe many scientists are starting to feel that blaming everything on CO2 and neglecting the powerful sun, oceans and soot, among other factors, was a pretty stupid thing to do after all.
So it should not be a surprise that 2 more leading warmist German climate scientists Prof. Mojib Latif of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences and Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology have come out and conceded in newspaper interviews in the recent days that natural factors do have significant impacts on climate.
Latif says that half of the 0.8°C of global warming we’ve seen since 1850 is due to natural causes. Marotzke says that ocean cycles stopped the warming over the last 12 years.
At the “Die kälte Sonne” website, which was set up to counter false attacks on the book’s science, authors Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt direct our attention to the story and write as follows (reproduced with permission):
In an interview on February 9, 2012, with the Austrian daily Die Presse, renowned climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif confirmed 2 fundamental assumptions made in the book “Die kalte Sonne”. Latif thus openly agrees with the view of authors Vahrenholt and Lüning that natural climate factors are responsible for about half of the 0.8°C of warming since the start of industrialization in 1850. A similar 50/50 ratio of anthropogenic vs natural climate drivers is also assumed by Professor Nicola Scafetta of Duke University in North Carolina (see page 135 in the book) as well as by physicist Prof. Nir Shaviv of Jerusalem (see page 86) in their models.

Here Latif is clearly positioning himself in contradiction to the claims made by the IPCC, which pegged the natural climate factors as having an influence of only single digit percentages. The all important magnitude of the so-called radiative forcings are for CO2 (1.66 W/m²) and the sun (0.12 W/m²), and are thus worlds apart.
Moreover, Latif confirmed in the interview that the stop in global warming over the last 12 years was caused by ocean cycles. Authors Vahrenholt and Lüning have the very same opinion in their book. Anything else would be surprising as the book itself is in part based on Latif’s work. Interestingly, even climate scientist Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Plank Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg said in an interview yesterday with the TAZ daily that ocean cycles were the main reason for the stopped global warming since the year 2000. Thus the darling aerosol joker used by the IPCC is stripped of it’s importance.
Now that the first knee-jerk reactions to the book within the German climate science community are just about behind us, a real detailed look at the scientific content of the book “Die kalte Sonne” is beginning. Here it will hopefully become rapidly clear that the book offers a realistic interpretation that is supported by the results of numerous peer-reviewed scientific papers.”
Very profound admissions. So natural factors sun and oceans are real factors – aerosols are stripped of their importance. Conclusion: CO2 is disappearing as a major climate factor with every passing day – making the IPCC models obselete!
It needs to be pointed out that Jochem Marotzke less than 5 years ago warned: “There’s not much time remaining!” Now today he says the ocean cycles (unexpectedly) have given us 12 extra years, thus conceding they indeed do have major impacts on the climate after all. Yes, he seems to be learning something.
And simple logic tells us that if these ocean cycles have had an impact over the last 12 years, then it must also be conceded that the negative phases of the PDO and AMO will also continue to have an impact in the decades ahead. Anything else is just not serious.
Of course Latif and Marotzke may try to deny or underplay their latest admissions, which they probably do not even realise they have made. But their words are on the record for everybody to see. Read them yourselves!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA Brazilian team of scientists led by Pabulo Henrique Rampelotto recently published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestrial Physics a paper on precipitation and temperature patterns in Santa Maria in Southern Brazil.
It’s the sun! What follows are excerpts from “Die kalte Sonne“ website.

Brazilian agriculture and climate. Public domain by its author, João Felipe C.S. (via Wikipedia).
The scientists carried out a frequency analysis of two data sets for the time period of 1912 until 2008. They especially checked for natural control factors such as solar activity fluctuations and internal ocean cycles like ENSO.
And what did they find?
You guessed it! Natural factors are driving the trends in Southern Brazil. Die kalte Sonne site writes that the temperature and precipitation developments are characterized by a series of natural cycles. Both data sets show similar cycle lengths. Die kalte Sonne site writes:

Rampelotto and his team found in addition to some short periods of between 2 and 8 years also characteristic cycle lengths of close to 11 years, 22 years and 64-83 years, which correspond to the solar periods of the Schwabe, Hale and Gleissberg cycles (see p. 51 in “Die kalte Sonne”). The results also showed that the 22-year Hale cycle was more pronounced in the datasets than the 11-year Schwabe cycle.  This is an important indicator that shows solar magnetic field and cosmic rays play an important role in climatic processes, i.e. evidence of the Svensmark solar amplifier (see p. 231 in “Die kalte Sonne”).
A polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field takes place every 11 years (Schwabe Cycle), thus resulting in that the original configuration is reached after 22 years (Hale Cycle). The polarity of the magnetic field only plays a role for the electrically charged rays, but not for the radiation fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by the magnetic field. If the solar magnetic field and cosmic rays did not play a role on the Earth’s climate, then the pronounced 22-year Hale cycle would be without explanation.
Another important factor of influence for temperature and precipitation amounts in Southern Brazil is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During El Nino periods, precipitation in the region increases.
The study shows that both solar activity fluctuations and internal oceanic cycles played crucial roles on Southern Brazilian climate during the last 100 years and continue to play a role today. The relative share of these two factors on climate fluctuations is difficult to estimate because their corresponding contributions can vary as to geographic location and altitude above sea level at the particular areas. Here, there can also be non-linear effects, which need to be researched further according to Rampelotto and his colleagues.
A lack of correlation between solar activity and climate development during any particular phase is no reason to doubt the fundamental effectivity of the process. Rather it also may be due to the interactions and overlapping with other climate factors such as internal oceanic oscillations. Such a climate-factor combination of sun and PDO must also be assumed for the global temperature development of the last 70 years (see p. 116-120 in “Die kalte Sonne”).”
More than a dozen solar papers recently!
This of course is the most recent of a spate of studies showing the sun (without which there would not be a climate) plays the lead role in climate change. Also see here, here, here, here, here, here here, here, here and here, to name a few.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot much really going on today so just a couple of interesting items.
First, don’t let anyone tell you that renewable energy is not a hot growth sector – at least that’s what Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine Westphalia, would like you to believe. What follows is yet another example of tricks used by climate scientists, media, governments and green proponents. We’ve seen this kind of slithery behaviour time and again before.
Hat-tip: Science Skeptical blog.
The government of North Rhine Westphalia has a graphic to show you. In the chart that follows, the horizontal curve shows the consumption of primary energy in the state. The hockey stick shape curve shows the consumption of renewable energy in the supposedly fast-becoming green state of North Rhine Westphalia.

Holy moly you might think at first glance – renewable energy is the business to get in on! Look – it has actually surpassed the consumption of old, dirty primary energy.
But take a closer look at the vertical scales. The left hand vertical axis is the scale for the consumption of primary energy, while the right hand axis is the scale for renewable energy consumption. It just happens that the left scale is about 25 times bigger than the right one.

While the graphic is not telling a lie, it certainly is misleading and manipulative. The author used a clever “trick” to hide the disproportion. What happens if both variables use the same scale? Here’s what the real story looks like.

Yawn. Suddenly one sees that reality is much less dramatic. Of course the first graphic is intentionally presented in a misleading way in order to manipulate general audiences.
Next item: Green Party leader begs Germans to fly to Tunisia.
Dirk Maxeiner here brings our attention to German Green Party Chief Claudia Roth’s plead that Germans fly to Tunisia for their summer holidays. Maxeiner’s question is: “Well, is flying now good or bad? The answer of course is that it is good only when Claudia tells you it is.
As Tunisia tries to regain political stability, German tourists have been wary to book holidays in the sunny north African country. During a visit in Tunis, Ms Roth tried to reassure the German public all is now okay in Tunisia:
Those who wish to make holidays ought to come to Tunisia – this is a way of support.”
She is de facto advocating that people produce lots of CO2 to boost the Tunisian economy. I thought using less CO2 was supposed to lead to new economic growth and green jobs. Depends which scale one uses, I guess.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLake Aussenalster in Hamburg, Germany rarely freezes over enough to allow tens of thousands to go skating on it. The ice has to be at leat 18 cm thick before officials declare it safe to walk on. The last time that happened was in 1997. This weekend it was thick enough to do so again.

This of course is because of galloping global warming. I have to point out that it hasn’t frozen completely solid – but solid enough for officials to give the green light for people to walk on without risk. Does anyone have the data on the years it has been officially opened?

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Schellnhuber’s Master Plan for the “Great Transformation” of society announced in a Spiegel interview is now out. h/t: DirkH
If there was ever a document out there certifying someone has no clue about economics and democratic principles, this is it! And it’s as remote from reality that anything can get. Only reality-isolated, pointy-headed academics could come up with such a thing.
It even tops my wildest expectations. You can now read it here: A World In Transition – A Social Contract For Sustainability. This is what these world-rescuer academics, who never worked a day in their lives in private industry, recommend for changing society – to save us from junk science-based global warming.
To accomplish this so-called Great Transformation of society, the authors of the master plan advocate 10 bundles of measures to take.
Bundle No. 1: Improve the Proactive State with Extended Participation Opportunities
In the German they call it the “Designing State”. Here they call for a strengthening of the state and advocates “bonus-malus” solutions. That means: let’s make the state even more powerful, and if you don’t do what it tells you, then you get whacked.
Bundle No. 2. Advance Global Carbon Pricing. 
The WBGU believes that carbon pricing is the most important political measure for decarbonisation, and a necessary element of any regulatory framework for the transformation into a climate-friendly society. However, the price of carbon has to be set at a level that is high enough to achieve the transformative impact called for, i. e. it must be substantially higher than the current European emissions trading price level.”
Here we see this is remote of free market economy and it is all about state control. In the German version they call for a carbon price that must be “many times higher”.
Bundle No. 3. Expand and Deepen the Europeanisation of Energy Policy
That is what the title of the Bundle 3 is in the German version.
The goal of a common European energy policy should be the decarbonisation of the energy system by the middle of the century.
Here they propose the rapid expansion of renewable energies, energy storage systems and involving non-EU countries to help, such as Norway and Africa (i.e. $1 trillion solar plant in the Sahara called Desertec). That means becoming dependent on unstable North African countries like Libya. Forget that consumers can’t afford it.
Bundle No. 4. Accelerate promotion of renewable energies on a global level through feed-in tariffs
The transformation speed that needs to be reached to protect the climate and avoid the imminent risk of path dependencies on fossil energy technologies can only be achieved by accelerating and increasing the use of renewable energies.”
This is what they call for after a host of countries have just stopped subsidies because they are too expensive. But economics have never been a concern for reality-remote academics in ivory towers.
Bundle No. 5: Promote sustainable energy supply services in developing and newly industrialising countries

These countries need support with guaranteeing all of their people access to the basic essentials of a modern energy supply by 2030. They need support that allows them to establish a sustainable energy infrastructure.”
Like we don’t have enough to pay for already with our own huge deficits, demographic disaster, proposed super-expensive renewable energy supply system. Now we are also expected to pay for these systems in for the rest of the world. And then we should expect these poor folks to be able to pay for these pricey renewable energies. I’ve already read enugh to be convinced that these “wisemen” belong in group therapy of some sort. This is as remote from reality as it gets.
Bundle No. 6 Steering the World’s Rapid Urbanisation towards Sustainability
For currently rapidly growing urban structures, for example in Asia, high-carbon path dependencies must be prevented, as they would hinder low-carbon development for many decades.”
Hey Asia! (and the rest of the world), you’re going to build your cities the way we tell you to.
Bundle 7: Advance Climate-Friendly Land-Use
Priority of any globally sustainable land-use policy must be securing the food supply for just under a billion mal- and undernourished people. Furthermore, demand for agricultural produce is going to rise because of the growing share of animal products and the increase in biomass production for energy and industry.”
The modern agriculture that has done so much under the free market system is supposed to go back to failed Soviet style management. In their rush to rescue the planet from a hypothetical extreme climate change, they are proposing to rush a real destruction instead.
Bundle 8: Encourage and Accelerate Investments into a Low-Carbon Future
State policies must therefore aim to make investment into low-carbon technologies more attractive, and to abolish current disincentives and investment barriers.”
That means topple the free market system. Let the government run it. But which government?
Bundle 9: International Climate and Energy Policy
…a climate protection scheme that is limited to the more prosperous countries cannot solve the problem. Global cooperation is therefore necessary to ensure that the requisite funds for climate-friendly development are also available to poorer countries, and that all countries have access to climate protection technologies and the respective expert knowledge. International climate and energy policy is the forum for achieving a global consensus on transformation targets and ambitions.”
That means the rich countries are going to have to pay for the poor ones. Redistibution! The whole thing is a high risk economics experiment. Not to see if it’ll succeed, but to see how fast something can fail.
Bundle 10: Pursue a Revolution in International Cooperation
The world desperately needs a higher level of international cooperation if climate- and environmentally-friendly global development is to be achieved in the long-term.”
No. The world needs cooperation to tackle today’s real problems that are killing millions right now, and not fantasy problems 100 years from now. Pouring trillions into flakey energy systems while neglecting the poor is immoral.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to klimaretter.de, a warmist site operated by socialists and green Utopians, Dave Roberts was invited by the Heinrich Böll Foundation as a speaker for climate blogs at the network conference re:publica in Berlin last month. Roberts, you will recall, is the activist at Grist who in 2006 called for Nuremberg-type trials for bastards who deny global warming.
Klimaretter.de interviewed Roberts here and asked him about the US failure to pass a climate bill and the power of American conservatives. He had some interesting responses. Here are some excerpts of questions and answers in paraphrased form (I’ve eliminated all the rambling).
klimaretter: After the wonderful election of Barack Obama, hopes to pass a climate were high. What happened?
Roberts: The idea that it would be enough to replace “bad people” with “good people” turned out to be utterly naive. Barack Obama seemed to be the Messiah we had been waiting for. But his charisma was not enough to solve the USA’s deep problems. The Republicans routinely used delay and disrupt tactics.
klimaretter: Why didn’t the law get passed?
Roberts: Obama thought he could quickly pass health care reform, and then use the momentum to pass a climate bill. But passing health care reform got bogged down and became a very difficult issue. The momentum got lost. So the climate bill died and the only thing left to do is to set our hopes on EPA and its authority to regulate CO2. The Republicans want to defund the EPA. The fight is tough, but it’s not over yet.
klimaretter: What makes the conservative climate skeptics so powerful in the USA? 
Roberts: The conservatives really know how to create an atmosphere of controversy in order to block climate protection measures. The Republicans are focused on spreading doubt and portraying scientific consensus as being in dispute. There are great parallels with the tactics used by the tobacco industry.
klimaretter: Will it be possible to expect progress in US climate protection over the next 2 Obama years?

Roberts (see English below): Das Klimagesetz ist jedenfalls erstmal tot – wahrscheinlich sogar auf etliche Jahre. Und auch wenn Obama wiedergewählt wird und die Demokraten im Repräsentantenhaus die Mehrheit zurückgewinnen muss man sich fragen, ob das reichen wird. Denn an dem Punkt waren wir schon einmal – und das Klimagesetz ist trotzdem grandios gescheitert.
In English: “The climate bill is now dead in any case – probably even for a number of years. And even if Obama gets re-elected and the Democrats regain the majority in the House of Representatives, one has to ask whether that will be enough. We were at that point once already, and the climate bill failed spectacularly.”
klimaretter: Will the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan have an impact on nuclear plans in the USA?
Roberts: The Fukushima issue here is being played down. The catastrophe will not change the course of nuclear power in the USA much. Obama’s energy secretary Steven Chu is a big proponent of nuclear power.
——————————————————————-
And so what is the reaction of green-eyed Germans to Robert’s dire message from the USA? Answer: “OH NEIN!”
For example, here’s how yet another socialist/green Utopian site, Klima Der Gerechtigkeit (in English: Climate Of Justice) reacts to the message and US analysis delivered by Roberts:
In a healthy world and in every other democracy, the climate bill would have been passed with huge majorities. Not so in the USA and its political system. No wonder David Roberts felt at times that he was on another planet when he visited Berlin.”
That comment was written by Arne Jungjohann, who is living in Washington. When he talks about “every other democracy”, he is referring to places like the defunct German “Democratic” Republic – former East Germany – the country that imprisoned its people behind a wall of concrete, barb wire and sharp shooters, and where everybody was spying on each other.
Spare us your lectures on “democracy”, Arne. In the USA the topic is being discussed openly, and not being rammed down the throats of citizens by obsessed dogmatists with masterplans. Go back and review history. Your twisted idea of democracy is sickening to any honest and moral person.

All them windmills littering the landscape and the acres of solar panels mounted on roofs here in cloudy Germany are doing nothing to reduce energy dependency, and are unable to take up the slack left by the panicked Merkel-ordered nuclear power plant shutdowns in Germany.
