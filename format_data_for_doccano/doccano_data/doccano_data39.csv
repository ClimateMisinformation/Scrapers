Share this...FacebookTwitterOne reason for all the hysteria throughout Germany, and elsewhere, is because there are people out there who don’t know what they are talking about. Here’s an example: Cem Özdemir, a leader in Germany’s Green Party, said on national ARD television:

You know, we know the arguments. The arguments are not that new. At peak times, that is not in normal use times, then energy consumption is at a maximum in Germany around noon, between 11 and 12, we consume about 80 gigabytes, but we produce 140 gigabytes, that is about one and half times what we really need.”
Hey! My computer has a memory capacity of 2000 gigawatts.

And that’s why Germany doesn’t need any nuclear power, according to Özdemir.
Imagine if Sarah Palin had said such a thing. But because Cem Özdemir is a greenie, he gets away with it. Luckily this is on Youtube and so the networks can’t bury it. To be fair, Mr Özdemir appears to have been up all night, stoking the flames of hysteria, and so he can blame this gaffe on exhaustion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman public radio Deutsche Welle here informs us that Germany has taken over the rotating chairmanship of the UN Security Council.
Hat-tip: reader J. James
You’d think the Council would have its plate full with all the unrest in the Middle East, the real threats of terrorism, Iran, Afghanistan and global financial crises. Not Germany. The country prefers not to deal with these pressing problems, and chooses to ignore reality and make believe it is rescuing the planet from a fantasy destruction hundreds of years in the future, and hopes the world will regard it as some kind of action hero for it.
I’d regard such behaviour as not that of a hero, but of a mental patient. Worse, the lives of millions is in the hands of that mental patient.
Germany last held the Chairmanship in 2003 in the run-up to the Iraq war. So what urgent topic of debate has Germany decided to focus on in the midst of all the other world’s real crises? Sea level in the year 2200 of course! Deutsche Welle writes.
Every presidency holds an ‘open debate,’ and Germany has selected climate change as the topic of their debate. It will be about the security implications of climate change, said Ambassador Wittig.

“Key points of the debate will be about the rise of sea levels and the disappearance of entire states,” said Wittig. “From the United Nations 192 states, for the first time several states could completely disappear,” he added.
The issue is not exactly new, but fits in with Germany’s profile within the United Nations as a pioneer of environmental and climate protection.
Seriously, if you look at the sea levels, you see it would take hundreds of years before some coastal countries would begin to disappear. In fact sea levels are dropping at many locations.

Meanwhile terrorists are plotting now, today. Fortunately the chairmanship gets rotated to saner minds from time to time, and as Deutsche Welle writes:

Only a small portion of time will actually be dedicated to the issues specifically put forward by Germany.”

The situation at the Fukushima power plant is very serious. Damage to the cores of the three units, unit 1, units 2 & 3, have been confirmed. There has been no serious change since yesterday. The cores remain uncovered, one to two meters. We do not know the exact situation inside the reactor vessels. But the pressure inside remains at about atmospheric pressure. This suggests that they remain largely intact.”

How many more of these are we going to need? I don’t know why there are still people out there who deny what ought to be obvious.
==============================
New Norwegian studies: A significant part of climate warming of the last 150 years is caused by the sun
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt (translated by P Gosselin with permission)

Three Norwegian scientists, led by astrophysicist Jan-Erik Solheim of Oslo, have taken a close look at the interaction between the temperature development on Earth and solar activity in the past. The scientists investigated the length of individual Schwabe solar sunspot cycles since 1850 until today and found a systematic correlation with the annual mean temperature of the subsequent cycle.
Here the scientists analyzed temperature data from Norway, Spitzbergen and other North European weather stations. Normally a sunspot cycle is about 11 years on average. If the cycle is longer, then it is a sign for a solar activity slumber. Solheim and his colleagues Kjell Stordahl and Ole Humlum have now been able to determine that the temperature lowered after a long and weak solar cycle. The temperature rose accordingly after a short and intense cycle. This points to a time delay of about 1 decade between the heat impact of the sun and the climatic reaction on Earth.

The length of individual Schwabe sunspot cycles correlates well with the annual mean temperature of the subsequent cycle (see diagram middle right). Example Tromsoe, from Solheim et al. (2011a).
Because the last Solar Cycle No. 23 was significantly longer (see p. 299-302, “Die kalte Sonne”) and by looking at the empirically obtained interrelation, the scientists expect an imminent cooling at Spitzbergen of several degrees Celsius (Solheim et al. 2011b). On a Norwegian and global scale, that could translate to up to 1°C (Solheim et al. 2011a, 2012). Moreover, using their correlation data, the Norwegian scientists estimate that about half of the warming since 1850 was caused by the sun.
In a parallel study, the Norwegian trio investigated the temperature history of the last 4000 years using the Greenland GISP ice core. Here the scientists found a characteristic temperature cycle with a period of about 1000 years. In the Greenland temperature curve it is plain to see the Minoic Warm Phase (3000 years ago), the Roman Warm Phase (2000 years ago), and the Medieval Warm Phase (1000 years ago) and today’s Modern Warm Phase. Cold periods occurred between these warm phases, with temperatures dropping more than 1°C. According to Humlum et al. (2011) the logical continuation of this natural cycle indicates that a large part of the 20th century warming is due to natural climate mechanisms (assumed to be foremost the sun).

Share this...FacebookTwitterEver wonder how climate change in the past could ever have been posible without CO2 changes? Some people, like Prof. Michael E. Mann, think it wasn’t possible and that climate was always steady back then.Mann even fabricated a hockey stick chart to precisely show that – until 1850 that is. Then man got smart, industrialized, and everything went to hell.
Well, there’s yet another temperature reconstruction out there showing once again Michael Mann was wrong, and that the climate often went to hell in the past too.
The latest proxy reconstruction comes from a German peat bog and goes back 2000 years. And in case you haven’t guessed it by now, temperatures were all over the place. So much so, that the researchers themselves even express they can’t believe their own results.
A new paper by Moschen et al appearing ain the journal Climate of the Past presents a high resolution reconstruction of local growing season temperature (GST) anomalies at Dürres Maar, Germany over the last two thousand years.
In 2007, a 5.5 m long core was recovered from the centre of Dürres Maar peat bog in the mountainous West Eifel Volcanic Field in southwestern Germany.
According to the paper’s abstract (emphasis added):
The temperature reconstruction is based on the Sphagnum δ13Ccellulose /temperature dependency observed in calibration studies. Reconstructed GST anomalies show considerable centennial and decadal scale variability. A cold and presumably also wet phase with below-average temperature is reconstructed between the 4th and 7th century AD which is in accordance with the so called European Migration Period marking the transition from the Late Roman Period to the Early Middle Ages. At High Medieval Times above-average temperatures are obvious followed by a temperature decrease.
I got a copy of the paper from a source, who wrote: “The ex-hockey team will hate it”.  The paper’s Figure 6 tells quite the story. Indeed there was a lot of climate change in the past when CO2 was more or less stagnant. Look at the huge variations 1000 years ago! Obviously natural factors truly do exist. The Medieval Warm Period is shown again to be just as warm, if not warmer than today.
As reader DirkH points out in a comment, even the researchers have great difficulty coming to terms with their own results.

"The mainstream transatlantic left has been acting different lately. Having been subsumed into third-way politics for several decades, it seems we are growing back some teeth in our bite on the big systemic issues of today. From Labour calling for a national climate emergency, to prominent Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declaring capitalism “irredeemable” – we are slowly unzipping ourselves from the straitjacket of incrementalist politics. The left has a new centre, and it’s not messing about. It is nonetheless critical to ground these struggles in their long history. Indeed, many post-independence struggles in the global south have been struggles against capitalism and the political and ecological injustices it produces. Take climate change. We are finally seeing something of a start to the kind of mass mobilisation and political will needed to rise to the challenge. Most importantly, Labour’s successful call to declare a national climate emergency marks a well overdue shift from the idea we can solve this by changing individual behaviours, in which climate change becomes the responsibility of working-class people who just need to behave themselves – eat less meat, use fewer plastic bags, have fewer kids. If real action follows, the move signifies promising recognition that this crisis requires rapid, large-scale political action and systemic change – and it is the companies and institutions responsible for the crisis that need to pay. However, alongside the hope, we also need to acknowledge we are miles away from where we need to be. While our political leadership has continually acted as if rising global inequality and conflict is merely bad management of an otherwise rational system, communities in the global south and indigenous populations have been giving their blood, sweat and tears to resist an economic system that puts profit above people and planet. Whether it’s Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was murdered in his struggle to break the political bond between Shell and the Nigerian government, or the 1977 Egyptian bread riots, in which hundreds were killed resisting the IMF-mandated neoliberalisation of the economy, the connection between capitalism as a system and its injustices is something the global majority is well-versed in. This isn’t limited to popular movements – governments across Latin America and the Pacific Islands have harboured an organised resistance to the manifold ways in which global capitalism poses an existential threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions. Many of these efforts have not only been ignored, but actively sabotaged by US and European state leaders. This history of resistance does not emerge from some kind mystic internal knowledge held by black and brown people. It is down to the material fact of white supremacy, which means the brutalities of neoliberalism have been felt in their most extreme by what we call “developing countries”. The IPCC report declaring us to be in “decade zero” was not a shock in Dominica, where a single hurricane set back development by a generation. Or in Pakistan, where the 2015 heatwave claimed 2,000 lives. 1.5C might seem like new science to us, but the chant “1.5C to stay alive” has been screamed from across the global south for years. However, a certain colonial mindset sees many of these struggles as heavily localised; as part of the pathological conflict of black and brown people, rather than politically salient movements we could do with learning from. And this can be seen in the framing of the US and UK as “leading” the fight against neoliberal capitalism and climate change. Not only is this historically wrong, but it risks sabotaging the very aims of our movement going forward. We certainly have a role in the urgent action required to face up to the crisis. We must contribute our fair share to the global effort to stay under 1.5C warming. This means no more incrementalism: it means immediately dismantling the neo-colonial role played by our energy companies throughout the world; contributing our fair share to the global transfer of wealth needed for mitigation programmes in the global south, and breaking the political bond between the City of London and the fossil fuel industry. It also means radically changing the role we play in global climate negotiations, which has historically been one of talking over those suffering the sharpest edge of climate chaos. These negotiations need to be democratised, legally binding and a space in which we listen, learn and then take action. This means understanding that any “Green New Deal” or “green industrial revolution” cannot be bound within our nation’s borders, or prioritise the wellbeing of westerners over black and brown lives in the rest of the world. As we make these moves towards climate emergency, it is important that progressives do not internalise the colonial principles that got us in this mess, either by simply ignoring the global historical context of resistance to emergency issues, or even actively arguing we should under-develop “Bombay” to deliver growth in Wigan. Indeed, the industrial revolution was financed and sustained by the blood money and infrastructure of slavery and colonialism; a “green” version of this is no better. By centring ourselves in the resistance to neoliberal capitalism and ecological crisis, we will likely repeat the mistakes of the past. A “green colonialism” or “socialist imperialism” is no victory worth claiming, and it is the default left position if we do not actively fight for a different vision. We must come into this space not as self-appointed leaders, but figures of solidarity. We are the last to join the party – let’s not behave once again like the world’s policeman and have it shut down before it’s even begun. • Dalia Gebrial is a PhD candidate at the London School of Economics, and an editor at Novara Media"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe know that Marc Morano’s latest headline is about Al Gore going ballistic in a cuss-laden tirade against growing global skepticism – probably venting his pent up anger over his evaporating investments and reputation. Anthony Watts also fills us in on that padded-room incident.

So this is as good a time as any to bring you the latest video of Marc Morano and his latest assessment of the global warming movement.
Some of the more notable quotes Morano makes:
…real world data are showing that the global warming alarm spread by Al Gore and the United Nations is in utter collapse…across the board what we thought we knew about climate just 4 or 5 years ago is now in utter collapse – we call it sub-prime science…UN scientists were trying to act as gatekeepers of peer review, they were trying to shut out people like Roy Spencer…peer review is still a corrupted process…It’s always been a political movement…akin to Nostradamus…”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome news that may help European meteorologists with their seasonal forecasts in the future. We know that last fall many predicted a hard winter for Europe, and just the opposite is now occurring. What I find interesting is how the new paper reminds us of the proper way to build a model.
A team of climate scientists  led by Dr. Daniela Matei and Prof. Dr. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and Prof. Dr. Johanna Baehr from Hamburg University’s Cluster of Excellence “CliSAP” have shown for the first time that the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) at 26.5 °N can be skillfully predicted for up to four years.
This can be important because, according to their press release:
The AMOC – known as “Gulf Stream” – transports warm surface waters into the high latitudes, where they cool, sink and return southwards at depth as cold North Atlantic Deep Water. Variations in AMOC can significantly affect the northward ocean heat transport and therefore the European and North Atlantic climate. Through its influence on sea surface temperature (SST), AMOC can further impact climate phenomena such as Sahel droughts or the frequency of Atlantic hurricanes. Therefore, it is of outmost importance to be able to predict these climate variations on a time horizon from years to decades.”
“Climate variations” here is the key. The authors explain the proper approach for making mid-term climate predictions in general:

In the near term (inter-annual to decadal timescales), climate variations are influenced by both anthropogenic forcing and natural variability. […] The skill of any prediction system is assessed retrospectively, by performing the so-called “hindcast” or “retrospective forecast” and comparing them with observations.”
Oh really! This is almost what the IPCC does with its famous climate models, but with a small difference of course. In the IPCC models, there are always huge discrepancies between the hindcast and observations. No problem though. The IPCC modellers simply apply the ever so versatile aerosol fudge factor wherever needed, and presto! CO2 is always the big driver and the significant natural cycles are reduced to nothing.
I don’t know if Drs. Matei and Marotzke of the MPI-M produce models for the IPCC, but if so, all they have to do now is take the same approach they mention above and include the other (very well-known, at least to the rest of the world) natural cycles like the PDO, AMO, NAO, solar, etc. in their climate models. If they did that, they would quickly discover that they could do away with the massive aerosol fudging and actually produce a multi-decadal model that works. Of course, the IPCC may not be happy with the result.
If they don’t make climate models for the IPCC, then they should at least give their climate modelling colleagues a hint or two.

"As political leaders travel across Australia to deliver their election talking points in farms, factories and sports fields, they are criss-crossing a country in the grip of a rolling climate emergency. In the year leading up to the election on 18 May, huge swathes of eastern Australia have endured their worst droughts in a century. There have been apocalyptic scenes along the Murray Darling river system in which up to 1 million fish have died. In Queensland, floods have wiped out half a million cattle and bushfires have burned close to pristine rainforests. In the usually cool southern state of Tasmania more bushfires have raged across 190,000 hectares of land and devastated old-growth forests. Last year was Australia’s hottest year on record and as winter begins many of the country’s major cities are staring down the barrel of water restrictions with Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin and Brisbane all facing the prospect of dams at just 50% capacity. But on the campaign trail, through warming cities, blackened bush and scorched outback, the two contenders for prime minister are trumpeting starkly different messages about what, if anything, should be done to address the crisis. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, represents the ruling conservative Liberal party. The slogan-loving former head of Tourism Australia came to power after toppling his more moderate predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, in 2018. Morrison’s stance on climate change can be summed up by an address to parliament in 2017 while brandishing a lump of coal. In a speech supporting fossil fuels, he goaded the opposition: “Don’t be afraid. Don’t be scared. It won’t hurt you. It’s coal.” The idea that many in Morrison’s party consider climate change and its effects to be something to be laughed at is not hyperbole from the left. In 2015, the former prime minister Tony Abbott – who once called climate change “crap” – was caught on camera laughing at a joke about rising sea levels in the Pacific. In this election, the ruling Liberal and rural National Coalition – or “COALition” as they have been dubbed in attack ads – are pushing for a “climate solutions” fund that pays polluters to lower their emissions, with the aim of meeting Paris commitments of lowering emissions by 28%. The country’s environment minister, Melissa Price, has been labelled the “invisible minister”, notable for her absence at the sites of environmental calamities, and her refusal to meet environmental groups. The party is also embroiled in a scandal dubbed “Watergate” involving the $80m purchase of water from a company with links to the Cayman Islands that was co-founded by the energy minister. Morrison himself kickstarted a scare campaign based on the opposition’s ambitious electric car policy as a “war on the weekend”, suggesting that pick-up trucks, which are beloved by Australians, will become unaffordable. But in rural areas a number of high-profile Liberal and National party MPs are facing independent and minor party challenges on the climate, the conflict between farming and mining, and sheer anger at being ignored on water management, as well as integrity issues. Independents are also chipping away at the Liberal vote in cities. Meanwhile, the Labor party, which is leading in the polls by 52-48%, has promised significant action on climate change. In his speech launching Labor’s official campaign, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, a former union man who has struggled with the perception that he is uncharismatic, said: “If we have the privilege to serve as the next government of Australia, I will not bring lumps of coal to parliament for a laugh while temperatures soar and bushfires rage and flood and drought batter our land.” Labor has made itself a “big target” in this election campaign, laying out a suite of policies including controversial tax reforms and the target of reducing emissions by 45% by 2030. Despite this, the party can’t bring itself to fully commit on climate change, and is refusing to say whether it would stop a highly controversial proposed coalmine that environmentalists say will threaten the Great Barrier Reef. Labor’s equivocation on the Adani project led the Australian Conservation Foundation to give the party a score of 56% on its environmental policies ahead of the election. The Liberal party scored just 4%. Meanwhile, the Greens, the fourth-largest party after the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals, was given a score of 99% by the ACF. The Greens have just one federal MP but are a force in the Australian Senate, with nine out of 76 senators. They are pushing for much more serious action on climate change, but have been accused of strategic blunders after they voted down Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009 on the grounds it did not go far enough, which helped hamstring Australian climate policy for a decade. Australians are acutely aware of the climate emergency. A poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation of more than 100,000 voters found that the environment was the number one issue for most respondents, with 29% rating it as their biggest concern, up from 9% in the 2016 election. Australian social researcher Rebecca Huntley said voters had started to connect the climate change debate with competent governance, or lack of it. “The focus on climate change comes and goes but there is always a foundational concern around air, water and soil that would unite most Australians no matter where they sit politically,” Huntley said. “Voters are searching for the party that can provide a pragmatic and tangible approach and they are asking whether the political system can deliver solutions.” The Wilderness Society’s federal policy director, Tim Beshara, agrees. “The public want action but the level of trust in government is low,” he said. “So if any political insiders still see the environment or climate as some inner-city non-core voter issue, then they are missing the wider view, which is that it’s an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, trustworthiness and competence.” Labor wants the election to become a great climate showdown. “On this issue,” Shorten has said, “perhaps above all others, the contrast and the case for change is night and day, black and white.” Morrison’s conservative government, meanwhile, is trying to frame this as an election about economic management, saying that a vote for Labor is “an economic leap in the dark”. “What is the cost to the economy?” Morrison asked Shorten about his party’s climate policy in their leaders’ debate. “I mean, if there is going to be a change … Australians deserve to know what is the cost of the change.” This is not the first Australian election in which climate change has been a defining issue, but last time did not work out well for those demanding action. Abbott rode to power in 2013 on a campaign of three-word slogans, promising to “Stop the boats” (of refugee arrivals) and “Scrap the tax” (repealing Australia’s cutting-edge carbon pricing scheme). Labor is hoping that Australia – burned from that experience – has moved on. "

" Three of the largest ports in Europe – Rotterdam, Antwerp and Ghent – are to be used to capture and bury 10m tonnes of CO2 emissions under the North Sea in what will be the biggest project of its kind in the world. The ports, which account for one-third of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg region, are to be used to pipe the gas into a porous reservoir of sandstone about two miles (3km) below the seabed.  It is hoped the project could be completed by 2030 but the scale of the storage, in two empty gas fields, is unprecedented and raises questions about how the CO2 will affect the deep subsurface, according to the Dutch government. An application for EU project of common interest status for the development has been made, which would open the door to subsidies for building the network. The goal is to construct the CO2 network in the port of Rotterdam by 2026, with work then to be completed in the following four years on a cross-border pipeline to Antwerp and the North Sea port by Ghent. A further expansion beyond the initial 10m tonnes of C02 is expected after 2030. The total emissions of the business activities in the ports amount to more than 60m tons of CO2 a year. By comparison, the UK’s net carbon emissions last year came to 364 million tonnes The purpose of carbon capture is to aid the transition of industry towards the elimination of the burning of fossil fuels, and to help reach climate change targets set in the Paris agreement. The Dutch government is targeting a 49% reduction in emissions by 2030. Scientists in Belgium and the Netherlands have largely welcomed the plans. Prof Mark Saeys of Ghent University told De Morgen newspaper: “Of course I would prefer to see investments in renewable energy, but you have to be realistic: as long as we as a society remain dependent on fossil fuels, underground CO2 storage may be a crucial lever for achieving our climate targets.” The world’s first large-scale carbon storage project was developed in 1996 off the Norwegian coast, injecting nearly 1m tonnes a year into a space 800 to 1,100 metres beneath the seabed. But the development of carbon capture and storage has been stilted in Europe. In 2009, the European commission committed €1bn to finance six pilot projects with the hope of having 12 schemes up and running by 2015. Due to the high costs, none of the projects were developed. More than 70% of the 30m tons of CO2 captured annually by facilities for use or storage is captured in North America. The largest initiative in the world to date is the Petra Nova project in Texas, which was launched in 2017 and is attached to a coal-fired power station. It has an annual capture capacity of 1.4m tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of the emissions produced by 350,000 cars. The pipeline planned for the European ports project, known as Porthos, would have the capacity to transport 5m tonnes of CO2 a year."
"Scientifically, the life-threatening dangers of global warming in the Arctic are increasingly understood. But political understanding – and action – lag far behind. Attempts by Donald Trump to sabotage initiatives by Arctic Council countries, who meet in Finland this week, are a disgrace and must be vigorously resisted. The Arctic region is particularly sensitive to climate change and is warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Observed effects include rapidly melting ice and permafrost, coastal erosion affecting indigenous communities, loss of habitat for polar bears and other animal and plant species and disrupted, extreme weather patterns. These negative effects are cyclical and felt globally, most obviously in rising sea levels. New research suggests the release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing Arctic permafrost, combined with loss of heat-deflecting white ice, will greatly accelerate warming, add up to $70tn to climate-related costs and disproportionately affect poorer countries. United Nations experts predict that Arctic winter temperature rises of 3C to 5C above pre-industrial levels are now inevitable by mid-century, even with greenhouse gas emission cuts agreed in the 2016 Paris climate change accord. This has raised fears of a “tipping point” when warming becomes irreversible. “What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,” said Joyce Msuya of the UN environment programme. Most members of the Arctic Council, a forum comprising Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and representatives of indigenous peoples, seem to accept urgent action is needed. But one member, the US, disagrees. American obstructionism now threatens to prevent meaningful progress on joint ameliorative measures. Trump officials have tried to block any mention of climate change in summit documents. The US also rejected any reference to the Paris agreement, which Trump, a notorious climate change denier, withdrew from in 2017. The American position reportedly softened after other countries strongly objected, but big questions remain over what the summit can actually achieve. Attempts within the US to overcome Trump’s pigheadedness have had mixed success. The latest National Climate Assessment, the work of 13 federal agencies and hundreds of scientists, warned “devastating” climate change could cost the economy $500bn a year by 2099. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to require the White House to adhere to the Paris accord. And an Alaska court has blocked Trump’s efforts to allow Arctic offshore oil and gas drilling. But Trump is not budging. He said he “did not believe” his own government’s climate assessment. The Democrats’ House resolution has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. And the White House is pushing back, unveiling a new strategy to challenge the scientific consensus that fossil fuels are the leading cause of climate change and pose growing security, economic and health threats. Yet even as he denies climate change, Trump wants US businesses to exploit Arctic resources, including vast oil and gas reserves, which is only possible due to thawing ice and increased accessibility. It’s a prospective bonanza that Russia and China also eye greedily. There is even talk of a “polar Silk Road” as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road trade initiative. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state and climate change sceptic who will attend the Finland summit, has other priorities. Last week, his spokesman warned China, which has Arctic Council observer status, to keep out. What most worries Pompeo and the Pentagon is increasing Chinese (and Russian) investment – and expanding military bases – not a drowning, dying planet. Intensifying great power competition in the Arctic is a foolish distraction from incomparably more urgent global climate concerns. Arctic Council members must stand up this week. They should tell the US to get real – or get lost."
"A devastating new UN report shows the planet is in serious danger from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems. Here we look at 10 of the key points from the report – and their relevance for Australia.  More than one million plant and animal species are now threatened with extinction, including 40% of all amphibian species, 33% of reef-forming corals and a third of all marine animals. Terrestrial native species have declined in abundance by 20% since 1990, and 690 vertebrate species have gone extinct since the 16th century. Australia alone has lost 27 species of mammal in just over 200 years of colonisation. If unchecked, loss of biodiversity could lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems. “We are eroding the very foundation of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life worldwide,” the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services chair, Sir Robert Watson, said. Modern agricultural practices have seen the diversity of species grown for human consumption narrowed to the most productive varieties. Those varieties are used in place of local species that were farmed previously. As of 2016, 559 of the 6,190 domesticated breeds of mammals used for agriculture were extinct and a further 1,000 are threatened. Wild relatives of domestic crop species are also under threat. The report said this “poses a serious risk to global food security by undermining the resilience of many agricultural systems to threats such as pests, pathogens, and climate change.” Nature is declining less rapidly in land that is owned or managed by Indigenous peoples, but it is still declining due to competing interests including mining and unsustainable agriculture and fishing. About 25% of all land globally is traditionally owned, managed, used or occupied by Indigenous peoples, including 35% of all formally protected areas and 35% of all remaining terrestrial areas with very low human intervention. The report found that despite Indigenous peoples “proactively confronting” problems of both climate change and habitat loss, regional and global plans to combat biodiversity loss and climate change do not make use of Indigenous knowledge. It recommends promoting Indigenous knowledge and land management systems in drafting the global and regional response to looming environmental threats. About 40% of Australia’s land mass is formally recognised either under native title or land rights laws. According to the UN, we need to bump that number up. Promoting Indigenous governance and self-determination through the recognition of land tenure is a global recommendation from the report. Doing so will promote positive contributions of Indigenous peoples and local communities to sustainability. Restoring native ecosystems is an “indispensable” part of both staving off mass extinction and mitigating the effects of climate change, but what is good for one may harm the other. The report warns that reforestation of cleared or previously un-forested areas, as well as large-scale bioenergy plantations, risks establishing monocultures. That is bad for biodiversity, could threaten food and water security, undermine local jobs and “intensify social conflict”, the report said. Scientists have already warned of a version of this occurring in Victoria’s central highlands, where Mountain Ash forests continue to be logged at what experts warn is an unsustainable rate. If logging continues that ecosystem is projected to collapse by 2067 and potentially be replaced by an open acacia woodland, with dire consequences for several threatened species and the security of Melbourne’s water supply. Urban areas have doubled globally since 1992. In Australia, one of the fastest growing areas is in western Melbourne, where 55% of the 1,200 native plant species in the remaining grasslands are under threat of extinction in the next 100 years. The report recommends maintaining green spaces or green wedges in the city as wildlife corridors and cleaning up metropolitan waterways is a key measure to protect biodiversity in urban areas. It also recommends promoting rooftop gardens, urban agriculture movements, and expanding native vegetation cover in both existing urban and peri-urban areas and in new developments. More than one-third of the world’s land surface and nearly three-quarters of all available freshwater resources are devoted to crop or livestock production. Crop production occurs on about 12% of all ice-free land worldwide, and grazing on 25% of total ice-free land and 70% of drylands — which includes all of Australia. The report recommends measures including protecting wetland biodiversity areas, limiting the expansion of unsustainable agriculture and mining, reversing the de-vegetation of catchment areas, reducing fertiliser use that causes polluted run-off, and minimising the negative impact of dams. It also recommends investing in water efficiency measures – in Australia that would include converting open irrigation channels to closed pipelines – as well as encouraging the use of household rainwater collections. Economic incentives traditionally reward business practices that deliver strong economic returns, often at the price of environmental harm, over those that promote conservation or restoration. By getting rid of environmentally harmful subsidies and promoting economic incentives that measure value in environmental and social terms, as well as economic terms, we would increase sustainable land and sea management. That move will be opposed by vested interests, the report says, but will promote better outcomes. Half of the live coral cover in the world has been lost since the 1870s and that loss has accelerated in recent decades, notably in the Great Barrier Reef. If global temperatures increase by 1.5C coral reef cover is expected to decline again, to 10-30% of former levels. In a 2C future coral reef cover will be just 1% of what it was before the industrial revolution. Losing the reefs will increase the risk of floods and hurricanes impacting between 100 million and 300 million people who live in 100-year coastal flood zones. The only way to stave off this damage is to keep climate change below 2C. That includes setting quotas, protecting key marine biodiversity areas, and reducing pollution from run-off. About 33% of global fish stocks are overfished while only 7% are under-fished. The companies and profits behind industrial fishing are concentrated in a few countries but cover 55% of the oceans, mainly in the northern hemisphere. We need to develop legally binding global agreements for responsible fisheries and urgently work towards eliminating illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing."

This video is the work of Kilez More, see http://www.kilezmore.com/.  The politically misfitted rapper in the video tells us that warmist climate science is a hoax, is all about money and control, and that the science is cooked up at the CRU and other institutes. I don’t know who is behind the video – could even be some renegade fringe types, who knows.
So are the youth turning against the Great Hoax? Looks that way.
I took a shot at translating the German lyrics in English below (first 2 parts only!). Of course you lose some doing that, and you can’t get the rhymes in. My English version below is only to give non-German readers and listeners the gist of the lyrics. Readers are welcome and urged to improve it.
Kilez More – Climate Change Lyrics in English)
You thinking of climate change and you’re screaming for laws
You’re thinking about CO2 and saying “let’s stop it”
Global catastrophes happening all because of man
We did too much driving, now the planet is too warm
If we don’t do something soon then the ice will melt
A flood is gonna kill us and the future’s gonna fall
No it aint…I’m telling you you’re off the wall
Man aint causing climate change, yeah you
think I’m crazy and making no sense
But just look at the climate institutes and you’ll see
what they do, they’re fudging the data making it hot
We just found out…their studies are made up
A hacker got in the computer and the database
Now read the mails from the CRU – they’ll make you laugh
They’re cooking the numbers, the temperature is up
Listen to me! It’s all a fraud and enough is enough
Ref
Climate change was not made by man
No… It’s only to keep the world in fear
All those who are pimpin it are being called experts
And the brothers who diss it are getting labelled sick
Climate change was not caused by man
No…it’s only to keep the world in fear
But I don’t believe it, and so I’m getting labelled sick
But it’s the price you pay when you think for yourself
II
Climate change is normal, it’s always been around
We aint done a thing, history shows us so
History books show in 1100 the planet was warm
In North England people were pickin grapes and making wine
And that wasn’t because of factories run by knights and
The shield industry driving the climate up
Then in sixteen hundred the Baltic froze over and it
Wasn’t because they stopped CO2 with ‘reform’
That’s pure arrogance when man thinks he’s got the power
To control the whole climate on the entire globe
Truth is only 1 to 3 percent comes from man
Comes from processes that are natural – so they’re lying
Inside the brainless walls of these fear-mongering crackpots
They want more power, more money, more control, more global tax
And every skeptic is getting branded by them
Being defamed and compared to Holocaust deniers
Ref
Climate change was not made by man
No… It’s only to keep the world in fear
All those who are pimpin it are being called experts
And the brothers who diss it are labelled sick
Climate change was not caused by man
No…it’s only to keep the world in fear
But I don’t believe it, and so I’m getting labelled sick
But it’s the price you pay when you think for yourself

"The US is a hotbed of climate science denial when compared with other countries, with international polling finding a significant number of Americans do not believe human-driven climate change is occurring. A total of 13% of Americans polled in a 23-country survey conducted by the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project agreed with the statement that the climate is changing “but human activity is not responsible at all”. A further 5% said the climate was not changing. Only Saudi Arabia (16%) and Indonesia (18%) had a higher proportion of people doubtful of manmade climate change. Americans were also more likely than any other western country polled to say they did not know whether the climate was changing or people were responsible – a total of 13% said this. But despite these views, the great majority of US citizens do accept the science of climate change, with nearly four in 10 saying human activity was at least partly responsible, potentially with other factors, and a further third taking the stronger view that human activity is the dominant cause. The project is a new annual survey of global attitudes in 23 of the world's biggest countries, covering almost 5 billion people.  The 2019 survey canvassed 25,325 people online across much of Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia in February and March.  Questions about populist attitudes and convictions were inserted in order to derive a ""populist cohort"", and discover what this group of people think about major world issues from immigration to vaccination, social media and globalisation. The full methodology can be found here.  Scientists overwhelmingly agree that people are causing climate change through the exponential increase of greenhouse gas emissions over the years. Global emissions are still rising, and the last four years have been the hottest since records began. Last October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists, warned of the dire consequences of continued global warming, indicating the window of opportunity for action had narrowed to as little as 12 years. A global movement of young people calling for action has sprung up as a result, spearheaded by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, giving way in London to a more feisty display of street protest orchestrated by the Extinction Rebellion group. In the US, street protests have been less visible but the political landscape around climate change has been transformed by the Green New Deal, an effort by the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to spur a second world war-level mobilisation to stem the increasingly severe hurricanes and wildfires that are racking the country. This week a UN global assessment report, compiled over three years by more than 450 scientists and diplomats, warned that a million species are at risk, largely as a result of human actions that are accelerating the decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems at an alarming rate. But wider denial of climate science is down to a concerted campaign of misinformation by fossil fuel interests and aspects of American character, according to Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist who founded the advocacy group Climate Mobilization. “The Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry have put billions of dollars into lying to the American public, even sending literature to science teachers in schools,” Salamon said. “They are so well organised and have managed to turn climate change into a controversial subject that gets shut down. It’s clearly working. “There is also the issue of American individualism, remnants of manifest destiny, that don’t set us up well for understanding that we are part of the web of life. The American dream is quite self-involved. We need a new American dream.” Americans also appear unusually prone to climate-related conspiracy theories, the YouGov data suggests. A total of 17% of those polled agreed that “the idea of manmade global warming is a hoax that was invented to deceive people”. Belief in this conspiracy theory, which was previously invoked by Donald Trump, who falsely claimed climate change was made up by China, increases with age and also conservative political ideology. A total of 52% of Americans who described themselves as “very rightwing” to YouGov insisted global warming was a hoax.  In Europe, fewer than one in 10 people across the major countries surveyed thought the climate was not changing or not changing owing to human activity, with only Poland showing a slightly higher number, with 12% taking one of these views. In the UK, the public’s appetite for stronger action on climate change appears to have increased markedly in the past few weeks alone, after this polling was carried out. The Extinction Rebellion mass protests have met with broad support, and the youth activist Thunberg was greeted by senior politicians, including the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove. Last week the UK government’s statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, recommended ways in which the UK could reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by mid-century, and the UK parliament voted that the world was in a state of “climate emergency” and that action must be taken accordingly. Individuals often shrug that there is little they can do on their own – but the YouGov survey found people are already examining their own shopping habits for environmental reasons. A clear majority of those surveyed across all countries took the view that it was fairly or very important to buy ethical goods made in socially and environmentally responsible ways. Perhaps surprisingly, support for ethical shopping was weakest in Germany, with only 54% of people regarding ethical shopping as important, while 40% of people in the UK and the US viewed it as unimportant. The YouGov polling data, published exclusively by the Guardian, shows a clear majority of people around the world think climate change is happening and that it is all or partly down to human actions. Though holdouts still remain, particularly among people with self-described very rightwing political views – a third of whom either took a sceptical stance or said they did not know when asked about climate change – there appears a mandate in this data for politicians to take a bolder approach to dealing with global warming, said Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe, a civil society group. “Poll after poll confirms that there is a large majority of citizens who recognise that climate change is happening and is manmade,” said Trio. “Citizens expect governments to act and reduce our negative impact on the climate. Governments have the obligation to drastically increase emission reductions and protect their citizens from climate disasters.”"

 Co2 driving the climate is a joke, a ruse – tantamount to saying Mexico drives the world economy. Sure it is a factor, but a small one. When I look at all the people running around with CO2 reduction as their new religion, I just shake my head. Duped! What a con-job.
This brings up our Climate Bet here with warmist Rob Honeycutt, who boldly bet $5000 that the 2011-2020 decade will be even warmer than the previous 2001-2010 decade. So far the first three months of the new decade are slam dunks for the COOLIST column, and have opened up an early lead 3 – o.

2011 01 -0.010 -0.055 0.036 -0.372

2011 03 -0.099 -0.073 -0.126 -0.345
The status of the bet has not changed since the last update here.
Sure there are still another 117 months to go before the bet is concluded, but I’m not in hurry for these months to pass by. So far ocean cycles are showing that they run the place, and not a trace gas. As the negative PDO takes hold and AMO heads south, more cooling is in the pipeline. The weak solar cycle also bodes ill for the warmists.
That cracking noise you hear is not the spring ice beaking up – it’s the sound of AGW science breaking apart.

By Matti Vooro
The headline on recent news clipping reads Toll from Europe Freeze tops 220, see here and here. Reading news clips about the current weather in Europe and Asia and then comparing that to what IPCC said in its 2007 report about what Europeans should expect for future winter weather is as if the IPCC was predicting the climate for another planet.

Fig. 1: European winter temperature deviations from the 1961 – 1990 base for the years 1998-2010. Blue = Europe winter temp, black line = linear trend.
The latest death count is over 300 now. You just cannot be this far off in your forecasts and claim that this is based on any credible climate science supported by most climate scientists. If it is supported by most climate scientists, then we have serious science credibility problems here for Europe.
Here is what the IPCC predicted earlier (emphasis added):
Assessments of projected climate change for Europe:
Annual mean temperatures in Europe are likely to increase more than the global mean. The warming in northern Europe is likely to be largest in winter and that in the Mediterranean area largest in summer. The lowest winter temperatures are likely to increase more than average winter temperature in northern Europe, and the highest summer temperatures are likely to increase more than average summer temperature in southern and central Europe.

Annual precipitation is very likely to increase in most of northern Europe and decrease in most of the Mediterranean area. In central Europe, precipitation is likely to increase in winter but decrease in summer. Extremes of daily
precipitation are very likely to increase in northern Europe. The annual number of precipitation days is very likely to decrease in the Mediterranean area. The risk of summer drought is likely to increase in central Europe and in the Mediterranean area.
Confidence in future changes in windiness is relatively low, but it seems more likely than not that there will be an increase in average and extreme wind speeds in northern Europe.
The duration of the snow season is very likely to shorten in all of Europe, and snow depth is likely to decrease in at least most of Europe.”
This is now the fourth of such cold winters for Europe depending on the individual country.  Europe’s and Berlin‘s winter temperatures show a linear decline since 1998 (See Figure 1) and more seriously with very cold winters since after 2007 and 2008, See the two charts at the bottom of this article.
Other scientists have noted that Northern Europe and Asia have had cooling winters since 1988 or for two decades now as noted below. So this is not just a new development but that the cooling has been coming now for a decade or more. So how could IPCC be so wrong only a few years ago? 
A recent technical paper called Arctic warming, increasing snow cover and widespread boreal winter cooling, Judah L Cohen1 et al:
Record cold snaps and heavy snowfall events across the United States, Europe and East Asia garnered much public attention during the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11 (Blunden et al 2011, Cohen et al2010). Cohen et al (2009) argued that the occurrence of more severe NH winter weather is a two-decade-long trend starting around 1988.”
So it is heartening to read just recently in the news that some German mainstream media have finally seen the light and have exposed the IPCC science as being flawed and no longer credible for planning our future and are beginning to ask the type of questions that should have been asked all along. It is unfortunate that hundreds of people had to die before we start doing proper planning for the colder winters that may lie ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a good overview explaining why the measurement of Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is fraught with much uncertainty and so subject to substantial error. Michael Limburg of the European Institute for Climate and Energy tells us why.

On Determining Global Mean Sea Level
by Dipl.-Ing. Michael Limburg
An exact determination of GMSL is a very difficult if not a fundamentally impossible task. Even more difficult is determining sea level rise (or drop) over time. Different authors using the same datasets arrive at completely different results. It’s little wonder sea level expert W. Siefert in Hamburg recently said in an interview: “When examined closely, sea level is being exposed more and more as a pure mathematical prop, inadequate and, foremost, not very meaningful. Especially when it is to be used as a sole standard of measure, or used to derive horror scenarios…(1)“
This is also confirmed by researchers like Douglas [Douglas, 1994], who illustrated in great detail why e.g. Barnett (1984), Emery and Aubry (1991) Pirazzoli (1993) concluded:
…the determination of a single sea-level curve of global applicability is an illusory task.”
Douglas hoped that improved research instruments would bring better and more reliable results in the years ahead. And with the possibilities presented by satellite altimetry, these results may now be at hand. But so far mostly controversial results have been produced and no really reliable findings have been gained.
And later, in spite of the many new instruments and techniques that can now be used to find the much sought signal of global warming on GMSL, they say…
…these tools seem to have raised more questions than they have answered.”
Obtainable accuracy
It must also be allowed to say that a claimed measurement accuracy of a few tenths of a millimetre per year for the (only measurable) Relative Sea Level (RSL) and the GMSL are not possible with the available historical data. Only the newest satellite altimetry tools may allow this in principle. Therefore using the unit of measure “mm” is grossly misleading. The IPCC,  many experts, publicly informed media, and laymen are hence falsely claiming an accuracy that simply cannot be reached. These figures are computed values only.
In reality sea level changes can be measured accurately only to centimetres, and often only to within several centimetres – and very often not even that. Munk [Munk, 2003] (3) confirms this writing that…:
“…the jury is still out on the interpretation of the tide gauge records.”
For sea level and for trends from global historical temperature data, the old saying of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) – known as a great inventor of many basic statistical principles and algorithm – remains true:
Nothing shows a lack of mathematical understanding more than an exaggeratedly accurate calculation.”
Therefore the only thing certain is that the statistical construct of GMSL over the last 120 years indicates a rise of between 10 and 20 cm/century. The error lies in the scale of the calculated value, and likely may be even higher. While Mörner expects a mean rise of 10 cm/century, the IPCC (AR4) sees approx. 19 cm/century. Today IPCC experts see an increase in the rate of rise over the last 20 years, while others explicitly exclude such a rate increase.
Why all the uncetrtainty?

It is due to built-in systematc errors. Many of these errors are widely unknown in their historical size, appearance and direction. They are included in the data and they involve an array of factors such as: dtermination of sea level measurement reference points, datasets of various lengths, contaminated datasets, rapid shifting of tectonic plates and their vertical components, barometric pressure, density of water, etc, etc.
A close analysis of all these error factors indicate that the errors are of a systematic nature and, because they are mostly subtle, they cannot be determined on the scale of the sought local sea level rise. Therefore they have to be indicated using error bars in accordance with good scientific practice. But this has very rarely been done. Credible figures regarding the attainable accuracy are as a rule the exception, e.g. Mörner +10 ± 10 cm by the year 2100 (or + 5 ± 15 cm) [Mörner, 2004] (2). Anything else has to be taken with much caution.
Assigning the causes of sea level rise
Detailed attempts to determine GMSLR are made by authors of the IPCC and others by breaking it down into various components. But one has to keep in mind that that this approach is prone to failure. Cazenave et al [Cazenave, 2004] is quoted on this:
…for the past 50 years, sea-level trends caused by change in ocean heat storage also show high regional variability,” ´
and
..has led to questions about whether the rate of 20th-century sea-level rise, based on poorly distributed historical tide gauges, is really representative of the true global mean.”
The estimates for eustatic and steric components cannot be brought in agreement with the observed data. The movement of single tectonic plates with speeds in the range of more than 15 cm/year, the vertical components therein, which can decisively impact the volume of the ocean above it, is certainly a cause of the observed changes in RSL and thus GMSL. But recording these changes and quantitively attributing them to a source has been impossible up to now.
Also a potential temperature-dependency is not detectable over the last 1000 years, as clearly shown by Storch et. al [Storch, 2008] (5). In their model that looks back, they did not find any correlation between sea level trend and temperature.
For all measurement locations, sea level changes can be more easily attributed to natural changes (glacial isostatic adjustment GIA / post glacial rebound PGR or other tectonic shifts) or, similar to the UHI for temperature, attributed indeed to man-made social-economic factors, e.g. urban growth and thus sinking. A greenhouse effect is not necessarily needed to explain it. This means future projections of the GMSL are purely speculative because of the great lack of understanding of the involved processes and the lack of data.
Nothing makes this more explicit than the wide range of estimates among IPCC lead authors (e.g. Rahmstorf) and other specialists: Jevreva, Mörner or Singer. Rahmstorf [Rahmstorf, 2007a](4) believes a maximum of 140 cm is possible by the end of the century, James Hansen estimates up to 600 cm under certain conditions, the IPCC shows estimates between 14 to 59 cm (final), Singer only 18-20 cm, and Mörner [Mörner, 2004] a mere 10 cm. This might be the reason why the IPCC authors are unusually cautious ( see for reference AR4 of WG I Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level on page 410 Chapter 5.5.2.):
…there is an increasing opinion that the best estimate lies closer to 2 mm/yr than to 1 mm/yr…”
Conclusion
When basing conclusions solely on the ever-escalating opinions of a few scientists – some of them well known for blowing the horn of alarmism – political leaders should not decide on extremely costly measures to curb completely doubtful global sea leve rise, which is a mere statistical construct from the very beginning.
The only rational conclusion one can draw is: All global mean sea level rise claims with an accuracy of better than ± 10 cm/century have to be taken with great caution. Breaking down the rise into components and attributing a respective rise to each, especially to temperature rise, is not possible with today’s level of knowledge. Each assignment of factors is simply too speculative.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSkeptic book by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning “Die kalte Sonne” (see side bar) will begin its third week on the Spiegel bestseller list since it was first released on February 7.

 
It shot up to number 14 on the bestseller list for German hardcover non-fiction books just a week after it was released. Last week it was at number 15, and next week it will be at the 18th spot.
Die kalte Sonne also remains No. 1 on the Hoffmann & Campe list. Publisher Hoffmann & Campe, based in Hamburg, are now is discussions with publishers for an English version. I’m also informed that a second printing of the German version is now underway.
Die kalte Sonne is also No. 1 on the German Amazon list for books on environment and natural science.
The book’s success has unleased a wave of outrage among climate alarmists and activists. But most of the criticism has been emotionally charged, from people who did not even bother to read the book. German readers click here.

As  the skeptic book sweeps across Central Europe, its launch was accompanied by a nasty cold snap over the first half of February. The online Swiss magazine Blick writes:
February 2012 is among the 10 coldest February months since measurements began 150 years ago. The cold wave in the first half of the month was the most intensive in 27 years, MeteoSchweiz reported on Tuesday.”
The German Weather Service (DWD) reported that Germany had its coldest February in 26 years, saying that…
…at times February, 2012 could be compared to the harsh winters of 1963, 1956 or 1929.”
The cold snap was particularly harsh across Eastern Europe, with hundreds of people dying of the cold. According to the online Russian Ria Novosti:
The worst cold in Russia’s south for the past twenty-five years caused a disaster for the country’s vineyards, which is comparable to the damage inflicted by the anti-alcohol campaign initiated by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Argumenty Nedeli weekly newspaper reported on Wednesday. The temperatures, which plunged to minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in February, destroyed over a half the vineyards on the Taman Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.”

"A coalition of major City investors have emerged as key players in forcing BP to be more transparent in how it fights climate change. Investors holding just under a tenth of all BP shares, equivalent to more than £10bn in value at Monday’s prices, put their names to the shareholder resolution, to be voted on at the company’s annual meeting next week, the Climate Action 100+ investor group revealed on Tuesday. The resolution is thought to represent the strongest level of support for a climate-related resolution at a major publicly listed company. Under the Climate Action 100+ resolution, BP will have to provide a detailed strategy on how it will comply with the Paris agreement, the global deal reached in 2015 on climate change that aims to limit global warming to only 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. Seven of the top 20 BP shareholders co-filed the resolution, including the UK’s biggest asset manager, Legal & General Investment Management, as well as Aviva Investors and M&G Investments. Other major investors who signed up to the resolution included Royal London Asset Management, Schroders, UBS Asset Management, Jupiter Asset Management and the pension funds of the churches of England, Scotland and Wales. Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors, described the resolution as only the first step in tackling the climate emergency. He said: “The scientific consensus is crystal clear on the need for far-reaching action by corporates, with the next decade critical in limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Investors have a responsibility to hold companies to account and to ensure they consider their alignment with the Paris agreement.” However, the resolution has faced criticism because it stops short of mandating emissions targets, which include all of the greenhouse gases produced when BP’s products are burned, known as “scope 3” emissions, on top of BP’s own operational emissions. BP has opposed another resolution, co-ordinated by the campaign group Follow This, which would force the company to set targets to reduce total emissions from BP fuel. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “BP does not want to take responsibility for the admissions for their products. “As long as an oil major has no targets for scope 3 they can never say they are committed to the Paris agreement.” The Follow This resolution is expected to receive support from multiple major investors but the presence of a separate, less strict resolution may mean fewer back it. Aegon, the Dutch insurer and investor, has committed to vote in favour of the carbon limits. Eric Rutten, chair of Aegon’s responsible investment committee, said: “These large oil and gas companies should follow Shell’s example to play a leading role in the transition to climate-neutral energy supply.” Investors in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, including some who proposed the BP resolution, were part of the coalition in December 2018 that forced Shell to commit to carbon targets that included its products, a much tougher requirement than that demanded of BP. Shell executive pay is also linked to the targets. The resolution backed by BP includes a commitment to measure scope 3 emissions. The company will also have to provide details of how new investments will meet the Paris goals, what metrics it uses to measure its success and its progress on combating climate change during the past year. Oil and other fossil fuel extractors have come under particular pressure in recent years as the scientific and diplomatic consensus has acknowledged the need for immediate and radical action to reduce carbon emissions in order to prevent catastrophic climate change. The pressure on oil companies has been heightened by recent Extinction Rebellion climate protests and the declaration by MPs that the UK faces a climate emergency."

Call it a green embarassment of spectacular dimensions. Don’t expect national media coverage here.
Despite all the massive subsidies, incentives and bureaucratic favors, which were supposed to guarantee the venture’s long-term success, Fremont California-based solar cell manufacturer Solyndra still went bankrupt, read here.
Hat-tip: reader Freddie.
In May 2010 the plant was used by Obama in a photo-op to showcase the promised green prosperity that we were (and are still) supposed to openly embrace and expect for the future.
How many more Soviet-style grand failures of this scale are we going to need before policymakers wake up to this green mirage of prosperity?
Solyndra is bankrupt, and likely gone are its 1100 jobs and the hopes and dreams held by its workers and their families. According to the Swiss online bluewin.ch/:

Solyndra was a showcase for the government’s investment in environmentally friendly technologies. The company received more than half a billion dollars in state credit guarantees. Among others, President Obama, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Energy Secretary Steven Chu visited the plant.”
According to san francisco.cbslocal.com here/:
Solyndra said as a result of the suspension of operations, some 1,100 full-time and temporary employees were being laid off effective immediately.
Solyndra workers learned as they arrived at the office that the recently-completed Fremont factory where they worked would be closing immediately.”
I heard of this news from an obscure Swiss news outlet, and not a peep from the national MSM. The MSM we recall are too busy hyping up tropical storms into “monster hurricanes of the century” and propping up the climate change hoax, which in turn leads to mega-failures like Solyndra. So is the media today.
Meanwhile the US economy is falling apart and people are losing hope with every false promise politicians make. The green economy is total pie-in-the sky. Sadly 1100 employees and their families are finding this out the hard way.

"Scott Morrison has been highly successful during this campaign at keeping the focus on Bill Shorten and Labor policies. He has presented the Coalition as the “nothing to see here” status quo option. In contrast, his opponents have been cast as the purveyors of radical change Australia doesn’t need. The Liberal leader has been running dead on his own agenda, and deliberately so, to ensure that all voter eyes are trained on the (risky) alternative. But despite the Seinfeld campaign, the Coalition isn’t actually seeking a mandate to do nothing. As the contest moves into the final week, it’s time to kick the tyres of Morrison’s deft “move on calmly, nothing to see here” campaign impressionism.  There are a few ways we could do this, but one obvious way in is through tax policy. The Coalition’s long-term tax cuts haven’t commanded a massive amount of deep focus for a few reasons. At budget time, all the attention was on the Coalition offering tax cuts for low and middle-income earners to try to neutralise a similar election offering by Labor. There wasn’t much attention paid to the tax relief for high-income earners slated for down the track, because it was unclear whether Morrison would win the current election, let alone be in a position to legislate a program taking effect between 2022 and 2025. The medium-term agenda attracted a significant discount rate. As well as the whole idea seeming reasonably hypothetical, there was a second, conceptual, discount factor. The generosity of the tax relief proposed for up the income scales doesn’t sit comfortably with the uncertain state of the economy. It seemed likely that the Senate, if presented with the whole package post-election, and told to take it or leave it, could elect to leave it on the basis it’s not prudent to bake in tax cuts at a time of pervasive economic uncertainty. So the sum of all the discount factors is the Coalition’s tax package has largely washed through the election conversation without troubling anyone much, apart from appearing as an abbreviated talking point – we’ll give you a nice tax cut and Labor will increase taxes. But the fact of the matter is the Coalition’s policy is not status quo, nor “nothing to see here”, but instead, a significant change to how the system works now. A couple of experts quoted in a recent ABC Fact Check noted that the package outlined in the April budget would reduce the progressivity of Australia’s tax system. Morrison and the treasurer Josh Frydenberg have been deeply reluctant throughout the campaign to quantify in dollar terms the tax relief that will flow to high income earners – to people earning $180,000 a year. The progressive think-tank the Australia Institute has calculated that figure at $77bn over 10 years. The two tax experts quoted by the ABC Fact Check, the Grattan Institute’s Danielle Wood and the Australian National University’s Ben Phillips, say the figure is more like $88bn or $89bn. The government won’t quantify the figure itself because it does not want to hand Labor a concrete attack point it can weaponise before election day. Another element related to the tax package was flagged by Wood early in the campaign, but the cut-through point she made hasn’t really lingered in the daily hustings conversation. Wood noted that in order to be able to afford the high-end tax cuts and keep the budget in surplus, the Coalition would need to cut spending by about $40bn a year by 2030. Faced with this inconvenient fine print, Morrison promptly declared poppycock, but Wood – a respected economic analyst – doesn’t resile from her calculations and, assuming she’s right, that points to the risk of a significant round of expenditure cuts that have not been disclosed to voters before voting day. Tony Abbott walked that same path in 2013 and his story did not end happily. The other clever teflon strategy Morrison has deployed during this campaign has been to detach himself from the dead weight of the Coalition’s period in government. He’s done laps of the country as a solo act to project lightness and agility and energy to voters – to present the impression of a political leader in sole command of his enterprise. Now if Morrison pulls off a victory, there’s no doubt his internal authority will be enhanced, because he will have achieved something that seemed impossible at the time when collective despair descended inside the government after Malcolm Turnbull was deposed last year. If Abbott loses in Warringah (and I have no idea how realistic that prospect is), that will also make life easier for the Liberals to rebuild and steady the enterprise either in government or opposition, because a long cycle of destruction will be broken. But whatever the abundant gratitude of colleagues post-election, if they find themselves on the government benches against expectations, Morrison will not be in solo command of his enterprise. It’s just not the real world. Sitting – comfortably obscured behind Morrison’s cheery five-week circumnavigation – is a battle for the leadership of the National party that will blow up after the election if the gritted teeth behind the scenes are a reliable measure, particularly if the election doesn’t go well for the junior Coalition partner. The Liberals will continue to struggle to agree on things they have spent a couple of terms struggling to agree on. This government roiled right up until the moment when Morrison took himself to the prime minister’s courtyard after visiting the governor-general – and the only thing forcing discipline now is the discipline of people trying to hold their seats. Morrison had a couple of formulations this week about how he has led and would lead his fractious political organisation. On the ABC, he first declared he was in full command of the show. In the last leaders’ debate, he said he led from the “middle” – a reference to balancing the sensibilities of the right and the left. In fairness to the current Liberal leader, he’s done that better than either Turnbull or Abbott. That was Morrison’s main claim to the top job when he faced off against Peter Dutton last year. But with due credit to the massaging given, there remains one live litmus test of who really runs the Liberal party in 2019, and it’s on an issue that sits at the front of many voters’ minds in this election. It’s climate change. Morrison made a big show in the months before the election of executing a positive pivot on climate change, backing renewable energy projects, rebooting the emissions reduction fund, and at one stage, declining to utter the word coal in deference to metropolitan progressive Liberal sensibilities. But the election campaign – all the hyperbolic shouting about the costs of climate action, the self-interested and cynical critiques of Labor’s decision to use international permits to lower the cost of abatement (a position the Coalition adopted in 2017 and abandoned only with the election in sight), and the “Labor’s secret plan to confiscate your ute” hyperventilation – speak volumes about who runs the show and Morrison’s inability to move the internal dial to something like a neutral position on the most important policy challenge of our time. The Coalition remains deeply regressive on climate action. One Liberal said to me this week: every time we talk about climate change, it hurts us with middle Australia. Right now it’s hard to say with any certainty just how much, but we’ll find out next Saturday night."

Recently I happened to look through some scientific papers and articles on global warming and the various forcing factors that affect our climate.
One that caught my eye was a paper by N.A. Krivova and S.K. Solanki [2003] called: Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850.

http://www.solen.info/solar/cyclcomp.html, web page prepared by Jan Alvestad
In the conclusions of the paper they state:
We have shown that even in extreme cases that solar variability caused all the global climate change prior to 1970, it cannot have been responsible for more than 30% (50% for the intercalibration Willson, 1997) of the strong global temperature rise since 1970.”
WUWT also reported the authors saying (emphasis added):
However, it is also clear that since about 1980, while the total solar radiation, its ultraviolet component, and the cosmic ray intensity all exhibit the 11-year solar periodicity, there has otherwise been no significant increase in their values. In contrast, the Earth has warmed up considerably within this time period. This means that the Sun is not the cause of the present global warming.”
While I agree that the sun was most likely behind all the warming since 1850 and earlier, I cannot agree that the sun was not behind the warming since 1970. The link may not be immediate or short term but a lagged connection nevertheless. The average decadal sunspot number during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s were 84.2, 67.2 and 49.6 respectively. The average mean global temperature anomalies during the same decades (HADCRUT3GL) were +0.079°C, +0.235°C, and +0.411°C respectively.
I went back and crunched the numbers for UAH satellite global temperature data and got mean temperature anomalies of -0.135°C, -0.0295°C and 0.0178°C. So on a decadal basis the sun and the global temperatures seem not to be correlated when measured by satellite or ground stations during the last 3 decades. Was Solanki correct then after all?
No. And there may be a logical explanation. Let’s take a decade at a time. The two graphs at the end of this article illustrate the average decadal sunspot numbers and average global temperature anomalies (hadcrut3gl) for the period 1900- 2010. But first the last 3 decades:
2000-2009 average decadal sunspot number was 49.6, down from 67.2 the decade before.  The average decadal mean global temperature anomaly was 0.411°C up from 0.235°C the decade before.
* The actual solar activity was naturally down since solar Cycle No. 23 was declining to its minimum.
* The decade’s temperatures were influenced by the lagged solar Cycle No. 22 and 23 which together had 4 active solar years averaging 113.
* PDO and AMO were mostly positive correlating with a warm mode in the Pacific and Atlantic. PDO stated to go negative in late 2007.
* North Pacific Ocean SST anomalies were rising and then declining after 2005 causing global atmosphere temperatures to stay high [but flat with no rise].
* There were 4 El Nino’s.
1990-1999 average decadal sunspot number was 67.2 down from 84.2 the decade before. The average decadal mean temperature anomaly was 0.235°C up from 0.079°C the decade before.
* The actual solar activity was higher than the following decade but lower than the previous with parts Cycle No. 22 and 23.
* The decade’s temperature was influenced by the lagged Cycle No. 21 and 22 which also had 5 active solar years 131.4.
* PDO was positive the entire decade, AMO was positive about half the decade.
* Significant El Nino in 1997/1998, 1994/1995, 1991/1992.
* North Pacific Ocean SST anomalies were mostly rising except after the 1997/1998 El Nino.
* There were 3 El Nino’s.
1980 1989 average decadal sunspot number was 84.2, up from 61.2, the decade before. 
The average decadal mean temperature anomaly was + 0.079C, up from -0.103 C
* The actual solar activity was up with influence from solar cycles 21 and 22
* The decade’s temperatures were influenced by lagged solar cycle 20 and 21 which had 3 active solar years averaging 134
* PDO was positive or warm mode, AMO was negative
* Significant EL Nino 1986/1987 North Pacific Ocean SST anomalies were fluctuating
* There were 2 El Nino’s.

Bob Tisdale in his blog and his article called Can El NINO events explain all of the global warming since 1976 parts 1 and 2 explains how a series of El Niños events could account for the major changes in global temperatures since 1976 through certain key El Ninos . The more significant El Nino in effect were 1997/1998, 1991/1992 and 1994/1995 and 1987/1988. See the graph below from Bob’s blog.
From my own analysis, during positive or warm phase of PDO and AMO, there are significantly greater number (2.5 times) of strong El Ninos than strong LA Ninas and more El Nino months compared to La Nina months .There were less La Nina’s in total as well .
Strong ElNinos seem to follow about 9-11 years after the previous strong solar maximum. 2009/2010 El Nino followed about nine years after the solar maximum period (4 months) of Cycle No. 23. The El Nino of 1997/1998 followed the very active solar maximum period (5 months) of Cycle No. 22. The same happened with the biggest El Nino ever recorded in 1878 which followed the solar max of 1869-1872.
PDO index tracks a spatial pattern of SST anomalies that, when it is cold in the western and central part of the North Pacific and warm in the eastern part of the North Pacific, the index has positive values. A more positive PDO index is typically a result of both more positive and warmer SST anomalies in the NE Pacific in combination with more negative or cooler SST anomalies in the NW and Central Pacific.
The AMO has been basically warm or positive mode during the period 1995-2012. So we have both the PDO and AMO as positive correlating with more warmer water along the coast of North East Pacific ocean and the North Atlantic ocean.

Summary
There appears to have been a correlation between solar activity and global temperatures going back for thousands of years as given by many peer reviewed papers, some of which have been posted on this blog very recently. In my graphs, the correlation appears to be there for the decades 1900 to 1940′s as the decadal average sunspot number and
the decadal average mean global temperature anomalies seem to rise together. In the 1950′s  solar activity and global temperature anomalies went in opposite directions when we had major solar activity (91.7 average decadal solar sunspot number) but the decadal global temperature anomalies were flat or slightly down as the PDO was negative correlating with more  cooler water in Pacific North East than in the Northwest and Central  Pacific. Also global SST were cooler in the 1950s. Scientists have been looking at
various lag factors and other concepts to get a better handle on the sun/ocean/atmosphere link.
In my judgment the reason why sometime global temperatures and solar activity do not correlate is that the ocean cycles are out of sync with solar effects during certain decades. This was apparent during the cool period of 1950’s to 1970’s where colder ocean cycles in the Pacific and Atlantic as correlated by negative PDO and negative AMO reduced the “lagged” warming effect of some strong solar cycles especially the strong solar maximum around 1956 -1960. Ocean cycles seem to overide or nullify decadal solar effects in certain decades.
Yet during the period 1980-2010, the solar activity was slowly  declining but both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were both  positive correlating with a warm mode (AMO and PDO both positiv)], resulting in the global surface temperatures going up while the sunactivity was declining. It is no coincidence that during this last decade when the lagged
effects of the decline of last solar cycle# 23 and the decline of the ocean cycles as reflected by AMO and PDO indices, both of which are now in sync, that global temperatures should  also  decline. This makes sense to me and it disproves claims that solar effects were not responsible for the 1980 to 2010 global warming.

What follows is the mean global temperature anomaly for each decade. Note overall it correlates with sunpsot activity:

The following chart is from from Climate 4 You sun section web page and illustrates the trend of the sunspot number since 1700. Notice the dips that correspond to cooler periods for the global temperatures including the 1960s, 1970s:

"Labor will promise to overhaul environmental protection law and establish a National Environment Protection Authority, as Bill Shorten and Scott Morrison resume campaigning after the second leaders’ debate in Brisbane on Friday night. Green groups and the internal Labor environmental action group Lean have been pressing Labor to make a specific election commitment on the regulatory overhaul, which was first flagged by Shorten at last year’s national conference. After some pre-event controversy, Shorten committed last December to introduce a new Australian environment act and create a commonwealth environmental protection agency if Labor wins the election. There was concern Labor could pull back from those undertakings under pressure from business concerned about more stringent environmental hurdles, but on Saturday Shorten will make a $50m commitment to the new regulatory framework, a $100m commitment for a new native species protection fund and also allocate $62m to tackle coastal erosion and prepare the coastline for the impact of climate change. This week Shorten has gone on the offensive over climate change, declaring Australian politics is “broken” because the parliament has been unable to rise to the challenge of delivering credible policy. On Friday the Coalition promised $203m to increase recycling, reduce waste and protect threatened species and waterways. Public debate about the adequacy of the environmental protection framework was sparked after a rushed environmental approval for the controversial Adani coal project, which the Morrison government ticked off just before calling the election. Labor initially seemed to be making the case that it would review the groundwater approval, but Shorten has pulled back, saying there are “no plans” to go down that path. Environment groups pointed to the groundwater approval as evidence that the regulatory framework needs an overhaul. The national convener of Lean, Felicity Wade, told Guardian Australia she was satisfied with the election commitments. “Australians want a prosperous future but also a safe one, and we want the beauty and ease of our unique natural environment to be looked after by government. “The Coalition has handed it all to big business to do as they please but Labor will ensure private interests can’t destroy our shared natural legacy. Better laws and better oversight will deliver this,” she said. Shorten delivered the commitments at national conference in response to a concerted lobbying effort by Lean. The policy shift was endorsed by 498 local party branches before the national conference, and since the conference 77 branches have passed a motion calling on the party to deliver “a full election policy announcement to underpin this major reform as a high priority for the first term of a Labor federal government”."
"For supporters of Liverpool, Spurs, Arsenal and Chelsea it has been quite a week. First they had the joy of seeing their teams get through to the finals of Europe’s two cup competitions: the only time there has been a clean sweep by English clubs. After the euphoria, though, came a hard lesson in basic economics. As the final whistle blew at Anfield, following Liverpool’s amazing comeback against Barcelona, anyone logging on to airline websites found the price of a ticket to Madrid – where the final of the Champions League will be held – had rocketed to more than £700 on the weekend of the match. When Spurs scored a last-minute winner against Ajax to join Liverpool in the final, prices rose again and not just for direct flights to Madrid but for alternative routes as well.  The price of accommodation in the Spanish capital also rocketed. Hotels jacked up their prices, as did those who let out their properties on Airbnb. The going rate for a two-night stay in a flat in Madrid over the Champions League final weekend is more than £1,000. Despite all the talk of supporters being gouged, this is the way markets work. There are a limited number of places to stay in Madrid and on May 31 and June 1, there will be a lot more people in need of them. If supply remains constant and demand goes up, then prices will rise. Liverpool and Spurs supporters had a choice. They could have decided the prices of airline tickets and accommodation were too high and refused to pay them. In those circumstances, prices would have come down. Instead, they paid up, fearing delay would only mean paying more later. If it is any comfort to football fans as they contemplate receiving whopping credit card bills, there are some less painful economic lessons from this year’s Champions League. The first is that management matters. Studies of UK productivity have shown there are vast differences between firms. Those that export perform more strongly than those that are purely domestically focused. In addition, those that are foreign-owned and managed do better than those run by Britons. In this light, it is significant that all four of the English clubs in this year’s finals have foreign coaches: Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool: Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs; Unai Emery at Arsenal and Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea. A second is that football is one of the very few areas of the economy where the workers hold the whip hand over management. The TV rights for broadcasting Premier League matches are a goldmine but the real beneficiaries have not been the owners but the players. The pool of star players is limited and probably no bigger or smaller than it ever was. What’s changed is that the TV billions have come rolling in. The competition for talent coupled with the worldwide appeal of the Premier League has allowed the Paul Pogbas and the Eden Hazards to bid up the price of their labour. Too much money chasing too few goods tends to lead to inflation, and the salaries of Premier League footballers are proof of that. The lesson provided by one Ajax, of the losing Champions League finalists is that investment in human capital matters. The Dutch club lack the financial clout of some of their European rivals but made up for it by nurturing young talent. As an example of the importance of training and skills to successful outcomes, the story of Ajax is hard to beat. But in football as in every business there is potential free-rider problem. Companies that have deep pockets don’t bother to invest in their own human capital but simply entice talent away from those that do by offering big reward packages. Ajax thrashed two clubs with extremely deep pockets – Real Madrid and Juventus – en route to the semi-final but the team will be broken up this summer. The final economics lesson from this year’s Champions League is one that has yet to be learned but needs to be: namely that environmental sustainability has to play a central role in decision making. Uefa, European football’s governing body, decided before the season started that the finals of its two competitions would be held in Madrid and Baku, yet now finds that all four finalists are from England. The result is that airlines get a windfall, as do the hotels and restaurants of Madrid and Baku, but at the cost of an enormous carbon footprint. From a climate change perspective, having Liverpool and Spurs jet off to Spain while Arsenal and Chelsea supporters make their way to Azerbaijan, is little short of disastrous. Last year, the final between Liverpool and Real Madrid was held in Kiev. Uefa needs to be held to account for this because it is clearly unsustainable. Last year’s Champions’ League final should have been held in Paris and this year’s finals should be in London or Cardiff. The idea that this would cause insurmountable logistical problems does not wash. In the bygone days before FA cup semi-finals were held at Wembley, neutral grounds were chosen once it was known which teams were playing each other. If Arsenal was playing Manchester United, for example, the likeliest venue was Villa Park in Birmingham. With a bit of planning, Uefa ought to be able to adopt a similar approach. As soon as it was known that the four semi-finalists for the Champions League were Liverpool, Spurs, Ajax and Barcelona, there were two obvious choices for the final: London or Paris. Football is influential. It needs to start taking climate change seriously."
"I’m no expert on Australian politics – I don’t know all the cross-currents that will determine this week’s balloting. But I do know a fair amount about the climate crisis, having written the first book on the subject back in 1989. So I can say with confidence that if Australians want to play a serious role in fixing the greatest challenge we’ve ever faced, this may be about the last election where people retain enough leverage to make a real difference.  Global warming, after all, is a math problem: how quickly can we reverse the flow of carbon into the atmosphere? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its report last year, said that unless a fundamental transformation was fully underway by 2030, we stood no chance of meeting the targets the world set in the Paris climate accords. No matter what country you’re in, “fundamental transformations” don’t come overnight; if you want to dramatically trim carbon emissions in 2030, it means you better start in 2020. That means that if Aussie politicians of all stripes are still passing around lumps of coal and fantasising about huge new coal mines, that’s not going to happen. The good news is, if you want change, the timing couldn’t be better: the engineers have done their job so well that the cost of renewable energy just keeps falling. In much of the world it’s now the cheapest way to produce electrons (and that’s even without charging fossil fuel a penny for the damage it’s doing). That means we’re in a position to make truly fast strides in the right direction (especially those of us lucky enough to live on a continent washed by wind and bathed in the rays of the sun). Not only that, but we’re in a “climate moment” around the globe. It’s been inspiring to watch the pictures on social media of young Australians joining the climate strikes now breaking out around the world; their British counterparts, and their older colleagues at Extinction Rebellion, were enough to convince the Tory-led British Parliament to pass a declaration of “climate emergency” last month. Even in Donald Trump’s United States the Green New Deal keeps gaining momentum – most of the Democrats vying to replace him are calling for a concerted response to an “existential risk”. None of it will be easy, of course – the fossil fuel industry continues to flex its considerable muscle around the world, and nowhere more than Australia. Watching the environment minister forced to disregard obvious science and instead rubberstamp proposals for groundwater plans for the Adani mega-mine are just the latest reminder of how the barons of this eighteenth century technology dominate Canberra. Reading that Tony Abbott bet $100 that the climate will not change over the next decade is the latest reminder of the pervasive intellectual dishonesty necessary to prop up the status quo. Australians literally watched hot water kill off huge swaths of the Great Barrier Reef in two years. Hell, you’ve watched wildfires wipe out suburbs in two hours. A decade is an eternity in climate time now. We’ve wasted three decades since scientists first raised the warning – that’s guaranteed that we’ll have massive increases in temperature.It means we’ve run out of decades to waste, and hence of elections to waste. Every election matters – it registers who we are at a certain moment in history, and it sets the course of the next few years. But this election will matter forever.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming movement really started up in the late 80s. Even back then blowhard scientists were telling us that the science was settled. And because the science was in fact not really settled and poorly understood, many fell into the trap of making downright stupid predictions.Today, 20 to 25 years later, it is good time to go back and look at how all these “settled” predictions are turning out. Most, we will find, were the sort of thing one typically hears from fortune-tellers.
One example is Hartmut Grassl, who was director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg until 2005, and a harsh critic of Die kalte Sonne book. Hat tip: Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s excellent “Die kalte Sonne” debunking site.
As we will see, instead of bringing prestige to the once renown institutes, many blowhard, the-science-is-settled fortune tellers will wind up being dark, embarrassing chapters that these once prestigious institutes will certainly be ashamed of in the future.
Maybe I’m being a bit too hard saying this. But scientists who succumb to dogma, politics, or just pure money, deserve no less. With each passing day they are beginning to appear more and more like arrogant, inflated ego scientists who thought they could win the day by claiming an authority that had obviously been misbestowed.
Working for insurer that rewards top performers with sex orgies
Today Hartmut Grassl, who was once director of the UN World Climate Program in Geneva from 1994 to 1999, is also a foundation board member of reinsurer Munich Re – a major beneficiary of the climate catastrophe scare (and promoter of sex orgies for top performers). Although Grassl’s fortune telling and predictions of doom are paying huge dividends for the insurance industry, they are turning out to be completely wrong.
Grassl predicted temperature would increase up to 2°C in 30 years.
Grassl made a stunning prediction back in 1990, Die kalte Sonne website writes here:
In 1990 Hartmut Graßl sounded the alarms with his book “Wir Klimamacher” (Us climate makers) predicting a terrible climate catastrophe. On page 61 he wrote with co-author Reiner Klingholz: ‘Already in the next 30 years the temperature of the Earth will increase, with a high probability, by one or two degrees Celsius.’
Today, 22 years later, we can check how well this prediction is doing so far. The result ought to be sobering for anyone concerned about a warming catastrophe. Well, they can all breathe a sigh a relief. Here’s what actually happened since 1990:
Temperature increase since 1990: 0.25°C.
Temperature increase over the last 10 years: ZERO!
And for Grassl’s crystal ball fortune to be correct, with eight years left to go, the global temperature would have to increase 0.75°C just to reach the lower limit of his prediction, and a whopping 1.75°C for his most pessimistic vision to come true. The chances of that happening, given the current phases of the the sun and oceans, are next to nothing. Good luck finding a climate scientist willing to bet Grassl will be right.
The question to Grassl is: What happened? Please explain it to us. Settled science you said?

To keep things in perspective, the entire climate discussion today is the nitpicking over a 0.8°C temperature rise  – over the last 160 years!
“The debate is over,” Grassl said in 1994
In 1994 Grassl was so convinced of his predictions that he declared the climate debate to be over. According to Die kalte Sonne site, Grassl wrote:
From the scientific side of it, the indication process concerning the topic of the greenhouse effect is over and the guilty verdict is in. It’s no longer about gathering more evidence, but solely about alleviating the punishment. The global mean temperature will increase over the next decades by one to two degrees Celsius. Each global change in climate magnitude, also including the mean temperature, forces new weather extremes at almost every location. We will see floods here, droughts there and storms at other places like we have never seen before.“
Reference for that quote: Graßl, H.: Technik München, Mitt.-Bl. Techn.-Wiss. Vereine München, 1994; 3,4. quoted e.g. in: Heinrich Röck Klima und Politik“ 2001.
Obviously today we see that much of what Grassl was saying was pure baloney. The temperature increased only a small fraction of what he predicted, thus indicating that CO2’s predicted effect had been completely over-estimated. Moreover, weather extremes have not increased at all. Today’s weather events are well within the boundaries of natural variability, see here and here, as well as page 202-208 in Die kalte Sonne. What has radically changed is our ability to record weather events. We have satellites, radars, computers, and almost everyone today walks around with a mobile phone that can make good video clips for the evening news.
This means that Grassl in his climate equation had foolishly neglected the other fundamental climate factors, namely the sun and oceans. An astonishing accomplishment for a scientist of his rumoured caliber. If a college professor were to grade Grassl’s work behind his prediction, he would certainly have to give him an “F”.
Die kalte Sonne website writes:
It is high time to admit to these errors and to make fundamental corrections to the climatic world view. Instead Grassl shifts into obstinate mode and refuses to depart at all from his now obsolete views.”
In his book Klimawandel – Was stimmt? Die wichtigsten Antworten“  (Climate Change – What’s Correct? The Important Answers) of 2007, Grassl simply avoids using terms like the Roman Warm Period, Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age when discussing the climate of the last 10,000 years. He believes in the bogus hockey stick.
On page 15 Grassl describes the good correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 750,000 years, and from this he postulates, like Al Gore did in in movie, that CO 2 was the driving climate force.
Let history judge Grassl as a scientist on that alone.
Other scientists who made dumb predictions, behaved arrogantly, and today refuse to admit their gross errors have to expect the same scrutiny and treatment. Be warned that history will not look upon you positively.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve noticed that German skeptic sites who were vigorously publicizing the rap video (here with English lyrics) yesterday (like Achse des Gutens) have abandoned ship today, and removed the story. I’m told that Kilez More is indeed very controversial, and is into all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories, and thus ought to be avoided. Tell me which artist isn’t!

Kilez More is a very young man who is obviously going through a growing-up stage – one that many people go through at one time or another in their lives, especially in their late teens and early 20s. It’s a stage of rebellion and questioning. That’s what most young people do.

He also has the talent of rap, and so is using it to express his doubts and to question society – just as many artists do. He provokes. Oh the crime of being young! What the warmists are trying to do is to suppress his questioning – asserting authority and insisting the discussion is over. It’s a shame even the skeptics have turned their backs on him. It’s a tune by a rapper, and nothing more.
Of course I probably don’t agree with most of More’s ideas (haven’t looked into them) but I do agree that he has the right to pose questions, especially about climate science, and that his encouraging young people to ask questions is correct. He makes climate assertions. Let his viewers hear them, and let them make up their own minds. Maybe he is wrong on every other subject. So what!
The only wrong questions are the ones that never get asked.
His Climate Swindle video is only telling young people to be careful, and to look deeper into the issues before accepting them at face value. Claims to authority aren’t good enough. That’s important. Young people eventually will do their own research and decide for themselves what the truth is. I haven’t looked at the content of his other music videos – no doubt some may be very controversial – but that’s another discussion.
Questioning authority cannot and must not be criminalized, and must not be a right that is exclusively reserved for a few. 
I get the feeling he is increasingly being viewed as a dangerous man for doing just that. The attempt to shut him up will backfire. Keep rapping, Kilez – they’re scared.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes the old wisdom turns out to be the better one – that is wisdom from the analog world, during a time when there were neither bits nor bytes, nor model calculations to explain the world to people. One of these wisdoms is: The search for missing persons using concentric circles around the last known position. Had the French aviation authority BEA followed the old wisdom, the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 would have been located within just a few weeks after it crashed off the Brazilian coast on June 1, 2009.”
This is how an online story here appearing in Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) began its story on the recent discovery of the wreckage of doomed Air France Flight 447, an Airbus 330-200 with 228 on board, which crashed into the ocean en route to Paris – almost 2 years ago.
Hat tip NTZ reader: Marcus K
So why did it take so long to find the wreckage in the Atlantic Ocean, in an area where the water is 4000 meters deep? The FAZ explains why. Instead of using the old concentric circle search method, authorities opted to rely on mathematical models from oceanographers and mathematicians. The result: they searched in the wrong area for almost 2 years.
In this case here, claiming the methodology was flawed but the answer is correct isn’t going to wash. Officails still don’t know why Flight 447 crashed. To find out, it is important to recover the flight data recorder. The sooner it is found, the quicker you can find the cause of the crash and implement possibly crucial technical modifications to the rest of the fleet in order to prevent the accident from happening again.
Unfortunately in this case, although the plane was found just recently, almost 2 years time was wasted – thus possibly put passengers in subsequent flights at needlessly higher risk.
The FAZ story writes that once a plane crashes, the flight recorder’s beacon sends out a signal for 30 days to make it easier to pinpoint its location. Already on June 10, 2009, an entire fleet of ships was searching an area, one was even equipped with Towed Pinger Locator, but there was no success. After 30 days, i.e. around July 1st, the flight recorder’s power ran out and the signal stopped. The first attempt to find the wreckage failed.
A second search attempt began on July 27, 2009, and included a French oceanography ship of the Ifremer Research Institute which used an ROV to search the ocean depths. But that search attempt also ended in failure on August 17, 2009.

Computer models send searchers on a wild goose chase
So what next? According to the FAZ (emphasis added):
Still in the summer of 2009, the French BEA contracted renowned oceanographers and mathematicians from France, Great Britain, USA and Russia to calculate the probable crash area. The task was to back-calculate the drift of the bodies and pieces of the wreckage that had been found north of the Last Known Position (LKP) on June 6, and trace it back to the time-point of the crash, taking currents, wind and waves into consideration. The highly complex calculations of the Drift Group were then summed up in a 2000 sq km probable crash area and presented in January 2010. The calculated area extended 60 km north of the last known position [LKP]. The 3rd phase of the search began on April 2, 2010.
This calculated search area is shown on the diagram, click here. Note how the mathematical computer model calculation produced an area all around where the wreckage was actually located. The last known position (LKP) is denoted by the green dot. The actual site of the wreckage is marked with an “X” and is only 10 km from the LKP!  The initial search area of 2009 is denoted by the light blue box at the top of the graphic. Finally, the computer modelled mathematical calculated search area is denoted by Phase 3.
Needless to say, the models sent the rescue efforts on a wild goose chase from April 2 to May 24 2010. The computer-model guided Phase 3, too, ended in failure.
Eventually, it wasn’t until officials had spent €30 million and almost 2 years time (and gotten a stroke of luck) that they were able to claim success in late March 2011. The French Marine had placed electronic buoys and monitored them for weeks and found out that currents behaved unpredictably and changed very often. The modelers had made wrong assumptions.
They couldn’t even model a 2000 sq km area for 5 days
Keep in mind that the modellers here only had to calculate the dynamics of one grid cell on the planet – and that for only a period of 5 days – and not the entire planet for 100 years (which climate modellers now claim they can do). A relatively small area for a only few days – and they still got it all wrong! (I’m not making fun of the mathematicians here – I’m just saying the task is extremely complex, and so you have take results cautiously).
This really ought to be a lesson for people and policymakers who rely on computer models to tell them what the climate is going to be like for the entire planet 10, 50 or 100 years into the future. Folks, it’s nothing more than wild guessing.

A reader who goes by the name of “renewable guy” and I had a recent exchange on the credibility of James Hansen and his crew at GISS a short time ago.  He gave me the following list of 9 observations to support Hansen and GISS:
1. “Observations show that the planet is changing in accordance with global warming theory.”
It is nice to see someone admit it is a theory rather than “settled science.”
2. “The evidence for global warming is being meticulously accumulated by scientists all over the world. This evidence includes the independent observations that paint a consistent picture of global warming. Our planet is suffering an energy imbalance and is steadily accumulating heat (Hansen 2005, Murphy 2009, von Schuckmann 2009, Trenberth 2009)”
Not quite. See here. All the papers in the list above depend on models. When actual data is used no heat accumulation is seen. For sea surface temperature changes see: read here.
3. “The height of the tropopause is increasing (Santer 2003, press release).”
Two related papers, the first one refutes Santer: read here and here. Figure 9 of the second paper by Hoinka shows no long term trend of tropopause height over the period 1979 thru 1993. There is however, great year to year variability.
4. “Jet streams are moving poleward (Archer 2008, Seidel 2007, Fu 2006).”
Not anymore. The ozone hole closing is counter-acting the warming affect. But this study is still using models, read here. The models depend on the temperature increasing. What if the temperature doesn’t follow the rules? And it has not over the last decade plus.
5. “The tropical belt is widening (Seidel 2007, Fu 2006).”
Same as above; two sides of the same coin. If the jets move poleward, the tropical zone gets wider.

6. “There is an increasing trend in record hot days versus record cold temperatures with currently twice as many record hot days than record cold temperatures (Meehle 2009, see press release).”
Have you heard of UHI? Here is an excellent compendium of the problem. Even NOAA knows the truth about that, and has known it for over 20 years, read here. There is also the increased reporting phenomenon; blame the Internet. This, and satellites, are responsible for much of the recent extreme weather reporting. NASA also knows.
7. “A shift towards earlier seasons (Stine 2009).”
I found this paper change was 1.7 days over 50 years. There are cyclic changes in temperature. The beginning year in this study was 1954, a relatively cool year for the twentieth century. If the study had begun 20 years earlier, the change would have been smaller, see here. The earth has been slowly warming since the end of the Little Ice Age. Seasons were much longer during the Medieval Warm Period, when grapes were cultivated in Scotland, as they can be cultivated now (with proper care, it’s still not as warm as southern England). In the last two thousand years, there have been two other periods when the growing season in northern Europe was as long as now: the Roman Warm Period, and the Medieval Warm Period. The cycle is now turning colder and will repeat learn about it here.
8. “Cooling and contraction of the upper atmosphere consistent with predicted effects of increasing greenhouse gases (Lastovicka 2008).”
Not quite, the sun has a much larger effect: read and learn something here.
9. “Lake warming (Schneider & Hook 2010).”
Sure, since 1985. Look again in another 25 years. All the above points have the same problem. If you look at a particular section of data, or a model, for just a few years, trends can be seen that disappear over a longer time interval. The sun and long ocean cycles last from 70 to several hundred years. Making judgements over shorter intervals is foolish.
Models have problems such as lack of spatial and time resolution, and assumptions that may or may not correspond to how nature actually works. Due to the complexity of the actual climate system, even a tiny piece of garbage in the input to a climate model will quickly make the output all garbage. If one knows anything about Chaos Theory, one will doubt any present or even future climate model.
The sun, ocean cycles, recovery from the little ice age, and urban heat island effects, account for all but about 0.2 to 0.3 degrees C of the recent warming. Climate sensitivity to CO2 is about 0.5 to 0.6 degrees C for CO2 doubling.

"Thirteen people have been arrested after environmental activists abseiled off the Sydney Harbour Bridge to demand action on climate change. The Greenpeace supporters launched themselves from a public walkway on the western side of the structure at dawn on Tuesday, calling on the major federal political parties to declare a “climate emergency”.  They unfurled banners emblazoned with “100% renewables” and “make coal history” as they dangled beneath the bridge. Officers from NSW Police, with help from PolAir, marine and rescue crews, removed several protesters from the bridge by 8am and arrested 10 people. Three activists remained hanging off the bridge on ropes but were removed and arrested by 9.30am.

The protest comes four days before Australians head to the polls in the federal election. The federal Labor senator Kristina Keneally said she didn’t condone the illegal protest but understood the activists’ frustrations. “Right now people are wanting action on climate change, they want a government that takes the issue seriously and takes real action,” she told Sky News on Tuesday. “I don’t agree with these protesters’ methods, (but) I understand their frustrations; it’s one shared by the Australian people.” "
"It brings a whole new meaning to grabbing some grub for lunch. Roasted crickets are to go on sale this week at outlets of a London snack brand – the first time in the UK edible insects will appear on the regular daily menu at a takeaway food chain. The crunchy whole crickets, from Eat Grub, will be available in Abokado shops across London from Tuesday as part of the chain’s new spring menu. The sweet chilli and lime-flavoured snack will join its customisable range of toppings for fresh salads, poke bowls and hotpots, and also be available as bagged snacks alongside nuts, edamame and popcorn.  Environmental experts have long recommended insects as a sustainable food source that could help cut food poverty and reduce the damaging impact of meat production. Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects, and they could help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population. Abokado’s managing director, Kara Alderin, said: “Abokado is all about customisation and offering our customers variety of different options to enhance their meals. We currently have a dozen unique toppings and dressings on offer, and this is an exciting addition to the range.” She said the roasted crickets were “quirky, but packed with flavour and protein they are the way forward in healthy, sustainable snacking”. To win over prospective new shoppers who might balk at bugs for lunch, Abokado will be offering Eat Grub samplings in its 23 stores and as part of local street marketing. Insect products from Eat Grub, a London-based food startup, can now be found in more than 700 outlets across Europe. Sainsbury’s, which was the first UK supermarket to start selling edible insects last November, stocks its Smoky BBQ flavoured crickets. In a report to be published this week, the supermarket is expected to highlight insect protein as a key food of the future. In the UK, food choices are becoming increasingly important in the debate about climate change, reflected in the rise of “flexitarianism”, whereby a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat. In the UK, edible insects have so far been predominantly limited to unusual pop-ups or online outlets and feature on a few restaurant menus. For consumers seeking an easier way into insect consumption, pasta, protein bars and granola bars made from insect flour went on sale in Selfridges in January. Eat Grub’s co-founder Shami Radia said: “It’s great to have Abokado supporting us in spreading the grub love; the fun way they approach food and innovation is exactly what we need to make eating insects more mainstream.”"

"4 April, 1.35pm As the Twin Otter plane engines roar into action, the familiar sound triggers a tingle of excitement in my stomach: I’m out on fieldwork.  We are the European Space Agency (ESA) land ice ground team. Our goal is to make measurements of the snow density and layering on the Greenland ice sheet. We will use the data to validate satellite altimetry measurements of the ice sheet surface, to improve the accuracy with which we can monitor how it has changed over time. As we take off from Ilulissat airport, looking out of the plane I can see a mess of broken icebergs and sea ice in the ocean. Small fishing vessels are dotted around in Disko Bay, leaving a trail of white frothy ocean in their wake. The boats are dwarfed by the vast size of the giant icebergs that surround them, and serve as a permanent reminder that “normal” life in this part of the world sits at the extreme edge of where humans can live. We were grounded in Ilulissat for three days before leaving because of a storm passing through. It’s normal to have bad storms in April, but none of us expected rain so early in the spring. A local dog sled owner I spoke to said that he had never seen it rain in Greenland at this time of year. Rain is just temporary weather and shouldn’t be mistaken for longer-term more permanent climate change. However, records from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) show that the frequency of abnormally warm temperatures in Ilulissat is increasing, so rain storms such as the one we experienced are further evidence that the polar regions are changing rapidly. 4 April, 3pm Time on the ice is limited today. We waited on standby all morning hoping for the wind speed to lower enough for us to take off, and for satellite images to show the cloud clearing up on the ice sheet. Weather delays can pull the plug on the best laid plans at any moment. Now in the air, crammed in between the radar and ice coring kit (essential for our scientific experiments), a heap of down jackets, boxes of Icelandic chocolate bars and the spare fuel tank, we plan our time carefully. Our field site is located next to Jakobshavn Isbrae, the fastest glacier in the world, which satellites have shown is thinning at a rate of over 20 meters per year at its terminus. That’s ice the height of a five-storey building, lost every year. 4 April, 4.30pm As the plane touches down, we bounce over hard sasstruggi, and special skis fixed around the wheels prevent us from sinking into the snow. These snow “dunes” are formed by persistent winds blowing the snow into sculpted ridges. The moment we land, a blast of cold dry air hits us and our breath is immediately visible, growing in clouds around us. It’s -36C outside, but there is barely any wind so it’s a beautiful day for ice coring. Ines, our PhD researcher, starts the magnaprobe experiment, using an instrument that measures the depth of the very top snow layer. She looks like a hi-tech ghostbuster, walking around the site with the backpack on and a large probe. For Ines, this campaign is particularly exciting as it’s her first time on an ice sheet, but this will be my fifth trip. As with every research project I work on, our team is an international group of scientists from France, the UK, Denmark, Brazil, Portugal, Italy and the US. We only have an hour on the ground, so Sebastian Bjerregaard Simonsen,a colleague from the Danish Technical University,and I work together as a slick team, systematically drilling down through the ice sheet roughly 80 centimetres at a time, then hauling the heavy drill out of the ground. As we huddle round the barrel to push the section of core out, we are both excited to see the layers of snow and ice revealed for the first time. The ice core looks like layers of a cake, with thicker opaque white sections of snow interspersed with thinner layers of water ice. The thickness of the layers isn’t even, and it tells us a story about warm melt events that have taken place over the last 10 years on the Greenland ice sheet. 4 April, 5.30pm Just as we hit our target depth of seven metres for the ice core, the airborne team overfly us, collecting radar measurements of the snow layering. With all the experiments successfully completed, we fly back to Akureyri. 4 April, 7.30pm As dusk turns to night we touch down at Constable Point on the east coast of Greenland for the final refuelling stop before heading back to Iceland. We will be analysing the ice cores through the night. Once the cores are pulled up from the ground it’s a race against time to collect the measurements we need before these long tubes of ice start to melt. There are no freezers big enough to preserve the intact cores so we have to burn the midnight oil. 5 April, 5am By sunrise the next morning we are all wide-eyed and exhausted, but it’s a small price we are happy to pay. The future most likely holds extreme change for our planet’s environment, and the polar regions are already evolving rapidly. The data we have gathered on this campaign will be used to improve how satellites measure changes in the ice sheets. This data is critical as it is currently the only method we have of monitoring sea levels in Greenland, and are used for flood defence planning along coastlines around the world. It’s a privilege to be in the field contributing to that understanding first hand. Anna Hogg is a research fellow in the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds"
"Some want a clear conscience. Others want to see if they are up to the challenge. But none of them want to wait until 2050 to cut their carbon emissions down to near-zero. Across the country, environmentalists of all ages – from seven to 75 – are taking action now to lead low-carbon lives.  Last week, the government’s official advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change, recommended that the UK set a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. The committee’s report acknowledged that cutting emissions to zero would be challenging and spell the end of petrol and diesel cars, as well as gas boilers. To achieve this target, people will have to fly less, waste less and eat less meat. But many people are already living like this, and some are even doing so in eco “superhomes” – houses which have been adapted to achieve a 60% or more reduction in carbon usage. The Observer spoke to three residents to find out how they have adapted their homes and their lives to reduce carbon emissions. “My husband Chris and I are Quakers. Eleven years ago, we downsized to a semi-detached house in Bournville. To make our new home energy efficient, we insulated as much as we could – even under the floorboards. We installed double glazing and put solar panels on a pergola in the garden. In total, we’ve reduced our home’s carbon emissions by 85%. We open the house to show people what we’ve done. Our diet is now 60% to 70% vegan, and the remainder vegetarian. We grow a lot of our fruit and vegetables on our allotment. We eat seasonally and I bake my own bread. Even though we own a car, we rarely drive and try to walk as much as we can or take the bus. We avoid flying, preferring to travel by train. We mend our clothes and furniture. When I feel I need to buy something, I try to get it from a charity shop, borrow it from a neighbour or ask for it on Freecycle or Freegle, where people advertise things they want to get rid of. We bank with Triodos Bank. It costs us a few pounds each month, but it means we know our money will be used for ethical and sustainable purposes, not fossil fuel exploration or companies.  I feel guilty about what people of my generation have done. I don’t want to leave behind a damaged world for my four grandchildren. But I think what really drove me to make changes was wanting to see just how sustainable we could make our lives now. It has been an enjoyable challenge, educating myself and adapting my lifestyle. It’s fun.” “I’m disabled and live with my parents Pat, 66, and John, 71, in a 1958 bungalow. We’ve done the obvious things like changing our boiler, adding insulation and installing solar panels but we’ve also taken some more unusual steps to lower our carbon emissions. For example, we’ve converted a chest freezer into a fridge, using a gadget that cuts the power once it reaches a certain temperature. The cold air doesn’t fall out like it did with our previous front-opening fridge, so it uses half the electricity. We charge our electric car with our solar panels and, on sunny days, we use a ‘sun oven’ to cook outside – it uses mirrors to concentrate the heat and it’s a real joy, eating a meal or cake baked with just sunshine. We also use a method called haybox cooking to cook inside: bringing a soup to boil and then putting it in an insulated box for an hour or two. It carries on cooking in its own heat, saving fuel. The waste water from our sink drains into our toilet cistern, so we reuse the water the next time we flush the toilet. All our vegetables are seasonal, grown either in our garden or on a local organic farm. My meals are 80% vegan, and 20% vegetarian. Vegan food is delicious – it’s a cuisine. I try to reuse and repair my belongings. I use the money I save to spend more on products I do buy. My clothes are either secondhand or organic. I have a Fairphone – it’s designed so that the individual parts can be easily replaced when they break. I don’t buy wrapping paper, I reuse an old duvet cover I cut up into squares. In total, we’ve reduced our home’s carbon emissions by 93%. I’ve enjoyed making all these changes – they’ve been fun – and I feel part of a big movement. I want to be able to say to the next generation: I tried to prevent runaway climate change. If I didn’t, I would feel I was committing a wrong.”  “My wife and I have two kids: Anouk, 12 and Laurie, seven. We used to live on a boat. Ten years ago, we moved into a freezing cold 1920s terraced house in Shepherd’s Bush. Straightaway, we started converting it – I did a lot of the work myself. I insulated it and added energy efficient windows, electric underfloor heating and an air-source heat pump. I also installed solar panels and a battery bank. This provides most of the energy our family needs all year round. We increased our energy efficiency by nearly 70%. I reckon we must be saving £1,000 a year on our energy bills. We buy organic food from Lidl, grow our own fruit using harvested rainwater and have cut down the amount of meat and dairy we eat, saving us about £60 a month. Our kids love vegetables and vegetarian meals, because they’ve always had them. Our favourite family meal is pea soup. We all enjoy shopping in second-hand clothes shops and getting bargains for £2, but the children do shop at Primark too, and will sometimes eat at McDonald’s and buy plastic toys or electric gadgets. We don’t try to restrict them. We just try to recycle and repair, and promote a green lifestyle. They do get a bit fed up of me preaching about renewable energy, but at the same time, I know they feel very strongly about climate catastrophe. I’m not just doing this for my kids and my community. I’m also doing it for myself. I want to be able to say, in the future: I have not taken part in the destruction of this planet. I can’t make a massive difference alone. But I can help a little and that’s what I’m doing. So when there are water shortages one day and floods the next, storms, heatwaves and bug infestations, when we are living in a horror movie in 10 or 20 years time, I will have a clear conscience.”"
"The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has welcomed an “urgent change” by Cambridge University, after it agreed to provide fully costed plans setting out how it could divest multibillion-pound endowments from fossil fuel corporations. The university’s management accepted a motion, known as a grace, which urged Cambridge to “set out fully the advantages and disadvantages, including the social and political ones”, of divestment from global coal, oil and gas companies. The grace, agreed without adjustments by management, follows an escalating campaign by staff and students concerned about Cambridge’s financial backing for the fossil fuel industry. Williams said: “It is an important message to our own society and national institutions, but also to all those vulnerable populations across the world who are most at risk from climate change; and it is good to see that clear and focused advocacy in the university has produced so welcome and urgent a change.” The grace was signed by 324 academics, which campaigners said represented one of the largest totals in the university’s history. The academic and Green party MEP candidate Jeremy Caddick, who helped push the motion, said: “Two years ago, we asked the university to divest from fossil fuels. Since then, the administration has done everything it can to avoid the question, so I am delighted that the council have accepted this latest grace.” This year, Clare Hall, the college of the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, became the latest to commit to fully divest funds from fossil fuels. The college also said it would withdraw money invested in the university’s £3.2bn central fund if it did not divest within five years. Awareness of the scale of the ecological crisis has been growing. Last month, more than 1,000 people were arrested during civil disobedience protests across London. Last week, parliament became the latest body to declare a climate emergency. And on Monday, a UN report detailed the urgent threat to human society from the loss of Earth’s natural life. Campaigners say Cambridge is too closely entwined with the fossil fuel industry. In January, the Guardian revealed the university had been offered two multimillion-pound donations from global fossil fuel corporations at the same time it was considering calls to divest its endowment fund. The author and Cambridge academic Robert Macfarlane said it was time for the university to act with urgency. “It is good news that Cambridge has at last accepted the need to re-evaluate its position on divestment,” he said. “Every week, new research, some of it coming out of Cambridge itself, further clarifies the severity of the climate crisis and the speed with which change is happening.” A spokesperson for the Cambridge zero carbon society, the group campaigning for divestment, said: “The university must produce costed strategies for how it can divest, alongside an evaluation of the social and moral factors in divestment, as hundreds of academics have demanded. “This is a second chance for the university to end their complicity in the climate crisis and align its economic policy with the scientific evidence produced at this very institution.” A spokesperson for the university said it recognised climate change was “a real and present danger” and had made two appointments to underline its commitment in the area. Cambridge said Emily Shuckburgh from the British Antarctic Survey had been appointed as the first director of the university’s carbon futures initiative. Toope described it as a critical role. “Emily is the ideal person to lead this initiative, which will pool research from across the university to address the greatest challenge the world faces today,” he said. The university has also appointed Ellen Quigley to “work with the chief financial officer to establish a programme of research into responsible investment”."
"Your editorial (13 May) correctly states that Britain needs a Green New Deal now, and indeed in your letters page last autumn (10 September) our report detailing what form such a “jobs in every constituency” Green New Deal could take, and how to pay for it, was supported by a cross-party group of MPs, NGO leaders and academics. Since then the idea has gained international traction thanks to the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the support of grassroots movements. The US approach also includes the need to improve economic security for the majority, which has widened its support base. Finally, the scientific data underscoring the need to act in the next 10 years to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss has resulted in unprecedented activist pressure on politicians to respond. As a result, all opposition parties are calling for the declaration of a climate emergency, but the government’s actual policies – from fracking to the rollback of support for renewables and energy efficiency – are making things worse. Yet all is not lost. At the end of last year more than 60 Tory MPs signed an all-party letter calling on the prime minister to back a net zero-emissions target ahead of 2050. Clearly the disconnect here is the lack of necessary political will. MPs should take inspiration from President Kennedy’s call in 1961 to put a man on the moon within a decade, but this time the priority must be to save the planet, rather than leave it.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group  • Orthodox economic theory is a spent force because it is based on a false premise: the wealth creation delusion. What is termed wealth creation is actually a process that destroys our planet’s natural wealth. Monetary wealth in the form of GDP is attributed to the destructive process to create the delusion of wealth creation. The consequences for our life-giving planetary systems, and ultimately our survival, are fast becoming apparent. We cannot tinker with such a drastically flawed system; we need a new philosophy of the meaning of life and living if we are to sustain human life. Sustainability necessitates extracting utility from nature without destroying it, and sharing out the proceeds.John StoneThames Ditton, Surrey • “Britain needs something like Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLake Aussenalster in Hamburg, Germany rarely freezes over enough to allow tens of thousands to go skating on it. The ice has to be at leat 18 cm thick before officials declare it safe to walk on. The last time that happened was in 1997. This weekend it was thick enough to do so again.

This of course is because of galloping global warming. I have to point out that it hasn’t frozen completely solid – but solid enough for officials to give the green light for people to walk on without risk. Does anyone have the data on the years it has been officially opened?

Klimaretter has a useless piece here where the author calls the Fukushima event the spark that is setting off the Green Industrial Revolution, and can hardly contain his glee. That may be true in some countries, at least for now.
Industrialisation of rural and natural areas. Photo credit: http://www.treehugger.com
But what the author does not mention is that many true greens are getting awfully uneasy about the current wide-scale massacre and mechanisation of the the world’s most beautiful mountain ridges, coastal areas and rural landscapes. And unless this madness is stopped, you aint seen nothing yet.
Groups like Klimaretter, irreversibly blinded by dogmatism and anti-carbon fanaticism, hacks of the green industry, anti-carbon religion and Big Green Finance, are unwittingly pushing for the mass desecration of natural landscape and rural beauty. Yes – let’s ruin the surface of the planet because we think it’ll tame and preserve the behaviour of the atmosphere.

True greens and skeptics may not agree on a lot of things, but we can all agree that the industrialisation of our countryside is a mortal sin against our natural heritage.
This is big industry, aided and abetted by the government, making a ton of money at the expense of little guys.
My hope is that the true greens will some day SOON realise that all this hype about CO2 causing climate change is wildy exaggerated by special interests (GE, Big Gas, banks and carbon traders, reinsurers, etc.) and that all this ugly mechanisation is for literally nothing.
My plea to greens is that they reconsider all this – and join up with the budding resistance to this madness – to fight for the preservation of our landscape. Let’s use the legal system to choke these vandalising bastards.
I was born and raised in northern Vermont in some of the most beautíful countryside you can imagine. Today, when I go back and visit, I get so depressed. The Green Mountains are now getting transformed into the Machine Mountains. Mountain tops are being cleared of forests, flattened, and scarred by service roads.

Vermont’s beauty in many of its most treasured rural areas is now gone forever -at least in my case. I will never again see these areas in their original natural beauty- not in my lifetime. Worse – far more of this is on the way. Local residents and their rights have no chance against the might of the industry. They are being steamrolled.
It’s heart-breaking enough to go back to my childhood farm my father owned and to find that it’s been parceled up and homes have been built on it. But it is far more depressing to see that all around the mountain ridges we once marveled have since been industrialised.
Is this what we really want? Is this how we protect the atmosphere and conserve its behaviour? We are living in a nightmare.
http://www.globalenvironmental.com/news/sheffield-wind-project-nearly-complete-123.php
This is only the very beginning – multiply all of this by 100, or even 1000. To fulfil the dreams of the wind energy industry and the financiers behind the carbon credit scheme, MANY MANY MORE are going to be put up. EVERYWHERE.
Thankfully the resistance to this madness has already begun. And so I am pleading for open minded true greens, like myself,  to take a look at grassroots groups that are resisting this massive industrial encroachment into our countryside treasures. See here for example. http://current.com/1cvfm4c, and join up with them.

Above are photos of the crimes they have committed against a hilltops not far from my childhood farm. The days of seeing this natural landscape are gone – forever. Some day wiser people are going to say, “My God! what kind of madness and dogmatism could have possibly driven this?” I am sure they will. But in the meantime the price is going to be really high and the scars will take a long time to heal.
I bought some property 5 years ago and here are some of the views in the area.

Rural Vermont – here still free of industrialisation. But how much longer? (Photo: P Gosselin)
I wonder how long it’ll be before that gets industrially vandalised. Worse, this is Vermont, where already 95% of its electricity comes from either hydro or Vermont Yankee nuclear power – i.e. practically carbon-free! So all the wind parks are just monuments of stupidity.
There is one exception in Vermont – in rich Chittenden county, where all the fat-cats live , many of whom are devout “environmentalists”. So much so that no windmills will be installed on the mountain ridges that they view from their mansions on Spear Street in Burlington. Here’s a view from Charlotte. As long as the fat cat environmentalists are living there, don’t expect to see windmills in their backyards. They belong elsewhere.

There are thousands of websites and photos that document the ravaging of the earth’s natural rural beauty. Remember, this is just the beginning of what these bastards intend to do. Again – “caused by arrogance, by dogma, by ignorance” (Jacob Bronowski).
So I strongly urge you all to seek out rural preservationist groups who are fighting to preserve rural beauty and to join their cause. There are other ways of producing energy that are far less destructive.

"More than 20 native animals would disappear from the Great Dividing Range before the end of the century if global emissions continue at business as usual rates, according to new analysis by Australian researchers. The University of Queensland and Australian Conservation Foundation study, published this week in Global Ecology and Conservation, examines native fauna in a part of the country that is home to three-quarters of the population and much of Australia’s biodiversity. The scientists and policy experts used climate models from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change to assess how many endemic species could face extinction in the Great Dividing Range due to warming temperatures. They examined 1,062 native species, and found 26 would go extinct by 2085 if the currently high global emissions trajectory continues. In that scenario, they assumed global warming of 3.7C by 2085. Of the 26 species the researchers said would not survive, 11 are found only in the Great Dividing Range and nowhere else on earth. Under a lower emissions pathway of 1.8C the Great Dividing Range would become climatically unsuitable for 16 species by 2085, including the 11 endemic species. “The way emissions are tracking, we will lose a raft of species found nowhere else in the world, including the blue-winged parrot, Mount Claro rock wallaby, magnificent brood frog and painted spadefoot toad,” the study’s lead author, Sean Maxwell, said. Another author, James Watson, said: “The fact is that there are 11 endemic species, which based off of this research, it appears they will be blasted off the face of the earth because there’s nowhere suitable for them to live.” “That’s the really sad thing from this piece.” But the researchers identify some hope for the remaining 1,036 animals for which they forecast some climatically suitable habitat would remain even under the most aggressive scenarios they modelled. The paper identifies two large sections of habitat, one in northern Queensland and another in northern New South Wales, that would benefit the survival of hundreds of species if they were protected. Watson said that could be done by governments establishing protected areas in those spaces, or through other means, such as stewardship programs that reward farmers and other landholders who keep habitat intact rather than clear it. Another author, James Trezise from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the research found at least 673 animals would benefit from protecting intact habitat, which he said was a strong argument for Australian governments prioritising policies to avoid deforestation. They found another 270 species would be heavily reliant on governments committing to restoring habitat areas in southern Queensland, southern NSW and northern Victoria that had already been modified in some form by agriculture and other activities. “We need to rapidly protect critical habitats and climate refuges for species if we are to give wildlife a chance in the face of climate change,” Trezise said. “The next Australian government will have to step up on protecting the environment. This means introducing stronger national environment laws and investing in new protected areas, wildlife corridors and ecosystem restoration.”"
"Modelling by BAEconomics that has been used to attack Labor’s climate policies is a “complete outlier” according to an analysis of more than 20 other recent modelling exercises on the effect of higher climate targets on the economy and electricity sector. The Australia Institute has published a review comparing the work of Brian Fisher with 19 other reports and and three Treasury models that examined the potential effects of higher climate targets.  Ten of those reports examined the economy-wide effects of higher targets, while 12 looked at the impacts on the electricity sector, including five reports modelling 100% renewable energy. The analysis found none of the reports showed greater action to address climate change was “economy wrecking” and that higher targets had, at most, “a very small impact on GDP growth compared to no action”. The Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said Fisher’s models had put the GDP impacts of climate action at levels five to 10 times higher than every other economy-wide model, including those from Warwick McKibbin, Climateworks, the Australian National University, CSIRO, Victoria University and the three Treasury models. “There is extensive literature on the cost of climate action in Australia including modelling from or commissioned by the government,” Merzian said. “All 22 reports analysed show the cost of higher emission reduction targets is small, even when ignoring the benefits. “Every reputable institution modelling climate costs, including the government’s own economic advisers and Treasury, show higher climate ambition has a negligible impact on the economy.” Fisher’s analysis looked at the cost of Labor’s 45% climate target across a range of scenarios, with and without the use of international permits. It claimed the cumulative costs to GDP could range from $264bn to $542bn between 2020 and 2030. Fisher’s analysis has been widely criticised for, among other things, assumptions about abatement costs that the Australian National University’s Frank Jotzo has said are implausibly high. The Australia Institute analysis finds that economy-wide models in other reports put the impact on GDP growth in every scenario at no more than 1.8% of GDP, but Fisher’s models put lost GDP growth at levels as high as 22%. “Fisher’s claims regarding the so-called huge economy-wide impacts and electricity price hikes are a complete outlier compared to over 20 other pieces of similar research,” Merzian said. “These claims do not stack up against the body of literature available or the actual Australian economic experience during the carbon price period, which saw 2% economic growth with 5% emissions reductions.” The Australia Institute found that the 12 reports examining the electricity sector showed higher ambition targets would reduce power costs, or result in “a modest and manageable increase”, including for 100% renewables. “The majority of Australians want the country to mobilise in a state of emergency to combat climate change with the same cooperation and commitment as a war effort,” Merzian said. “Meanwhile the Coalition government has gone to great lengths to cherry-pick contrary advice and delay serious climate action.” Comment was sought from Fisher."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe climate summit in Durban is coming up and so expect a steady stream of shocking, frightful climate reports to come out over the weeks ahead. The latest comes from the US Department of Energy, which shows that global man-made CO2 emissions have reached shocking record levels.
Last year more than 9100 million tons of CO2 were emitted into the atmosphere. The reaction by the media in Germany today has been one of utter horror.
Global temps fall as CO2 rises to ""record levels"".
I guess the doom and fright that activists feel is understandable: global temperatures today are a whole tenth of a degree Celsius above normal and haven’t risen in about 15 years (in fact they are dropping), the third world countries are developing and living better, and the global economy has rebounded…oh horrors!
The German online CO2 Handel presents a news release from the German Press Agency DPA:
Just weeks before the UN climate conference in Durban South Africa, the US Department of Energy spooks the world with grim news: New preliminary results show that the emissions of the climate-killing gas Co2 is rising dramatically.

Alone in China and India CO2 emissions emissions climbed 10 percent.”
German Green Party Chairwoman Claudia Roth called the latest figures “alarming at an extreme scale.” Eberhard Brandes, Chairman of WWF Germany, is outraged and said: “The data coming out of the USA are shocking and exceed the worst our fears and pessimistic scenarios.” While Halloween takes place one day a year in the USA, in Germany it’s a year-round affair.
In comic fashion, the German Press Agency DPA blasted and blamed the USA, but then added:
The international community of nations has failed miserably.” In the USA CO2 emissions compared to last year decreased – in Germany on the other hand they increased.”
Decreased? Who cares – let’s blame the capitalists any way.

"The Green New Deal is probably the most fashionable policy in the English-speaking world. In Britain it is advocated by both Tory MPs and Jeremy Corbyn; while a non-partisan Canadian coalition of nearly 70 groups are backing such a scheme. However, it has been made flesh by US Democrats, in particular the political phenomenon in the US House of Representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has spelled out what a Green New Deal involves in a House resolution: rejecting economic orthodoxy to confront climate change. She ought to be congratulated twice over. At present the thinking is for governments to tackle global warming by including the social cost of carbon in the prices people pay, either through a carbon tax or a system of tradable carbon-emission permits. Such ideas have a role to play in changing the way societies consume and produce energy, but they are only moving us incrementally – if at all – towards sustainability. Global emissions of carbon dioxide are higher than they have ever been, almost three decades after the first global conference aimed at reducing them. The situation is becoming dangerous for human life. The latest figures show there is little more than a decade to save ourselves and the other creatures with whom we share the planet. To do so we must decouple economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction.  This will not be easy. Economic power has become increasingly concentrated, giving rise to grotesque levels of inequality – both within and among countries. With financial speculation now a feature of capitalism, so are fraud and instability. Meanwhile, investment in public goods across the globe has stagnated. Growth increasingly relies on resource extraction, threatening civilisation itself. Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s plan recognises this and is rooted in making the economy both greener and more equitable. Her prospectus calls for a reduction in the inequality of income and wealth, essential given that the world’s richest 10% are responsible for half of carbon emissions. It sees large public spending to transform the US economy with an industrial base that would be net-zero in carbon emissions in a few decades. The plan is to create good job opportunities as the economy is made sustainably viable for the future. Critics claim such ideas are pie-in-the-sky and would require huge spending, sparking inflation or resulting in massive tax increases. Democratic leaders fret that it would make the party unelectable in conservative-leaning US states. Yet the issue is not the money to pay for the investments proposed. US government deficits are historically normal and often economically necessary. The constraint is what a nation can produce. As the economist Stephanie Kelton, who is advising Bernie Sanders, notes in her defence of the Green New Deal: “Inflation isn’t triggered by the amount of money the government creates but by the availability of biophysical resources that money tries to go out and buy.” Policymakers ought not wait for economic theory to catch up to real-world events. Ms Ocasio-Cortez rightly sees parallels with the response to the 1930s crisis where President Roosevelt dispensed with economic orthodoxy and tamed Big Finance. He created a New Deal jobs programme that employed millions, oversaw a massive expansion of government and remade the US industrial base. Humanity will run out of limited global resources long before the US runs out of dollars. Britain needs something like Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. And we need it now – before it is too late."
"Heavy industry companies in Australia have been given the green light to increase their greenhouse gas emissions by nearly a third without penalty under the Coalition’s climate change policy. An analysis of a scheme known as the “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Coalition’s Direct Action policy, found the government regulator has approved a 32% increase in how much large industrial facilities are allowed to emit each year since the policy was introduced. While not every company emits up to their limit under the scheme, the most recent data, for 2017-18, shows emissions from large industry are up 12% since 2015. The increases have been signed off despite the safeguard mechanism having been promised to limit emissions from big polluters to ensure they do not just cancel out cuts paid for by taxpayers through the other half of Direct Action, the emissions reduction fund. The analysis by RepuTex, an energy and emissions research firm, found the increase in recorded emissions was set to wipe out the entire $2.55bn committed to pollution cuts over the past five years. Most of that has gone to restoring and protecting habitat and cutting pollution at landfill sites. “This is effectively money going down the drain,” RepuTex executive director Hugh Grossman said. Grossman said, though rarely discussed, the “safeguard mechanism” was Australia’s climate policy Achilles’ heel. He said it needed to be weighed alongside any cuts purchased through the emissions reduction fund, which the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has renamed a “climate solutions” fund. “In simple terms, Australia’s emission reduction target won’t be met until industrial emissions growth is constrained,” Grossman said. Industrial sites under the safeguard mechanism are the main driver of the continuing rise in Australia’s national emissions. The most recent government data shows emissions rose 0.9% in the year to September, a point Morrison has conceded during the campaign. Much of the increase is due to a 19.7% expansion of the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry, which is covered by the mechanism. The Coalition has changed how it describes the safeguard mechanism over time. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure emissions cuts contracted through the emissions reduction fund were not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. A government climate policy document released in February said the mechanism required Australia’s largest emitters to “measure, report and manage” their emissions, but did not say it would limit pollution. The government plans further changes to the scheme that are expected to allow more industrial sites to change their emissions limit. When the scheme began, most sites received limits, known as baselines, equivalent to their highest pollution level between 2009 and 2014. Companies that went beyond their baseline had to buy carbon credits to offset the breach. This has happened in a handful of cases. But companies could also apply to increase their baseline if their production levels were expected to rise or they had started operating more recently. About 100 companies have applied for a higher pollution limit, known as a “calculated baseline”. After consulting with industry, the government announced in March it would allow all companies to adopt a calculated baseline to “improve operation of the scheme, reduce costs for business and make it fairer and simpler”. Grossman said this was expected to lead to further emissions increases beyond those already approved. RepuTex found the combined baseline levels, or limits, of companies under the scheme had increased from 151m tonnes to 200m tonnes a year since the scheme was introduced, a 32% rise. Actual annual emissions from industrial sites under the scheme have increased from 139m tonnes to 155m tonnes since it was introduced, a 12% jump. RepuTex forecasts they will rise to 166m tonnes a year. It would lead to a total of 280m tonnes of extra emissions from Australian industry by 2030 – significantly more than the 193m tonnes of cuts that have signed up through the emissions reduction fund. Morrison has promised $2bn additional funding for the rebadged “climate solutions” fund if re-elected over 15 years. RepuTex found this could only offset the rise in industrial emissions – a situation the analysts describe as “running to stand still” – and not lead to a cut in national emissions as the government has promised. Labor says it would strengthen and expand the safeguard mechanism so polluters have to cut their combined emissions 45% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. It promises to protect export industries from the full cost of emissions reductions. Many details of how it would transform the scheme remain unexplained. The government says Labor’s plans would hurt production and employment, while it will allow industry to grow. The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute produced broadly similar results to RepuTex in a separate analysis of the safeguard mechanism, finding it does almost nothing to limit emissions. Tom Swann, senior researcher with the institute, said LNG facilities were responsible for the largest breaches of emissions limits. Chevron’s Gorgon development in the Pilbara, site of a long promised but to date unsuccessful carbon capture and storage project, and Woodside’s North West Shelf project emitted 680,000 tonnes and 160,000 tonnes beyond their limits respectively. Heavy industry is responsible for about a quarter of Australia’s emissions. RepuTex expects it to pass electricity next year to become the biggest contributor to national pollution."
"The national debate about climate policy is off the rails again. We should be talking about positioning Australia economically for the low-carbon future, making use of our huge opportunities to produce low-cost clean energy, and mobilising investment. We should be having a serious conversation about what are the best policies needed for that. And we should understand the implications of Australia’s climate policy for our long-term competitiveness and international standing.  Instead it’s the carbon wars once more. A confected furore over the presumed cumulative economic cost dominates the headlines, provoked by a single short report with some scary-looking numbers. The paper by Brian Fisher is a private black-box modelling exercise of no particular standing that uses outdated assumptions. But we still have news reports citing its supposed findings that “the Labor emissions target would subtract at least $264bn from gross national product by 2030”, and numbers as high as $542bn have also been used. There is a tendency for climate policy modelling assumptions to be highly conservative. Fisher’s modelling is an extreme example, painting the picture of an inflexible economy where clean technology is exorbitantly costly. Just consider the carbon prices in some of the scenarios, of $300-400 per tonne of carbon dioxide. Any sensible policies to cut emissions will come at a small fraction of that. As a measure of how ridiculous such carbon prices are, consider that it would now cost less than half that amount to suck carbon dioxide straight out of the atmosphere and sequester it, using purpose built plants. That’s the highest cost option one might consider right now if the world were to go all out on climate action. In reality, carbon costs are far lower. The key for Australia is renewable energy. Wind farms and solar parks built now can provide energy for around $50 per megawatt hour. That is half the current average wholesale price which is set mostly by fossil fuel plants. Renewables keep getting cheaper, and they will push coal out of the market. Intermittent power output can be firmed through storage and better interconnections, at moderate cost. A $400 carbon price implies a penalty of around $350 per megawatt hour for a typical black coal fired power generator. Just a fraction of that would make all coal power stations immediately uneconomic. So it is not a question of high carbon prices or higher electricity prices. It is how governments can help that process of transition along. The answers include stable policy to give investors confidence, a carbon policy for the electricity sector that is integrated with carbon policy for the rest of the economy, sensible investment in transmission and energy storage, making coal plant closures more predictable, and helping with structural adjustment in regions where coal plants close. Industry will switch from coal and gas to using zero-carbon electricity, and do so faster with a price signal on carbon. Electric vehicles will quickly be cheaper on a lifecycle basis than petrol or diesel cars. All this is now in reach because clean technologies are becoming cheap. The modelling in the headlines this week seems to assume we’re stuck in the early 2000s. The Fisher paper also ignores the opportunities for cheap abatement in other sectors, particularly agriculture and land use. Lots can be done at low cost to reduce agricultural emissions and sequester more carbon in vegetation and soils. The Coalition’s Emissions Reduction Fund pays an average of $12 per tonne for emissions reductions from land projects. Under Labor’s policies, industry could fund land-based emissions offsets. There could also be R&D for low-emissions agriculture and rules to stop broad-scale land clearing. The key is to put policies in place that allow efficient, broad-based and durable action. An economy-wide carbon price would be the ideal centrepiece. That still seems too difficult politically, but a patchwork of price-based policies across the economy could evolve into a consistent system. And it makes sense to allow international trading of emissions. Australian businesses could trade in emissions markets in the EU, California and many other jurisdictions. The Australian government could partner with developing countries that are happy to do more to cut emissions if rich countries support them. Renewable electrification paid for by Australian aid in the Pacific and Eastern Indonesia comes to mind. The credit for emissions reductions achieved by 2030 could be shared between Australia and the developing country partners. If Australia met a 45% reduction target in this way, we would encourage other nations to do more, and make a contribution to the planned global ratcheting up of the Paris Agreement. If we stick with a 26% target this would be seen as weak. The longer term game holds huge opportunity for Australia. In a world that goes towards net zero emissions, Australia is superbly positioned. Thanks to geography and climate, we can produce practically unlimited amounts of cheap renewable energy. An almost fully decarbonized domestic energy supply is not the end point. Let’s talk about 200% renewables: half used here, half exported to countries that are less favourably endowed, in the form of hydrogen, higher order synthetic fuels and energy intensive commodities produced in Australia using renewable power. Then let’s talk about how to facilitate the massive investments for Australia’s renewable energy future, who gets what share of the profits, how we support economic diversification in regions where coal mining will cease, and how this relates to ideas about our future economic prosperity. Those are the conversations worth having. Frank Jotzo is a professor at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy, and co-director of the Energy Transition Hub"
"Donald Trump’s reluctance to address climate change is set to cost his business empire millions of dollars in fines levied by New York City due to the amount of pollution emitted by Trump-owned buildings.  According to data shared with the Guardian, eight Trump properties in New York City do not comply with new regulations designed to slash greenhouse gas emissions. This means the Trump Organization is on track to be hit with fines of $2.1m every year from 2030, unless its buildings are made more environmentally friendly. According to city officials, the president’s eight largest New York properties pump out around 27,000 tons of planet-warming gases every ear, the equivalent of 5,800 cars. The buildings that exceed the new pollution thresholds include Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, and the Trump Building on Wall Street. The biggest potential offender is Trump International Hotel & Tower, a 583ft skyscraper that looms over the south-west corner of Central Park. The building is on course to be fined $850,871 a year if no improvements are made to its energy efficiency. The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, will hold a rally outside Trump Tower on Monday, seeking to highlight the looming penalties. “President Trump, you’re on notice,” de Blasio said. “Your polluting buildings are part of the problem. Cut your emissions or pay the price.” The fines are part of legislation passed by the city council in April that seeks to cut planet-warming emissions from the city’s largest buildings. All premises larger than 25,000ft – a total of 50,000 buildings – will be required to cut overall emissions 40% or face annual fines. The new standards, hailed by advocates as the toughest action by any city on climate change so far, takes aim at the biggest source of greenhouse gases in New York, where buildings account for more than two-thirds of emissions. Trump’s properties have long been identified as leading consumers of energy, although city officials say some other buildings are on track for even heavier fines. In order to comply with the new regulations, the Trump properties must improve insulation, upgrade window glass, replace boilers and better automate electricity use. “The good performers won’t have to pay any penalties but anything above the threshold has a lot of work to do now,” said Mark Chambers, director of the mayor’s office of sustainability. “It’s clear the president needs to pay attention to this, it’s a lot of money. “We will do what’s necessary to combat the climate crisis. It’s important we are all held responsible and President Trump is the No 1 roadblock globally to us responding to climate change.” New York has positioned itself as a bulwark against Trump administration attempts to dismantle action to address climate change. The city has vowed to divest its pension funds of fossil fuel investments and attempted to sue major oil companies for their role in the climate crisis. De Blasio has set a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. The new regulations on large buildings echo a central plank of the Green New Deal, a federal plan put forward by the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that calls for retrofitting all buildings for energy efficiency within 10 years. Ocasio-Cortez said: “Solving our current climate crisis will require leadership and bold ideas. New York City is providing both with its Green New Deal.” New York’s new climate regulations have been opposed by some developers who complain it will hamper the construction of large, dense buildings and deter energy-hungry tenants such as media and technology companies. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. According to the International Energy Agency, the construction and operation of buildings is responsible for more than a third of global energy consumption. Last year, a major United Nations report warned that the world must make an “unprecedented” effort to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and then effectively to zero by 2050 to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, including severe heatwaves, flooding, ruinous storms and food insecurity."

According to reports, Joe does not expect to see an El Nino until 2012. That’s more bad news for the Honeycutt warmists (see my last post). Looks like the cooling streak will be extended for some time.

"Australians are not big on advertising their political allegiances. So the proliferation of Zali Steggall posters around the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah must be causing the incumbent, former prime minster Tony Abbott, some serious heartburn. There are literally hundreds around the electorate: on mansions, in windows of apartments, in storefronts and on building sites. In the streets of Manly and at pre-poll centres, the turquoise T-shirts of the independent Steggall often outnumber the Liberal-blue supporters two to one or more. And then there are the orange shirts of the activist group GetUp, who are out in force door-knocking thousands of homes with their mainly grey-haired army of supporters. The only public seat poll during the campaign in Warringah, by Lonergan for GetUp two weeks ago, points to an ignominious end for Abbott. The Lonergan poll of 805 people taken on 1 May had Steggall romping home, 56% to 44% two-party-preferred. The fact that it was commissioned by GetUp gives some comfort to those who still think Abbott has a chance, although there are rumours of an internal poll that has been buried because it was so bad for Abbott.  Other signs are also bad for Abbott. His fundraising site, Battlelines, has been struggling to meet its fundraising target of $150,000. With less than two weeks to go it was telling supporters it still needed to raise $51,255, and this week it told supporters it had made progress towards closing the gap but needed another $100,000 for last-minute digital advertising. Abbott is banking on his support coming from the quiet voters of Warringah: the people who don’t proclaim their allegiance with T-shirts, posters and donations. But he is also facing a groundswell of discontent from moderate Liberals who have organised against him and coalesced around Steggall. They are angry about the Liberal party’s lack of action on climate change, the failure of Abbott to represent the progressive sentiments of the northern beaches electorate and the party’s dysfunction. In the once solidly Liberal area of Mosman, the Abbott stalwarts are enduring a torrid time. When the Guardian visited the Mosman prepoll two weeks ago, two volunteers handing out how-to-votes for the renegade conservative Liberal senator Jim Molan, who is attempting to “ticket bust” and get supporters to put him above the two Liberals and National on the official ticket, quickly opened up about the abuse they were copping. “They drive by in cars and they roll down the window, out comes the hand and the middle finger goes up,” says one well-dressed woman in her sixties. “They honk and yell abuse. And this is Mosman! “Two Queenwood girls came past yesterday and started abusing us about climate change. They were just vile,” says her friend. “Very rude,” says the first woman. “They’d just swallowed the propaganda on climate change.” Queenwood is an elite private girls’ school in the area. Steggall, a former student, is on the council of governors. She’s also a former Olympian, a barrister, the daughter of a local solicitor in Manly and spent most of her life in the beachside suburb except when she was training to be a skier in France. She has become a lightning rod for all the discontent and frustration that this well-heeled electorate feels with its MP of 25 years. The Liberal party and the rightwing conservative group, Advance Australia, backed by Maurice Newman and other businessmen, have been attempting to portray Steggall as a stooge of the Labor party, GetUp, Alex Turnbull ( the son of the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who was unseated by the Abbott forces in late 2018) the environmental movement, the Greens and/or Stop Adani. It has pushed out a four-part video, which warns that GetUp is as insidious as the communist party and is using brain-washing tactics to capture well-meaning supporters. But the truth may be much simpler than an elaborate Green-left conspiracy. About a year ago, several people in the community, many of them disaffected moderate members of the Liberal party, started organising to get rid of Abbott because of the role he had played in blocking meaningful action on climate change, including undermining his own party’s national energy guarantee. It snowballed. The group People of Warringah had existed since the last election, when another independent ran and got 11% of the vote. Voices of Warringah formed about 12 months ago. The North Shore Environmental Stewards also formed, which included several prominent Liberals members. Late last year the groups met and agreed on an informal preselection process, rather than see multiple independents run. They backed Steggall. There are also local insurgents. Mark Kelly, who owns a surfboard company in Manly, is behind the Vote Tony Out T- shirts and tote bags, which started appearing about a year ago. “A lot of it is just me. It’s true grassroots. I put in $10,000 for the first lot of T-shirts but now I’m sitting on $35k of stock downstairs.” Kelly has sold more than 6,000 T-shirts and he thinks it will approach 7,000 by election day. The hotspot for sales is Mosman. Kelly says he never gives the T-shirts or stickers away. He says it’s important that people are committed and can talk about why they want to vote Abbott out. Unlike Getup, which marshals volunteers to talk to people they don’t know, Kelly says he has been encouraging his group to talk to their peers and family. “There’s only 100,000 people in Warringah, but I want the other 25 million in Australia to ring people they know in Warringah and start having conversations with them, along the lines of: ‘You’re responsible for this, now can you help us fix it?’” Kelly says. The question is whether Steggall’s support is as deep across the electorate as it appears to be in Mosman and Manly. Warringah is an electorate with different parts. In village-like Manly, where there are a mix of young renters and wealthy older residents, there has been a historic willingness to embrace independents such as Peter Macdonald and David Barr in the state seat. Wealthy Mosman and Cremorne should be blue-ribbon Liberal, but the well-educated population appear to be the most angry about the Liberals’ lack of action on climate change, and Abbott’s stance on same-sex marriage. Areas such as Killarney Heights and Frenchs Forest are middle-class suburbs with a mix of older residents and young families with big mortgages. In 2016 the booths in these areas returned a 55%-58% primary vote for Abbott, compared with 51.6% overall. If Abbott’s primary falls below 40% due to moderate Liberals defecting, he is in real trouble, as there will be limited preference flows to him. Labor, the Greens and the other independent, Susan Moylan-Coombs, are putting Steggall ahead of Abbott on their how-to-vote cards. Abbott’s strategy is to try to shore up his support among voters through a mix of fear that a vote for Steggall will deliver Labor’s agenda on taxes, franking credits and negative gearing, while also running on his record as a good bloke who delivers for his electorate. His Facebook page and local material has centred on his contribution to the community: the pollie pedal, which raises money for local charities; millions in grants he secured for the local surf clubs; and a famous incident in which, as a volunteer firefighter, he saved a constituent’s house. He has also made his support for the building of the tunnel to replace the Spit Bridge a major focus, even though the northern beaches tunnel is a state project. The federal government has splashed $50m towards the total $14bn price tag. But after 25 years, even this largesse is hard to sell. “There is quite a bit of cynicism about the tunnel, because its been trotted out every election,” Steggall says. It has been at the centre of his campaign every time since 1994. While Abbott has gone hyper-local, the Liberals’ official line of attack on Steggall is to warn that a vote for her is a vote for Bill Shorten. When queried about whether this was accurate, given Steggall is not directing preferences, Abbott responded in a Manly forum that the loss of any Liberal seat takes Shorten closer to The Lodge. It highlights how unwilling the far right is to accept that they have moved away from moderate liberals. The appearance of her posters on building sites is proof that the CFMEU building union is backing Steggall, he says. The third-party attacks on Steggall, led by Advance Australia, are more pointed. They link Steggall to Shorten and misleadingly quote her saying she has never voted Liberal in her life. “What else would they do?” Steggall says. “I am a moderate liberal. Again it highlights how unwilling the far right is to accept that they have moved away from moderate liberals. They view anyone who is not with them on the far right, as left,” she tells the Guardian. “I haven’t got anything to do with GetUp, I haven’t got anything to do with the Labor party,” she says, sounding a little exasperated. “I know much has been said that I haven’t voted for Tony Abbott at the federal level. I … I voted Liberal at state and local elections. As far as federal elections have gone, I knew that his policies are just too conservative for me, and I viewed it as a protest vote because I knew this electorate would never go any other way than conservative,” she says. “I am for small government, competition. I think we need to support small businesses to be more efficient and competitive. You need to strike a balance between workers’ rights and pay, but it can’t be at the expense of business being effective.” The reason she is gaining support is simple: she has a plan on climate change and Liberals are fed up with the party’s lack of action. Other candidates have struggled to gain oxygen in a race between a former Olympian and a former prime minister. Kristyn Glanville, running for the Greens, is an environment and planning lawyer. “What motivates me to run is I did a lot of pro-bono work for refugees.” Australia’s policies are “retraumatising” them, she says. “I just feel I had to be able to tell my children and grandchildren that I hadn’t stayed silent on all these issues.” Running for Labor is Dean Harris. He says his campaign has “plans to address the issues rather than just holding on to power”. “Transport is a big issue in the community,” he says. “I have spoken to a lot of transport experts who say you don’t get people off the road by encouraging them to take more trips by car. Experts say that there’s a good case for light rail or heavy rail, connecting into Chatswood.” It may be the fight of his life, but Abbott has been strangely low key in the campaign. He has has been largely unavailable to the mainstream media and he has avoided most of the community forums. He has attended two debates with Steggall hosted by Sky News and has done some solo appearances at community meetings. The reaction to Abbott, a consummate performer at these gatherings, has been polite but sceptical. One question in particular seems to arouse passions in the audience: why did he abstain from voting for same-sex marriage, when his electorate voted 75% in favour? At a Manly precinct gathering he explained there were two theories of representation: that the representative should take soundings from his electorate and take their views to Canberra; or that the representative should act according to his conscience. Abbott belongs to the latter school. It was the closest the audience came to booing. And that is at the heart of it: Steggall has outlined a platform that she will push for if she becomes the MP for Warringah. So has Abbott over the years. The question is whether the voters of Warringah are prepared to buy his version of conservative politics for another three years."
"Ice losses are rapidly spreading deep into the interior of the Antarctic, new analysis of satellite data shows. The warming of the Southern Ocean is resulting in glaciers sliding into the sea increasingly rapidly, with ice now being lost five times faster than in the 1990s. The West Antarctic ice sheet was stable in 1992 but up to a quarter of its expanse is now thinning. More than 100 metres of ice thickness has been lost in the worst-hit places. A complete loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet would drive global sea levels up by about five metres, drowning coastal cities around the world. The current losses are doubling every decade, the scientists said, and sea level rise are now running at the extreme end of projections made just a few years ago. The research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, compared 800m satellite measurements of ice sheet height from 1992 to 2017 with weather information. This distinguished short-term changes owing to varying snowfall from long-term changes owing to climate. “From a standing start in the 1990s, thinning has spread inland progressively over the past 25 years – that is rapid in glaciological terms,” said Prof Andy Shepherd, of Leeds University in the UK, who led the study. “The speed of drawing down ice from an ice sheet used to be spoken of in geological timescales, but that has now been replaced by people’s lifetimes.” He said the thinning of some ice streams had extended 300 miles inland along their 600-mile length. “More than 50% of the Pine Island and Thwaites glacier basins have been affected by thinning in the past 25 years. We are past halfway and that is a worry.” Researchers already knew that ice was being lost from West Antarctica, but the new work pinpoints where it is happening and how rapidly. This will enable more accurate projections to be made of sea level rises and may aid preparations for these rises. In the recent past, snow falling on to Antarctica’s glaciers balanced the ice lost as icebergs calved off into the ocean. But now the glaciers are flowing faster than snow can replenish them. “Along a 3,000km [1,850-mile] stretch of West Antarctica, the water in front of the glaciers is too hot,” he said. This causes melting of the underside of the glaciers where they grind against the seabed. The melting lessens the friction and allows the glaciers then to slide more quickly into the ocean and therefore become thinner. “In parts of Antarctica, the ice sheet has thinned by extraordinary amounts,” Shepherd said. Separate research published in January found that ice loss from the entire Antarctic continent had increased six-fold since the 1980s, with the biggest losses in the west. The new study indicates West Antarctica has caused 5mm of sea level rise since 1992, consistent with the January study’s findings. The expansion of the oceans as they warm and the vast melting in Greenland are the main current causes of the rising oceans, but Antarctica is the biggest store of ice. The East Antarctic ice sheet contains enough ice to raise sea levels by about 60 metres. It had been considered stable, but research in December found even this stronghold was showing signs of melting. Without rapid cuts in the carbon emissions driving global warming, the melting and rising sea level will continue for thousands of years. “Before we had useful satellite measurements from space, most glaciologists thought the polar ice sheets were pretty isolated from climate change and didn’t change rapidly at all,” Shepherd said. “Now we know that is not true.”"

Schellnhuber on the who are the “climate sinners”:
The USA has completely abandoned a powerful climate policy. Indeed also Canada and Australia, whose industries have grown because of fossil energies, belong in court in the dock. All developed countries are are slowing the process down , and are simply shifting greenhouse gas intensive industries, i.e. dirty industries, to China and India.

Solar Activity Shows Precipitation In Maine Over the Last 7000 Years
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Geoscientist Jonathan Nichols and Yongsong Huang of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, published just days ago  a new study in Geophysical Research Letters, which shows an impressive synchronocity between the development of precipitation and solar activity for the investigated area. The study is based on a 5-meter long sediment core extracted from a peat bog just off the coast of Maine. The layers of the core cover the climate history going back 6800 years. Nichols and Huang reconstructed the precipitation development in the region by using biomarkers and hydrogen isotopes, and then documented pronounced fluctuations where periods of drought alternated with wet periods. Moreover the two scientists discovered that the development of moisture was in sync with solar activity. Wet periods occurred during weak phases of solar activity. Especially the 210-year Suess/de Vries cycle could be seen in the precipitation patterns of the Maine peat bog (this is also discussed on pages 58-59 in “Die kalte Sonne”).
Also storm activity was in sync with this development. This was shown by the analysis of storm sediment layers from some New England lakes. Especially during the moist, inactive solar periods did storms occur with increasing frequency. Because of this, Nichols and Huang assume that the solar climate signal was intensified by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or the Arctic Oscillation (AO). More evidence of this is also provided by various European peat bog studies. Because of the reduction in solar activity now projected over the upcoming decades, the authors assume that precipitation over the US Northeast will rise and lead to more frequent flooding.
The study underscores the great importance of solar cycles on our climate – especially their impact on precipitation. Prominent examples of the sun’s impact on precipitation amounts are illustrated by the lake levels of the east African Lake Victoria, as well as the discharge rates from South America’s second largest river, the Parana (see p. 58 and 67 in “Die kalte Sonne”).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA Brazilian team of scientists led by Pabulo Henrique Rampelotto recently published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestrial Physics a paper on precipitation and temperature patterns in Santa Maria in Southern Brazil.
It’s the sun! What follows are excerpts from “Die kalte Sonne“ website.

Brazilian agriculture and climate. Public domain by its author, João Felipe C.S. (via Wikipedia).
The scientists carried out a frequency analysis of two data sets for the time period of 1912 until 2008. They especially checked for natural control factors such as solar activity fluctuations and internal ocean cycles like ENSO.
And what did they find?
You guessed it! Natural factors are driving the trends in Southern Brazil. Die kalte Sonne site writes that the temperature and precipitation developments are characterized by a series of natural cycles. Both data sets show similar cycle lengths. Die kalte Sonne site writes:

Rampelotto and his team found in addition to some short periods of between 2 and 8 years also characteristic cycle lengths of close to 11 years, 22 years and 64-83 years, which correspond to the solar periods of the Schwabe, Hale and Gleissberg cycles (see p. 51 in “Die kalte Sonne”). The results also showed that the 22-year Hale cycle was more pronounced in the datasets than the 11-year Schwabe cycle.  This is an important indicator that shows solar magnetic field and cosmic rays play an important role in climatic processes, i.e. evidence of the Svensmark solar amplifier (see p. 231 in “Die kalte Sonne”).
A polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field takes place every 11 years (Schwabe Cycle), thus resulting in that the original configuration is reached after 22 years (Hale Cycle). The polarity of the magnetic field only plays a role for the electrically charged rays, but not for the radiation fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by the magnetic field. If the solar magnetic field and cosmic rays did not play a role on the Earth’s climate, then the pronounced 22-year Hale cycle would be without explanation.
Another important factor of influence for temperature and precipitation amounts in Southern Brazil is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During El Nino periods, precipitation in the region increases.
The study shows that both solar activity fluctuations and internal oceanic cycles played crucial roles on Southern Brazilian climate during the last 100 years and continue to play a role today. The relative share of these two factors on climate fluctuations is difficult to estimate because their corresponding contributions can vary as to geographic location and altitude above sea level at the particular areas. Here, there can also be non-linear effects, which need to be researched further according to Rampelotto and his colleagues.
A lack of correlation between solar activity and climate development during any particular phase is no reason to doubt the fundamental effectivity of the process. Rather it also may be due to the interactions and overlapping with other climate factors such as internal oceanic oscillations. Such a climate-factor combination of sun and PDO must also be assumed for the global temperature development of the last 70 years (see p. 116-120 in “Die kalte Sonne”).”
More than a dozen solar papers recently!
This of course is the most recent of a spate of studies showing the sun (without which there would not be a climate) plays the lead role in climate change. Also see here, here, here, here, here, here here, here, here and here, to name a few.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI know some Danes are not going to like my tone here, but too bad. Why is it the government needs to tell you how to eat?Have you never learned?
As long as you full grown Danes are unable to feed yourselves, then you deserve all the ridicule the rest of the world can muster. How much more possibly incompetent can one get? This story is from T-Online. Hat-tip DirkH.
Denmark has become the first country in the world to tax fat in foods. According to the law, a fat tax of €2.15 per kilogram is now being levied.  The tax is designed to keep the people from eating too much unhealthy food (and to put more money into government coffers).
I ask myself just how incompetent and stupid must the Danes be to not know how to eat. Do they they really need the government to spoon-feed them? Have they been potty-trained yet? I wonder.
It’s coming to your country soon
We may joke about this, but it surely is coming to your country too. Note how the tax is all for our own protection. The Danes ought to throw this law back up.
According to reports, Danes are now rushing to the food markets and buying up fatty foods in bulk. T-Online quotes Sören Jörgensen:
‘We have to fill our stores with tons of butter and margerine in order to be able to serve our customers,’ said Sören Jörgensen Konzern Arla creamery.  Christian Jensen, manager of a supermarket in Copenhagen, spoke of a chaotic week: ‘There were many empty shelves. People have filled up their freezers.'”
Many don’t believe this will change eating habits. People will buy what they want to eat no matter the price. But it sure will transfer lots of money from the citizens to government coffers.

The Wippermann interview is the latest in a series of intense criticisms by German mainstream media aimed at the worrisome anti-democratic and authoritarian views expressed by factions of the German scientific community such as the PIK, WBGU and the German government lately, see here, here and here.
Wippermann, who is an expert on authoritarianism, fires extremely harsh words at the WBGU and its seemingly out-of-control Professor Schellnhuber, calling the authors of the WBGU social contract “fanatics” and the language “worrisome”.
What follows are summarized excerpts of the FOCUS interview.
=========================================
FOCUS: What does the language in the paper remind you of?
Wippermann: The language is scary and it makes me afraid. Those who speak like that behave the same way. It is a negative Utopia, a dystopia. When Utopian minds are at work, it is always dangerous.
FOCUS: What world view do you see in the text?
Wippermann: Here we are dealing with scientific fanatics who want to assert their ideas. It makes me wonder that we are discussing this for the first time, and how little it has been discussed in the public up to now.

FOCUS: What about the role of science in politics?
Wippermann: First off: the German government should have distanced itself from the WBGU long ago. It just cannot be. In short, you just cannot say that you demand some other democracy, a different state and a different world order. It is unacceptable.
FOCUS: How could scientists write such a paper?
Wippermann: I’m afraid this is not just thoughtlessness. It goes a lot further than how to make the world a better place. The authors are suggesting a climate dictatorship, the Climate State – and one that is truly extensive and far-reaching. For example, they want to abolish national states.
FOCUS: But this paper was written by leading scientists.
Wippermann: Also a science can become a religion. When they demand a transnational democracy – whatever that may be – it’ll be a dictatorship.
FOCUS: But they claim it’s for democracy
Wippermann: From history we know of enough people who wanted to make the world a better place after having prophesized the end of the world and bringing an undemocratic system that forces others to accept their views. And why is it that the Germans again have to save the planet, and not only prophesize its downfall? Does the world always have to be measured using a German yardstick? Who do the authors think they are? Such arrogance.
FOCUS: What spirit does the call to action radiate?
Wippermann: The paper disastrously follows the tradition of “Revolutionary Messianism“, which was analyzed by Norman Cohn. There’s a line of “Revolutionary Messianism“ from the Medieval Times to modern totalitarian movements.
FOCUS: Aren’t humanists more prone to all this than natural scientists?
Wippermann: Natural scientists deal directly with people. Think for a minute what emerged from “eugenics”. These scientists here can actually do politics.
Wolfgang Wippermann is a professor at the Friedrich-Meinecke-Institute at the Free University of Berlin. He also teaches at the University of Arts in Berlin. He was a guest professor in Innsbruck, Peking (Teachers College), Indiana University, University of Minnesota and Duke University. Wippermann’ s main area of research is ideology history. His primary areas include antiziganism, theory of fascism, history of communism, anti-Semitism and the historical role of demonology and demonization of societal fringe groups.  Wippermann is the author of numerous publications.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper has been published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestrial Physics, authored by Nicola Scafetta, 2012: Testing an astronomically based decadal-scale empirical harmonic climate model versus the IPCC (2007) general circulation models. Entire paper available here.
Solar system (public domain graphic -NASA)
It’s not a secret that the IPCC models are all rigged to make CO2 look like the culprit for the last 150 years of warming. We say this because we now know their models completely ignore, or selectively distort, the potency of an array of drivers and amplification mechanisms.
In the paper, according to the abstract, Scafetta compares the performance of a recently proposed empirical climate model based on astronomical harmonics against all CMIP3 available general circulation climate models (GCM) used by the IPCC (2007) and finds that the climate appears to be resonating with, or is synchronized to, a set of natural harmonics that have been associated to the solar system planetary motion.
According to the abstract:
…the GCMs fail to reproduce the major decadal and multidecadal oscillations found in the global surface temperature record from 1850 to 2011. On the contrary, the proposed harmonic model (which herein uses cycles with 9.1, 10–10.5, 20–21, 60–62 year periods) is found to well reconstruct the observed climate oscillations from 1850 to 2011, and it is shown to be able to forecast the climate oscillations from 1950 to 2011 using the data covering the period 1850–1950, and vice versa.”
What does Scafetta conclude from this (emphasis added)?

We show that the IPCC GCM’s claim that all warming observed from 1970 to 2000 has been anthropogenically induced is erroneous because of the GCM failure in reconstructing the quasi 20-year and 60-year climatic cycles.”
In the conclusion of the paper, Scafetta also writes:

Consequently, the IPCC projections for the 21st century cannot be trusted.”

In light of this new information and all the new findings we’ve seen since 2007, the IPCC has no choice but to recognize and admit that their models are totally inadequate and in need of a complete overhaul.
Should the IPCC continue to ignore new findings and claim their models are accurate and correct (when they know they are not), then it will be de facto entering the territory of scientific fraud. The next assessment report, due in 2013 or 2014, must include the new scientific findings. Anything else would be willful fraud. That’s what it is when there’s intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual.
There’s no way the IPCC will be able stick to its current climate models in its next report without opening themselves up to lawsuits for scientific fraud. No more excuses.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Schellnhuber’s Master Plan for the “Great Transformation” of society announced in a Spiegel interview is now out. h/t: DirkH
If there was ever a document out there certifying someone has no clue about economics and democratic principles, this is it! And it’s as remote from reality that anything can get. Only reality-isolated, pointy-headed academics could come up with such a thing.
It even tops my wildest expectations. You can now read it here: A World In Transition – A Social Contract For Sustainability. This is what these world-rescuer academics, who never worked a day in their lives in private industry, recommend for changing society – to save us from junk science-based global warming.
To accomplish this so-called Great Transformation of society, the authors of the master plan advocate 10 bundles of measures to take.
Bundle No. 1: Improve the Proactive State with Extended Participation Opportunities
In the German they call it the “Designing State”. Here they call for a strengthening of the state and advocates “bonus-malus” solutions. That means: let’s make the state even more powerful, and if you don’t do what it tells you, then you get whacked.
Bundle No. 2. Advance Global Carbon Pricing. 
The WBGU believes that carbon pricing is the most important political measure for decarbonisation, and a necessary element of any regulatory framework for the transformation into a climate-friendly society. However, the price of carbon has to be set at a level that is high enough to achieve the transformative impact called for, i. e. it must be substantially higher than the current European emissions trading price level.”
Here we see this is remote of free market economy and it is all about state control. In the German version they call for a carbon price that must be “many times higher”.
Bundle No. 3. Expand and Deepen the Europeanisation of Energy Policy
That is what the title of the Bundle 3 is in the German version.
The goal of a common European energy policy should be the decarbonisation of the energy system by the middle of the century.
Here they propose the rapid expansion of renewable energies, energy storage systems and involving non-EU countries to help, such as Norway and Africa (i.e. $1 trillion solar plant in the Sahara called Desertec). That means becoming dependent on unstable North African countries like Libya. Forget that consumers can’t afford it.
Bundle No. 4. Accelerate promotion of renewable energies on a global level through feed-in tariffs
The transformation speed that needs to be reached to protect the climate and avoid the imminent risk of path dependencies on fossil energy technologies can only be achieved by accelerating and increasing the use of renewable energies.”
This is what they call for after a host of countries have just stopped subsidies because they are too expensive. But economics have never been a concern for reality-remote academics in ivory towers.
Bundle No. 5: Promote sustainable energy supply services in developing and newly industrialising countries

These countries need support with guaranteeing all of their people access to the basic essentials of a modern energy supply by 2030. They need support that allows them to establish a sustainable energy infrastructure.”
Like we don’t have enough to pay for already with our own huge deficits, demographic disaster, proposed super-expensive renewable energy supply system. Now we are also expected to pay for these systems in for the rest of the world. And then we should expect these poor folks to be able to pay for these pricey renewable energies. I’ve already read enugh to be convinced that these “wisemen” belong in group therapy of some sort. This is as remote from reality as it gets.
Bundle No. 6 Steering the World’s Rapid Urbanisation towards Sustainability
For currently rapidly growing urban structures, for example in Asia, high-carbon path dependencies must be prevented, as they would hinder low-carbon development for many decades.”
Hey Asia! (and the rest of the world), you’re going to build your cities the way we tell you to.
Bundle 7: Advance Climate-Friendly Land-Use
Priority of any globally sustainable land-use policy must be securing the food supply for just under a billion mal- and undernourished people. Furthermore, demand for agricultural produce is going to rise because of the growing share of animal products and the increase in biomass production for energy and industry.”
The modern agriculture that has done so much under the free market system is supposed to go back to failed Soviet style management. In their rush to rescue the planet from a hypothetical extreme climate change, they are proposing to rush a real destruction instead.
Bundle 8: Encourage and Accelerate Investments into a Low-Carbon Future
State policies must therefore aim to make investment into low-carbon technologies more attractive, and to abolish current disincentives and investment barriers.”
That means topple the free market system. Let the government run it. But which government?
Bundle 9: International Climate and Energy Policy
…a climate protection scheme that is limited to the more prosperous countries cannot solve the problem. Global cooperation is therefore necessary to ensure that the requisite funds for climate-friendly development are also available to poorer countries, and that all countries have access to climate protection technologies and the respective expert knowledge. International climate and energy policy is the forum for achieving a global consensus on transformation targets and ambitions.”
That means the rich countries are going to have to pay for the poor ones. Redistibution! The whole thing is a high risk economics experiment. Not to see if it’ll succeed, but to see how fast something can fail.
Bundle 10: Pursue a Revolution in International Cooperation
The world desperately needs a higher level of international cooperation if climate- and environmentally-friendly global development is to be achieved in the long-term.”
No. The world needs cooperation to tackle today’s real problems that are killing millions right now, and not fantasy problems 100 years from now. Pouring trillions into flakey energy systems while neglecting the poor is immoral.

"New polling from a respected foreign policy thinktank underscores the point that 2019 is the climate change election, with a majority of Australians saying global warming is a critical threat. The poll undertaken for Lowy says 64% of adults rank climate change number one on a list of 12 threats to Australia’s national interests, up six points from last year’s survey and a jump of 18 points since 2014. The 2019 result is the first time climate has topped the list of threats since Lowy began the research in 2006. After climate change, cyberattacks ranks second, terrorism third and North Korea’s nuclear program fourth. The Lowy result is consistent with private research undertaken by environmental groups and by the major political parties, which suggest climate change is surfacing as a concern in parts of the country normally sanguine about the issue. The new poll comes as a shocking new report from the United Nations this week finds biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, with one million species at risk of extinction, and human populations in jeopardy if the trajectory is not reversed. New analysis funded by the Australian Conservation Foundation suggests the vast majority of threatened species habitat destruction in Australia over the last two decades has been concentrated in 12 federal electorates, nine of which are held by Liberal and National MPs. In the Lowy poll, six in 10 of the sample say Australia needs to address the threat of climate change, even if that means incurring significant costs, which is a level of concern not seen in the data since 2006. While 60% favour prompt action, 28% favour gradual action so the costs of the transition are lowered. Only 10% favour waiting until further evidence emerges. The survey suggests climate change is a generational preoccupation. Three quarters of Australians aged 18-44 (76%, up six points from 2018) believe global warming is a “serious and pressing problem”, while fewer than half (49%) of Australians aged over 45 share this concern. Climate change has been front and centre in the federal election, with the Coalition campaigning to discredit Labor’s policy of imposing an emissions reduction target of 45% on the basis that the costs of action are too high. While the Coalition took a decision in December 2017 to use international permits as part of its climate policies – a decision it reversed in the lead-up to the campaign – Scott Morrison has spent the campaign attacking Labor for adopting the same stance in an effort to lower the costs of abatement. The government has also attacked Labor for flagging it will impose a pollution standard for vehicles despite pursuing the same policy objective itself before abandoning the push because of opposition from motoring groups, the Institute of Petroleum and the National party. Labor has countered the politicking by arguing climate change action incurs a cost, but the costs of not acting to deal with the threat are also high. Bill Shorten has declared that Australian politics is broken after a decade of partisan brawling about the issue, and the system won’t be restored to functionality until the parliament legislates a credible climate policy. The Greens, which argue Labor’s policies are not ambitious enough, have called on Labor to establish a collaborative policy development process for climate policy along the lines of a process adopted in the 43rd parliament in the event Shorten wins on 18 May. Shorten has rebuffed that overture. The Lowy poll indicates a majority of the sample believes Labor will do a more competent job at managing the threat of global warming than the Coalition. The Liberals are favoured over Labor on national security and economic management."

"The privilege of governing Australia obliges a political party, whatever its ideological leanings, to offer voters two things – coherent policies to deal with the biggest issues confronting the nation and a competent and prepared team to implement them. The climate emergency is the most pressing issue of our time. For decades, Australia has seen this existential crisis looming and has failed to act on it.  With just 12 years to limit the global climate catastrophe, citizens here and around the world are demanding governments stand up to vested interests and act. The UK parliament has declared a climate emergency, the idea of a Green New Deal is gaining traction in the US and beyond, and students around the world are engaging in spontaneous activism to force change. But in Australia the Coalition appears deaf to the rising clamour from the electorate. After tearing itself apart and dumping a prime minister to avoid implementing a functional climate plan, it clings to an obviously deficient emissions reduction target and has been forced back to Tony Abbott’s discredited climate policy because the hard right will countenance nothing else. That’s a policy that has seen Australia’s greenhouse emissions continue to rise for the past five years and that would put no constraint on continuing increases in the future. The idea that a major party should seriously propose we waste money for little result for another three years, when we have no more years to waste, is a shocking abrogation of responsibility. Scott Morrison’s dismissive response to a UN report finding that the world is sleepwalking towards an extinction crisis, and his parliamentary stunt of fondling a lump of coal, underline the contempt with which he seems to treat the electorate’s legitimate and rising concerns. The prime minister’s positive election pitch has boiled down to personal tax cuts, targeted at low- and middle-income earners in the short term, but offering an additional $230bn of tax relief to higher income earners over the next decade. The plan would improve the household budgets of many families but it would also make Australia’s tax system less progressive, reducing revenue so much that future governments’ capacity to offer services at their current standards would be constrained, and leeway to cope with global economic turbulence would be severely limited. The Coalition’s plan also leaves no room for spending that Guardian Australia believes is urgently needed if Australia is to be a fair and decent society, in particular an increase to the pitiful level of unemployment benefit – the main reason about 10% of us live below the poverty line even though we have enjoyed 28 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Mr Morrison has narrowed the contest with Labor in this campaign, but has carried the Coalition’s message almost as a one-man band, a solo act made necessary because the wounds of last year’s leadership coup are still open and the ideological divisions unresolved. Ministers hastily elevated to plug gaps caused by the rush of resignations after Malcolm Turnbull’s demise have shown scant command of their brief, and little interest in talking about the important portfolios they manage. And yet, to shut down an uncomfortable line of questioning in a campaign debate, Mr Morrison has promised that one of those most conspicuously “missing in action” – the environment minister, Melissa Price – will stay in the role if the Coalition is re-elected. In some important portfolios he did not appoint new ministers before the election was called, meaning announcements continue to be made in the name of ministers who are not even contesting. The task of government can never be a one-person undertaking, and voters have ample evidence to doubt the Coalition has a full team ready for the job. Alarmingly, Mr Morrison is also boosting the incoherent populism of Clive Palmer, apparently in the hope that the vote for his United Australia party, inflated by an estimated $50m in advertising, will push some conservative lower house candidates over the line, with the help of a Liberal/UAP preference deal. It may, and it may also put the Palmer party into the Senate. Mr Morrison implausibly insists Mr Palmer represents “no threat to the economy or national security”, despite UAP policies – where they can be deciphered – proposing hundreds of billions in extra spending and despite the erratic businessman’s rants about “communist China” planning a “clandestine takeover of Australia”. Given Mr Palmer’s chaotic behaviour when last in office, this short-term preference tactic could come at the cost of further voter disillusionment with the democratic system. The Coalition has neither credible policies nor a competent team, and Guardian Australia believes it has failed the test for re-election. Judged by the same standard, Labor presents voters with a convincing case. It has set a higher target for emissions reductions, closer to Australia’s fair share of the global climate response, and has a credible policy to achieve it – much of it borrowed from what Mr Turnbull wanted to implement. It will boost renewables, encourage electric car uptake and strengthen national environment laws. Its tax agenda is unashamedly progressive, with slightly more generous short-term tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners and a firm rejection of the Coalition’s bigger future cuts for workers higher up the income scales. Labor has had big-ticket tax policies on the table since the 2016 campaign, policy transparency that should be encouraged, despite the obvious political risks. Labor will reduce tax concessions for negative gearing, capital gains tax, superannuation and family trusts and has more recently announced the abolition of cash payouts from shareholder franking credits and a further crackdown on multinational tax avoidance. The revenue raised would be funnelled to social spending, on childcare, free dental care for pensioners, Medicare, schools and universities. Disappointingly, an increase in unemployment benefits is not on Labor’s list of concrete promises. Bill Shorten says he will review the payment in government, with a view to increasing it, but there is no provision for this expensive shift in the Labor leader’s costings. There is also an obvious fiscal risk in Labor’s plan. The Senate seems certain to block at least some of the tax changes, while the spending is likely to sail through. Labor may well need the higher budget surpluses it is promising to cover the difference. While Mr Shorten has failed to inspire voters, with net approval ratings still well in the negatives, he has approached the task of uniting and leading Labor with conscientious consideration, and the depth of experience and preparation on his front bench is clear. We have always considered Guardian Australia readers capable of making their own voting decisions, but in 2019 we urge readers to heed the fact that Labor is the only party with a credible climate policy and a chance of forming government after Saturday. For those with more a progressive leaning and a conviction Australia should work faster to reduce emissions, the Greens’ climate policy is more ambitious than Labor’s and its tax and spending policies more redistributive. Depending on the election outcome in the Senate, the Greens could work to toughen Labor’s stance. But the pre-election positioning by Shorten and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, will require careful judgment from climate-minded voters about whether the two left-of-centre parties are preparing to rerun the climate negotiations of 2009 or of 2010. Senator Di Natale has said he wants a “seat at the table”, as the Greens had with Julia Gillard to develop the carbon price in 2010. But he has also declared he is prepared to vote down a Labor climate plan that “locks in” insufficient ambition, as the Greens did to Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009. Shorten insists he will have a mandate to implement the policy he is taking to the poll but his success will almost certainly depend on the Senate negotiation. For more conservative voters who cannot stomach the Coalition’s wilful inaction on climate change, or who want to cast a vote against Liberal MPs who have worked hardest to prevent responsible policy, such as Mr Abbott, there are in many seats credible independent candidates who could make positive contributions in the parliament. Their success could also finally weaken the sway of climate sceptics within the Coalition. We believe the Coalition’s indefensible attitude to climate change, its wafer-thin policy offering and the fact that it has not resolved the internal divisions that blighted its term in office mean it has forfeited the right to voters’ trust. However you choose to exercise your democratic decision-making on Saturday, please consider your candidate’s position on climate and the rapidly shrinking timeframe for action. We have endured mindless scare campaigns and half-baked policy for too many decades. We don’t have three more years to waste."

Share this...FacebookTwitterKilled more people than nuclear power.
Japan’s earthquake has unleashed a massive wave of hysteria throughout Germany as media outlets hyperventilate over the danger of a meltdown at the Japanese Fukushima nuclear power plant. Sure nuclear power is deadly dangerous if not properly used, and the situation in Japan is critical. But listening to the media, you’d think nothing could be more dangerous.
Now activists are demanding we switch immediately over to the-planet saving renewable energy sources, like wind power for example.
But just how safe is wind energy? Just how “safe” are many things out there? What about public transportation?
It turns out that nuclear power is a minor killer when the big picture is examined.
Zero nuclear power plant deaths in the USA 
Wind energy has killed more
The Japanese earthquake and nuclear reactor accidents is yet another example of the media’s distorted perception. It turns out that wind power has been a bigger killer than nuclear power in the USA. Here’s what treehugger reported awhile back:
According to one viewpoint of reports offering the comparison between wind versus nuclear energy, there has not been one single injury to a nuclear plant worker in all its 104 power plants and 40 years of service in the United States… not one!
The Wind Turbine Industry on the other hand, has quite a treacherous track record as you can see by the summary below:
Summary of Wind Turbine Incidents (December 2008):
• 41 worker fatalities –  includes falling from turbine towers and transporting turbines on the highway.
• 39 Incidents of blade failure – failed blades can travel over 400 meters, killing any unfortunate bystanders.
• 110 Incidents of fire – When a wind turbine fire occurs, local fire departments can do little but watch due to the 30-story height of these turbine units. The falling debris are then carried across the distance and cause new fires.
• 60 Incidents of structural failure- As turbines become more prevalent, these breakages will become more common in public areas, thereby causing more deaths and dismemberment’s from falling debris.
• 24 incidents of “hurling ice”- Ice forms on these giant blades and is reportedly hurled at deathly speeds in all directions. Author reports that some 880 ice incidents having occurred over Germany’s 13-years of harnessing wind power.”
Another way to save the planet and to “live safely” is to ride your bicycle. Well it turns out that bike-riding is far deadlier than nuclear power. In the USA in 2008, 716 bicyclists were killed in traffic accidents. About 53,000 bicyclists have died in traffic crashes in the United States since 1932. Compare that to the deaths caused by nuclear power in the United States – or even globally.
Candles kill more than nuclear
Indeed many things are far more dangerous than nuclear power plants, at least they have caused far more deaths and mayhem. Here are some annual death statistics from the USA that cause many more deaths, taken from here and here at Arthur Hu’s site. Why don’t we ban all of these menacing products?
Nuclear power plants – 0 deaths per year
Candles  – 126
Bicycles 1995  – 800
Agriculture  – 1,300
Motorcycles  – 2,500
Car Phones 2002   – 2,500
Alcohol – 100,000
Tobacco – 500,000
Candles kill 126 – in just a single year and in a single country! Having a reliable supply of electricity would mean less use of candles, and so lives would be saved. As far as I know, all of the above killer items are being sold without protest.  Here are some other killers:
Roller skates  – 10 
Window blind cords  – 13
Drawstring hoods  – 17
Dog Bites  – 20       
Skiing deaths  – 34       
Yes, even the lowly blind cord has killed more than U.S. nuclear power plants have.

Green transportation is a killer too
Let’s go green and hop on public transport. But wait, they cause more deaths than nuclear power too. Admittedly these US statistics aren’t so up-to-date, but they give you an idea of the risks involved.
1999 bus deaths  – 58
1999 railroad – 805
1999  struck by trains – 530
Dangerous occupations
And let’s move to ban all the following potentially catastrophic occupations. Actually they are not potentially – they simply just are! They are destroying the planet and kill humans. Occupations in USA; deaths/100,000:
Timber cutters  – 117.8 
Fishers    – 71.1 
Pilots and navigators  –  69.8 
Structural metal workers  – 58.2 
Drivers-sales workers   – 37.9 
Roofers – 37.0
Electrical power installers   – 32.5 
Farm occupations  – 28.0
Construction laborers –  27.7 
Truck drivers  – 25.0
We accept many of the risks these products and occupations pose because their benefits far outweigh the harm they do.
Automobiles are far more dangerous
If zero deaths in the United States from nuclear power is too much to take, then take a look at what the automobile claims every year:
Traffic deaths per year global: 1.27 million
Nuclear power has an excellent record
One thing that constantly gets ignored is the cost-benefit analysis of nuclear power. It has a far better track record than many other products or systems out there and it vastly improves our lives as a whole. Of course, there is a risk in generating power with nuclear reactions, but the benefits it offers are immense.
Sure accidents will happen. But as technology improves, these accidents will become rarer. It is indeed difficult to find a product that has given us so much for so little in terms of lives lost. Even if the worst happens in Japan, the loss of life will be relatively small.
I recall a few years ago 4 workers getting killed in a biogas plant here in northern Germany. Yet, the incident went practically unreported in the media. Imagine if these four workers had been killed in a nuclear plant.
The issue has little to do with safety, and much more so to do with politics and power.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEd Caryl has taken an in-depth look into wind energy as an alternative and finds it’s riddled with technical problems. In the end he calls it “a huge scam”.
====================================================
Alternative Energy Wind Power?
By Ed Caryl
Wind power in the U. S. is most available in harvestable quantities in the Great Plains states just east of the Rocky Mountains.

Figure 1: Brazos Wind Farm, Texas. Source: Wikimedia Commons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GreenMountainWindFarm_Fluvanna_2004.jpg

Figure 2: Wind power in the United States. Source: Wikipedia Commons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Wind_Resources_and_Transmission_Lines_map.jpg
This is advantageous, as those states have vast areas with little population, flat terrain, good transportation for the long components, and lots of open, privately owned land that can be leased for wind farms and still be used for cattle grazing or farming.
At 30% Gross Capacity Factor, with 80 meter tower height, according to the U. S. Department of Energy, the limit for harvestable wind power in the 48 contiguous U. S. states is 38 PetaWatt-hours (38 X 1015 watt-hours [wh]). In the US we need to generate at least 30 PetaWh from all sources of energy (30 X 1015 wh), just to keep the U. S. current standard of living. So wind will generate all of what is needed. About 14% of all the energy used is electrical power. Last year, the United States used 4.1 X1015 watt-hours of electricity. Harvestable wind power would be almost 10 times the electrical power we currently use. But, the land area used would total over 22% of the land area of the United States, and would require 11 million 1 MegaWatt turbines.
Lets look at some real world examples of high-density wind farms. In California, power is generated in three high wind locations: Altamont pass east of San Francisco, Tehachapi pass east of Bakersfield, and San Gorgonio pass near Palm Springs. The largest wind farm field is San Gorgonio.
Figure 3a
Figure 3b
Figures 3a and 3b: San Gorgonio Pass, south and north sides of Interstate Highway 10, Palm Springs, California. Photos by the author.
The wind farms at San Gorgonio Pass cover 70 square miles. There are over 4000 wind turbines at this location. In all of California, there are over 12,000 wind turbines. In 2004, output totaled 4.258 GigaWatthours of electricity. In 2007, this had increased to 6.8 Gwh, 2.3% of the electricity generated in the state. This is approaching 7% of what can be generated by wind in the state of California. These three locations are the prime wind locations in California, and the best spots at each are taken. The rest of the wind power locations in California are on the coast, in very scenic locations. (For a sneak-peek at today’s California electrical use and the renewables availability see this site.)
In California, a transmission line from the nuclear plant at Palo Verde, Arizona to Los Angeles passes through the San Gorgonio wind farm area. The wind farm thus supplements the nuclear power. San Gorgonio generates less than 0.03% of the power generated at Palo Verde. Most Southern California electrical power comes from Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Out of state generation accounts for 31% of California’s electrical power, 24% from other Southwest states, and 7% from the Pacific Northwest. Southern California has also imported power from the Cerro Prieto geothermal plant in Mexicali, Baja California Nord, in Mexico.
In the U. S. as a whole, 94.65 Twh were wind generated in 2010, also 2.3% of the electrical power generated (over 4,100 Twh or 4.1 X 1015 watt-hours). Two states, Iowa (15.4%) and North Dakota (12.0%) generate more than 10% of their power from wind. Minnesota (9.7%), South Dakota (8.3%), and Kansas (7.2%) are not far behind. (Source: Wikipedia) In these states wind power makes sense because the resource is available, the amount of power needed is low relative to the area, the power is used locally, and wind power is competitive with other sources. The percentage of wind generated power has not reached the point where backup power when the wind stops is a problem.
What are the downsides to wind generated power? There are several.
Wind power tends to drop when you most need it.
During the last few cold winters in the U. K. wind power generation dropped to very low levels during the coldest days. This happens everywhere. Wind power cannot be depended on to supply heating electricity when it is most needed. It must be remembered that all heating systems require some electricity to move the heat within the system. In California, wind power generation has a definite daily pattern, low in the morning and ramping up during the afternoon. But this pattern doesn’t happen every day. See A Grid Manager’s Nightmare. To provide power when the wind dies, a grid manager must have an equivalent amount of other generation available, usually fossil fueled, or the lights will go out. The U. K. solves this problem by importing nuclear power from France. Denmark imports hydroelectric power from the rest of Scandinavia. If all the euro-zone countries continue to expand wind power, there will come a point where sufficient backup power will no longer be available.
In California, a report by KEMA Inc. written in June 2010, states:

Researchers concluded that accommodating 33 percent renewables generation by 2020 will require major alterations to system operations. They also noted that California may need between 3,000 to 5,000 or more megawatts (MW) of conventional (fossil-fuel-powered or hydroelectric) generation to meet load and planning reserve margin requirements.”
Wind turbines are dangerous
There are several ways one can get killed by a wind turbine. Bird kills are just one downside. In the U. S. state of Montana, a study found that three times as many bats were being killed as birds. One reason is that bats don’t need be struck by the blades to be killed. A bat’s lung structure is such that the pressure change as the blade passes by ruptures lung tissue and kills the bat from the “bends”.
A wind turbine is a tall tower first of all. Falls from a tower higher than 20 meters usually has a bad outcome. This means that to work on a turbine requires a safety line. This leads to another problem. Outside the turbine nacelle there are the rotating blades and a shaft. If the line gets tangled in either, the wearer is pulled off the nacelle and into the blades or shaft… Not good. Inside the nacelle, there is the rotating shaft, gears, and the generator. If a safety line, clothing, or a hand, gets caught in the rotating machinery, the resulting escalating injuries are inexorably and agonizingly fatal.
One worker was killed inside a tower by falling ice. The falling sheet of ice nearly cut him in half. Ice throw by the turbine blades has been documented to 150 meters. Calculations have predicted ice throw to half a mile (nearly 1 kilometer). Blade failure throw has been documented to 1300 meters. The recommended distance to occupied housing due to blade throw, noise, and shadow flicker from blade rotation through sunlight, is 2 km. Shadow flicker can trigger epilepsy in sensitive individuals.
There have also been many fatal accidents during the transportation and construction process. Erecting a large wind turbine requires moving very long loads on the highways, and using very large cranes to erect the components. Both processes are hazardous. There have been a total of at least 78 people killed in the wind industry as of March 31st of 2011.
Wind turbines are noisy
Small wind turbines hum. Large wind turbines, as the blades pass the tower, make a low frequency thump as well as low frequency “swish – swish” sounds that can travel for miles. One reference mentioned that the Nazis used similar sounds for torture. Farmers near wind farms in the U. K. and Taiwan have reported livestock losses reportedly from lack of sleep.
Fire is a hazard for wind turbines
Electrical components can short out, overheat, or otherwise fail causing fire. Gearboxes can leak lubricants, overheat, and catch fire. Lightning can cause fire, and a wind turbine is a tall object that attracts lightning. A wind turbine contains many gallons of flammable lubricant and hydraulic fluid. To reduce weight, a wind turbine nacelle is often fiberglass or other plastic that can burn and melt, dripping flaming material onto the surroundings. Local fire departments usually respond to a wind turbine fire to simply watch it burn and control any spot fires on the ground, because they cannot fight a fire 50 or 80 meters in the air. Note in Figure 3b, above, that several towers no longer mount turbines. Their fate is not known for certain, but fire or “king-pin” failures (the shaft around which the turbines rotate to face the wind) are the likely reason. The “king-pin” is the only support that keeps the turbine on the tower.
Wind turbines are different from other generation methods in a way that exacerbates danger. There are no on-site operators. If something goes wrong that is not monitored and/or controlled electronically, a problem can spiral into disaster faster than remote operators can physically respond to the scene.
Eric Rosenbloom wrote an excellent paper in 2006 that details much of the danger from wind turbines. See his paper here.
What to do when the turbines wear out? 
The usual annual funds planned for maintenance and repair for a wind farm is 4 or 5% of the cost of installed equipment. The planned life is usually 20 to 30 years. This should be thought of as the half-life of a wind farm. In this period, half of the turbines will have catastrophically failed. Usually in older wind farms, after half have failed, the others are decommissioned and eventually abandoned. If the permitting agreements have not called for removal, old wind farms are often just abandoned by owners. This is happening in Hawaii and California as this is written.
The economics of wind power, or how do we make money on this?
In Texas and Denmark, wind farm operators often pay the grid operators to take their generated power. They can do this because the subsidies they receive from the government allow a small profit. This happens because the wind power is distant from the cities that need it, and transmissions costs are higher than what the power is worth. In Texas, the power is in the “panhandle” in the north, and the power is needed in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Houston in the central and south of the state. In the U. S., Subsidies include a 5-year accelerated depreciation schedule, as well as tax rebates, and Renewable Energy Credits. The accelerated depreciation schedule means that operators will sell the wind farm after five years, the next owner will take the depreciation for another five years, and sell it again. If the new owner is a European company, they get “carbon offset” credits for an additional subsidy.
In Denmark, wind power is backed by hydroelectric power in Norway and Sweden. When the wind is blowing, Norway and Sweden will back off their hydroelectric power production to save water in the reservoirs. Hydroelectric power is cheap, so Denmark gets little or nothing (sometimes less than nothing) for the wind power they are exporting. When the wind stops, Denmark then imports power from Norway, Sweden, and the rest of Europe at the spot price. As in the U. S., subsidies allow this to work, giving the operators a profit, no matter which way the wind blows.
Wind power is a huge scam. There is no other way to describe it. If it were not for subsidies, no one in their right mind would build a wind farm. To learn more, this author recommends following the links in this article for as long as your nausea level will allow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Brown and Climate Ethics
By Ed Caryl
Donald A. Brown at Penn State writing in his blog here did the “Climate Skeptics” a big favor by gathering “The Hockey-Stick Team’s” arguments into one article. I am sure that Professor Brown was certain that no skeptic would have the temerity to actually challenge his assertions.
But his assertions beg for challenge. One of his techniques is to make claims about the skeptic side that are in fact much more true for the Team side. These techniques include:
Lying
One example of the Team’s use of lying is the assertion that “97% of Climate Scientists agree” that AGW is true. This figure is based on an on-line poll sent to over 10,000 “earth scientists” where the participants were self selected, and the actual numbers were 75 out of 79 answering the poll describing themselves as “peer-reviewed climate scientists”. See here. The actual questions on that poll were:
1. When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?
2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”
Nearly all skeptics would answer “have generally risen” to Question 1, and most would answer “yes” to Question 2. This loaded poll proves nothing. The whole argument revolves around “how much”. We don’t know if the above 79 participants were actually “climate scientists” or not. They could just as well have been kids down at the neighborhood Starbucks with laptops. But this assertion has been repeated countless times on the Internet as if it were Holy Writ and Peer Reviewed. (It was not.) The principle used here is that “If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth”. this according to one of history’s most infamous propagandist.
Professor Brown says that:
Some of the claims made by some of those engaged in the disinformation campaign have been outright lies about such things as the claim that the entire scientific basis for human-induced climate change is a hoax or that there is no evidence of human causation of climate change.”
This statement itself is not true. Most skeptics think that there is some human causation, just not the catastrophic kind claimed by the Team. In answer to Professor Brown’s citation of six books for his side, here’s my citation of six books for the skeptic’s side:
1.  Evidence Based Climate Science, Dr. Don Easterbrook
2.  The Hockey Stick Illusion, A. W. Montford
3.  Climategate, The CRUtape Letters, Steven Mosher and Thomas W. Fuller
4.  The Great Global Warming Blunder, Dr. Roy W. Spencer
5. The Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming, Patrick J.Michaels (Editor), Dr. Sallie L. Baliunas, Dr. Robert C. Balling Jr , Dr. Randall S. Cerveny, Dr. John Christy, Dr. Robert E. Davis, Dr. Oliver W. Frauenfeld, Dr. Ross McKitrick, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, Dr. Eric S. Posmentier, Dr. Willie Soon (Contributors)
6. Die Kalte Sonne, (The Cold Sun, Why the Climate Catastrophe is Not Taking Place) Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Luñing (In Press) For more on this one, read here
Focusing On An Unknown While Ignoring the Known.
The amount of the unknown on climate science is far greater than what is known, and thus impacts the known at every level. For example: although climate sensitivity, (the temperature rise due to CO2 doubling) has yet to be established, a number is used in all the general climate models. The IPCC “consensus” is that it is somewhere between 1.5°C to 4.5°C (IPCC, 2007, pp.798-799). Where do those numbers come from? They come from guesses by Michael Mann and Syukuro Manabe.
Here is the story (from Wikipedia):
The standard modern estimate of climate sensitivity – 3 °C, plus or minus 1.5 °C – originates with a committee on anthropogenic global warming convened in 1979 by the National Academy of Sciences and chaired by Jule Charney. Only two sets of models were available; one, due to Syukuro Manabe, exhibited a climate sensitivity of 2 °C, the other, due to James E. Hansen, exhibited a climate sensitivity of 4 °C. “According to Manabe, Charney chose 0.5 °C as a not-unreasonable margin of error, subtracted it from Manabe’s number, and added it to Hansen’s. Thus was born the 1.5 °C-to-4.5 °C range of likely climate sensitivity that has appeared in every greenhouse assessment since…”[16]
Many people have tried to develop more accurate estimates. The current range is anything from zero to 10°C, though the latter number is usually dismissed. As time goes by, the number seems to be dropping. Recent ice-age studies don’t change the old estimates by very much, but give a median value of 2.3°C. Even more recently, there have been efforts to calculate climate sensitivity from thermodynamic principals. Find the papers here, here, and here. These all suggest that the climate sensitivity is zero. Measurements from above the atmosphere all suggest that climate sensitivity is less than 0.6°C. See here, here, and here.
Specious Claims of Bad Science
In Dr. Brown’s paragraph here he cites no specific examples; this is a general childish name-calling type of attack. This list is offered as a rebuttal. Tom Nelson offers 250 examples of bad science, or scientists behaving badly, gleened from the Climategate 2 emails in the Team’s own words.
Creation of Front Groups
Both sides have created “front groups”. What is the IPCC, if not a “front group”? The Center for American Progress is a front group. This is a label intended to denigrate. For the figures on money spent by organizations on both sides see here. A summary is quoted:
Figure 1.1, I compare the spending of climate action opponents and advocates.  As the figure displays, the combined program spending of environmental organizations ($1.4 billion) is almost twice as much as the combined program spending of conservative organizations and industry associations ($787 million).  Specific to climate change and energy-related activities, environmental groups appear to have outspent conservative groups and their industry association allies $394 million to $259 million.”
Creation of Misleading Lists of Climate Sceptics [sic]

From Brown’s point of view, any skeptic will have questionable credentials. That’s part of the Team’s tactics to denigrate and marginalize any skeptic. There is a problem though. One of the better-known lists is the Oregon Petition. It currently has 31,487 signatories, over 9,000 of those with PhDs. Contrast this with the poll cited above with 75 anonymous positive poll responders. Also keep in mind that “The Team” has less than 50 people as core members. The Oregon Petition is simply too large to be dismissed. In the end, it only takes a single skeptic scientist.
PR Campaigns to Convince the Public There’s No Scientific Basis
Both sides have used PR firms. This is what you do when billions of dollars are at stake. The University of East Anglia used (and is still using) the BBC to convince the public of the opposite. What larger PR firm could they have used? It is very difficult for skeptics to match these large megaphones. That’s why so many are blogging.
Astroturf Groups
This is right out of the Nancy Pelosi playbook. I’m surprised he used the term. Notice that none are named. It is another dubious attempt to denigrate. His use of the terms “disinformation campaign” is also a handy term for denigration. Without investigation, anything written by a skeptic automatically gets labeled as disinformation, and any conversation between three or more skeptics will be labeled as an Astroturf Group. For Dr. Brown’s information, I am myself a group of one, funded by Social Security.
Cyber-Bullying Scientists and Journalists
Both of these groups have made themselves public figures. James Hansen, for just one example, delights in getting himself arrested on camera in front of the White House. Michael Mann regularly appears on TV talk-shows and news programs making claims that beg a response. When public scientists step outside of the peer-reviewed scientific literature, they are asking for trouble. When their public claims are demonstrably not true, they must be refuted. Here is a link to predictions made in the 1980’s by James Hansen.
Dr. Brown then gives skeptics some advice:
A few things we are not saying. We are not against skepticism in [sic] but skeptics must play by certain rules of science. That is skeptics should:
a) Publish conclusions in peer-reviewed literature.
b. Stop claiming that anything that is not fully proven is bad science.
c. Not lie about or overstate their scientific conclusions.
d. Not cherry-pick scientific evidence by focusing on what is not known while ignoring what is known.
e. Not repeat scientific arguments that have been fully refuted.
f. Publicly condemn cyber-bullying of journalists and scientists.”
For no. a, Dr. Brown may not realize that peer review has been tightly controlled by the Team. It has been difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get papers published in certain journals with conclusions that the Team does not approve, whether or not those conclusions are scientifically valid. Some discussion of the problem here, here, here, and here.
For no. b: “Stop claiming that anything not fully proven is bad science.” For it to be good science, define “fully”. As Einstein said, “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” The skeptic effort must be encouraged; the alternative is totalitarianism.
As for no. c, lies are easily detected. No skeptic knowingly lies. It is too easily found out. This statement is just another bogus denigration attempt.
No. d: “Not cherry-pick scientific evidence by focusing on what is not known…” This is a strange statement. All scientists focus on the unknown… and should. Only by focusing on the unknown can anything new be learned. New knowledge can overturn what we thought we knew. See Einstein, above.
No. e: “Not repeat scientific arguments that have been fully refuted.” See Einstein, above.
No. f: “Publicly condemn…” This cuts both ways. Stop condemning (cyber-bullying) skeptics. Also stop characterizing any critique of public statements by the Team as cyber-bullying. It all takes place in cyber-space as a matter of course. This is just another attempt to limit free-speech and discourse.
Calling this discourse an ethics problem is suspicious. I would ask Dr Brown to examine his own ethics in writing his piece. Who or what is he trying to protect? Both sides think they are saving the earth. Both sides have their extremists. Neither side has a lock on “the truth”.
Part of the problem is that the public loves a disaster, particularly the media, and the Team has played on that for political and funding reasons. If they are proved alarmist, the money dries up instantly.  Here is the first blog article this author wrote on the  subject. (Chicken Little was a Calamitologist.)

"Two areas of Western Australia have been declared “water deficient” and will have supplies trucked in by the state government to keep farm animals alive. Farmers around the area of Mallee Hill in the shire of Lake Grace and Mount Short in the Ravensthorpe shire have run out of water for their stock and had been driving more than 40km to cart water back to their farms.  From Thursday, the state’s water and environmental regulation department will begin carrying 350 kilolitres a week to a centrally located tank near Mallee Hill in response to a petition by seven farmers for assistance. Water-carting to Mount Short began last week. It was the first time a water deficiency declaration had been made in eight years. The surrounding region, which stretches inland from the state’s south coast from Albany to Hopetown, had very low winter rainfall in 2018. Both areas have recorded about 30mm of rain so far this year, down from a January-May average of 70mm. Water minister Dave Kelly said the below-average rainfall in both regions was part of a long-term drying trend attributed to climate change. “Climate change has impacted rainfall across the south-west of WA,” Kelly said. “In particular, last winter there was very low rainfall and no follow-up summer rainfall in the mid-northern region of the shire of Lake Grace. “As a result, on-farm water supplies and strategic community water supplies are now depleted.” A water deficiency declaration can be made when five or more farmers within a 20km radius have to travel more than 40km to get water. Water provided by the government can be used only for animal welfare purposes. “This declaration will assist landholders to reduce the cost and stress of sourcing suitable water supplies for their animals,” the WA agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said. “We continue to work with landholders affected by below-average rainfall, providing information and support about how best to navigate the season ahead.” WA farmers president Rhys Turton said he expected more areas in the southern parts of the state would be placed on emergency water provisions before winter was over. “They have been through a pretty dry winter last year, very dry spring,” Turton said. “Most have not had a lot of summer rainfall so there has been very little run-off to fill water storage dams. They have been driving for some time to get water for stock.” Rainfall in WA has been drying up since the 1970s, but the trend is patchy. Some parts of the state, such as the wheatbelt, where Turton farms, experienced their best winter in living memory last year. He said that even if the drying trend was attributed to climate change, as it is by the Bureau of Meteorology, it did not mean that areas would become unviable for farming. “They are at no greater risk there than anywhere else in Australia,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Fritz Vahrenholt, author along with Dr. Sebastian Lüning of the skeptic German bestseller “Die kalte Sonne” had been invited to take part in the political talk show “hart aber fair” (tough but fair) on German public television, prime time Monday evening, March 12.
That was before the show caved in and disinvited the tough-debating Vahrenholt. That’s a pity because many viewers and I were really looking forward to this show. Instead we’ll have to be content with the boring topic of “electricity, gas, and fuel are getting more and more expensive – energy supply transition at our expense” with the usual blowhard dullard politicians blasting the same hot air we’ve been hearing for years.
The global warming religion is no longer able to withstand scrutiny. That’s how weak the whole science has become. Now the lock-stepping publicly-funded media have to shield the issue from public debate. They don’t fear the climate itself – it is debate itself that they truly fear. This is not the first time Vahrenholt gets disinvited from a major event. Last month the University of Osnabrück disinvited him, saying that his claim that the climate is 50% driven by the sun is “too provocative”.
I called hart aber fair studios in Cologne to get an explanation, but all I got from these publicly funded employees was “Nobody knows…I can’t tell you why” and “Maybe  because Vahrenholt is ill and can’t make it.” and “The person who could tell you is not available”. Unfortunately, they could not give me any names.  This is all absurd, of course. Perhaps German readers will have better luck. You can call the studios at 0221 2200, ask for “hart aber fair Redaktion”.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) published the news of the dubious disinvitation yesterday, but did not provide details as to why. The public is only left to speculate. The following are some reactions from readers:
Don Carlos writes: “Cancelled. Aha. Why am I not surprised?”
Friedrich Wildhagen writes: “They are afraid of the callers during the show. The Warmies show they are afraid. Hats off to Prof. Vahrenholt, Dr. Lüning. Job very well done!”
Alfred Casimir writes: “This report shows the insecurity that has arrived in the media. Take the disinvitation as a victory.”

Dear Mr. Gosselin,
Thanks for your interest in ‘hart aber fair’.
On the March 12, 2012 edition of ‘hart aber fair’, we will look at the topic of ‘electricity, gas, petrol are getting more and more expensive – energy transition at our expense?’ A change in the topic here is simply not the case, rather it is more of an adjustment based on editorial reasons.
The experience of many ‘hart aber fair’ editions has shown that with six participants it is not always possible to get a word in sufficiently. Moreover, there are quickly overlaps and doublings in the argumentation, which we naturally wish to avoid. In the concrete case this would likely have happened with Roland Tichy and Prof. Vahrenholt. Therefore we decided to reduce the number of participants to five guests, contradictory to the original plan.
You see: The preparation of a current talkshow like ‘hart aber fair’ is a constant development process which, for various reasons, can lead to topic changes and changes in the participants even right before the show begins.
We would be pleased if you tuned in on Monday to follow the discussion even without Prof. Vahrenholt.
Best regards,
 Matthias Radner
 Producer
 ‘hart aber fair’ (ARD/WDR)”
========================================
What I read from this is that they decided to make the show totally boring by presenting the same stale and moldy bread that everyone is sick of being served. Vahrenholt is the only one among them with a best-selling book with fresh new issues. Don’t bother watching. We’ve seen this crap dozens of times already.

SkySails kite-towing technology fails to deliver. (Photo: SkySails)

The German FAZ reports here that Hamburg-based SkySails will lay off half of its workers. Managing director Stephan Wrage, an industrial engineer, blames reluctance by shipping companies to invest in his “innovative technology”. The FAZ also adds:
 There’s no support from the banks. He expects the difficult situation to continue for another 1 to 2 years.”
I can’t understand the lack of interest. Maybe it has something to do with high costs and low benefits? Damn customers – always expecting performance for their money.
What the company has to do now is ask the government to pass a law requiring ships be outfitted with towing kites. You see, the shipping companies are too stupid to recognize the benefits of this “innovative technology”. They need the government to decide it for them. After all, according to the company’s website, “40 employees representing a wide range of disciplines and specialties – from aerospace engineers, to software developers, shipbuilders, management professionals and CNC operators – all help to develop, manufacture and market the worldwide patented SkySails technology.” They can’t be all wrong, can they?
The company, established in 2001, also boasts:
SkySails kites are the key technology for capturing the vast potential of high-altitude winds, and SkySails is the first company in the world that has succeeded in developing towing-kite technology into an industrial application. […] Some 50 million euros have been invested in developing the SkySails technology and establishing the manufacturing capability.
50 million euros! And high altitude? Since when do ships fly? And they claim they have succeeded?

SkySails won many awards
There are also promotional videos for the award-winning company’s products at its website. One shows how the huge kite is deployed (to high altitudes). It requires that the ship be outfitted with a giant crane for hoisting the large kite into the air before releasing it. The crane itself has got to cost a fortune.
I majored in mechanical engineering, and only a couple hours of simple calculations would tell anyone that this technology makes no sense. I’m beginning to wonder what German engineering students are being taught at their universities.
The FAZ also writes:
The shipping companies are hesitant to invest a million euros for a towing kite. So far SkySails has sold about 10 towing kites, but not all have been installed.”
A million euros! Ten kites – in 11 years.
My advice to the management is that they speak to an old engineer, the kind that still uses a slide rule and was never brainwashed by green religion, and listen to what he says. If he says ha ha ha – it means the idea won’t work, and start designing a better diesel engine instead.
I’m sure there were a number of politicians who made the obligatory tour of the “innovative” plant, followed by a speech on how this was the “future of energy” – blah blah blah. Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lünings’s book “Die kalte Sonne” did not hit the bookstores a minute too soon.

"Just seven months ago the United Nations told the world that we have 12 years to limit the climate change catastrophe. It means that to keep global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels we need to cut carbon pollution by 45% by 2030 and down to zero by 2050. Twelve years. Actually scratch that – now it is 11 years. Now ask yourself how often that has been raised during this election campaign?  At the time a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on impacts of climate change said: “It’s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now. This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.” Oh bless. At the start of the 2019 federal election campaign Scott Morrison put out a video where he was all dewy-eyed about the future, saying “the next 10 years are important to everybody at every stage of life”. And yet not once – NOT ONCE – did he mention that the UN has given us 11 years to do something about a global catastrophe. No, instead it’s all standard of living and nothingness statements that would get shot down by any decent advertising firm in the first meeting. He did say one thing that is correct. He noted that “the decisions you make in one term of government last for a decade or more”. And in no area is this more true than with climate change. Every year we do less than enough, the ability to limit damage becomes less and the cost of doing so becomes larger. I’ve written in the past how climate change has destroyed the minds of conservatives. But it has also destroyed the media model that seemed to work so well for holding politicians to account: the model of balance and impartiality, where journalists who strive to be seen to take no sides and have no bias. It’s a model that only holds up so long as both sides are open to reality because it implicitly gives credibility to both sides. But over the past 30 years the conservative side has become hostage to cranks and charlatans. And as the conservatives lurched ever more towards lunacy the media has for the most part followed. It has led us to a position where the Liberal party’s utterly pathetic climate change policy is given credence. And where the big issue about the ALP’s less-worse policy is the cost, not from the point of view that it could be achieved with a more efficient price on carbon but that it costs more than does the LNP’s nothing policy. It is a position where editors give front-page space to modelling so redolent with bias that you can practically smell the coal dust on its pages. It has meant those wishing to actually do something about climate change have to not just argue their policy is better, but that the need for the policy is there. Election campaigns are often about costs – how much will your healthcare or education policy cost? But we do not as a rule talk costs to the economy, because such modelling is pretty nebulous and is reliant on assumptions that can distort any picture for better or worse. That does not render modelling irrelevant, but it means it is no fact check. And with climate change any costings that do not count the costs of inaction are worthless. It would be like doing a costing of investing in the polio vaccine in the 1940s and not considering the cost of people continuing to die and suffer from polio. Clearly the costs of inaction massively outweigh the cost of acting. The good news is we do have some research on the costs, because while in Australia we allow political parties to indulge the equivalent of arguing over which rat in a restaurant kitchen has the fewest number of fleas, in the UK things are rather more mature. This week in the UK the Committee on Climate Change released a report arguing the UK needs to reduce emissions emission to zero by 2050. In what should be a siren for all journalists, they note that “the costs of the low-carbon transition are critically dependent on the quality as well as the stringency of public policy”. Note the issue is quality of the policy, not whether or not there is some precise hit to GDP they can come up with. And what is quality? Policy with “long-term clarity on the regulatory landscape, prioritisation of the role of markets, and policy processes that are transparent, predictable, and based on cost-benefit analysis”. And for it to be successful “it will also need to be credible (actors must believe the government means what it says), consistent across time and governments, and across different policy sectors, and yet adaptive to new circumstances”. In other words: Tony Abbott and his ilk – your time is done. The report also notes that “the very word ‘costs’ to describe decarbonisation expenditures is somewhat misleading, because in a very real sense such expenditures are also investments”. What’s more, it suggests “the correct answer to the question ‘what will it cost?’” is that it depends on “what is done now”. Wait and it costs more; do it poorly now and it costs more; accept that a policy to reduce emissions by 26% including dodgy accounting as legitimate, and it will cost more. And if you really are worried about economic growth the report also concludes that “there has been no appreciable difference in rates of economic growth between those countries that have reduced emissions substantially and those that have not”. But importantly, “yet the former camp are arguably in a stronger position to benefit from a global transition to a zero carbon economy in years to come”. The report makes clear it is time to stop giving credence to cranks and demand better of our political parties – and there is no excuse for the media either. We need at a minimum a 45% reduction by 2030 and to get to zero net emission by 2050. So parties need to explain what they are going to do to get there and argue why their way is best. If a party is not even willing to come up with such a path then do not treat them with the respect that “balance” gives them. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist and economics writers"

It’s about how the drugged-up-on-green government assures failure – this one with potentially catastrophic proportions for Germany. Let it be a lesson for other countries.
Read about the entire bloody mess at:Germany’s Wind Power Revolution in the Doldrums.
Is Germany's renewable energy supply on the verge causing the entire system to crash and burn?
With its nuclear power reactors in the process of being shut down by government decree (done in a hysterical state of mind in the wake of Fukushima), Germany now needs to find an alternative supply for electricity, and real soon. The answer was to build huge offshore wind parks in the windy North Sea, for example like the one now being completed by energy giant RWE. However,
…when work is completed on the Nordsee Ost wind farm, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the island of Helgoland in the North Sea, the sea air will be filled with a strong smell of fumes: diesel fumes. The reason is as simple as it is surprising. The wind farm operator, German utility RWE, has to keep the sensitive equipment — the drives, hubs and rotor blades — in constant motion, and for now that requires diesel-powered generators. Because although the wind farm will soon be ready to generate electricity, it won’t be able to start doing so because of a lack of infrastructure to transport the electricity to the mainland and feed it into the grid. The necessary connections and cabling won’t be ready on time and the delay could last up to a year.”
In other words, before Germany can launch itself into the renewable energy era Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen so frequently hails, the country must first burn massive amounts of fossil fuels out in the middle of the North Sea — a paradox as the country embarks on its energy revolution.”

Wonderful government management: Multi-billion euro windparks are going to just sit there and literally make the wind blow. It gets worse, read on. Other quotes:
So far 86 applications have been submitted for North Sea wind farms, though just 24 have been approved — and only four are in operation.”
RWE’s managers warn that even the more modest target for 2020 could be “missed by miles.”

Because of the weather conditions, engineers could only carry out much of the work between May and September.”
Without a grid to plug into, the turbines can’t deliver any electricity to the mainland. And without the sale of “green” power, the multi billion-euro wind farms won’t be generating revenues any time soon.”
RWE alone could lose more than a hundred million euros.”
…private investors now have doubts once more.”
The delays on the high seas are a bitter blow for the German government’s…”
Got to feel bad for the energy power companies – ordered by politicians to do the virtually impossible.
Germany’s power system was once tops in the world. Now that the government elephant has been allowed to run wild through the china shop, the risk of a complete collapse is real.

"Another week, another report lamenting the decimation of wildlife and the threat of natural collapse. The UN tome was so gloomy it needed 1,800 pages to spell out the message: 1 million species face extinction if we carry on like this.  So what is to be done? The OECD has suggested that punitive taxes are the only way to discourage a rapacious approach to natural resources. But Upside readers have also been in touch advocating a shift of course away from growth at all costs and towards something more sustainable. Maria Smith suggested it was time to explore in greater depth whether we could escape the pursuit of endless economic growth. We are all familiar with the damaging impact that the pursuit of financial wealth has on society, culture and the environment. We need no reminding of this planet’s dangerous rate of warming or its peoples’ divide between those with too much and those without enough. Yet the supremacy of economic growth as an indicator of progress is still sought after by governments all over the world. As climate change has now begun to bite, the link between economic growth and environmental decline needs to be more thoroughly understood and accepted. With this in mind, it would be great to hear from you: do we have to expand our economies indefinitely? How would we wean ourselves off growth? Are there models for how this would work? What would be the pitfalls, and how to mitigate them?

Remarkably, Britain went an entire week without using coal power – for the first time in almost 140 years. The country is generating solar power at record levels.

I’ve been swimming in the sea off Hove for over a year and have not had a cold or infection in that time. I turn 65 in a couple of weeks and suggest, if you haven’t already done so, you consider researching the benefits of strength training for all ages. John Nugent, via email I really enjoyed Jonny Weeks’ article & I thought you might be interested in how cold-water swimming has been instrumental in the recovery from severe depression of my swimming friend, Katie Maggs.

"Independent candidate for Warringah, Zali Steggall, has pledged to address the health impacts of climate change if she wins Warringah as an independent. Like her fellow independent, Kerryn Phelps in Wentworth, Steggall signed up on Monday to the strategy developed by the Climate Health Alliance, which has more than one million health professionals behind it through their representative groups. It is pushing governments to start factoring climate change into their thinking about health policy, warning that a rise of 3C in world temperatures would have catastrophic consequences for the health of Australians. Among the health impacts of climate change are an expected jump in severe asthma attacks, more disease due to severe weather events such as flooding, increased mental illness due to prolonged droughts and higher death rates among the elderly and chronically ill due to more frequent very hot days. On 21 November 2016 thousands of people were taken ill and 10 people died in Melbourne due to  thunderstorm asthma. High temperatures, thunderstorms and windy conditions blew rye grass pollen into the city causing the mass incident. Melbourne has now implemented an alert system for epidemic asthma which operates during October and December each year when pollen levels are at their highest. Mary Chiarella, professor of nursing at Sydney university, said increasingly warm weather meant there would be more out-of-season pollen that would extend the asthma risk season. More hot days would drive hospital admissions putting additional stress – and costs – on the health system. “[Economist] Warwick McKibbon says no action is not a zero sum game. Just because you don’t spend the money taking action, doesn’t mean it will deliver a zero cost,” said Steggall. “We are in one of the most exposed regions to climate change,” she said. Steggall said she would be pushing for the expert panel to look into the climate change impacts on health outcomes and to advise the government on its response. “My point of difference [with Tony Abbott] is I do like facts and data,” she said, a reference to the criticism that Abbott has made of her expert panel proposal. At a debate last week, Abbott said Steggall would be shirking her responsibilities as a parliamentarian when she said she would be “led by experts” on climate change policy and what emissions cuts the nation should commit to. She also criticised Abbott’s focus on power costs due to measures to address climate change. “The more people understand the other impacts on them personally, the more the case for action,” she said."
"The recent shocking UN report on the threatened extinction of one million species has focused global attention on the crucial role of biodiversity in the health of the planet. Almost exactly 30 years ago, the first warning sounded that amphibian species were already in potentially catastrophic freefall. Tim Halliday, who has died aged 73, was one of the leading figures in a worldwide initiative to raise the alarm, and to understand the reasons for the decline. The current chief scientist of the Amphibian Survival Alliance, Phil Bishop, called him “the leading champion and ambassador for all things amphibian”. In 1989 Halliday was one of the prime movers in organising the First World Congress of Herpetology (herpetology is the study of amphibians and reptiles) at the University of Kent, Canterbury. While studying the courtship and mating of British newts in the wild, he had noticed over the years that the numbers in his study ponds had been falling. As participants at the congress compared notes, they realised that the same was happening all over the world. Many of these declines were described as “enigmatic”, because frogs, toads, newts and salamanders were dying in supposedly protected habitats.  Following the congress, Halliday and others set up the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force, of which he was international director from 1994 until 2006, under the auspices of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The key task was to record numbers of individuals of different species in locations all around the world, to collate the population data with environmental information, and to highlight those species under threat of extinction. Halliday launched a journal, FrogLog, to share the data, and through a programme of small grants sent young biologists all over the world to find amphibians and record how they were doing. The number of known species has almost doubled since the project began, but the data showed that around one in three was at risk of extinction, more than any other kind of animal. Halliday and his colleagues concluded that amphibians were peculiarly vulnerable because they live both on land and in water. Human activity, leading to habitat loss, pollution and climate change, takes its toll, as does widespread infection by the chytrid fungus. In his darker moments, Halliday described himself as an “extinction biologist” rather than a conservationist, documenting species that would soon no longer exist. He was delighted, however, when Sri Lankan scientists named a new discovery after him: Pseudophilautus hallidayi, or Halliday’s shrub frog. He made a point of going to visit it in its natural habitat, a deep, wooded ravine near Kandy. Halliday was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire. His father, Jack Halliday, taught biology at Marlborough college, and his mother, Edna (nee Barlow), was a housemistress there. Tim attended the school and his passion for wildlife began with collecting leeches in the neighbouring water meadows, wondering at their astonishing diversity. The school also furnished him with a large, hardbacked book of cartridge paper in which to make biological drawings: thereafter he would combine his skills as a draughtsman with scientific inquiry. He studied zoology at Oxford University, and pursued a doctorate on the sexual behaviour of newts in the university’s Animal Behaviour Research Group. The group had been founded by the pioneering ethologist Niko Tinbergen, and provided the starting point for the careers of many others including Desmond Morris, Aubrey Manning and Richard Dawkins. Halliday became known for his summary figure of the smooth newt courtship sequence, reproduced in several textbooks that were beginning to embrace the quantitative approach to behaviour pioneered by the Tinbergen school. In 1977 he was appointed as a lecturer in biology at the Open University, concluding his career there as professor of biology in 2009. He wrote numerous courses on comparative and evolutionary biology and neuroscience, and maintained a busy programme of fundamental research alongside his conservation work. He served on the council of the Zoological Society of London from 1990 until 1998, and chaired its committee on conservation: he called this his “suit and tie” period, being more usually seen in T-shirt and red Kickers. His public communication role included advising the BBC on David Attenborough’s programmes Life on Earth and Life in Cold Blood, and he published a popular handbook on frogs in 2016. Just before Christmas 2016 Halliday’s GP, an old friend, diagnosed him with cancer. It turned out to be a rare and fatal lymphoma. In the years that remained to him, Halliday returned with renewed vigour to his work as a wildlife illustrator, raising thousands of pounds for lymphoma research through an exhibition of his paintings of brilliantly coloured amphibians and birds in September 2018. In 1970 Halliday married Carolyn Wheeler. The daughter of a GP in Marlborough, Carolyn had been the first girl to attend Marlborough college, and had also studied zoology at Oxford – though Halliday had first met her at nursery school. She and their children, Sam, Jo and Alice, survive him, as do two grandchildren. • Timothy Richard Halliday, biologist, born 11 September 1945; died 10 April 2019"

=========================================================
Indeed, for those of us reading reliable reports, we get the sense that they are slowly gaining the upper hand over the problems.
On the other hand, listening to the media report on the Fukushima sitiuation is a bit like listening to a hysterical child who is convinced that he has just seen the boogey man under his bed. Here’s an example of media stupidity and sensationalism:
You just can”t rely on this kind of low level media for accurate, factual and cool-headed information. Not surprisingly, some Germans, who are 9000 km away from the reactors, are actually out buying iodine pills and Geiger counters. Some are probably even digging bomb-shelters by now.
So get the latest news from experts, instead. Here’s the latest update (reality):
From World Nuclear News here (emphasis added): ================================================================

Problems for units 3 and 4
16 March 2011
Earlier, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that a blaze was spotted in the reactor building of Fukushima Daiichi 4 at 5.45am local time this morning. Attempts to extinguish it were reportedly delayed due to high levels of radiation in the area. A spokesperson for TEPCO said that by around 6:15am there were no flames to be seen. The incident at unit 4 is believed to be in the region of a used fuel pond in the upper portion of the reactor building.
FIRST PUBLISHED 0.25am GMT
UPDATE 1:14am GMT
Information from TEPCO spokesman and video feed
UPDATE 2: 4:10am GMT
Update title from ‘Second fire reported at unit 4’ and information on Unit 3 and 4 from Chief Cabinet Secretary Edano
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano has described problems that occurred on the morning of 16 March with Fukushima Daiichi 3 and 4. He also outlined plans to pump water into unit 4.
At 8:34am local time white smoke was seen billowing out of Fukushima Daiichi 3. Efforts to determine the cause of this development were interrupted as all workers had evacuated to a safe area due to rising radiation readings. Readings from a sensor near the front gate had fluctuated for some time, although Edano said that on the whole there was no health hazard. Earlier in the morning readings had ranged between 600-800 microsieverts per hour, but at 10am readings rose to 1000 microsieverts per hour. Readings began to fall again from around 10:54.
Edano said that one possibility being considered was that the unit 3 reactor had suffered a similar failure to that suffered by unit 2 yesterday, although there had been no reported blast or loud sound, which had been the case for unit 2. The immediate focus, said Edano was on monitoring of levels and checking pumping operations.
It was not clear whether the increase in radiation readings were due to the problems today with unit 3 or the ongoing problems resulting from the damage suffered by unit 2, yesterday.
Edano also outlined plans for units 4. Preparations were being made to inject water into unit 4, however the high levels of radiation from unit 3 were impairing those preparations. When possible, the water injection would be done gradually as there were safety concerns over pouring a large amount of water at once. The water will be pumped into the reactor building from the ground, plans to drop water from a helicopter having been abandoned. Although he said that “all things were possible” Edano did not believe that recriticality at unit 4 was a realistic risk.
Second fire at unit 4
Tokyo Electric Power Company issued a notice of an explosion at unit 4 at 6am on 15 March. This was followed by the company’s confirmation of damage around the fifth floor rooftop area of the reactor building. On that day, a fire was discovered but investigations concluded it had died down by around 11am. At present it is not clear whether today’s fire was a completely new blaze, or if the fire reported yesterday had flared up again.”

Here it is in a nutshell:
Reactors 1 and 2: There no news mentioned here about them. And there is a saying about “no news”. Let’s hope it stays that way.
Reactor 3: White smoke was seen, radiation levels went up, but have since come back down. They are monitoring levels and checking pumping operations. I can’t discern a disaster there.
Reactor 4: Here we see that a fire was spotted this morning at 5:45. By 6:15 there were no more flames to be seen.
Overall there are no reports that any of the reactors and containment facilities having melted down, let alone exploded like Chernobyl.
And if the World Nuclear News is not good enough, here’s the latest status report from:
IAEA (emphasis added):
==========================================

Japan Earthquake Update (16 March 2011, 03:55 UTC)
Japanese authorities have informed the IAEA that a fire in the reactor building of Unit 4 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was visually observed at 20:45 UTC of 15 March. As of 21:15 UTC of the same day, the fire could no longer be observed.
Fire of 14 March
As previously reported, at 23:54 UTC of 14 March a fire had occurred at Unit 4. The fire lasted around two hours and was confirmed to be extinguished at 02:00 UTC of 15 March.
Water Level in Unit 5
Japanese authorities have also informed the IAEA that at 12:00 UTC of 15 March the water level in Unit 5 had decreased to 201 cm above the top of the fuel. This was a 40 cm decrease since 07:00 UTC of 15 March. Officials at the plant were planning to use an operational diesel generator in Unit 6 to supply water to Unit 5.
The IAEA continues to liaise with the Japanese authorities and is monitoring the situation as it evolves.”
==================================
Or read here: http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/artikeldetail/article/111/tschernobyl-wiederholt-sich-nicht.html
In a nutshell, no news about Reactors 1-3, the Reactor 4 fire appears to be extinguished, and Reactor 5 seems to be threatening something, but the means of controlling that are at hand.
This all doesn’t mean that we are out of the woods. The next hours will tells us more. In the meantime be careful with all the Hollywood-type of drama and hype you hear from the clueless media and Greenpeace “experts”.
Also you can get press releases from the reactor operator TEPCO. But the press releases are confusing:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Voice Of Russia website has an interview with John Ritch, Director General of the World Nuclear Association, based in London, UK. The interview starts as follows:
What kind of consequences could the decision by the German government have, both in political and economical aspects?
Well, let us return to the basics of what has occurred here. To be successful, democracy requires leadership rather than politician desperately chasing the latest polls. Missus Merkel’s desperate chase has now produced an act of monumental irresponsibility both for the global environment and for Germany’s economic interest. Germany will now pollute more, function less efficiently and depend more on imported energy…
Continue reading (with audio)“
Ritch doesn’t hold back in blasting Germany’s hysterical knee-jerk move away from nuclear power, adding comments as follows:
…excellent companies are being made to bear the burden of this political imbecility…will actually have little effect on the momentum of the world’s continuing shift towards nuclear power…they have become victims of a German experiment in the environmental ideology…has taken a serious step backwards into a dark yesterday…an example of misguided ideology…unfortunate to see such a sophisticated nation falling pray to this kind of ideological illusion…”
And here’s how Ritch views “green” technology industries and a German future based on them:
…they will benefit from it but only to the degree that the government is willing to create subsidies, because they operate technologies that cannot actually succeed in a competitive market…eventually the burden of such heavy subsidies will show up in the tax burden of the ordinary German citizen, and…will begin to notice that their government has led them down a completely silly path.”
In German there ‘s a saying that describes the country’s plan to reach this utopia: “Sie sind auf dem Holzweg!”
This is just the latest sequel to a bad film by Germany’s latest political directors. Call it: Germany Commits Suicide III.

"Eduardo Brondizio’s observation – “We have been displacing our impact around the planet from frontier to frontier. But we are running out of frontiers” – is crucial (Humanity facing ‘urgent threat’ from loss of Earth’s natural life, 7 May). This frontier-based structure of thought, in which there is always a beyond, an outside, a domain of otherness, underpins the dichotomies of class and hence of economics (capital and labour); of race, religion and migration; of gender and sexuality; as well as that of ecology. In every sphere, the uncivilised, untamed, more “natural” partner is positioned for exploitation and subordination. This is the basic structure underlying capitalism, but probably goes back much further to the beginnings of agriculture, when the land was first “tamed”. Its time is up. We have reached the final frontier and there is no longer any outside. The very concept of “nature” is misleading, since it positions human beings over and against something different called the natural world, and which therefore can be conceptualised as providing us with “services”. The concept should be junked.Richard MiddletonCrossmichael, Dumfries and Galloway  • There is a strong case for dating the start of the Anthropocene to 1950, since which time a million species have become threatened; 1950 coincides with the growth of international travel, leading to the introduction of alien species into vulnerable populations which then collapse. Back in 1950, world population was one-third of its current level. A combination of antibiotics, vaccination programmes and ineffective family planning have seen human numbers rocket past 7 billion, and they are still rising. Finally the demands of humanity have led to deforestation and widespread loss of habitat in every part of the globe. It is entirely appropriate that the UN and other institutions produce reports documenting the disappearance and decline of most species on Earth. But they will have no impact at all unless they are accompanied by measures to limit human numbers.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet • Obviously there are many uncomfortable changes we humans are going to have to make in our attempts to rectify our sorry situation, but a very simple, painless and cheap way of making some improvement to our biodiversity is to cease our ever-increasing manicuring of hedgerows and verges. In Sweden, there is legislation to forbid verge-cutting until October; why not here? While many of our remedies to alleviate the situation are costly, this change would actually save money.Judith WrightDarwen, Lancashire • Climate change is the greatest threat facing the countryside. From prolonged heatwaves and moorland wildfires to severe and more frequent flooding, our countryside is under severe pressure from the impact of climate breakdown – but it will also provide many of the solutions. It will take a cross-departmental approach to ensure reaching a net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions is the top priority for all ministers (Emissions must stop by 2050, UK advisers say, 2 May). But by prioritising policies and funding that will see better land use across the countryside, dramatically reduce emissions from agriculture and halt the degradation of soils and increase the planting of hedgerows and trees, and by implementing an ambitious new strategy for the restoration of our peatlands, we can drive carbon back into the ground.Tom FyansDeputy chief executive, Campaign to Protect Rural England • Leading the way in becoming a net zero-carbon country would be a massive challenge, but there is a strong social case for doing so, as well as a practical, moral and strategic one (Editorial, 3 May). It affords us a timely opportunity to bring the country together in an act of national social renewal, by challenging individuals and communities to work together, share good practice and even compete with each other to become the greenest business, town or village in the land. Britain leading the world in carbon reduction could be a way to redefine patriotism for this century and move us on from all those outdated second world war references so beloved of rightwing politicians.Richard AldwinckleLondon • Extinction Rebellion rightly warns of looming catastrophe. Greta Thunberg rightly suggests panic is an appropriate response. Deciding on the best action is now critical. But here’s the problem: most people think reducing CO2 emissions is the “solution” to climate change. The reality is that we also need to start work: removing the trillion tons of CO2 that’s already overheating the planet; and refreezing the Arctic before meltdown becomes irreversible. The increase of CO2 in the atmosphere and the retreat of Arctic sea ice must be halted within a few years. Further intervention for two or three decades can restore the climate norms our grandparents enjoyed. The Foundation for Climate Restoration has been promoting an intervention strategy. It was founded last year by innovator and philanthropist Peter Fiekowsky, and has identified a number of safe and affordable intervention techniques for CO2 removal and sea-ice restoration. Past norms could be restored by 2050 at a cost of less than a thousandth of global GDP per year. The foundation is seeking investment for the development of an initial set of technologies, some of which may eventually pay for themselves. But government support is also needed: for changing agricultural practice to put more carbon in the soil; for promoting algae in our oceans to sequester carbon while restoring fisheries; and for deploying cloud cooling technology and other techniques to refreeze the Arctic.John NissenChair of the Arctic Methane Emergency Group, a partner of the Foundation for Climate Restoration • Most human activities are dependent on the use of energy, whether from fossil fuels or renewable sources. Cutting carbon emissions provides a dangerously false impression of progress towards any target – for 2030, 2040 or 2050 - aimed at reducing climate change. As the figures published daily on the Guardian weather page show, the concentration of emissions in the atmosphere is rising inexorably. That is the cause of rising temperatures. It is only when zero global emissions have been achieved that the world can begin to benefit from their reduction. In the years that it will take to arrive at that level, the situation will be graver as, meanwhile, emissions are being added to the existing concentration. It will require stopping using any fossil fuels, whether for heating and hot water, petrol, diesel and most electricity-powered car use, train travel, second homes abroad, air travel, carnivorous diets, long distance freight – and large families. Only governments can make this mandatory. They have no other option. Are we too selfish to forgo our preferred lifestyles even though that will mean our children and grandchildren will face Armageddon?Dr Mayer HillmanLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

That’s probably good news for the gas industry, and for Germany’s neighbours.
But right now, Germany does not have the gas capacity to step in and take up the slack, and so expect the country to put its gas development on the fast-track, and to import.
The construction of coal power plants faces massive resistance here, and so that too is also out of the picture. So where will Germany get its power when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow?
By abandoning coal and nuclear, Germany may succeed in isolating itself when it comes to energy. Either it will have to become dependent on its neighbors, or its population will be expected to behave like energy misers and to fret over every milliwatt that gets used.
Some of Germany’s electric power will be generated by natural gas. And the rest? Not to worry. Germany has got plenty of neighbors around who are less prone to atomic hysteria and who will be willing to sell power – for a price. Plenty of new atomic power capacity is being planned just to the east (see World Nuclear Association). And everywhere else around the world, atomic power plants are being constructed, planned or proposed.
Reactors now under construction
According to the World Nuclear Association, 62 reactors are currently under construction.

China: 27 reactors
Russia: 10
India: 5
Germany: 0
Many more reactors are being planned – 158 in total. When one looks at the chart, Germany columns are filled with goose eggs.
China: 50 reactors
India: 18
Japan: 12
Russia 14
USA: 9
Germany: 0
And many more are being proposed: 324 reactors in all.
China: 110 reactors
India: 40
Italy 10
Russia 30
Ukraine: 20
Japan: 12
Russia 14
USA: 23
UAE: 10
Vietnam: 12
Turkey: 4
Poland: 6
Germany: 0
Plenty of Germany’s neighbors are positioning to take over the job of producing electricity. If Germany should find it’s too expensive to produce electricity with sun and wind, or it’s too difficult to get a steady supply, then it will have to call Italy, Ukraine, Poland or Russia for help.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChanging the Arctic Climate
 By Ed Caryl
GISS and the GHCN are preoccupied with the Arctic, bestowing large “corrections” on the few and far northern stations. The raw data of the Arctic did not tell the story they wanted to hear, and so GISS took it upon themselves to rewrite it.
Let’s start with Figure 1 from Paul Homewood’s article How GISS has totally Corrupted Reykjavik’s Temperature, used by permission.

Figure 1: Corrupted Reykjavik’s temperature
In January of this year, Paul Homewood of Not A Lot of People Know That, wrote an article describing GHCN and GISS changes to the temperature data that resulted in early 20th century cooling in Reykjavik, Iceland. Because I had stored many annual temperature records for Arctic stations in preparing A Light In Siberia in September of 2010, this prompted an investigation into whether GHCN and GISS had pulled the same on other station data. The short answer…yes they had!
Last year in May, GHCN did a major revision of their historical temperature database. They changed the title of the database to GHCN-M version 3. GISS followed. They refer to the new data as GHCN_v3. The important thing to note is that GHCN_v3 already contains homogeneity “corrections” so there is in most cases now, no difference between
GISS “raw” data (after removing suspicious records), and “after GISS homogeneity adjustments.” As a result, we only get to see temperature data that has already been modified by the hand of man (or a computer under the direction of a man).
What has this done to temperatures? You get one guess.

Figure 2. This is a GHCN comparison of database version 2 and version 3. Land and Ocean Temperatures for January. Source: NOAA/GHCN here.
The chart is subtle in that the scale is chosen to hide the slope and amount of the change trend. But look closely. Note that the change trend is from cooler in the past to warmer in the present, even though the temperature trend is already in that direction. They just added another ~0.1°C to the century trend.
What did they do in the Arctic? Above the Arctic Circle, there are few weather stations.

Figure 3. This is the last ten years temperature trend. From GISS.
The red Arctic grids on the anomaly maps represent ten stations, most in Arctic Russia. It is a bit difficult to sort out specifically which stations these are. Eleven stations in or close to these locations were investigated. Many have quite large “corrections.” Ostrov Dixon is the red grid square on the left on the north coast of Russia. Barrow is the orange grid square at the top of Alaska. Figure 4 is the first example.

Figure 4. This is the temperature change and change amounts to the Ostrov Dixon (Dickson Island) station.
The mainstream climate scientists have always disliked the warming in the 1920’s, 30’s, and 40’s, and the cooling in the 1960’s and 70’s. At several locations in the Arctic they have sought to “correct” these years.

Figure 5. Ostrov Kotel (Kettle Island)

At Ostrov Kotel they simply warmed the whole series from just before 1950 to 1995 With obvious steps at each end of the change. At Barrow, (Figure 6) the change was a series of ramps. This makes little sense at Barrow. For all its history the measuring site has been at the airport. Barrow has a well-documented heat island, but the correction is in the wrong direction for that. Again, the correction takes away most of the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s cooling.

Figure 6. This is the temperature change at Barrow.
At most locations they were not so obvious. For 11 locations that seem to be the heart of the warm grids, here are the plots.

Figure 7. The GHCN/GISS corrections at 11 Arctic locations.
It is very difficult to see a pattern in Figure 7. Some stations have a wild pattern of corrections of several degrees. Some have just a few spikes here and there. Some have a definite pattern.

Figure 8. This is the average “correction” of all the stations in Figure 7 with a linear trend line.
Figure 8 shows the pattern: cooling of the distant past, and warming of the inconvenient 60’s and 70’s.
Figure 9 below shows the average anomaly for those 11 stations:

Figure 9. This is the average anomaly for the 11 stations before and after GHCN “corrections”, with trend lines.
In Figure 9, the “corrections” have doubled the warming trend from 0.7°C per century to 1.4°C per century. The pesky warming in the 20’s and 30’s, and the cooling of the 60’s and 70’s are now nearly on the same level, almost wiping out that inconvenient AMO cycle.
I had data from a dozen other Arctic and Northern Siberian stations from last year. Most of those had just a few minor changes. Here (Figure 10) is the average correction for all 23 stations. As one gets further from the extreme Arctic, the changes begin to average out. If all stations around the globe are included, the average becomes that slow warming “correction” seen in Figure 2.

Figure 10. This is the average of 23 Arctic stations.
GHCN seems preoccupied with the Arctic, bestowing large “corrections” on the few far northern stations. This is in line with the “climate scientists” belief system:

The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe.
Ocean cycles have little effect on the climate.
The present decade is the warmest.
CO2 rules.

This confirmation bias gets reflected in every evaluation step when reviewing temperature records. The result is that each new data release further confirms what they look for. Can we trust the GHCN and GISS temperature data? You be the judge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people view environmentalist groups as friendly folks who only want to protect nature. The reality, however, is that many are very powerful, intolerant, and have the means to bully, intimidate, and criminalize people just for having a different opinion.Take for example Hubert Weiger of the powerful German environmental group BUND (Bund für Natur Deutschland). At eco-website Klimaretter (Climate Rescuer) here, Weiger fumes at Canada and wants the UN to start a legal process because the country backed out of the completely useless Kyoto treaty. Klimaretter writes:
In 2012, the United Nations should introduce a breach of contract process against Canada because the country backed out of the Kyoto contract. This is what the Chairman of the environmental association BUND, Hubert Weiger demands. ‘Also the German government must apply pressure,’ said Weiger in a interview with klimaretter.info.”
Still not clear to you? Well you listen, and you listen good! Klimaretter continues:
‘The community of nations cannot stand by and simply let a country throw this kind of crucial human rights binding contract into the dustbin,’ he believes.”
There are plenty of German eco-kooks within the government, and so Canada ought not take these threats too lightly. Canada can reckon with a massive smear campaign from the intolerant environmentalists in Europe. Weiger then adds:
“Not only did Germany reach its targets without any problems, but also did so reaping economic benefits. Climate protection is a central innovation driver for the economy and creates considerably more jobs than it destroys.”
In addition to scientific papers, Herr Weiger also obviously hasn’t been reading the financial papers. The reality is quite to the contrary. Germany’s energy sector is nearing a meltdown of unprecedented dimensions (soon to appear in English). This year the country went from being a major net exporter to a major net importer of energy. Germany’s solar companies are drowning in red ink and teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Moreover, conventional power companies have announced the sackings of thousands of well-paid workers. Also read here, Green Economy 2011 in a Nosedive.

And in the wake of Fukushima, Germany elected to wipe out an entire industry in which it was a global leader when it came to safety and innovation: nuclear power. For some, the shutdown of nuclear plants can’t come soon enough. Klimaretter writes:
Weiger is demanding that the nuclear exit be moved up to 2012 or 2013.”
Shutting down all of Germany’s nuclear reactors might be tough to explain to the public. No problem though, Weigner has a solution for that too:
What we need is a ‘comprehensive information and motivation campaign, beginning with kindergarten and extending through to seniors, on TV, radio, Internet at all levels – from the federal government on through to the municipalities and local communities.”
Talk about scary. Sounds like something from the old playbooks of authoritarian regimes. It wouldn’t be scary if this was just from an obscure green kook from a fringe organization. But these are the recommendations of an organization that is widely quoted by the media daily and is well-connected to Germany’s top government levels.
Canada, beware! They hate you because you have a different opinion and you refuse to fall to your knees before them. And you’ve been making too many plans for your damn dirty tar sands.
One final note: One of the main contributors to Klimaretter is centre-left SPD honcho Michael Müller. I can only surmise that he condones this type of highly intrusive, authoritarian-style of global and local interference.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more that time runs out for the world to stop “dangerous climate change”, the more the world seems to drag its feet and postpone limiting so-called greenhouse gases. The disconnect between the supposedly imminent threat and the world’s reaction could not be more profound.
If anything, the world’s reaction confirms that global warming is nothing really but hot air.
According to Der Spiegel, a realistic new deadline looks to be 2014 or 2015. A new treaty would regulate CO2 emissions for 40 industrial countries. But Russia, Japan, Canada and the USA have already said they would not join in.
China, the world’s greatest CO2 emitter, and India are not bound to CO2 reductions in any treaty. Currently represenatives from 180 countries are meeting in Bonn in a half-hearted attempt to lay the groundwork for Durban.
Der Spiegel reports here again that the world will likely postpone in Durban signing a climate treaty to succeed Kyoto I. Speigel writes:
here also will likely be no new international treaty at the next climate conference in Durban South Africa at the end of the year. The United Nations no longer anticipates a successor treaty for the Kyoto Climate Protocol to be finished on time. The end of December deadline will be missed, said Christiana Figueres, UN Climate Chief said at a UN conference in Bonn.

Prospects look dim. Even WWF “climate expert” Tasneem Esso sees the writing on the wall, and says:
The current political framework is not favourable for a treaty. We cannot be optimistic.”
Speigel reports that the USA says it is in favour of a Kyoto 2, but only if nations like China are included. China, which is rapidly modernizing its economy, refuses to restict its CO2 emissions.
Officials and scientists are claiming the situation is urgent. Der Spiegel writes that the number of annual “reported natural catastrophes” has doubled over the last 2 decades from 200 to 400, and that:
The number of catastrophe refusgees jumped 2 and half times from 2009 to 2010. In total more than 90% of the catastrophes in the past year could be traced back to weather events.”
Der Spiegel does not provide any source for these statistics other than quoting “some scientists”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper titled High-resolution sea surface reconstructions off Cape Hatteras over the last 10 ka appearing just recently in the AGU Paleoceanography Journal authored by Caroline Cléroux et al provides further, clear evidence of a major solar impact on climate during the Holocene. Hat/tip: http://kaltesonne.de/.
According to the paper’s abstract, the study presents high-resolution foraminiferal-based sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity and upper water column stratification reconstructions off Cape Hatteras, a region sensitive to atmospheric and thermohaline circulation changes associated with the Gulf Stream.
Now if I recall correctly, this was the region that Stefan Rahmstorf deemed not long ago as good enough to be used to represent sea level trend for the whole world.
The above authors focused on the last 10,000 years to study the surface hydrology changes under our current climate conditions and looked at centennial to millennial time scale variability. To do this, a seabed core was extracted off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina at a water depth of 620 m.
They observed opposite evolutions between the conditions off Cape Hatteras and those south of Iceland, known today for the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern. Around 8.3 ka and 5.2–3.5 ka, they reconstructed positive salinity anomalies off Cape Hatteras. For the 5.2–3.5 ka period they demonstrated that the salinity increase was caused by the cessation of the low salinity surface flow coming from the north.
What’s behind the anomalies? They found that variations were in sync with total solar irradiance. The abstract states (emphasis added):
Wavelet transform analysis revealed a 1000-year period pacing the d18O signal over the early Holocene. This 1000-year frequency band is significantly coherent with the 1000-year frequency band of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) between 9.5 ka and 7 ka and both signals are in phase over the rest of the studied period.”
The paper’s introduction has a few sentences that the IPCC really needs to take note of (emphasis added):

The last decade of paleoclimate research has shown that the Holocene is not the stable, climatic event-free period as previously thought: both external and internal (oceanic) forcings have caused major climatic changes. […] On a shorter time scale, observations over about the last 50 years show interannual and decadal climate change. These fluctuations probably persisted throughout the Holocene, together with centennial to millennial variability.”
Dr. Sebastian Lüning writes at the Die kalte Sonne site:
The new findings once again clearly underscore that the last several thousands of years are characterized by natural temperature cycles that are controlled by fluctuations in solar activity (see p. 68-75 in ‘Die kalte Sonne’). The logical continuation of these natural cycles through today shows that an important part of the warming of the last 150 years has to be attributed to the increase in solar activity. It is not a mere coincidence that the last decades have been the most solar active of the last 10,000 years.
The climate models used by the IPCC are not able to reproduce these millennial cycles because they assign only a very small climate impact to the sun. Also the recently introduced new climate model from the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg suffers from the same deficiency, and thus the results of that model are essentially unrealistic.”
In layman’s terms: crap in, crap out.
Once again yet another study that emphatically shows that climate changed in the recent past (while CO2 was stable), and that these changes were in sync with solar activity. We’ve said it a thousand times before, and we’ll probably have to say it another thousand times:
“It’s the sun, moron!”

"Larry Turner doesn’t expect to be back. “We’re going to lose our town,” he said as he hosed down what little he was able to rescue from his 95-year-old mother’s house after weeks underwater in the small Iowa community of Pacific Junction. “I’ve been here 68 years and this is the worst I’ve ever seen. Every home got destroyed.”  Pacific Junction’s 470 residents were forced to flee in mid-March after a surge of water hit the Missouri river and busted through levees the length of Iowa to create the region’s biggest floods in living memory. The breach that wrecked the town occurred a few miles to the north. Within hours, surrounding farmland disappeared under an inland sea and Pacific Junction was drowned by 15 feet of water. It was a month before most residents could get back into their homes and no one has returned permanently because their houses are uninhabitable. Pacific Junction’s streets are still piled high with remnants of furniture, washing machines and toys. Officials went through the town tagging which homes might be salvaged and which are doomed. Some residents have marked houses “For sale. As is” but it is difficult to imagine who would buy.  Turner worked in construction for most of his life and judged that the water damage was too great to save either his mother’s house or his own. “My place is five blocks from here. I got a brother lives here in town. He got flooded out. My sister lives here in town. She got flooded out,” he said.  Besides the cost of rebuilding, Turner has another factor to consider when deciding whether to return to the town he has lived in since birth. The surge in water was driven by rapidly melting snows to the north and the “bomb cyclone” late winter storm that dumped huge amounts of rain on the region. Coming after years of intensifying rains, storms and drought increasingly attributed to climate change, Turner wonders if there’s even a future for towns like Pacific Junction without addressing the dramatic shifts in the weather. It’s a question being pondered by communities and farmers across the Midwest. America’s two great rivers book-end Iowa. The Missouri runs along the state’s western border and the Mississippi marks its eastern boundary. Both have set record floods in recent weeks. In the west of the state, Pacific Junction’s trauma is shared the length of the Missouri in Iowa and beyond as the huge flow of water breached one levee after another, turning the meandering river into a series of lakes, swamping farms, closing an interstate highway and washing though towns. Three hundred miles to the east, the city of Davenport is grappling with more than 50 days of flooding after the Mississippi spilled over its banks, broke through a barrier and washed into downtown. The streets of smaller cities to the south, such as Buffalo, were underwater for days. Democratic presidential candidates have descended on flood-battered communities on both rivers. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke were among those campaigning in Iowa who directly linked the floods to climate change. That’s a politically sensitive topic in a state where three-quarters of registered Republicans regard climate change as only a “minor” or “no real threat”. But the flooding, and its duration as well as scale, have focussed attention on long-term planning to deal with the impact of changing weather patterns even among those who question their cause. In Davenport, a city of 103,000 on the border with Illinois, the flooding has prompted renewed debate about how best to prepare for what is widely assumed to be more regular and sustained surges on the Mississippi. “Between hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts, literally all within a year, something’s changing,” said Davenport’s mayor, Frank Klipsch. “I think we would be irresponsible if we don’t address that.” Davenport has for years deployed a portable barrier to contain overflow from the river in an area of waterside parkland that serves as a flood plain. But the city was hit with a huge surge in the Mississippi this year and the water has stayed around for longer than at any time on record. After six weeks, a section of the barrier collapsed and water rushed into parts of downtown, flooding businesses. Klipsch said the old response would have been to build a higher flood wall. That has met with opposition over what a concrete barrier would do to the riverside view and the large cost to local taxpayers. But the bigger issue, the mayor said, is that cities such as Davenport should no longer act alone. “You talk to some people here and they’re, ‘Just put up a flood wall’. But you step back a little and that isolationism isn’t necessarily the best approach today,” said Klipsch. “The river is not one city but a whole system in of itself so that whatever one city does it impacts others along the river. What we do here very well may have a very detrimental effect on cities down river. One of our small cities, Buffalo, just south of us, had tremendous flood problems now. If we were to put up a flood protection wall it would basically funnel an excessive amount of water and would literally blow that community away.” Klipsch, who visited Belgium recently and noted that the discussion around the climate crisis in Europe is a very different beast from in the US, said that even those who question why the weather is changing mostly no longer doubt that it is. That, he said, has opened the way to more honest discussion about how to deal with the practical effects. Klipsch is co-chair of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative of 124 mayors along the river, many of whom are increasingly outspoken in their belief that climate change is not only real but going to have an increasingly serious impact on their communities. “I haven’t heard anybody disagree that there are climate changes happening. The source of the climate change may be in debate for some. For many of us it’s not. But it still has to be dealt with. Even very conservative areas realize they’re struggling with many, many climate issues they’re going to have to deal with. When the problem is so clear, it’s easier to get everybody in the same room pushing in the same direction.” Klipsch said that in Davenport that means deciding what level of flooding the community is prepared to accept and whether that means allowing a larger part of the city to act as a flood plain in order to help protect towns downstream. That, in turn, would require the city to decide how to manage wider and more frequent incursions by the river. The baseball stadium on the river’s edge is already surrounded by its own flood wall and became a small island in the Mississippi for weeks. But the sewage and fresh water plants for the city also sit close to the river. “We’re looking at potential flood levels in the future and how to accommodate those. Should we start planning for 22 foot being more of a normal? Or 23? Or 24? Our big concern is we have to make sure the infrastructure stays functional,” said Klipsch.  But even now not everyone agrees that such planning is necessary. Andy Young, the mayor of Pacific Junction, does not pin the flood on climate change. It is, he said, a once-in-a-lifetime event. “My thought is Mother Nature had a lot to do with it because it was rain. That’s not climate change. It’s Mother Nature bringing on her fury,” he said. Turner disagrees. “I believe in climate change. The weather has really changed in the past years,” he said. The changing weather patterns have prompted a different discussion about priorities along the Missouri where criticism has focussed on the US Army Corps of Engineers which dams the river, and decides how much water to release downstream. Turner and others in Pacific Junction accuse the corps of keeping dam levels too high to preserve fish habitats and facilitate recreational boating. They say that means there is less capacity to contain a rush of water from a large snow melt or bomb cyclone, and the corps is then obliged to release large volumes of water downstream. Last year, a federal judge sided with farmers along the Missouri who blamed the corps for facilitating flooding. Hundreds of farmers and business owners across six states sued the corps, accusing it of putting wildlife conservation ahead of flood protection. The ruling said that if the army continues to manage the river and dams in the way that it does, then flooding can be expected to continue. Some environmentalists criticise the farmers themselves for taking over natural floodplains that should be used to contain overflow from the rivers and protect towns along the Missouri. They say there needs to be a discussion about returning the land to serving the river. For now though, the immediate struggle in Pacific Junction is to see whether the town even has a future. The mayor said it can come back. “A lot of these families have been down here between 40 and 80 years. I’m fourth generation. My daughter is a fifth. There is nothing that was untouched. It’s completely gutted. But we’ll start over again,” he said. Turner is doubtful. “I’d say we’d be lucky to get 25% back. I don’t think it’ll be a town anymore,” he said."
"The first drafts of Dyson’s closely guarded electric car designs have emerged, showing a vehicle with unusual proportions that could be used off-road. The patent filings are the first clue to what the “radically different” car pledged by the British inventor Sir James Dyson might look like.  Dyson said the patents were “deliberately light on specifics”, but revealed some of the ways in which the company was trying to improve on current electric vehicles in its £2.5bn development project. The car’s very large and narrow wheels could allow for increased range and efficiency, according to Dyson, essential for battery-powered vehicles. The wheels would be kept as close to the front and back of the vehicle as possible to make the car “highly manoeuvrable … and improving handling on rough terrain.” Despite the high ground clearance, the vehicle’s overall height would be lower than most SUVs, and a larger, thinner battery pack than rivals would help give more space inside. The driver would sit lower in the cabin, with a shallow-angled windscreen improving aerodynamics. The patents were filed 18 months ago but only published this week. The cars are expected to launch in 2021, a year behind the original date. Dyson, whose fortune was built on revolutionising the traditional vacuum cleaner design, has so far indicated the car would be a premium vehicle, implying a price tag in the range of a Tesla, which costs £38,000 for a Model 3 or about £70,000 for a Model S. The designs underscore that the new car will also need bespoke parts such as tyres. Dyson has said the vehicle will go on sale in a limited number of countries at first, with China likely to be a frontrunner, and would be “entirely designed by Dyson, manufactured by Dyson and sold by Dyson”. The car would build on Dyson technology used in its other products, such as its own motor and battery types. The billionaire, who was an outspoken supporter of Brexit, provoked anger by announcing last year that the car would be manufactured in Singapore rather than Britain. The company is about to start construction work on its new plant in Singapore, because Dyson believes there is a bigger market for electric vehicles in Asia. However, he maintains the car is a British project, with the design, engineering and testing of prototypes being carried out at Hullavington airfield, where hangars have been converted to house the project. In an email sent to more than 500 staff working on the vehicle, Dyson stressed the need to keep the details of his new product secret. However, he said patents were needed as the car would “include fundamentally new technologies and make some inventive leaps”. But he also cautioned that “we do not always use patents or make products based on patents that we have filed”. He said competitors had missed opportunities by adapting electric vehicles from existing formats, but Dyson’s was “a vehicle which has been developed from the bottom up”. The British government has pledged to ban fossil fuel vehicles by 2040, in response to climate change targets and air pollution concerns. Dyson has urged the prime minister, Theresa May, to bring forward the date of the ban by a decade to 2030, describing the existing target as “madness”. He told the Financial Times he believed the electric car market had been underestimated, adding: “I believe it’s driven not so much by subsidies as by genuine desire of the public to have silent and non-polluting vehicles.”"
"Entire communities might need to be moved away from coasts and rivers as the UK takes urgent action to prepare for an average global temperature rise of 4C, the Environment Agency warned. The agency said on Thursday that difficult decisions would have to be taken in the coming years to make sure the UK was resilient amid flooding that would not be held back by higher land defences.  Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, set out the regulator’s long-term strategy for tackling flooding and coastal change, which, she said, was a preparation for a 4C rise in global temperatures. The rise is far in excess of the target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels set in the legally binding Paris Agreement of 2015. “The coastline has never stayed in the same place and there have always been floods, but climate change is increasing and accelerating these threats,” said Howard Boyd. “We can’t win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences. We need to develop consistent standards for flood and coastal resilience in England that help communities better understand their risk and give them more control about how to adapt and respond.” The strategy text says the approach to flood protection and assessing risk had to change. “We need to act now without delay … we need to apply a different philosophy.” Instead of acting once a flood had happened the country needed to build “climate resilient” communities, homes and businesses, and simply building bigger and bigger walls as defences was not the solution, the document says. The policy calls for natural barriers and flood relief systems, but also for an increase in the resilience of homes and businesses against the inevitable flooding with such structures as flood doors and stone floors. The strategy also makes clear that some areas of the UK and some homes and businesses cannot be protected. “Despite our collective best efforts, we will not always be able to prevent flooding and coastal change happening.” The priority in these areas will be to keep people safe, minimise damage and aid quick recovery. Ultimately it may also mean supporting individuals and communities in a move from an affected area. “Resilience includes accepting that in some places we can’t eliminate all flooding and coastal change, and so we need to be better at adapting to living with the consequences – for example, by designing homes that can be restored quickly after they’ve been inundated with water, or potentially moving communities out of harm’s way.” It is already thought unbeneficial to protect or adapt about 114 miles of coastline because of flooding, and more than 1,000 miles of coast are at risk of erosion. A recent report from the government’s advisory panel the Committee on Climate Change said that by the 2080s up to 1.5m properties in England could be in areas of significant levels of flood risk. In the Humber estuary rising sea levels and river flooding are putting 55,000 homes at risk. In 2013 a tidal surge hit the east coast, forcing thousands of people to abandon homes as areas of the North Sea rose to higher levels than had happened in the floods of 1953. In Devon, in 2014, people were forced from their homes and a key stretch of the railway link to the rest of the UK was destroyed in storms and flooding. More homes would be at risk in the future as the number of properties built on floodplains was likely to double over the next 50 years, the agency warns. The agency set out a target, for up to 2050, for the UK to become resilient to flood and coastal risks, and for a policy of “resilience for places”, referring to the ability of communities to cope with, and recover from, all sources of flooding or coastal change. The agency says an average outlay of £1bn a year will be needed to build traditional flood and coastal defences and allow for natural flood management. “Flooding of any kind is horrendous,” the report says. “Erosion destroys. [Floods] are dirty, invasive, damaging, and can kill. They can force people to leave their homes and their businesses, cause prolonged mental ill health, and destroy livelihoods, natural habitats and other valued places. At best flooding and coastal change can be inconvenient and disruptive.” Lord Deben, chair of the  Committee on Climate Change, last week called for the British government to immediately set a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. He said the UK urgently needed to stay ahead of worsening impacts by adapting. “The Environment Agency is doing just that by setting out their flood strategy, but we won’t be able to keep up with the pace of change if we don’t reduce emissions to zero,” he said. Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said smarter adaptation and building resilience to flooding was undeniably important but that the focus should be first and foremost on slashing emissions to avoid the worst consequences of climate chaos. “With its relentless pursuit of fracking, airport expansion and road building, and barely tepid support for renewable energy, our government is failing with this regard,” Childs said. The environment minister, Thérèse Coffey, said the government was already providing £2.6bn over six years, delivering more than 1,500 projects to better protect 300,000 homes. “But the threat of climate change will mean an increasing risk, and preparing the country is a priority for the government, and the nation as a whole,” she said, adding that the government would be launching a call for evidence to inform action on flood and coastal erosion risks."
"George Monbiot wants the world to stop eating fish (Journal, 9 May). However, considering over a billion people rely on fish as part of their diet, many of them in poorer parts of the world, simply cutting fish out – even if it were possible – would deprive millions of people of an essential protein source and vital source of income. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) provides an international benchmark for sustainable fishing that ensures certified fisheries safeguard fish stocks and our oceans. Monbiot criticises the MSC for certifying unsustainable fisheries. But his examples include a tuna fishery that has nearly eradicated shark finning in its fishery. The steps taken by this certified fishery have helped to secure livelihoods for a suite of small-island developing nations, and they have contributed to the protection of important species, including sharks.  The Shetland dredged scallop fishery is also called out – yet this fishery has worked hard to be the only UK dredged scallop fishery to bear the MSC label. It covers less than 5% of Shetland waters, providing a haven for biogenic reefs and ecologically significant maerl beds in these waters. In fact, this fishery is inspiring a new direction for the UK scallop fleet, which is working with scientists, government, environmental groups and the UK seafood sector to forge a sustainable path forward. There is no simple solution to the challenges faced by our oceans, and in the context of a growing global population we need to find sustainable sources of seafood that safeguard our seas. The MSC is contributing to the solution through its rigorous eco-label programme by incentivising sustainable fishing at a global level to help preserve our seafood supplies for this and future generations. Making a global industry sustainable is complex and takes time. But the MSC is committed to global ocean sustainability by setting standards that help preserve our seafood supplies for this and future generations.Erin PriddleMSC program director, UK and Ireland • George Monbiot makes some key points about the devastation of fish stocks. Importantly, he also draws attention to the huge concentration of ownership – a very different image from the poor fisherman being destroyed by EU policies. However, he misses the fact that fishing subsidies have helped create this situation – subsidies for building more efficient boats with radar and sonar systems that make fishing rather like shooting into a barrel. Fishing subsidies, like farming subsidies, go to the rich few, not to the small operator. Greed is the reason for the decline of the industry.Sam LairdLe Causse, Souillac, France • Your editorial (A million species face extinction. One species is to blame – and will pay too, Journal, 8 May) does well to note that phytoplankton are “barely noticed at all”. When the microscopic oceanic organisms do get mentioned, it is entirely for absorbing carbon dioxide. But, like the carbon-extracting forests, they are even more significant for the fact that by using photosynthesis they trap the carbon from carbon dioxide and release the oxygen as a byproduct into the atmosphere. This oxygen is essential for all animal life, including humankind. Roughly one-third is released by rainforests and most of the remainder comes from marine plants of which the phytoplankton are the most significant members. Small increases in ocean temperatures devastate the growth of phytoplankton. We are one of the million species that face extinction as a result of ocean warming caused by climate change.Dr Keith SnellCockermouth, Cumbria • While the need for government action on climate change and environmental breakdown is urgent, all of those who are employed as leaders and managers in the public, private or third sectors should surely be looking closely at what their organisation can do to turn things round and making the necessary changes, sooner rather than later. Protesting is important, but it’s time now for all of us to take action in whatever sphere we can.Fiona CarnieBath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"A group of Torres Strait Islanders from low-lying islands off the northern coast of Australia will on Monday lodge a complaint with the United Nations human rights committee against the Australian government, alleging climate inaction. The complaint will assert that the Morrison government has failed to take adequate action to reduce emissions or pursue proper adaptation measures on the islands and, as a consequence, has failed fundamental human rights obligations to Torres Strait Islander people.  One of the complainants, sixth-generation Warraber man, Kabay Tamu, said in a statement: “When erosion happens, and the lands get taken away by the seas, it’s like a piece of us that gets taken with it – a piece of our heart, a piece of our body. That’s why it has an effect on us. Not only the islands but us, as people. “We have a sacred site here, which we are connected to spiritually. And disconnecting people from the land, and from the spirits of the land, is devastating. “It’s devastating to even imagine that my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren being forced to leave because of the effects that are out of our hands. “We’re currently seeing the effects of climate change on our islands daily, with rising seas, tidal surges, coastal erosion and inundation of our communities.” The non-profit coordinating the complaint by the Torres Strait Islanders says this will be the first climate change litigation brought against the Australian government based on a human rights complaint, and also the first legal action worldwide brought by inhabitants of low-lying islands against a nation state. Lawyers with environmental law non-profit ClientEarth, are representing the islanders, with support from British-based barristers. The UN Human Rights Committee is a body of 18 legal experts that sits in Geneva. The committee monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The complainants are alleging that Australia has violated article 27, the right to culture; article 17, the right to be free from arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home; and article 6, the right to life. According to briefing material supplied by ClientEarth, the complaint alleges these rights have been violated both by Australia’s insufficient greenhouse gas mitigation targets and plans, and by its failure to fund adequate coastal defence and resilience measures on the islands, such as seawalls. Lawyers for the islanders allege that the catastrophic nature of the predicted future impacts of climate change on the Torres Strait Islands, including the total submergence of ancestral homelands, is a sufficiently severe impact as to constitute a violation of the rights to culture, family and life. The islanders want the government to commit at least $20m for emergency measures such as seawalls, as requested by local authorities, and sustained investment in long-term adaptation measures to ensure the islands can continue to be inhabited. They want a commitment to reduce emissions by at least 65% below 2005 levels by 2030 and going net zero before 2050 and a phase out of thermal coal, both for domestic electricity generation and export markets. ClientEarth’s lead lawyer for the case, Sophie Marjanac, said in a statement: “Climate change is fundamentally a human rights issue. The predicted impacts of climate change in the Torres Strait, including the inundation of ancestral homelands, would be catastrophic for its people. “Australia’s continued failure to build infrastructure to protect the islands, and to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, constitutes a clear violation of the islanders’ rights to culture, family and life.” The impact of climate change has been a significant touchstone in the 2019 election. A recent poll from a respected foreign policy thinktank, the Lowy Institute, has found a majority of Australians believe global warming is a critical threat. The poll undertaken for Lowy says 64% of adults rank climate change number one on a list of 12 threats to Australia’s national interests, up six points from last year’s survey and a jump of 18 points since 2014. The 2019 result is the first time climate has topped the list of threats since Lowy began the research in 2006."
"We humans pride ourselves on our ability to look beyond immediate concerns and think on a grander scale. While other creatures preen for mates, hunt prey or build homes, only humans ponder the nature of time, explore our place in the universe or are troubled by the question of what wiped out the dinosaurs. Yet we are often poor at focusing on and understanding the things which really matter. A new mass extinction is under way, and this time we are mostly responsible. The new UN Global Assessment Report warns that a million plant and animal species are at risk of being wiped out. Most of us find it impossible to visualise such a large number. Focusing on individual cases is only partially helpful. Plenty of tears are shed for charismatic megafauna such as rhinos when they are driven to the brink. Fewer know or care that two in five amphibian species are under threat. Phytoplankton drifting in the ocean are barely noticed at all, but absorb carbon dioxide as well as being eaten by zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by larger creatures, in turn eaten by ourselves.  It took only a century for humans to discover the dodo and drive it to extinction. But annihilation is now too speedy and commonplace for us to even recognise each species: we are sending creatures to their deaths before we know what they are. In many more cases species will survive, but in far tinier numbers. The biomass of wild animals has fallen by 82%; hedgehog populations in the British countryside halved in the last half-century. In contrast, our own population soars, and so does its consumption. Climate change is one of the major causes of this catastrophe, bleaching corals and damaging habitats. Any sensible strategy must consider them together, as an environmental emergency. But there are also specific challenges to wildlife, including the replacement of forests by fields of cows; overfishing; the impact of pesticides and fertilisers; the pollution of air and water and soil; and the spread of plastics through our oceans and food chains. Government leaders must press this issue by raising it personally instead of leaving it to ministers; Emmanuel Macron has pledged to do so when he hosts the G7 summit this year. They should start now: next autumn, countries will meet in China for a UN conference on biodiversity, setting new targets. There has been shamefully slow progress towards the existing ones, drawn up in Japan in 2010, though there have been some successes. The US never even ratified the convention on biological diversity, hindering its chances of gaining traction. The best hope of progress there is perhaps through a version of a Green New Deal incorporating biodiversity. There are already signs of a shift in thinking. A new OECD report makes a bold call for taxes on wildlife-degrading companies, and the diversion of finance to biodiversity-boosting projects rather than damaging ones; fossil fuel companies and agribusiness continue to receive vast subsidies. Many believe a more radical rethinking of our economic model is needed. Real change will require a depth of imagination, ambition and sheer determination which humans have historically struggled to muster. Yet if we cannot summon the required concern for a million species, we could at least focus on one: our own. We may not be charmed by Earth’s 5.5 million insect species, but we need them to pollinate crops, disperse seeds and break down waste to enrich the soil. Through ignorance, greed, laziness and simple lack of attention we are wiping out the very creatures upon whom we ourselves depend."
"A new UN report is set to reveal that up to 1m species face extinction because of human actions. The loss of pollinating insects and other ecological disasters – from the destruction of flood-saving mangroves to air pollution – poses no less of a threat than climate change, according to the report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).  We are triggering a mass extinction event, and critically we cannot separate one environmental crisis from another. Biodiversity loss cannot be partitioned from climate change, or from human population growth or pollution or plastics in our oceans. These challenges are all interconnected. We face an ecology of environmental concerns, and if we continue to consider these problems in partitioned isolation, solutions will continue to emerge far too slowly. The IPBES report reveals that 3.2 billion people are suffering from degraded soils. We cannot feed our planet’s growing population by destroying its soil. And soil erosion is also fuelling climate change because that earth contains three times more carbon than is in the atmosphere. Soil-destroying chemical farming means there are no insects or skylarks above our fields – and so we’re experiencing this tragic loss of biodiversity. The connections between these crises make solutions seem all too dauntingly difficult. But in fact, a solution to one problem will inevitably make a positive impact on many others too. More than 28,000 people are dying because of polluted air each year in Britain and air pollution is linked to psychotic experiences and a reduction in educational achievement. It’s not rocket science: improving air quality in our cities by cutting polluting vehicles will bring a vast range of benefits to human health, and help tackle climate change too. That’s a simple binary example of the ecology of crisis. George Monbiot advocates taking land out of meat production and rewilding it. This will boost biodiversity enormously but will also tackle global warming because those rewilded, rewetted lands will capture significantly more carbon. If these lands are also opened up for us to enjoy, our physical and mental health will flourish. Thus we repair the ecology of destruction. It can be difficult to know what we can do as individuals – but at least we all possess an increasingly sophisticated understanding of how farming, consumption and energy-use impacts upon the planet, hence the growth of the vegan movement. Lifestyle changes are always worth doing, but seldom as simple as they seem. As I found during Veganuary, it wasn’t too difficult to go vegan but that didn’t automatically mean I was eating ethically or in an environmentally friendly way: some of my vegan food was over-packaged and filled with palm oil. If I make a change, it’s me. If both of us do, it’s we. That’s how things grow. The youth climate strikes have been an incredible act of self-empowerment for that generation. I hope their confidence will grow and grow. At the moment they are campaigning about the climate; I hope that next they’ll be campaigning about how they can’t hear any birds singing. And we’ve seen the success of Extinction Rebellion in recent weeks. These protests definitely made a difference to environmental debates in the House of Commons last week. As long as we keep it peaceful and democratic, activism is going to become increasingly important to not only instigate change, but to speed it up. The human species is remarkably inventive and adaptable but it is simply no good at change. When we are presented with good evidence to change our minds, we resist it. For many farmers, change is coming, whether they accept it or not. Intensive livestock farming has been found out on many accounts. If I was a livestock farmer today and I wasn’t producing high-welfare, low-intensity, high-quality meat like Rosewood farm in Yorkshire or Henry Edmunds’ organic farm at Cholderton, Wiltshire, to name but two, I would be thinking, “OK, this vegan thing is growing quickly, I’d better diversify my business”. But many farmers are fighting these big social trends. Why fight these challenges, when they present a huge opportunity? I’m not saying every farmer can follow Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree at Knepp, who have turned a failing farm into a rewilded, ecological haven with loads of biodiversity, but new ideas and models are out there. Like all of us, farmers need help to embrace change – and we need to change what farm subsidies do. We need government-supported low-interest loans to help farmers make these changes, to diversify and generate better opportunities for them, their families and their futures. Either big, intensive, chemically-fuelled farmers revise their businesses or the world is going to poison itself. But we can’t just put the pressure on farmers, we need to act ourselves. So those of us who live in cities and suburbs should pressurise the government to introduce mandatory changes immediately to vastly improve urban biodiversity and air quality. My People’s Manifesto for Wildlife contains loads of practical ideas for positive regulations: why not have ponds on every industrial estate, and boxes for swifts and sparrows on every new housing development? We’re not struggling to find ideas to solve problems either globally or locally. It’s action we’re lacking, in government and beyond, as individuals and together as a species. If we act now we may be surprised at how these seemingly vast problems diminish quicker than we imagine. • Chris Packham is a naturalist, nature photographer and author, and one of the presenters of BBC2’s Springwatch"

One big headline that Germany’s online tabloid Bild carries today is about the breaking off the Antarctic Pine Island ice chunk, which is the size of Berlin…880 sq km!

Bild calls it a “Monster Ice Berg!” and of course we are to believe that it is yet the latest sign of the coming climate apocalypse that we will all suffer unless we all run and hide under our beds and beg for mercy. According to Bild, the giant ice berg is about 60m high.
Simple mathematics tells us the volume is about 53 cubic km.
Bild mentions, quoting scientists, that such glacier calving of this magnitude is normal, and occur about every 10 years or so. But normalcy is not the message that Bild wants the reader to get, and so warns that the “monster iceberg” could pose a threat to shipping, and to animal life! Bild also says that scientists are deeply worried and writes:
The Pine Island glacier is huge and unstable, and thus it is difficult to judge the risk for global sea level rise.”
Such stupidity – of course aimed at quite uninformed, clueless readers, to say it diplomatically. How much global sea level rise should we expect? From various sources we can read that a large part is already underwater. But let’s assume that none of it is under water just for the calculation.
Sea level rise estimation:
Area of oceans: 362 million sq km
Volume of Pine Island chunk: 53 cu km
Sea level rise: 53 km3 divided by 362,000,000 km2 = 0.000000145 km = 0.000145 m = 0.145 mm = 145 microns
Given that much of it is already submerged in sea water, we can safely assume that sea level rise will be less then a tenth of a millimeter.
Quick – head for the hills!

Share this...FacebookTwitterLots of lip service, but governments worldwide are getting cold feet about really reducing CO2 emissions. Commitment is clearly fading.German news magazine Stern has a short interview here with climatologist Mojib Latif, who provides us with a very encouraging confession with respect to the climate science swindle, i.e. it has reached “an absolute low point”!
Latif claims to be a warmist and insists that man is able to regulate the global climate simply by regulating the amount of greenhouse gases that gets emitted into the complex, extraterrestially-driven climate system.
Latif first tells Stern that Germany’s accelerated phase-out of nuclear power will mean more CO2 emissions because of more power generation from fossil fuel plants, e.g. read here, 2 German coal power plants approved.
This of course all undermines the idea of getting the planet to reduce its CO2 emissions, for which countries and global organisations earlier concocted and attempted to implement emissions trading schemes. Latif here is not convinced by these efforts, and comments:
So far it all has been quite a toothless tiger. If it were today what it had been originally designed to do, then it would be a very different story. But there have been exceptions after exceptions, especially in Germany with the energy-intensive industries. That’s not how it’s supposed to work.”
Of course governments have given industries so many exceptions because the perceived problem is not really serious enough to be taken seriously. And no country is actually going to commit suicide for the sake of solving a phony problem (except maybe Germany, which has moved onto the ledge and is now threatening to actually jump).
Stern then asks the question on every body’s mind:

Just how intensely is the community of countries fighting climate change?”
In other words: Just how committed are they? Latif answers (emphasis added):
We’ve reached an absolute low point. Actually at the UN-level we were further Along in the early 1990s. Today we see only word acrobatics. Heiligendamm, Copenhagen or Cancun all have not brought us further.”
Commitment has cooled to the lowest point in 20 years, i.e. since it got started. On CO2 trends, Latif warns:
The trend is alarming: Since 1990 CO2 emissions worldwide have risen 40 percent.”
40%? That corresponds roughly to the rise in the level of worldwide democracy.
Mojib Latif is a Professor at the former Institute for Ocean Sciences and the now Leibniz Institute for Ocean Sciences at the Christian Albrechts University in Kiel.
In 2009 he was awarded the Deutsche Bank-IFM-GEOMAR Ocean Research Prize.

"UK companies failing to tackle climate change would be delisted from the London Stock Exchange under radical plans for greening the economy being drawn up by Labour. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he would consider changing the law if necessary to force UK-listed firms to take adequate steps to fight the “climate emergency” facing the planet.  In an interview with the Guardian, McDonnell said much of the City was already aware of the need to make faster progress towards a zero-carbon economy, but his proposals were about “weeding out those that are not taking it seriously”. “We’ve got to signal now that we’re being serious about tackling climate change. And we’re going to use every lever of government we possibly can to enable that to happen,” he said. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The shadow chancellor said that as a backbench MP he had proposed that the criteria for a listing a company on the stock exchange should include human rights, trade union rights and environmental policy. “We’re now going to discuss how we can insert tackling climate change as one of the criteria for listing on the London stock market.” Asked whether he would delist firms without climate change plans that are already quoted on the stock exchange, McDonnell replied: “Yes”. Labour’s proposals are likely to set alarm bells ringing in the City, home to some of the world’s biggest natural resource companies. But the shadow chancellor said the measures were justified by the scale of the climate change challenge. “It’s not about threatening or penalising, it’s saying here’s the steps we need to take to save the planet, it’s as simple as that,” he said. The shadow chancellor’s tough message to the finance sector followed meetings with the Extinction Rebellion group that staged protests last month – including in the City of London. Activists glued themselves to the entrances of the stock exchange, wearing LED signs saying “Climate emergency”, “Tell the truth” and “You can’t eat money”. The steps to banish egregious polluters from the City form part of wider Labour plans to place climate change at the heart of its agenda for government, as the party readies for a possible autumn election. Should an election be called and the party win power, McDonnell said he would help form a “red-green” government and help push Britain to a low-carbon economy. “There’s a sweeping understanding, right the way across, that our administration has to tackle this issue in a way that no one else is taking that seriously,” he said. Labour has a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, or earlier if possible, while Jeremy Corbyn has acted to declare a formal climate emergency. The party has held a series of internal meetings to explore how government departments can pull together on the issue, while also discussing ways to reform the Bank of England’s powers. McDonnell suggested that if he became chancellor before a successor was chosen for Mark Carney, the Bank’s outgoing governor, he would seek to install someone who could lead the fight for greening the economy. “We do need someone fresh. We need someone who’s got an understanding of the challenges and climate change is a key one. And we need someone who is willing to be radical,” he said. The shadow chancellor said he had been impressed by Carney’s attempts to drive climate change up the agenda and that someone was required to push the issue to the next stage. “That does need some radical thinking,” he said. Carney used an article in the Guardian last month to warn that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and needs reform. The governor is set to leave Threadneedle Street early next year. The search for his successor is due to conclude by October. McDonnell has previously said the Bank’s powers to tackle climate change risks in the financial system could be overhauled, as well as measures handing Threadneedle Street a target for raising productivity growth in the UK economy. As part of those reforms, the shadow chancellor suggested Threadneedle Street could be given a climate change target. It could also be told to apply its policy toolkit to green the economy, including potential measures to penalise carbon-linked assets. Possible measures could include forcing banks to increase the financial reserves they hold to protect against losses for carbon assets. McDonnell said he thought the finance sector was ready for the changes, as growing numbers of investment management firms signal they will alter investing rules to take account of climate change. “The debate is beginning to change. The writing is on the wall and they’re going to see opportunities in the mechanisms for tackling climate change as well,” McDonnell said. “We want to signal change is coming and we’re serious about climate change.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German scientists are now spreading fear among children at schools. Is this the indoctrination part of the “Masterplan”?
German science used to be, and is in many areas, still highly regarded worldwide. But in the area of climate science, it has been reduced to politics and masterplanning.
Sadly, Germany’s “leading climate scientists” are far more preoccupied with transforming society and spreading panic among the population then doing science. Spreading panic is a favourite practice of Stefan Rahmstorf who, like his director Hans Schellnhuber, is a “scientist” at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research (PIK).
Rahmstorf is featured in astory at the online Märkische Zeitung, written by Alexandra Amling, who writes how Rahmstorf recently gave a presentation to school students. The Märkische Zeitung writes:
Only when mankind switches over only to renewable energies will we be able to avert the consequences of climate change, Stefan Rahmstorf made clear on Thursday evening in a presentation to school students and interested individuals at the Goethe School.”
Maybe the Märkische newspaper (Ms Amling) confused it, but here it is claimed that using renewables will stop the consequences of climate change, but not climate change itself. I’m having trouble making sense of this. If we use only renewable energy, the climate will change anyway, but the consequences of that change will be averted? Abracadabra.
The Märkische Zeitung then added, quoting Rahmstorf:
‘If extraterrestial life existed and little green men observed us, then they would see a dramatic disappearance of ice in the Arctic and would wonder, shaking their heads, if the earth is so little worth to us,’ said the oceanographer with admonishing tones.”

More contempt for humans – all consistent with the Schellnhuber’s “masterplan” mentality, which views humans as too stupid to run the planet democratically, and so authoritarian means are warranted.
According to Märkische Zeitung, Rahmstorf drives no car and has equipped his house with solar technology, and so we should all do the same. Beacuse if we don’t, we might drown – at least that’s what Rahmstorf’s last slide of his presentation, a doctored photo, implies:
At the end he showed a photo that will certainly remain in our minds: A wall of a house with the writing: ‘I don’t believe in global warning’. However the second line is hardly legible because it is drowning in floodwater.”
Here Rahmstorf is saying that anyone who doesn’t believe his horror scenarios is a fool. Yet ironically, when one looks at the data, Rahmstorf is exposed.
In the event that Ms Amling is interested in facts, then she should consider the following:
FACT: Sea level rise is decelerating.
FACT: Global temperature has not risen at all in the last 10 years.
FACT: Tropical storm activity has been falling since the 1980s.
FACT: A huge number of scientists completely disagree with Rahmstorf.
FACT: Rahmstorf’s sea level projection is an extreme outlier, way out of the mainstream.
We’d be more than happy to point Ms Amling to the data behind these facts, and other facts. I would even appear in front of these children with my own presentation in order to undo the educational damage that has been inflicted by Rahmstorf.
After looking at the data, Ms Ameling might consider Rahmstorf as simply not a serious person who is irresponsibly inserting fear into vulnerable young minds and doing a disservice to his country.

"The world’s leading scientists will warn the planet’s life-support systems are approaching a danger zone for humanity when they release the results of the most comprehensive study of life on Earth ever undertaken. Up to 1m species are at risk of annihilation, many within decades, according to a leaked draft of the global assessment report, which has been compiled over three years by the UN’s leading research body on nature. The 1,800-page study will show people living today, as well as wildlife and future generations, are at risk unless urgent action is taken to reverse the loss of plants, insects and other creatures on which humanity depends for food, pollination, clean water and a stable climate. The final wording of the summary for policymakers is being finalised in Paris by a gathering of experts and government representatives before the launch on Monday, but the overall message is already clear, according to Robert Watson, the chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). “There is no question we are losing biodiversity at a truly unsustainable rate that will affect human wellbeing both for current and future generations,” he said. “We are in trouble if we don’t act, but there are a range of actions that can be taken to protect nature and meet human goals for health and development.” The authors hope the first global assessment of biodiversity in almost 15 years will push the nature crisis into the global spotlight in the same way climate breakdown has surged up the political agenda since the 1.5C report last year by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Like its predecessor, the report is a compilation of reams of academic studies, in this case on subjects ranging from ocean plankton and subterranean bacteria to honey bees and Amazonian botany. Following previous findings on the decimation of wildlife, the overview of the state of the world’s nature is expected to provide evidence that the world is facing a sixth wave of extinction. Unlike the past five, this one is human-driven. Mike Barrett, WWF’s executive director of conservation and science, said: “All of our ecosystems are in trouble. This is the most comprehensive report on the state of the environment. It irrefutably confirms that nature is in steep decline.” Barrett said this posed an environmental emergency for humanity, which is threatened by a triple challenge of climate, nature and food production. “There is no time to despair,” he said. “We should be hopeful that we have a window of opportunity to do something about it over these two years.” The report will sketch out possible future scenarios that will vary depending on the decisions taken by governments, businesses and individuals. The next year and a half is likely to be crucial because world leaders will agree rescue plans for nature and the climate at two big conferences at the end of 2020. That is when China will host the UN framework convention on biodiversity gathering in Kunming, which will establish new 20-year targets to replace those agreed in Aichi, Japan, in 2010. Soon after, the UN framework convention on climate change will revise Paris agreement commitments at a meeting in either the UK, Italy, Belgium or Turkey. Watson, a British professor who has headed both of the UN’s leading scientific panels, said the forthcoming report will delve more deeply than anything before into the causes of nature collapse, chief among which is the conversion of forests, wetlands and other wild landscapes into ploughed fields, dam reservoirs and concrete cities. Three-quarters of the world’s land surface has been severely altered, according to the leaked draft. Humanity is also decimating the living systems on which we depend by emitting carbon dioxide and spreading invasive species. Watson said the authors have learned from attribution science, which has transformed the debate on the climate crisis by showing how much more likely hurricanes, droughts and floods have become as a result of global heating. The goal is to persuade an audience beyond the usual green NGOs and government departments. “We need to appeal not just to environment ministers, but to those in charge of agriculture, transport and energy because they are the ones responsible for the drivers of biodiversity loss,” he said. A focus will be to move away from protection of individual species and areas, and to look at systemic drivers of change, including consumption and trade. The political environment is changing in some countries due to overwhelming scientific evidence and increasing public concern about the twin crises of nature and climate, which have prompted more than 1 million students to strike from school and led to street protests by Extinction Rebellion activists in more than a dozen countries. The UK parliament declared a climate emergency this week and the government’s chief climate advisory body recommended an accelerated plan to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Until now, however, the nature crisis has been treated as far less of a priority. “Where are the headlines? Where are the emergency meetings?” asked the school strike founder, Greta Thunberg, in a recent tweet on the subject. Extinction Rebellion activists said protests that blocked several London streets last month were as much aimed at the defence of nature as stabilising the climate. “They are two sides of the same destructive coin,” said Farhana Yamin, a coordinator of the movement who is also an environmental lawyer and formerly a lead author of the IPCC report. “The work of IPBES is as crucial as the work done by the IPCC on the 1.5-degree report. That is why Extinction Rebellion is demanding an end [to] biodiversity loss and a net-zero phaseout by 2025. We can’t save humanity by only tackling climate change or only caring about biodiversity.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman publicist Dr. Cora Stephan has a very worthwhile perspective on Hans Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Chancellor Merkel’s no. 1 climate advisor.Ms Stephan is concerned about Schellnhuber’s extreme views and has good reason for that. She begins by quoting Schellnhuber on freedom of science and democracy:
Core questions such as these, and questions on human rights, deserve a place in the Constitution. That would mean there would be judges who would vote against the majority when it is right to do so in regards to our constitutional consensus. This would require a very few ethical elites.”
Stephan puts Schellnhuber’s dictator-speak in plain language:
On the subject of climate change, democracy has to be switched off in favor of control by ethical elitists because most people are too removed from the long-term future (and its possibly dying children with whom Schellnhuber likes to threaten us.”
Schellnhuber claims that a few select elites (like his mates at the PIK) can see 100+ years into the future and to assess the impacts that our actions today will have. Either we do as he tells us, or millions of future children will die. (Ironically, much of what Schellnhuber proposes means millions of children would be denied birth, so I’m not sure how unborn lives could be saved).
Ms Stephan calls Schellnhuber’s type of climate activism an attempt at creating an “above the law state of emergency”, and involves a new climate religion operated by “high priests”:
The new religion promises the Last Judgement already today – that is we endeavour one last huge and dramatic effort to save humanity from a well-deserved downfall. As is the case with other religions, the best is repentance, humility and self-restriction – preferably through emission payments without end.”

Stephan writes that the new climate religion fills a void left behind by other religions, and tells us to feel guilty about prosperity.
Eventually, we fear, we’ll have to pay the price for our prosperity – be it to God or Nature, – with Biblical plagues such as storms, huge tidal waves, floods, fire-spewing volcanoes, in short: death and demons”.
Stephan warns us not to doubt the elite prophets who have the powers, tools and instruments to see deep into the future:
The new priests who proclaim these scenarios have attracted billions of followers with their announcements of world downfall. And, like all other prophets, they do not tolerate any doubts about their predictions. Those who dare express doubt are nothing more than egotistical wretches, appeasers and trivializers, block-headed deniers or worse, or to the least paid agents of evil.”
As the climate zealotry and hysteria spread though society, it’s only logical that the obstacles that prevent necessary action, like democracy, be removed and replaced globally by an “authoritarian regime of experts”. The “projected global downfall is the state-of-emergency that justifies every measure and it distracts us from every other unfinished business. There is no alternative.”
But all is not bleak in Germany. Cora Stephan writes that “the dire projections of global gloom and doom by the climate gurus have begun to crumble”. Clever citizens know where to check up on the facts.  Trust in those in high places is melting away along with their once assumed moral authority. Indeed they’ve squandered their authority – as is always the case with individuals who over-reach.

"Last week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change. The organisers were delighted when 150 people turned up. Even they were surprised, though, when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying, change their boilers and cars, eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change. But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England. Shrewsbury joins more than 100 other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency, and has pledged that it will be carbon-neutral within 11 years, with more following every week.  The stakes get higher every day. In the past week, not only have the world’s leading scientists dropped a bomb into the debate by stating, across 1,800 pages of detailed evidence, that our wholesale destruction of the biosphere threatens humanity just as much as climate change, but carbon levels in the atmosphere have reached their highest level in 800,000 years. So, could this be the moment when politicians recognise they have both strong intellectual reason to act urgently on the environment as well as, finally, the public backing to do so? When, instead of trying to score marginal partisan points, they believe they have the legitimacy to be non-partisan, politically bold, and to together back transformative economic and social change in pursuit of the public good? Could politics indeed be changing with the climate? The last few months have seen the debate shift. Put it down to David Attenborough’s documentary, 1.5 million children on school strike, the charisma of Greta Thunberg, or sheer frustration with the political system, but increasing numbers of people now seem to recognise that nature’s wellbeing is a national priority. The UK government, keen to position itself as a world leader on climate, but still promoting flying and roads and less keen to act at home, recognises the moment. Cambridge development economist Sir Partha Dasgupta has been commissioned to conduct a major study on the case for acting on biodiversity, much as Lord Stern was asked to review the economics of climate change by Gordon Brown in 2006. Stern’s 700-page report added greatly to the debate. But that was 13 years ago, since which time there have been many highly authoritative studies done on environmental economics. No new report is needed. They all argue roughly the same: that it will cost infinitely more for governments to do nothing about biodiversity and climate than to act decisively, and that to delay will increase costs further. Dasgupta can only argue that we must act soon. Besides, while it sounds impressive to bring forward by 30 years the target for net-zero emissions, few countries think it will be too difficult. Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have asked the EU to set 2050 as a target for being carbon-neutral, and want 25% of the EU budget to go to fighting climate change. For the moment, governments have little to lose. Most consumers would barely notice the changes needed to get to carbon neutrality in 30 years’ time. Who noticed that Britain has just had the first week in more than 100 years of electricity without coal, or that divestment from fossil fuels has reached $8tn? People will have to buy electric cars, more efficient fridges and heating systems, and Britain will need vastly more solar capacity, bigger forests and better insulation, but these are mostly easy and popular changes. A “new green deal” budget could be brought in to fund a massive push for nature conservation and energy change. The ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans after 2040 could be brought forward to 2030 easily enough, and few people would object to penalties for climate polluters, higher taxes for companies that destroy nature and incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation. If Heathrow never got its new runway, or we did not build more roads, or we all ate less meat, it would not hurt that much. Indeed, it’s clear that protecting nature brings great collective rewards. Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels would clear up air pollution rapidly and save billions of pounds a year that the NHS must currently spend dealing with heart attacks, asthma, strokes and respiratory illnesses. Cities would become more liveable, the countryside more attractive. Instead of being regarded by government as a costly imposition, action on climate and nature regeneration could be easily recast as visionary politics offering huge public benefits. But what happens when the voluntary measures run out and the warming is not seen to slow because greenhouse gases are so long-lasting? Really addressing climate and biodiversity collapse means rationing carbon. It means no more free ride for extractive industries such as mining, palm oil and forestry companies who profit from environmental destruction. It means heavy penalties for polluters, the axing of food and aviation subsidies, and taking a torch to vested interests. It means addressing the indirect causes of the crisis, such as population growth and consumerism, even rethinking the whole idea of progress and wealth. There are dangers in both action and inaction. How will rich countries react to mass migrations from poor climate-affected countries, or to the breakdown of the food system that might ensue when climate change leads to disastrous harvests in major rice- and wheat-producing countries? Already, the UN says, there are around 2,500 conflicts over fossil fuels, water, food and land. Climate change and biodiversity loss will only increase that number. Then there is the risk that the climate crisis could foster a new generation of authoritarian, top-down rulers who will try bypassing consumers and institutions. This is because it necessitates a major shift from the kind of individual responsibility we have grown used to in the past 50 years, to greater state action. That could easily be exploited. It also opens the door for rich governments to propose dangerous and ill-thought-through technological fixes as a substitute for mitigation. How much simpler for cash-strapped governments to ask a few billionaires to help slow warming in the US or Europe by funding a monstrously expensive plan to preserve the Arctic sea ice by covering it with a layer of reflective silica “microbubbles”; or to deflect the sun’s rays in space; or to spray the oceans with iron filings? But the risks of doing nothing far outweigh the possible pitfalls of really addressing climate change and biodiversity collapse. Of course there will be objections from diehard capitalists and liberals alike. But, to echo Margaret Thatcher as she pushed through the deregulation that has done so much to fuel the crisis: there really is no alternative. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnjoy it while you can. I have no way of knowing if it will stay that way.Yesterday I was sure the German media were gearing up for yet another assault on science, getting ready to turn the US tornadoes into a Katrina-type event.
For example on Friday NDR public radio linked the tornadoes to man-made climate change. And there were some other similar reports from the fringes. Expecting to see more stories on tornadoes due to climate change today, I’m a bit astonished that I can’t find much in the mainstream media – amazing.
Some reports – from the fringes
Some kooky websites, like the one I mentioned yesterday, or klimaretter (“climate saviour”), who rarely bother checking scientific data and history, have chimed in. Klimaretter here for example wrote:
More than 130 tornadoes swept across the USA South and triggered the worst tornado catastrophe in decades.”
Here the author tries to make it sound like an event of Biblical proportions. Then he continues on the cause of the tornadoes:
Climatologists warn that global warming will lead to significantly more frequent and extreme weather events like heavy rains, powerful storms or droughts. This is physically based on the fact that warmer air has considerably more energy and water than cooler air.”
Another example of kooky science comes from geographer Jürgen Schönstein here at scienceblogs, who partly blames the death toll on the South’s faith in God (and Roy Spencer?), writing:
And I wouldn’t be surprised if a certain, uncontemplated and fatalistic religiousness played a role, which I observed the most often in the American South: It’s God’s will – if HE wants, then he’ll protect his sheep, and if not, then it is no use resisting His will. And whoever nurtured doubt in (climate) science from the highest positions in the USA certainly did not help to overcome this situation…”
And, though saying no one can be certain about the cause, he writes:

Still I’ll wager that we will be seeing more and more such killer storms in the USA in the coming years.”
Keep up the faith Jürgen (and keep ignoring the data).
Unlike these few nutty reports by outlets desperate for anything and everything, the mainstream media on the other hand has been remarkably SILENT. Maybe we ought not hold our breaths – that may change. The “climate masterminds” at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are likely concocting new tales for the media. Maybe the hysteria will break out in earnest tomorrow.
But it could also be that the media and charlatan scientists have grown much more cautious with their dubious claims, which in the past have been increasingly and deservedly attacked and ridiculed by a growing number of science and social blogs and sites, e.g. here, here, here, here, here, or here. Maybe they are finding out that all their fear-mongering has been backfiring in their faces lately.
All is quiet in the mainstream media this morning
Germany’s flagship ARD television reported on the tornado in an amazingly balanced way. In its news video here the report attributes the cause of the tornadoes as follows:
Meteorologists are searching for the reason behind the scale and strength of the tornado series. On thing is clear: the weather phenomena La Nina, cold stable winds over moist cold air provided the ideal conditions for creating tornadoes.”
So tornadoes are fuelled by La Ninas (cold) and not global warming. We’ve all seen the charts- tornadoes and accumulated cyclone energy have been trending downwards for decades, and appear to be linked more to oceanic cycles.
Der Spiegel reported on the tornadoes, but did not mention anything about climate change. I found nothing much at the FAZ, Focus, Süddeutsche, and others. A Google search also produced very little.
Is this the calm before the hysteria?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been interesting reading some of the reactions from the green, warmist sites. Of course they are all seething in rage and resignation as their unclean movement collapses.None of them up to now have presented any scientific arguments refuting the claims made by Lüning and Vahrenholt.
Indeed many forget that geologist and climate-paleontologist Lüning is also one of the authors and brings more expertise to the book than many of those who reside in bloated “climate institutes” and call themselves climate scientists. The book is not written by just an “RWE boss”.
The very green Financial Times Deutschland (Germany) has been running a reader poll here since February 8.
The results? The FTD may be green, and maybe many of its readers, but FTD’s readers are also obviously open-minded, or just downright skeptical.
Survey: The climate view of Fritz Vahrenholt is…
Answer 1: humbug – 10%
 Answer 2: rhetoric of a lobbyist – 20%
 Answer 3: good food for thought – 28%
 Answer 4: 100% right on! – 42%
Number of votes: 4800
I suspect that a number of readers really don’t see any real changes in the climate, except that we are back to cold winters here in Germany, which of course flies in the face of projections of warming. And I suspect that many see through the scam. They see who’s making money, and where it is all taking us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPrivate meteorologist Dr. Carsten Brandt of donnerwetter.de here predicts a hot and dry barbecue summer for Central Europe.
Donnerwetter.de's summer forecast looks great for barbeques.
Graphic from: www.donnerwetter.de news, click here
But don’t worry, his forecast does not come from the Met Office, and so there is a good chance it’ll be more or less right. Indeed many of Brandt’s seasonal forecasts have been spot on – on par with Joe Bastardi’s track record. For example back in October, 2010, he predicted a cold winter – and it happened. In February, 2011, donnerwetter.de announced a nice and warm spring dominated by high pressure systems  – and that happened too.
Donnerwetter.de predicts the warm and dry conditions will persist through July with a probability of 80%. According to donnerwetter.de, this is all due to a pattern of stubborn high pressure systems taking hold over Germany over the last months, writing:
For about one year now we have been observing a change in patterns in the atmosphere over Europe. Normally the weather over Germany is characterised by powerful low pressure systems which bring lots of rain and temperature fluctuations with them. The high pressure systems are hanging out more and more often over the Mediterranean or over Eastern Europe. Over the last months there have been extremely many high pressure systems settling over Germany and Central Europe.”
Though Germans may enjoy the beautiful weather in the weeks ahead, the low amounts of precipitation are going to wreak havoc on agriculture and pose serious threats of forest fires.
What is behind the spell of dry, warm and sunny weather?
Brandt doesn’t say. From donnerwetter.de, we don’t get the “it’s yet another sign of climate change” crap that we often hear from the AGW hucksters. We can be thankful for that.

But do expect the climate alarmism hatchery that is the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK) to chime in soon, claiming that a new model had predicted it all along. Producing an after-the-fact model is the tactic they used to explain the past cold winter. So expect crap from them in the weeks ahead.
Is low solar cycle activity inducing a cooling trend?
Since solar activity has wound down over the last years, there really does seem to be some new patterns forming. Is it just a coincidence? Maybe it’s a harbinger for a climate change that most of us have not been expecting – cooling. The PDO has also gone negative and the AMO is headed in that direction. Sounds to me like cooling increasingly can’t be ruled out. Let’s watch how long the La Nina conditions persist.
Accuweather, without Joe Bastardi, botched its Europe spring forecast
Interestingly, Accuweather’s spring forecast for Germany/Central Europe, made on March 18, looks like a real Met Office act, i.e. COMPLETELY  WRONG! In March Accuweather predicted:
U.K., Ireland and Germany to be Stormy, Unsettled
The overall position of the jet stream with a ridge over Spain and North Africa this spring should tend to steer storm systems into the U.K., Ireland and Germany.”
Actually, pretty much just the opposite has and is occurring. Makes you wonder if they’ll be begging Joe Bastardi to come back. According to the latest World Meteorological Organisation report:
The United Kingdom had extremely dry conditions in March and April especially in its southeastern parts and experienced its driest March since 1953. The other parts of western and central Europe all had a dry February, March and April. 2011 was up to now one of the driest 10 years in nearly whole Switzerland since 1864.”

"The Scottish government has dropped controversial plans to cut its taxes on aviation after Nicola Sturgeon declared last week the world faces a climate emergency. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said cutting air passenger duty would be incompatible with its new pledge to cut Scotland’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2045.  The Scottish government faced intense cross-party pressure to keep the levy in place after Sturgeon accepted recommendations from the UK committee on climate change (CCC) last week that Scotland should adopt a 2045 target date. Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, told the Guardian cutting the levy would undermine efforts to combat climate change by making it harder for Scotland to reduce its overall emissions.  Keeping the tax in place “would help immensely with the emissions challenge there is in Scotland” he said. The CCC recommended the UK government should aim for a UK-wide net zero target of 2050, five years later than Scotland. The CCC believes Scotland has far greater scope to sequestrate its CO2 emissions by planting forests and to capture and store CO2 in disused North Sea oil fields. Critics of the proposed aviation tax cut, which the Scottish National party had pledged to introduce in successive elections, said reducing the levy by 50% would increase CO2 emissions from aviation in Scotland by at least 60,000 tonnes and cut tax income by about £150m. That figure did not account for the sharp increase in flying which Scotland’s airports hoped that would lead to; Scotland’s enterprise agencies also provide subsidies to airlines such as Ryanair, and the government owns Prestwick airport, which is heavily indebted, and small airports in the Highlands and islands. The Scottish government has faced a long delay implementing the policy after running into unforeseen problems with EU rules on state aid but Ryanair and BA, and Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, had pressed the Scottish government to cut the levy. Cunningham announced the switch before a Scottish Labour party-sponsored debate on retaining air passenger duty in Holyrood tomorrow. She said the Scottish government’s change of stance highlighted the need for all parties to support radical measures to reduce CO2 emissions, including a tax on parking spaces at workplaces which Labour opposes. Colin Smyth, Scottish Labour’s transport spokesman, said this policy should have been reversed years ago. Patrick Harvie, the co-convenor of the Scottish Green party, said: “Greens have led the case against this ill thought out tax giveaway from the moment it was first proposed, so we very much welcome the Scottish government’s huge U-turn.” The Greens will be pressing for an even tougher net zero target date of 2040, tabling amendments to the new climate bill going through Holyrood. Gordon Dewar, the chief executive of Edinburgh airport, was furious about the decision, accusing Scottish ministers of hypocrisy for continuing to support Prestwick airport, which owes the taxpayer more than £40m. He said airlines were already cutting their emissions by supporting carbon offsetting. “We’ve gone from personal commitments to all-out cancellation in the space of just two weeks, which shows just how reactionary this decision is. It does not show leadership and means airports and airlines have been led down a path of failed promises for three years by this Scottish government,” Dewar said."
"Parks are being hit by cutbacks in local authority spending and the National Lottery’s “Parks for People” funding scheme is winding down. This matters because our parks are more than recreation areas, important as that is. The green spaces in towns and cities capture and store carbon from the air in trees and soil. They help soak up big downpours of rain that could otherwise cause localised flash flooding, and they can also help reduce air pollution. And as summers grow hotter, trees also cool the air in what can be overheated urban areas.  A recent study in the US found that trees in particular can have a profound cooling effect by as much as 5C. Trees provide cool areas of shade and behave like air conditioners as water evaporates from their leaves and cools the air. The biggest cooling effect comes from large numbers of trees, with tree canopies that cover 40% or more of an area giving the best results. This can also be seen in temperature maps of London, with levels tending to rise from outer London and peaking in the centre, but with cooler areas in urban parks. Another finding from previous research is that the best cooling effect is from healthy and fast-growing trees."

This is a follow-up article on GHCN and GISS changes to the temperature records for Reykjavik, Iceland.

Figure 1: Reykjavik, Iceland: Photo from Christian Bickel 
We now know that GHCN has changed data set versions from version 2 to version 3. Each of those versions has a history. Version 2 was made up by combining records from closely related stations, then “homogenizing” the combination to produce a data “product.” Version 3 presumably started from the Version 2 data set with revisions prompted by additional data. That presumption may not be correct.
As a first step, all the data from the Version 2 database were downloaded from GISS. There were four sets of station data, covering various years, but only one set that covered the period from 1901 to 1948. These are all plotted together in Figure 2, along with the combined dataset, and the “homogenized” result.

Figure 2: This is all the Reykjavik Version 2 data.
Three of the original data sets lie atop each other for the period from 1949 to the present. One set (the 4th one) is slightly warmer (!) in the years from 1982 to the present, and was ignored. However the homogenized data differs from the original data by a large amount early in the record, tapering down to no difference in the present, warming the past. Figure 3 is that difference.

Figure 3: This is the Version 2 homogenized data minus the Version 2 Combined data.
Each of those distinct steps in Figure 3 is exactly six years long. This arbitrary pattern cannot be anything but deliberate. It cannot be based on site changes, equipment changes, or any other factor that might change the real temperature. This is artificial.
The Iceland Meteorological Office has not moved since being built at this location in 1920. There may have been instrument changes, but no position changes.
GHCN describes their homogenization process:
Many surface weather stations undergo minor relocations through their history of observation. Stations may also be subject to changes in instrumentation as measurement technology evolves. Further, the land use/land cover in the vicinity of an observing site may also change with time. Such modifications to an observing site have the potential to alter a thermometer’s microclimate exposure characteristics and/or change the bias of measurements, the impact of which can be a systematic shift in the mean level of temperature readings that is unrelated to true climate variations. The process of removing such “non-climatic” artifacts in a climate time series is called homogenization.”
But Version 2 has been abandoned. We now have version 3. Figure 5 is a plot of both original and homogenized versions of both Version 2 and Version 3.

Figure 5: This is a plot of “original” and “homogenized” datasets for both Version 2 and Version 3.

Note that in Figure 5, from 1901 to about 1970, there is little agreement between the four datasets. Figure 6 is the difference between Version 2 after combining, and Version 3. (SCAR is not a factor in this data. SCAR is the acronym for Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. No Antarctic data was harmed in the production of Reykjavik data).

Figure 6: This is the difference between Reykjavik Version 3 and Version 2 after combining the data from 4 datasets.
It is not clear why these differences exist. Prior to 1946, there were no nearby stations to compare. The Keflavik airport station did not produce data until 1949, and then the temperatures there agree very well with the original data from the downtown stations. The variances are within a few 100ths of a degree. The warm years around 1940 are wiped out in Version 3. But the changes don’t end there.

Figure 7. This is the difference between Version 3 before and Version 3 after GISS homogenization.
In Figure 7 we see the arbitrary and regular stair-steps again. But note that the steps are different from the steps in Figure 3, and they are in addition to the changes by GHCN seen in Figure 6. These changes put back some (but not all) of the cooling that was arbitrarily introduced in Figure 6. The final result is the product of two homogenizing
processes, the first by GHCN, and the second by GISS. The result of all this is the graph that Paul Homewood produced (below) and the blue and bold-red traces in Figure 5.
The GHCN Version 3 data was supposed to be superior to version 2, filling data gaps, etc. If this is so, then why does Version 3 have gaps where Version 2 does not? Version 3 has gaps for 1926, 1946, 1966, and 2008 – 2009. The original data (Version 2 raw) does not have these gaps.

Figure 8: This is from Paul Homewood’s article How GISS has totally Corrupted Reykjavik’s Temperature, used by permission.
There have been many changes like this to the temperature records. Here is a list of stations that have had arbitrary stair-step or other changes, and the links to articles that describe them:
Darwin, Australia, here, by Willis Eschenbach.
Central Park, New York City, here, by E. M. Smith, the Chiefio.
Prague, Czech Republic, here, and here, by John O. Sullivan.
Russia, (scroll to the bottom for the article) here, RIA/NOVOSTI.
Matanuska Valley, Alaska, here, Willis Eschenbach.
Ostrov Dixon, Ostrov Kotel, Russia; Barrow, Alaska, and others, here, Ed Caryl
Many of those in the above list were changes imposed in version 2. We should revisit those stations using version 3 data. So many stations, so little time…

"The Greens would support a future Labor government to use regulation to enforce climate policy in the event of a hostile Senate, Greens leader Richard Di Natale says. The Victorian senator says he is confident the Greens will be able to work with Labor leader Bill Shorten, despite Shorten not responding to a letter he sent last year asking them to do just that.  Di Natale says that if the Senate crossbench is populated by right-wing parties opposed to climate action, he will support a Labor government using other means to achieve environmental goals. “We have to work hard in an environment where no one has the balance of power in their own right... to look for common ground and work to achieve it,” Di Natale says. “Some changes, like those to the safeguard mechanism, might be made through regulation rather than legislation and I hope that a Labor government recognises that Australians want them to take very strong and decisive action. “We know that there are some changes that we won’t need a parliament to support.” Just last week, the Greens criticised the Coalition for making changes to the emissions safeguard mechanism, established as part of the Direct Action scheme to set “baselines” or limits for big polluters. The Coalition changes raised the limit for big polluters, but the same method could be used to reduce emissions limits in a backdoor cap-and-trade scheme. Di Natale was speaking from his office in Collins Street, Melbourne, in the second last week of the campaign. This city has been the party’s stronghold since the early 2000s, but support has taken a hit in recent years because of infighting, and it lost half its state MPs at last year’s Victorian election. Melbourne is poised to play a decisive role in the election next Saturday, which Di Natale believes Labor will win with the help of Greens preferences. But despite voters saying climate change is the most pressing issue when determining whom to vote for, and some commentators arguing that the Greens vote is likely to hold steady as a result, the party has been largely absent from media coverage of the campaign. Labor’s focus on climate change, even if its policies are significantly less ambitious than those put forward by the Greens, has allowed the bigger party to soak up much of the oxygen in the climate debate. It is frustrating, Di Natale says, because Labor’s policy lags behind market trends in the energy sector. “That’s what’s going to happen if we sit back and let the market do this for us without any intervention,” he says. Labor has proposed a target of 50% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030; 50% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030; and no ban on the mining, burning or export of fossil fuels. It has equivocated on ruling out the Adani coalmine, which the Greens oppose, and has been criticised for supporting a plan to extract gas from the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory. The Greens policy calls for 100% of electricity generation to come from renewable energy sources and 100% of new car sales to be electric by 2030; a plan to phase out the coal, oil and gas industry and create a transition package for workers; the reintroduction of a carbon price; and a resources super profits tax. “It’s all well and good to talk about renewables and a target but unless you are bringing down pollution, unless you are transitioning away from coal ... then it doesn’t matter what you do with renewables,” Di Natale says. “The primary source of the problem is increasing pollution from coal and we have to have a plan to drive that down.” The director of the Energy Change Institute at the Australian National University, Prof Ken Baldwin, says Australia will reach 100% renewable energy in the early to mid 2030s if the current rate of renewable energy installation is maintained. He says reaching the Greens’ target without damaging the economy is “within the realm of possibility” provided there is careful planning to transition the electricity grid and the fossil fuel workforce to a renewable economy. If Australia does not get the energy sector to do the heavy lifting on meeting its international obligations on reducing emissions, “we’re stuffed,” Baldwin says. But he says the proposed ban on coal, oil and gas exports could be counter-productive and argues that Australia should continue to export fossil fuels to developing countries, if it can provide a cleaner source than otherwise available. That’s the argument the resources minister, Matt Canavan, has used to support the proposed Adani mine. Whether the Greens are able to influence Labor climate policy will depend on the make-up of the Senate. Clive Palmer’s United Australia party is vying to take the balance of power, thanks to a preference deal struck with the Liberals. The Centre Alliance and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party also hold some spots, and Fraser Anning’s extreme right-wing Conservative National party is running 70 candidates. Scott Morrison has joined conservative commentators in describing the Greens as equal and opposite to the right-wing minor parties in seriousness and scope. Di Natale says the comparison is “a smokescreen for Scott Morrison doing a deal with racists and climate deniers”. Deakin University politics lecturer Geoffrey Robinson says the comparison is unfair. “The Palmer party is obviously a kind of personal vehicle largely devoid of any policy commitment whatsoever,” Robinson says. “To compare the Greens and One Nation depends on your views about xenophobic populist nationalism versus Greens social democracy … but even there I think you can argue that the Greens give a lot more serious thought to policy than One Nation has.” The Greens have form in getting some of those policies enacted. The banking inquiry, the royal commission into the abuse of people with disabilities, the medevac legislation carried in the lower house by independent MP Kerryn Phelps, as well as bipartisan support for a federal anti-corruption body, could all be credited to the Greens in the last term of parliament. Labor’s shift on the live sheep export trade, its recent announcements on environmental protection laws, expanding free dental care to pensioners, and the bipartisan commitment to establish a national integrity commission can also be traced to the Greens. And despite being in politics to “get good outcomes”, they would like to get that credit. “If you don’t get credit for a reform, people don’t know you’re responsible for it and they’re less likely to support you,” Di Natale says. “And the bottom line in politics is if people are going to continue to support the work that you do, they need to know what you deliver on.” In the 46th parliament, the Greens’ focus will be on raising Newstart and the Youth Allowance. The income payment has not been increased in real terms since 1994. A report by Deloitte Access Economics last year put the cost of increasing the payment at $3.3bn, which Di Natale says can be borne by pursuing multinational tax avoidance and axing subsidies to fossil fuel companies. “This is front and centre,” he says. “This has to be one of the first things that a new government looks at and $75 a week is what people deserve and need.” Labor has pledged to review Newstart if elected. Di Natale says he has had “informal conversations” with the Centre Alliance on supporting the policy. “I don’t want to put words in their mouth but I am pretty confident ... I am confident that we will be able to get this reform though the Senate,” he says. Robinson says that of all the Greens’ policies, raising Newstart is the one most likely to have success under a potential Shorten government. “Labor voters want Newstart to go up,” he says. Also high on the list are universal Medicare-funded dental care; Medicare-funded mental healthcare; a ban on political donations from the mining, property development, tobacco, alcohol and gambling industries; and a ban on politicians and their senior staff from accepting a lobbying job within five years of leaving parliament. Di Natale is also eager to prosecute media reform. On Saturday he and Shorten were due to appear side-by-side in Melbourne at the ABC Friends leaders’ forum. In his speech Di Natale warns the Murdoch media empire “will not give up its stranglehold on our media and the control of our politics that comes with it without a fight”. “The Greens will do what needs to be done to rein in the malign influence of News Corp, to protect and strengthen our ABC and to encourage more diversity in our media landscape.” Di Natale will ask Labor to adopt the Greens’ media policy to set up a new public interest test for media mergers, as recommended by the 2012 convergence review and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and strengthen the Australian Communications and Media Authority to give it “real teeth”. Di Natale is optimistic of making progress even on those challenges, based on the Greens’ record in the last parliament. “We have delivered serious reforms,” Di Natale says. “It’s easy to stand up in parliament, to make outrageous comments, to wear a burqa into the parliament, to give a first speech where you invoke the final solution, and get coverage. “It’s much more difficult but much more important to advance a serious policy agenda for the country. That’s what we’re about, and we’ve delivered in spades for people.”"

German daily Bild, which has more readers than the WSJ, USA Today and NYT combined,  reports that cats leave huge carbon paw-prints and so make a significant contribution to climate change. Each househiold cat is repsonsible for the emissions of 2.2 tons of CO2 annually.
The information is based on a story appearing in health magazine Healthy Living and on a study from climate company ClimatePartner.
According to Bild, internet portal utopia.de tested the impacts of five different pets on climate. Bild writes:
Catfood, cat litter, waste… every cat leads to 2.2 tons of CO2 emissions annually. No other house pet leaves such a terrible ecological paw-print.
Just the manufacture of cat food and its packing leads to about one ton of CO2 per cat. The waste disposal of food cans and cat litter burdens the climate with an additional 1250 kg of carbon dioxide. Then you have to include the water consumption for cleaning the cat potty.”
The house cat is an even bigger climate sinner than a dog, says Bild.
What pet ought one keep if concerned about impacting the climate? The study says the canary bird is the ideal pet to keep, emitting only 0.028 tons of CO2 annually.
According to Wikipedia: “Cats are a common companion animal in Europe and North America, and their worldwide population exceeds 500 million.” That comes out to a billion tons of CO2 just on the account of cats. That’s the same as 100 million Europeans. Time to call the exterminator. Hey – it’s either them, or us.
Of course Bild reminds us that cats themselves are not really the problem, but people who keep them. Bild writes: “Humans by far are worse for the climate”.

"Tony Abbott has bet me $100 that in 10 years’ time the climate will not have changed. When I found myself in a Manly coffee shop last week being offered the bet, I was incredulous. Abbott was smiling, charmingly dismissive. This person with the power to help steer the world away from anthropogenic disaster wasn’t having a bar of my concerns about climate change. He wasn’t going to help; he was going to wield his status and wealth to show how confident he was in his position of not doing anything.  He was going to prove he disagreed with climate science, with the majority of Australian voters and with the mother of a six-year-old who had just literally begged him to take the climate emergency seriously, with a jocular bet. No doubt he expected me to laugh and back down. And maybe I should have, amazed and insulted beyond belief. Maybe I should have said instead (as my husband suggested when I got home) “I’m not going to bet $100. Bet me something substantial, like your electorate, or all your power, so that you’ll actually be motivated to work to save the climate.” But all I could think of at the time was that Abbott was eager to go on record as a) completely ignorant of climate science and b) completely dismissive of a parent and her concerns for her child’s future. I agreed to the bet. The bet had come about when I went to meet my Sydney cousin at a coffee shop where I discovered that Abbott had chosen the same place to have lunch. Children striking for climate action, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, were wrapping up a protest outside his office round the corner. Meanwhile, my cousin texted to say she was running late. Very late. I realised I was now faced with the prospect of waiting alone for her in a very small space, metres away from Abbott, whose views on the need for urgent climate action are diametrically opposed to my own. The tension (on my part) was excruciating. Abbott and the friend he was with, on the other hand, appeared relaxed, and I was even able to discover that the famous “ha-ha-ha!” laugh is not an affectation for the media. I considered leaving, but then realised I had the opportunity to speak personally to Abbott as an Australian voter. But what to say? I didn’t want to lecture him and then go back and sit down. I didn’t think I could say anything that would cut through his loyalty to the coal industry and his reluctance to take the threat of climate change seriously, so I decided just to speak to him and put myself on the record as having registered a protest against his inaction. I went over to his table and said, “Hi, excuse me for interrupting your lunch.” Abbott and his associate were gracious, until I began, “I have a six-year-old daughter.” Abbott’s smile stiffened a little and his face closed slightly. I said, “The IPCC report tells us that we have 12 years to deal with climate change. In 12 years’ time she’ll be 18. I had to speak to you on her behalf and beg you to take climate change and her future seriously.” Abbott launched into a well-rehearsed rebuff about how my daughter and I wouldn’t be very well off in the future if I lost my job and our industries closed down. While I responded internally about a just transition from coal to renewables, he was adding something about trying for a balance – which seemed a new, somewhat less hardline approach than his previous utter denial of the need for change, and indeed, of climate change itself. Could the massive worldwide push for climate action and the approaching election be persuading him at least to pay lip service to the concept of tackling climate change? But I continued, making a gesture showing a severely unbalanced scale pointing straight down. “It seems to me things are already very unbalanced, with the scales weighing towards a complete emergency,” I said. Abbott said “I disagree” and went on to say a bit more about how other countries weren’t doing their bit. I interrupted him and said, “I know you disagree. I just wanted to go on record as having asked you to take climate change seriously. I want to be able to tell my daughter in the future that I took a shot when I had the chance.” At this point, the encounter took a turn for the bizarre. He offered to bet me $100 the climate would not change in 10 years and I accepted. There was some debate about the wording. I said “the climate won’t change” was extremely broad. Abbott suggested “we won’t all be frying” (I’m from South Australia and having survived multiple heatwaves this summer, including a record-breaking 46.7C day, I beg to differ). Showing an outrageous ignorance of climate science for someone in his position, Abbott mused, “Maybe it will have gone up by about half a degree ... ” “Half a degree is huge!” I countered, horrified. In the end the broad wording of “the climate won’t change in 10 years” was agreed on. We shook hands. Abbott’s associate wrote it down and witnessed it and we both signed.  Afterwards I donated $100 to the Australian Youth Climate Coalition. I gave away my winnings 10 years in advance because I knew I’d won this ridiculous, offensive bet as soon as it was made. Even if Abbott and the Liberal party do a 180-degree turn away from supporting coal, even if they embrace renewables tomorrow, the debt from fossil fuels previously released into the atmosphere will be paid in increased warming for decades to come, let alone 10 years. And if they do as Abbott’s bet predicts, which is exactly nothing, because they don’t understand or they don’t care that the climate is in freefall, and they tell everyone that they plan to do nothing, while smiling and joking, then surely, surely, the Australian public will do something on 18 May. Of course, I’ll be back to collect my winnings in 2029. My daughter will be 16 then, the same age as Greta Thunberg is today. I hope she’ll join me.

Neil Cavuto however admits he doesn’t know what a “Trabi” is. Nothing wrong with that – not everyone can have the fortune of being brought up in communist East Germany – that state run socialist paradise that America now longs to be. So I thought I’d show Neil what he missed out on living in the capitalistic West.

Worse than Inspector Columbo’s car!
My first experience with a Trabi was back in early 1990, just after I had first moved from the US to West Germany and the Wall had fallen. With the border open and East Germans free again to travel unrestricted for the first time in 30+ years, many of them took a drive into West Germany for the first time. On the autobahns Beamers, Audis, and Mercedes Benzes were zooming by in the fast lane at 140 mph as the tiny two-stroke 25 hp Trabants could barely muster going 50 mph. The contrast between West and East could not have been more stark.

East Germans had to wait 15 years for delivery of a new Trabi. Not because demand for them was high – but because it took that long for the state-run factories to build and deliver them. In 1990, the Trabant was technically stuck in the 1940s. If you had an accident in it, the best you could hope for was a quick death.
East German TV spot
Here’s the Trabant 601 – with 600 cc air-cooled 2-stroke engine, fully synchronized 4-speed transmission, 28 mpg highway! Available in any color (as long as it’s beige).

So get your new Government Motors Chevy Volt today, and relive the good ol communist days! Folks, this is what the state-planned, government-run economy can deliver – if only you’ll just give it the chance.
So Neil was right about one thing: It was a real doozie.

"Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called for “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” to avert full blown climate catastrophe. It’s not too late to stave off the worst impacts, they urged – indeed, it’s “possible within the laws of physics and chemistry”. But we need to act fast. Presidential candidate Joe Biden, 76, seems to have a very different understanding of the climate crisis than the world’s leading climate scientists. Several top advisers to the former vice-president previewed his “middle of the road” plan on the issue for Reuters on Friday. He’ll have the US rejoin the Paris agreement, which Trump has said he will leave exit as soon as that document’s terms allow in early 2021. He’ll preserve existing regulations on emissions and fuel efficiency that the current administration has targeted. Like Obama, he’ll embrace an “all of the above” energy strategy, with plenty of room for new natural gas development and exports as well as carbon capture and storage, to indefinitely extend the life of the coal industry.  The Sunrise Movement – one of the leading groups pushing for a Green New Deal – has rightfully called Biden’s plan a “death sentence for our generation”, advocating instead the kind of economy-wide mobilization scientists have urged. “Right now, we need a little bit more reality around this dialogue,” Heather Zichal told Reuters, taking a swipe at such plans. Zichal, “who has become Biden’s informal advisor on climate change policy,” Volcovici writes, also served as a top climate advisor to the Obama administration. Until recently, she sat on the board of directors of Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company that would stand to profit handsomely if federal policy stands by natural gas as a so-called bridge fuel to renewables. Her resignation from Cheniere, an official statement of theirs clarified, “was not due to any disagreement with the company or its management with respect to any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practices”. And why would she? Before leaving Cheniere last summer, she made over $1m through her four year stretch there, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The only reality Zichal seems concerned with is one where the the fossil fuel companies that she has gotten rich off of keep realizing fat profits. Scientific reality is a different story. A recent report from Oil Change International found that allowing the industry continuing to explore for and extract all the new fuel deposits they intend to would run directly counter to the goals inscribed in the Paris agreement. As the IPCC report indicates, meeting those will mean that global natural gas usage decline by 74% by mid-century – and arguably much faster in the US. Staying below 2C means keeping 80% of known fossil fuel reserves buried underground. As out of touch as they are with the scale of the climate challenge, Biden’s industry-friendly plans aren’t surprising. In a video announcing his White House bid, Biden painted Donald Trump’s presidency as an aberration. His promise? Get the country back to business as usual. Presumably, that also means the business of digging up and and burning as many fossil fuels as humanly possible. Last November, Obama bragged to a crowd in Houston about the explosion of oil and gas drilling during his time in office. “Suddenly America’s like the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas – that was me, people,” he said, fishing for an applause. The upshot here isn’t complicated: Biden does not have a plan to keep warming below 1.5 or even 2C. If every country fully lived up to its pledges in the Paris agreement, for instance – including the Clean Power Plan the Obama administration crafted to satisfy its contribution – we’d be on track for a little over 3C of warming, displacing tens of millions of people from the world’s coastal cities, submerging low-lying island states and gravely threatening the world’s food supply. As atmosphere scientists Andrew Dessler told HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman, Biden’s plans would “be more in line with stabilizing at 3-4C of warming, rather than staying below 2C”. “Middle Class Joe” may well believe that the climate crisis poses an existential threat, which is more than can be said of the current administration. If his climate plan is to get us back to 2016, he’s not any more in touch with reality than they are. • This article was amended on 14 May 2019. An earlier version incorrectly stated Biden’s age as 79. He is 76."

We recall the climate discussion that had been planned to take place at the European Society of Engineers and Industrialists (SEII) in Brussels on September 1-2, 2011, and how IPCC vice president Jean-Pascal van Ypersele attempted to suppress it. Eventually it was relocated and took place somewhere else not far away.

"Climate change is transforming life by redrawing coastlines, turning vast areas of forest into infernos, stirring enormous storms and spreading exotic diseases. An indirect casualty of this upheaval could be Joe Biden’s hopes of becoming US president. Biden, frontrunner in the polls to secure the Democratic nomination, has not laid out a plan to address the crisis. This is set to change, according to Reuters, with the Biden campaign working on a strategy to reinstate climate policies torn down by Donald Trump, such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and vehicle fuel efficiency requirements. The plan, which is being worked on by the former Barack Obama adviser Heather Zichal, would see the US remain in the Paris climate agreement and offer support for nuclear energy and also natural gas, which is generally cleaner than coal but still emits planet-warming pollutants. Biden is also said to favour nascent carbon capture technology, which aims to contain and store emissions from industrial facilities. But this “middle ground” approach has been roundly attacked by environmental groups and progressive Democrats for being woefully insufficient. More importantly, it does not appear to chime with the urgent action scientists say is required to avert disastrous climate change. A landmark UN report last year stated that “unprecedented”, “rapid and far-reaching” transformations across energy, land use and transportation are needed to avoid increasingly dire flooding, wildfires, heatwaves, food insecurity and unrest. “A ‘middle ground’ policy that’s supportive of more fossil fuel development is a death sentence for our generation and the millions of people on the frontlines of the climate crisis,” said Varshini Prakash, director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate change organization allied to progressive Democrats such as the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Biden’s betting that a retreat to mediocrity and tepid policymaking will garner him the Democratic nomination, but climate change is a top issue in this election and voters expect candidates to put forward solutions in line with the crisis.” Ocasio-Cortez has championed the Green New Deal, which calls for a national mobilization against climate change on a par with the second world war. The concept has garnered support among some of Biden’s rival presidential nominees including senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The GND, perhaps alongside the severe hurricanes and wildfires that have rattled Americans over the past two years, has helped elevate the issue of climate change to a leading priority for Democratic voters. A CNN poll in April found that climate change was the single most important matter for Democrats, eclipsing healthcare, gun control and impeaching Trump, with 96% saying it was somewhat or very important to them. This rapid shift in priorities threatens to cast Biden’s candidacy as out of touch, even at this early stage. A climate plan deemed feeble by primary voters could harm the former vice-president in a new landscape where the Democratic National Committee is being pushed to hold a climate change-only debate and one candidate, the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, is running solely on the issue of global warming. “We cannot simply go back to the past; we need a bold climate plan for our future,” Inslee said of Biden’s stance on climate change. “Facing a crisis does not permit half-measures. Half-measures mean full extinction of millions of species and full economic damage to communities across America.” Biden has never been at the forefront of the climate movement but is positioning himself as a pragmatic operator who gets things done, including having aided the passage of the Paris climate deal. In a recent rally in Iowa, Biden said he was “one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in 87”, a reference to his successful attempt to get President Ronald Reagan to set up a taskforce on the issue. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, tweeted that the former vice-president had called climate change an “existential threat”. “He knows how high the stakes are,” Ducklo tweeted. “As president, Biden would enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way, and will be discussing the specifics of that plan in the near future. Any assertions otherwise are not accurate.” Proponents of the GND hope that if Biden does manage to secure the Democratic nomination he will embrace the plan due to its focus on creating high-paying jobs in clean energy generation. The worry for climate activists is that the issue could revert to being largely overlooked, much like in the 2016 election, should Biden end up facing Trump in the 2020 contest. “If you’re running to lead the nation, you need to have a plan on climate change given it will be the most catastrophic thing to happen to us,” said Rhiana Gunn-Wright, policy director at New Consensus, which helped design the Green New Deal. “It’s disappointing Joe Biden hasn’t said more. Beto [O’Rourke], Warren and Inslee have all released a plan, so Biden in many ways is an outlier. “The next presidential election will be crucial, but this is a movement not solely focused on that. The Green New Deal is built to exist beyond this election season. People are energized and they want to fix this,” Gunn-Wright said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMarc Morano here recently made what ought to be an obvious point: It’s immoral not to use fossil fuels, which are cheap and plentifully at our disposal. Today they can be burned more cleanly and efficiently than ever. Moreover, the science shows that they don’t have a significant impact on climate.To solve the poverty that still ravages many parts of the world, it is imperative that these impacted regions be supplied with the essential cornerstone of development: cheap ENERGY. It’s a fact: The more energy people consume, the more their standards of living improve. Take a look at the 2 following tables.
Per capita GDP, selected countries 
[US $]
1. Norway 55,000
2. USA 47,000
3. Australia: 41,000
4. Canada: 39,000
5. Germany: 36,000
6. Japan: 34,000
7. Russia: 16,000
8. Mexico: 14,000
9. China: 7,600
10. India: 3,500
11. Sudan: 2,300
12. North Korea: 1,800
13. Ethiopia: 600
Per capita energy consumption of randomly selected countries 
[kilograms of oil equivalent]
1. Canada: 8300
2. USA 7800
3. Norway 5900
4. Australia: 5700
5. Russia: 4400
6. Germany: 4200
7. Japan: 4000
8. Mexico: 1530
9. China: 1140
10. North Korea: 900
11. India: 510
12. Sudan: 480
13. Ethiopia: 280
Compare the position of each country in the 2 tables. What do you notice?
It should be no surprise that the countries with higher per capita energy consumption also have higher per capita GDP, i.e. far better standards of living. On the other hand, countries that consume very little energy have impoverished standards of living and much misery. It’s almost 1 to 1. No country that consumes lots of energy is living in poverty, and no country that consumes little energy is living in prosperity. Of course there are other factors that come into play, such as education and freedom.
Depriving people of energy is not going to allevaite poverty, period. To the contrary, it will only make it worse.  Moreover, making the supply of energy more expensive by mandating costly renewables is only going to result in yet a further reduction in energy consumption in the third world – one they simply cannot afford. Expensive alternative energy sources there will only make the catastrophic living conditions there even worse.
Preventing the construction of power plants and the drilling of gas and oil will also have the same devastating effects.
An extreme example is Somalia. There even the fundamental source of energy for human life – FOOD – is now in short supply. The big problem there is not that there is a global shortage of food, but rather it is that huge amounts of the global food stocks are being converted into biofuels to combat fantasized AGW. That criminal kind of energy-deprivation enacted by the west needs to stop – and soon.

"I grew up in a remote mining town. I know the hardship. I saw the tragedy. One of my earliest memories is a whole town stopped for a miner’s funeral, family after family lining the main street, one people joined in grief. And when politicians talk of caring about miners I don’t believe a word they say.  If they cared wouldn’t they be advocating to end black lung disease, a 19th century industrial disease now returned, because of unsafe working conditions, to kill Australian coalminers in the 21st century? If they cared wouldn’t they be speaking out about the increasing casualisation and pay stripping of coalminers, supported by the Morrison government?And if they cared wouldn’t they question whether Adani is an appropriate business to employ Australian miners? Adani, such a friend of the working man that, when building its giant Shantigram luxury estate in India, it housed workers in conditions so appalling that there were 15 recorded outbreaks of cholera.Put a hi-vis jacket on that corpse and say you’re still for the working miners of Queensland, Scott.But then Adani’s long-term aim isn’t to employ miners under whatever pitiful conditions and awards its paid-up political mates might legislate. As Adani Mining’s CEO said in 2016, “When we ramp up the mine, everything will be autonomous from mine to port. In our eyes, this is the mine of the future.” That’s right: Adani’s ambition is ultimately that its mine is all robots. Not a miner, not a driller, not a driver in sight. So the promised 10,000 jobs that turned out to be 1,462 jobs will in turn vanish like the mist as Adani buys in ever more robots. But that’s not all. Modelling by Wood Mackenzie shows that if coalmining in the Galilee Basin, led by Adani, goes ahead, coal production in older, less efficient Australian coalmines will drop significantly and many coalmining jobs will vanish. Adani’s new mine will simply steal the jobs off the old mines. Jabbering jobs, jobs, jobs, in a hard hat doesn’t change these truths. It doesn’t make a politician fair dinkum. It makes him or her a lying clown who sells every coalminer down the drain for another backhander from the bosses of the fossil fuel industry. The coalmining communities of Australia deserve better. They deserve the truth. They need a responsible transition plan, not lies and deceit. Because Adani’s mine is not happening to help miners. It’s not happening to help Clermont or Mackay or far-north Queensland. It’s certainly not happening to help the poor of India. It’s happening because of one thing: greed. And that greed controls our politics. How can Scott Morrison claim to care about climate change when his political survival now hinges on a deal with Clive Palmer, a man whose own massive Galilee Basin coalmine is dependent on Adani getting up? What exactly did Scott Morrison promise Palmer? The Liberals’ platform is nothing more than a smoking coal heap. Forty-one years ago, I had just kayaked through a beautiful gorge on the Franklin River called Irenabyss. The Franklin was to be dammed and though there was opposition to the damming, no one I knew believed it was possible to defeat the all-powerful state and federal governments that were at the time hell-bent on building it. The gorge opened out into small basin. At its rainforested edge there was a beach. I kayaked over to it and a lanky man appeared out of the rainforest. And there, on the banks of that beautiful, doomed river, I met Bob Brown. I asked Bob did he really think the river could be saved. His answer was revealing. I think, he said, that there is hope. And this is what I learned from Bob Brown. The battle for that river raged for another four years. Governments came and went. At every step it looked like we had lost, and yet, what we could not see was that at every stop we were growing stronger. Thousands of people went to prison in the biggest act of civil disobedience in Australian history. In the end the government was spending countless millions to get heavy machinery into that remote rainforest to destroy as much a possible to make that dam inevitable. And at the very last moment, the high court ruled the dam could not go ahead. I am here today to say that there is hope. That the Franklin flows free and Adani will be stopped. These things happen because at a certain point enough people say there are things that matter more than politics or money. There is no power on this earth that can resist an idea whose time has come. I am not going to waste your time today repeating the many facts with which you are already familiar, suffice to say one thing: the IPCC last October said we had 12 years to contain climate change – that is, decarbonise our economy so that the temperature rises no more than another half a degree on what it is today. If large-scale action is not taken now the IPCC warned that we will face a global warming catastrophe. More than half a year of that 12 years has already passed without any meaningful national or international action. Our emissions are still rising. And that is why this is a crisis unlike any we have ever faced. On present trends much of Australia will become, quite simply, uninhabitable. And what remains liveable will be small bands of our country. We will not have the means to generate the food we need, the wealth we are accustomed to. The most recent science suggests that around the world up to one million species on which we depend for food and clean water face annihilation, that the planet’s very life support systems are entering a danger zone. This is not science fiction. This is not a Netflix series. It is what the world’s leading scientists tell us. The moment for believing this is a matter that can be solved by flying less or not eating meat has long passed. The solution will not be about personal choices. It will be about – and can only be about – political change. And that change will not come about because of a messianic leader. It will not come about because of this party or that party. It will only happen if we wish it to happen and if we make it happen. We have only ourselves to blame and we have only ourselves to turn to save ourselves. It matters very much who you vote for this election. And after May 18 it matters even more to press whoever wins to recognise this crisis is not an issue. It is the issue. The drying out of Australia is the issue. The collapse of our fisheries is the issue. The likelihood of not having enough water to sustain our population is the issue. The threat greater and greater mega-fires pose is the issue. The decline of our agriculture is the issue. The inability of our infrastructure to cope with ever-larger floods and more frequent cyclones is the issue. Sea rises are the issue. The death of our rivers, the death of the Great Barrier Reef, the death of the Tasmanian rainforests is the issue. The drying wheatbelt is the issue. If our very fate as a species is not the issue, then what is? And that is why Adani has become the symbol of why our country is broken. That is why the fight against Adani is a fight for the soul of our country. I know many of you may feel that you have no power, or lack the skills or abilities needed. Faced with the crisis that is climate change it is too easy to feel powerless, to feel the problem is beyond your powers or perhaps anyone’s to influence. Perhaps the greatest problem we face is not climate change, but the myth of our own powerlessness. We believe only the most powerful – the politicians, the corporations – can change our world. Accordingly, we feel a great despair about our future because we can see no hope in any politician or any corporation. But it is not so. Because the only thing that will save us is us. Half of the carbon in the atmosphere was put there by us in the last 30 years. And now we have 11 and a half years to reverse that disastrous act. It is a time to act and it is for us to act. Because there is no one else and there is no other time. And if our politicians continue to deceive themselves and deceive us, if after May 18 we end up with a government that will not act, and if we are only left with only our bodies to oppose this mine, if it takes putting our flesh between the past and the future, between the bulldozers and the earth, if it means a blockade of the Adani site, then I, for one, will be there. And if that means being arrested and going to jail then I will go to jail. And my question to you today is this: will you? Will you stand with me, will you go to jail with me, to stop this mine and save our future? Because if you will, I ask you to raise your hand. I tell you this: we will win. The Franklin was more than a river. Adani is more than a mine. This rally, you people, are part of the river of hope that flows through this country, our beloved country, and it is a river that cannot be bought, that cannot be dammed, that cannot be poisoned, that cannot be bought and sold. And every day that river grows larger and stronger. And I am hopeful. Why? Because 41 years ago I met a man who refused to abandon hope and led a movement with such moral clarity that the river still flows. And 41 years later I stand here before you, with that same man, to say that hope is never lost. Never. Never. Never.

"Australia’s biodiversity is in trouble. The UN global assessment report painted a stark picture: the decline of the world’s natural support systems means that human society is in danger. According to the report, nature is being destroyed at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years. More than a million species are at risk of extinction, natural ecosystems have declined by about 47% and the biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%. All of this is largely because of human activity. And the resulting impacts are likely to worsen unless we take action immediately. As Guardian Australia has reported, Australia’s natural support systems are at breaking point. Increased land-clearing, warming oceans and a drought exacerbated by climate change are taking their toll on our biodiversity. The country is already experiencing rising oceans, marine heatwaves, longer fire seasons and extreme heat patterns. These are consistent with a changing climate. However, there has been a lack of leadership from state and federal governments in this area, protections and funding have been slashed and emissions continue to rise unabated. Without drastic action, the future of Australia’s biodiversity looks bleak. There is a “extinction crisis unfolding in plain sight” in Australia. More than 50 animal and 60 plant species have been lost, with Australia recording the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world over the last 200 years. There’s more to come. Conservative estimates put more than 1,800 plant and animal species and woodlands, forests and wetlands at risk of extinction due to the intertwined pressures of climate change, land use practices, habitat loss and invasive species. The downward trend could be stopped, say conservationists, but only if there is meaningful government intervention. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s James Trezise told Guardian Australia: “From a conservation standpoint we know what needs to happen, but it seems there isn’t the political will to get us there.” The lack of political engagement in these issues is staggering. In February 2018, it was revealed that less than 40% of Australia’s nationally listed threatened species have recovery plans in place and, for the 10% of listed threatened species that require plans, supporting documentation was unfinished, according to the environment and energy department’s own data. There hasn’t been any critical habitat listed on the federal critical habitat register for threatened species since 2005. And the Coalition has been accused of spending the $255m in threatened species funding on unrelated projects. Then in March, the federal environment department was forced to admit that it didn’t know whether recovery plans to prevent extinctions are actually being implemented. The disregard for the protection of these areas was made clear when Liberal senator Anne Ruston, the federal minister responsible for forests, said in February during a Senate debate: “I’m sure that trees were put on this earth in the very first instance because they were able to be cut down, because they would grow again and because they would provide a resource for myriad different things.” Climate change is increasing the pressure on our biodiversity – yet Australia’s emissions rise unabated. National emissions are the highest they have ever been, with the increased production of LNG the major contributor. Guardian Australia reported that emissions growth between 2015 and 2020 from the rapidly growing natural gas industry will effectively wipe out any gains already made. Questions have been raised about the government’s $2.5bn emissions reduction fund and whether it provided value for money with funding wasted on projects that would have gone ahead regardless. Emissions from land and forest clearing are also negating any gains made under the ERF. According to government data, forest-clearing has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the emissions reduction fund began in 2015, with an estimated 60.3m tonnes to be emitted in the next year. Although there has long been rainfall variability in Australia, King said other measures of drought including temperatures effects and evaporation changes pointed to a changed climate, with these patterns set to continue into the future. The UN report identified agriculture as one of the primary causes of the deterioration of biodiversity around the world. The deterioration of the Murray-Darling, the so-called food bowl of Australia, is a case in point. Some of Australia’s most eminent environmental scientists have warned that the Murray-Darling basin plan, the strategy set up to save Australia’s largest river system, is not delivering the environmental outcomes promised. They point to watered down rules, state and federal governments shy of delivering reform, over-extraction and a lack of compliance by irrigators and no allowances for climate change. The South Australian royal commission set up to investigate the issues found that government and MDBA officials were “guilty of maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions”. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, also warned the Murray-Darling basin plan’s failure to take account of climate change was “potentially catastrophic”. Scientists have already reported that the climate in the region is changing, with temperatures rising and rainfall decreasing. The federal government and the authority, who had refused to take part in the royal commission, dismissed the findings. The UN report found the accelerating factors of climate change, pollution and invasive species were impacting the biodiversity of the world’s oceans. Climate change is also causing marine heatwaves to happen more frequently and with more intensity, which have a devastating impact on the ocean’s ecosystems. In our region, the extreme intense marine heatwave of 2017-18 caused major disruption including kelp habitat loss, new species invasions and fisheries season changes. It’s a stark warning of things to come."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming movement is all about energy starvation – with the aim of denying humanity access to the cheapest and most readily available forms of energy.The restriction of energy eventually makes whatever energy that is left on the market so expensive that it risks becoming unaffordable to the large majority of the world’s poor people. The result: Many of the poor will simply die because of the consequences of energy deprivation.
After all, it was Hans Schellnhuber who called determining that the “carrying capacity of the planet to be less than a billion people” one of the triumphs of science, read here.
One way to help deny energy to humanity is to deny populations the use of the huge reserves of the now easily extractable tar sands in Canada. Activists are now gearing up to pressure Obama stop this supply of fuel.
This is what German alarmist site klimaretter.de (which means “climate saviour.de” in German) here encourages, namely blocking the Keystone XL continental pipeline extension that is in the works to transport the valuable tar sand petroleum product from Canada to US markets. Klimaretter labels the pipeline: “Pipeline for climate killer oil”.
Solid bitumen in the sands
Tar sands are heavy bitumen found in the soils of northern Canada. Anywhere else, bitumen oozing openly in the environment would be considered an environmental hazard and any efforts to clean it up would be welcome. But not if the clean-up means supplying the USA with cheap and reliable energy. Klimaretter claims tar sand “is considered extremely environmentally and climate-damaging” and that “studies presume that its oil causes 5 times more greenhouse gases than conventional oil”.

Activists demand that it all be stopped. One way to stop, at least hinder, tar sand extraction would be to shut down the planned pipeline extension from Canada to Texas. Klimaretter says that the USA is greedily wringing its hands as it eyes these riches, claiming that the “fatal impacts on climate change are being gladly ignored”.
James Hansen, says klimaretter, warns of these “fatal” consequences. Klimaretter quotes the eccentric NASA scientist:
The known climate scientist James Hansen emphasizes that the extraction of tar sands would increase the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by 50%. ‘When the development of the tar sands continues, then it means “game over for the climate,’ says Hansen.”
Bill McKibben chimes in saying that Obama could stop the pipeline expansion. Klimaretter quotes:
‘In this matter the President has full control in that he can issue permission or refuse it,’ says Bill McKibben, founder of  350.org.”
With the US economy still in shambles and Obama looking out for the poor folks, it’ll be interesting to see what Obama decides. Poor people desperately need cheap and reliable energy –  so does prosperity. And looking at the climate, the scientific data clearly shows that CO2 has only a minor impact, if any, on the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe always knew they were going to get nasty – really nasty. That’s because we are truly dealing with intolerant zealots here who react viciously and emotionally when their religion comes under fire. Their latest reaction is proof enough.
It’s enough to make any normal person sick. These Greenpeace fanatics are losing it.
We saw it with the TAZ in their recent headline “Skeptics are like viruses“.
Now Greenpeace has declared war  on Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning. Why? Because they chose to exercise their democratic right to free speech and to do what good science involves: practice a little scrutiny, and to get a dialog going – a dialogue that activists have been trying to shut down for years.
But for Greenpeace, no one has any business questioning global warming science or delivering good news like: the climate catastrophe is not coming. Greenpeace insists that a catastrophe is coming, and it intends to make sure no one threatens that prospect. They misrepresent any data that shows to the contrary. Greenpeace thinks everyone needs to remain in fear, if not of climate change, then of Greenpeace itself. No one must begin to doubt.
Greenpeace latest, highly emotional report released today is titled:
Fritz Vahrenholt: Der eiskalte Leugner
Fritz Vahrenholt: The Ice Cold Denier
In it Greenpeace claims that all the science in “Die kalte Sonne” is already debunked, cites their friend and ally Gavin Schmidt, and then tells everyone that the science is settled and that we should just believe them. Then GP portrays Vahrenholt as some kind of callous carbon monster who doesn’t care about people. Near the end GP writes:
As already today millions of people are dying or losing their homes because of increasing weather extremes, his cancellation of the ‘climate catastrophe’ comes across as being spiteful to humans.”
Ice cold denier? Millions dying? Welcome to the tolerant green Germany.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf an “expert” sits down for an interview with a leading media outlet, he should at least know what he’s talking about.
Unfortunately this was hardly the case for Georg Feulner of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Eicke Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany, both giving recent interviews with leading German media outlets in an attempt to respond to Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s controversial book.
And both interviews ended with the scientists looking as if they lacked knowledge on climate change and the latest research.
In Feulner’s case, Lüning and Vahrenholt shred his claims in a report posted at WUWT, read here.
As far as Eicke Weber of the Fraunhofer Institute is concerned, in his interview here in Welt am Sonntag, he did himself no favors. The statements he made only revealed his knowledge has stunning deficiencies on the subject of climate science.
 ************************************************
The following is by Dr. Sebastian Lüning, which I translated from the German – some editing for clarity. (Original German here)
Weber confuses the Milankovitch cycles with the primary solar cycles
Already at the very start, Weber confuses the Milankovitch cycles with the primary solar activity oscillations. To put it simply: While the arguments of our book “Die kalte Sonne” focus mainly on the primary energy output from the sun, Weber in the interview speaks of changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters! These parameters lead to changes in the amount of energy reaching the Earth because of geometric reasons (see page 80-82). These so-called “Milankovitch” cycles are measured in time periods of tens of thousands of years, and so play no real role in today’s decadal-scale climate change.

Weber believes CO2 led temperature during the ice age / interglacial transitions
Weber commits another classic error – probably leftover damage from Al-Gore’s Film “An Inconvenient Truth”. Weber attempts to put the blame on atmospheric CO2 for the transitions between ice ages and interglacials. This falsehood has already been chalked up by Al Gore, and is one of the reasons why a British High Court forbade the AIT film to be shown in classrooms uncommented. If Weber had read our book on pages 129-131, then he would have learned of the correct correlation between the two. High resolution investigations of the last 600,000 years show that the temperature first increased, and then CO2 followed with a lag of 800 years. The CO2 increase was obviously caused by the temperature increase, and not vice versa.

Observe the last interglacial 130,000 to 110,000 years ago. Temperature plummeted even as CO2 stayed at about 260 ppm.
Weber believes in the 10,000-year hockey stick!
Contrary to what was suggested in the interview by solar energy expert Weber, during the Holocene (the last 10.000 years, since the last ice age) the climate was in no way stable. Here the ominous Hockey Stick was doing its magic. The fact, however, is that the climate was neither stable during the last 1000 years nor the last 10,000 years (see book p. 68-75). The climate was characterised by millenium cycles, where temperatures were for the most part in sync with solar activity. It is only by hiding these facts and correlations that climate science has succeeded in marginalizing the sun as a factor in the climate equations over the years. The models cannot in any way reproduce the climate of the last 10,00o years.
Weber simply dismisses all other climate factors
Then came Weber’s decisive statement in his interview: “To me it’s moot to discuss how the 0.75° Celsius increase observed over the last 50 years has come about when we see the record levels that CO2 concentrations have reached.” Eicke Weber obviously does not care about the individual natural and anthropogenic climate factors in the current climate development. This is a bit astonishing as it is precisely this knowledge that is important for making climate models and determining how temperature will develop in the coming decades.  For the Fraunhofer Director, it suffices to know that CO2 has reached a historical record level.
Here’s a short fact-check: Just how high is the current atmospheric CO2 concentration? Currently it is 0.039 percent. Over the greater part of the Earth’s history, CO2-concentration was significantly above that. This somewhat diminishes Weber’s use of the term “historical record high”. Here Weber suppresses the fact that the real climate discussion revolves around what is the correct value of the CO2 climate sensitivity (see book p. 220-225). CO2 by itself can produce a warming of only 1.1°C for each doubling. But the IPCC given values of up to 4.5°C, based on the poorly understood amplification effect of water vapour and clouds.
A normal reader of the interview most likely will not even notice Eicke Weber’s stunningly weak knowledge. But trust in our academic elite will however, be damaged for a long time to come.

First, don’t let anyone tell you that renewable energy is not a hot growth sector – at least that’s what Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine Westphalia, would like you to believe. What follows is yet another example of tricks used by climate scientists, media, governments and green proponents. We’ve seen this kind of slithery behaviour time and again before.
Hat-tip: Science Skeptical blog.
The government of North Rhine Westphalia has a graphic to show you. In the chart that follows, the horizontal curve shows the consumption of primary energy in the state. The hockey stick shape curve shows the consumption of renewable energy in the supposedly fast-becoming green state of North Rhine Westphalia.

Holy moly you might think at first glance – renewable energy is the business to get in on! Look – it has actually surpassed the consumption of old, dirty primary energy.
But take a closer look at the vertical scales. The left hand vertical axis is the scale for the consumption of primary energy, while the right hand axis is the scale for renewable energy consumption. It just happens that the left scale is about 25 times bigger than the right one.

While the graphic is not telling a lie, it certainly is misleading and manipulative. The author used a clever “trick” to hide the disproportion. What happens if both variables use the same scale? Here’s what the real story looks like.

Yawn. Suddenly one sees that reality is much less dramatic. Of course the first graphic is intentionally presented in a misleading way in order to manipulate general audiences.
Next item: Green Party leader begs Germans to fly to Tunisia.
Dirk Maxeiner here brings our attention to German Green Party Chief Claudia Roth’s plead that Germans fly to Tunisia for their summer holidays. Maxeiner’s question is: “Well, is flying now good or bad? The answer of course is that it is good only when Claudia tells you it is.
As Tunisia tries to regain political stability, German tourists have been wary to book holidays in the sunny north African country. During a visit in Tunis, Ms Roth tried to reassure the German public all is now okay in Tunisia:
Those who wish to make holidays ought to come to Tunisia – this is a way of support.”
She is de facto advocating that people produce lots of CO2 to boost the Tunisian economy. I thought using less CO2 was supposed to lead to new economic growth and green jobs. Depends which scale one uses, I guess.

The IPCC has ignored an entire field of science…
Very few people have recognised that in the research that Vahrenholt und Lüning are referring to has nothing to do with the irradiative heating of the sun, which indeed does not fluctuate much, but with the soilar winds which are increasingly shown to have an indirect impact on cloud formation, and thus influence the climate.
The IPCC has looked at this on the fringes and have determined that this research – which the renwoned CERN institute and others are carrying out -– is not far enough to allow conclusions to be drawn.
That may or may not be the case. But the fact remains that the IPCC, which is responsible for bringing the scientists together, still has not gotten the idea to invite these scientists for its large climate reports. Why not? After all it’s the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and not the Intergovernmental Panel on CO2.”
The positive feedbacks ASSUMED for CO2 with respect to water vapour are also very poorly understood. Yet the IPCC has no problems inflating those and including them in their climate reports.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJeez…can’t these guys make up their minds!
Here’s Der Spiegel writing about global warming in 1948, just 26 years before it warned the planet was cooling (1974), read that here, which was only 12 years before they again warned of warming (1986), read it here!
The 1948 piece is titled: It’s getting warmer on the planet. Below are a few of the excerpts. See if it all sounds familiar to you.
First Der Spiegel starts by telling us that “the Governor of California has declared an emergency in 28 counties of his state” and that the current drought there is “likely the most extreme in the last 500 years.”
Weather extremes, and Spitzbergen 7°C above normal
Back in 1948 Spiegel authors wrote of “unusual weather over the past year in Central Europe” and fears that “the climate of the old continent will not remain the same.”
And what would climate predictions be without a consensus of scientists? Der Spiegel wrote:
The scientists say: What is certain is that we now find ourselves in the middle of a large climate change. And it is the biggest in many parts of the world. Not only an increase in air temperatures, but also an increase in water surface temperatures in the oceans.
The most plain to see is the warming in the northern polar regions. Winter temperatures at Spitzbergen during the 1930/39 decade were 7°C over the 1926 measured mean.”
I don’t have my PDO and AMO chart here at my fingertips, but weren’t they at about their positive peaks back then?

Melting Arctic
There was also plenty of Arctic melting going on back then too, just like today! Der Spiegel wrote:
The “Northeast Passage” (the seaway north of Siberia) is like the “Northwest Passage” around Canada, which were earlier virtually impassible, have since become much easier. Amundsen needed 3 years to get through the Northwest passage at the start of this century. In autumn of last year, Canadian Larsen needed less than three months to overcome it. And Larsen had none of the impassable ice that Amundsen had to deal with.
“Catastrophic consequences” wrote Der Spiegel:
The polar climate improvement and the appearance of warmer waters in the northern seas are causing profound changes in plant and animal life.
The glaciers in Greenland, Spitzbergen and Nowaja Semlja, as well as the ones in the European mountains, have been retreating considerably for quite some time now. The complete melting of all glaciers would have catastrophic consequences: sea levels would rise about 55 meters.”
Warming causes both mild and cold winters, just like today! Der Spiegel wrote in 1948:
Warming has led to increased meteorological unrest. That means a tendency for more extreme climate, e.g. very mild and very harsh winters. In Frankfurt December 1934, January 1921 and February 1926 were the three mildest, and January 1940 and February 1929 were both the coldest winter months in over 100 years.”
Now get a load of their hypothesis for the cause!
Also cosmic causes, which are still mysterious to science, could be at play – changes in solar radiation and its composition. It appears to be much more than just a coincidence that the extreme weather year of 1947 just happened to be the biggest sunspot year in over 200 years. Periods of 80 and 110 year respectively have been detected.”
Message to scientists today: It’s the sun, stupid!

"Donald Trump’s interior secretary hasn’t “lost sleep over”, the record-breaking levels of pollution heating the planet, he told US lawmakers in an oversight hearing. The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii observed carbon dioxide levels of 415 parts per million in the atmosphere on Friday – the highest ever documented.  Asked to rank his concern on a scale of 1 to 10, by the Pennsylvania Democratic congressman Matt Cartwright, David Bernhardt pointed to US climate progress. “I believe the United States is number 1 in terms of decreasing CO2,” Bernhardt said. Pushed to give a number, Bernhardt said: “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.” The US has put more carbon pollution into the atmosphere than any other nation in history. China is currently the biggest emitter, and the US ranks second. Carbon emissions in the US actually increased last year. The Trump administration has rolled back many of the Obama-era efforts to limit heat-trapping pollution and many Trump officials have questioned the severity of climate change and whether it is caused by human actions. Scientists agree that humans are the dominant cause of rising temperatures, including the fossil fuels they burn to drive vehicles and run power plants. A recent international science report warned that climate change threatens humans and a million other species. Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist, has been criticized for his decisions favoring industry. At the hearing on Wednesday, an activist in a “Swamp Thing” mask was in full view several rows behind him. Trump vowed to “drain the swamp” if he was elected president, but has appointed multiple former industry representatives to run his agencies."
"A colleague recently described how fish would swim into her clothing when she was a child bathing in the ocean off the coast of Vietnam, but today the fish are gone and her children find the story far-fetched. Another recalled his experiences just last year in Cape Town – one of the world’s most attractive tourism and leisure destinations – when more than 2 million people faced the nightmare prospect of all taps, in every home and business, running dry. These instances, on opposite sides of the world, are two faces of the same problem; the relentless pressure we are putting on biodiversity and the contributions that nature makes to our wellbeing, and the way we humans are changing the Earth’s climate. The rich variety of nature provides us with the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe, and countless moments of personal inspiration spent in forests and mountains, exploring beaches and rivers, or even listening to a simple birdsong in a quiet moment. We have all assumed that nature would always be here for us and our children. However, our boundless consumption, shortsighted reliance on fossil fuels and our unsustainable use of nature now seriously threaten our future. Environmentalists, scientists and indigenous peoples have been sounding the alarm for decades. Our understanding of the overexploitation of the planet has advanced with grim, sharp clarity over that time. We have entered an era of rapidly accelerating species extinction, and are facing the irreversible loss of plant and animal species, habitats and vital crops, while coming face to face with the horrific impacts of global climate change. In 2018 alone, there were deadly heatwaves across Europe and south-east Asia, while the US experienced floods and wildfires. Insurance companies went under, unable to bear the costs of rebuilding after extreme weather events. There is a rising wave of collective anger and anxiety. The spectre of such environmental damage has caused grave concern, especially among global youth, about our inability to sustain our health, productivity, security and wellbeing. New realities have pulled back the curtain and exposed initiatives such as the banning of plastic straws as the drop in the ocean they truly are when it comes to protecting the future for ourselves, our children and all the species with which we share our planet. We must now consider the animals, insects, plants and all the places in which they live. Despite the profound threat of biodiversity loss, it is climate change that has long been considered the most pressing environmental concern. That changed this week in Paris, when representatives from 130 nations approved the most comprehensive assessment of global biodiversity ever undertaken. The report, spearheaded by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), found that nature is being eroded at rates unprecedented in human history. One million species are currently threatened with extinction and we are undermining the entire natural infrastructure on which our modern world depends. Nature powers human endeavours – underpinning productivity, culture and even our beliefs and identities. But our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide are under threat. We are exploiting nature faster than it can replenish itself. The IPBES assessment has shown the strong interrelationship between climate change, the loss of biodiversity and human wellbeing. Climate change has been identified as a primary driver of biodiversity loss, already altering every part of nature. Likewise, the loss of biodiversity contributes to climate change, for example when we destroy forests we emit carbon dioxide, the major “human-produced” greenhouse gas. We cannot solve the threats of human-induced climate change and loss of biodiversity in isolation. We either solve both or we solve neither. The IPBES report shows that governments and businesses are nowhere close to doing enough. The world is on track to miss the targets of the Paris agreement, the Aichi biodiversity targets and 80% of the UN sustainable development goals (food, water and energy security), because of our poor stewardship of the natural world. However, the good news is that there are many policies and technologies that will limit global temperature rise and address the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These will also offer our last, best chance to limit human-induced climate change and preserve the greatest amount of biodiversity possible. The way we produce and use energy, and farm, use our soils, protect coastal ecosystems and treat our forests will make or break our future, but it can also help us have a better quality of life. We still have time – though very limited – to turn things around. It won’t be easy. It requires massive changes, from removing subsidies that lead to the destruction of nature and future warming of the Earth, to enacting laws that encourage the protection of nature; from reducing our growing addiction to fossil-fuel energy and natural resource consumption, to rethinking the definition of a rewarding life. Our current agricultural system is broken. If we keep producing food using current unsustainable agricultural practices, we will undermine future food production. But we already have more than enough food to go around. Today 815 million people go to bed hungry, 38 million more than in 2015. Yet, if food waste were a country, its emissions would rank third in the world, after China and the US, producing 8% of manmade emissions. We need to redirect government subsidies towards more sustainable and regenerative farming. This will not only contribute towards absorbing carbon and reducing the emissions of other greenhouse gases, it can also halt a frightening trajectory where farmland is so overloaded that eventually it just stops growing crops. We simply cannot afford the cost of inaction. Change of the magnitude required will mean a different life for everyone, but the costs of doing nothing will be much higher. The G7 environment ministers, currently meeting in France, have the opportunity to return to their capitals with the freshly approved IPBES report. The world needs them to reflect our current level of crisis at the heads of state meeting later this year. The UK parliament has endorsed a motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency, which is a start, but action and budgets from governments and business will need to follow. As policymakers around the world grapple with the twin threats of climate change and biodiversity loss, it is essential that they understand the linkages between the two so that their decisions and actions address both. The world needs to recognise that loss of biodiversity and human-induced climate change are not only environmental issues, but development, economic, social, security, equity and moral issues as well. The future of humanity depends on action now. If we do not act, our children and all future generations will never forgive us. • Sir Robert Watson is chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve had a number of things that have kept me from blogging over the last couple of days, and so I’m happy to have something quick today. Although it’s on the light side, it is profoundly true and insightful. This ought not be a surprise, though, as it comes from a profoundly insightful and critical mind.
Science cabaret artist and physicist Vince Ebert is featured in an interview at the online Schweizer Monat (Swiss Month) and gives his impressions on science, hypocrisy, and depressed polar bears. Hat tip: www.achgut.com/.
In a nutshell, Ebert claims Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger have got to be rolling in their graves as a reaction to how climate science is run today. The following are some excerpts of the interview from the part on climate science.
On the role freedom plays in science
Science is open to results. Experiments are made to refute theories and to improve. Someone can come along tomorrow and prove the theory of relativity is false. Suppose a biologist claps his hands near a fly, and it flies away. Then he takes a second fly, rips off its wings, claps his hands and discovers: Flies go deaf when you rip out their wings. Every new experiment can produce new knowledge. So a scientist can never say: “The problem is solved”.

There are complex interactions that you simply cannot broadly explain. That’s why it annoys me when someone just comes along and believes he can explain such highly complex systems as climate change through the media, and trumpet it as irrevocable truth.”
On the “arrogance of science”
One should accept one’s own lack of knowledge and consider it as part of the process. Certainly many scientists are torpedoing this mindset. With climate change, many specialists and experts appear not as scientists, but rather as politicians. They come over, having studied physics, and actually claim: “The discussion is over.” And that when it is impossible to falsify their models! Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger have got to be rolling in their graves.”
On climate scientists and the public
Climate research is really a mine field here. Climate scientists get no funding when they say: “Actually, everything is not really that bad, and our models really are not able to predict the future”. On the other hand, a lot of money flows to those who claim: “Let us explain what your climate will look like in 20 years”. Many scientists are jumping on this bandwagon. Who can blame them!”

"Human society is in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems, the world’s leading scientists have warned, as they announced the results of the most thorough planetary health check ever undertaken. From coral reefs flickering out beneath the oceans to rainforests desiccating into savannahs, nature is being destroyed at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10m years, according to the UN global assessment report. The biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%, natural ecosystems have lost about half their area and a million species are at risk of extinction – all largely as a result of human actions, said the study, compiled over three years by more than 450 scientists and diplomats. Two in five amphibian species are at risk of extinction, as are one-third of reef-forming corals, and close to one-third of other marine species. The picture for insects – which are crucial to plant pollination – is less clear, but conservative estimates suggest at least one in 10 are threatened with extinction and, in some regions, populations have crashed. In economic terms, the losses are jaw-dropping. Pollinator loss has put up to $577bn (£440bn) of crop output at risk, while land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23% of global land. The knock-on impacts on humankind, including freshwater shortages and climate instability, are already “ominous” and will worsen without drastic remedial action, the authors said. “The health of the ecosystems on which we and other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide,” said Robert Watson, the chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ibpes). “We have lost time. We must act now.” The warning was unusually stark for a UN report that has to be agreed by consensus across all nations. Hundreds of scientists have compiled 15,000 academic studies and reports from indigenous communities living on the frontline of change. They build on the millennium ecosystem assessment of 2005, but go much further by looking not just at an inventory of species, but the web of interactions between biodiversity, climate and human wellbeing. Over the past week, representatives from the world’s governments have fine-tuned the summary for policymakers, which includes remedial scenarios, such as “transformative change” across all areas of government, revised trade rules, massive investments in forests and other green infrastructure, and changes in individual behaviour such as lower consumption of meat and material goods. Following school strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, the UK parliament’s declaration of a climate emergency and Green New Deal debates in the US and Spain, the authors hope the 1,800-page assessment of biodiversity will push the nature crisis into the global spotlight in the same way climate breakdown has surged up the political agenda since the 1.5C report last year by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. David Obura, one of the main authors on the report and a global authority on corals, said: “We tried to document how far in trouble we are to focus people’s minds, but also to say it is not too late if we put a huge amount into transformational behavioural change. This is fundamental to humanity. We are not just talking about nice species out there; this is our life-support system.” The report shows a planet in which the human footprint is so large it leaves little space for anything else. Three-quarters of all land has been turned into farm fields, covered by concrete, swallowed up by dam reservoirs or otherwise significantly altered. Two-thirds of the marine environment has also been changed by fish farms, shipping routes, subsea mines and other projects. Three-quarters of rivers and lakes are used for crop or livestock cultivation. As a result, more than 500,000 species have insufficient habitats for long-term survival. Many are on course to disappear within decades. In May 2019, the most comprehensive study of life on Earth ever undertaken was released by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The report was compiled from more than 1,500 academic papers and reports from indigenous groups. The overall message is that the world’s life support systems, on which humans depend, are in trouble. Remedies are possible, but they require urgent, transformative action because policies until now have failed to halt the tide of human-made extinctions. The authors hope the mega-report will guide policymakers and generate public discussion on biodiversity (including wildlife, food crops, livestock and ecosystems) in the same way that the climate debate is shaped by reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report also examines five main drivers of unprecedented biodiversity and ecosystem change over the past 50 years, identifying them as: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasion of alien species. Eduardo Brondizio, an Ibpes co-chair from Indiana University Bloomington, said: “We have been displacing our impact around the planet from frontier to frontier. But we are running out of frontiers … If we see business as usual going forward then we’ll see a very fast decline in the ability of nature to provide what we need and to buffer climate change.” Agriculture and fishing are the primary causes of the deterioration. Food production has increased dramatically since the 1970s, which has helped feed a growing global population and generated jobs and economic growth. But this has come at a high cost. The meat industry has a particularly heavy impact. Grazing areas for cattle account for about 25% of the world’s ice-free land and more than 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Crop production uses 12% of land and creates less than 7% of emissions. The study paints a picture of a suffocating human-caused sameness spreading across the planet, as a small range of cash crops and high-value livestock are replacing forests and other nature-rich ecosystems. As well as eroding the soil, which causes a loss of fertility, these monocultures are more vulnerable to disease, drought and other impacts of climate breakdown. In terms of habitats, the deepest loss is of wetlands, which have drained by 83% since 1700, with a knock-on impact on water quality and birdlife. Forests are diminishing, particularly in the tropics. In the first 13 years of this century, the area of intact forest fell by 7%, bigger than France and the UK combined. Although the overall rate of deforestation has slowed, this is partly an accounting trick, as monoculture plantations replace biodiverse jungle and woodland. Oceans are no longer a sanctuary. Only 3% of marine areas are free from human pressure. Industrial fishing takes place in more than half the world’s oceans, leaving one-third of fish populations overexploited. Climate change, pollution and invasive species have had a relatively low impact, but these factors are accelerating. Emissions continue to rise. Last week, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed the 415 parts per million mark for the first time. Even if global heating can be kept within the Paris agreement target of 1.5C to 2C, the ranges of most species will shrink profoundly, the paper warns. Population growth is noted as a factor, along with inequality. Individuals in the developed world have four times as much of an economic footprint as those in the poorest countries, and the gap is growing. Our species now extracts 60bn tons of resources each year, almost double the amount in 1980, though the world population has grown by only 66% in that time. The report notes how the discharges are overwhelming the Earth’s capacity to absorb them. More than 80% of wastewater is pumped into streams, lakes and oceans without treatment, along with 300m-400m tons of heavy metals, toxic slurry and other industrial discharges. Plastic waste has risen tenfold since 1980, affecting 86% of marine turtles, 44% of seabirds and 43% of marine mammals. Fertiliser run-off has created 400 “dead zones”, affecting an area the size of the UK. Andy Purvis, a professor at the Natural History Museum in London and one of the main authors of the report, said he was encouraged nations had agreed on the need for bitter medicine. “This is the most thorough, most detailed and most extensive planetary health check. The take-home message is that we should have gone to the doctor sooner. We are in a bad way. The society we would like our children and grandchildren to live in is in real jeopardy. I cannot overstate it,” he said. “If we leave it to later generations to clear up the mess, I don’t think they will forgive us.” The next 18 months will be crucial. For the first time, the issue of biodiversity loss is on the G8 agenda. The UK has commissioned Partha Dasgupta, a professor at Cambridge University, to write a study on the economic case for nature, which is expected to serve a similar function as the Stern review on the economics of climate change. Next year, China will host a landmark UN conference to draw up new global goals for biodiversity. Cristiana Pașca Palmer, the head of the UN’s chief biodiversity organisation, said she was both concerned and hopeful. “The report today paints quite a worrying picture. The danger is that we put the planet in a position where it is hard to recover,” she said. “But there are a lot of positive things happening. Until now, we haven’t had the political will to act. But public pressure is high. People are worried and want action.” The report acknowledges current conservation strategies, such as the creation of protected areas, are well-intended but inadequate. Future forecasts indicate negative trends will continue in all scenarios except those that embrace radical change across society, politics, economics and technology. It says values and goals need to change across governments so local, national and international policymakers are aligned to tackle the underlying causes of planetary deterioration. This includes a shift in incentives, investments in green infrastructure, accounting for nature deterioration in international trade, addressing population growth and unequal levels of consumption, greater cooperation across sectors, new environmental laws and stronger enforcement. Greater support for indigenous communities and other forest dwellers and smallholders is also essential. Many of the last holdouts for nature are in areas managed by such groups, but even here, the pressures are beginning to take a toll, as wildlife declines along with knowledge of how to manage it. Josef Settele, an Ipbes co-chair and entomologist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, said: “The situation is tricky and difficult but I would never give up. The report shows there is a way out. I believe we can still bend the curve. “People shouldn’t panic, but they should begin drastic change. Business as usual with small adjustments won’t be enough.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2019 because Eduardo Brondizio is from Indiana University Bloomington, not Indiana State University as an earlier version said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you wish to bail out someone in dire financial straits, then you’ll want to make sure that the party receiving the bailout funds will break its old spending habits and not continue its wasteful ways.
This is the case with insolvent Portugal, as the IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank prepare a bailout package for the country. These bailout institutions are demanding that Portugal, among other measures, take a hard look at all its renewable expensive energy subsidies.
The author of the climate website Ecotretas informs us that the offical Portugal-bailout Memorandum Of Understanging (MOU) has been released by the above-named institutes. You can read it HERE.
Here we have the de facto financial branch of the European Union certifying that renewable energies are financially non-sustainable – a waste of money. Yes, so-called sustainability helps lead to fiscal non-sustainability.
The relevant parts on energy are on pages 24 and 25. Under Additional costs associated with electricity production under the ordinary regime; the conditions call for (emphasis added):
5.6. Take measures in order to limit the additional cost associated with the production of electricityunder the ordinary regime, in particular through renegotiation or downward revision of the guaranteed compensation mechanism (CMEC) paid to producers under the ordinary regime and the remaining long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs). [Q4-2011]
And written under Support schemes for production of energy under the special regime (cogeneration and renewables):
5.7. Review the efficiency of support schemes for co-generation and propose possible options for adjusting downward the feed-in tariff used in co-generation (reduce the implicit subsidy) [Q4-2011]
5.8. Review in a report the efficiency of support schemes for renewables, covering their rationale, their levels, and other relevant design elements.[Q4-2011]
5.9. For existing contracts in renewables, assess in a report the possibility of agreeing a renegotiation of the contracts in view of a lower feed-in tariff. [Q4-2011]
5.10. For new contracts in renewables, revise downward the feed-in tariffs and ensure that the tariffs do not over-compensate producers for their costs and they continue to provide an incentive to reduce costs further, through digressive tariffs. For more mature technologies develop alternative mechanisms (such as feed-in premiums). Reports on action taken will be provided annually in Q3-2011, Q3-2012 and Q3-2013.
5.11. Decisions on future investments in renewables, in particular in less mature technologies,will be based on a rigorous analysis in terms of its costs and consequences for energy prices. International benchmarks should be used for the analysis and an independent evaluation should be carried out. Reports on action taken will be provided annually in Q3-2011, Q3-2012 and Q3-2013.
In a nutshell, for Portugal to stop wasting money on renewables, as the IMF, EC and ECB request, the country really ought to stop renewables altogether. Obviously renewable energy are for rich countries who have money to burn. But when you’re broke – then you ought to stop using it.
After all in the end, what good is “energy sustainability” if it leads the world to real financial ruin?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt wasn’t all that long ago when a number of climate scientists were projecting the Earth would soon fall into an almost permanent, increasing El Niño mode, where the surface temperatures of the equatorial Pacific would always be like what we saw in 1998 – all man-made.

Today a number of German-language papers are reporting that Norwegian scientist Tore Furevik of the Bjerknes Centre of the University of Bergen says he expects the opposite to happen at least this year. Furevik says that La Niña may come back for third straight year. “The situation is simlar to the previous year,” he says.
Die Welt here writes that “there are no signs that La Nina is going to disappear anytime soon” and that according to Norwegian experts “it will occur even more strongly than in 2011”.
The Wiener Zeitung of Vienna, Austria adds:
The La Niña phenomena has been persisting since 2010 and there are no signs of it going away. We had this strong cooling in 2010 and instead of getting warmer, we stayed in a long cold phase’, said Furevik. “And it appears as if an even stronger La Niña will occur.'”

Furevik’s La Niña forecast contradicts the experts’ forecast, where an ensemble of models show the trend towards an El Niño for the 2nd half of the year:

Since about 2005 the PDO phase has gone negative and is projected to stay that way for another 15-25 years – meaning cooler global temperatures.
If Furevik is right, it means that 2012 and the first half of 2013 will end up being cold. That’s bad news for those betting the Earth will warm further this decade. That means that the first quarter of the 2010s decade will be much cooler than the average of the last decade.

Negative PDO favors more frequent occurrence of cooling La Niñas.  Source: http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/. The overall 60-year cycle shows we are now at the start of a cool phase.

"Britain’s move to “net zero” carbon and the declaration of a climate emergency in parliament will be “given careful consideration” in deciding whether to grant a review of Heathrow airport’s expansion, the government has said. The new approach falls well short of any commitment to review Heathrow’s expansion, but means the decision on whether to grant campaigners’ request for a review will include the net zero target and the climate emergency among its criteria.  Green campaigners welcomed the pledge, which came in a letter to environmental group Plan B. Tim Crosland, director of Plan B, said: “We’re pleased to see the government is taking seriously our request to review the expansion of Heathrow airport. The government can either take the necessary action to avoid climate breakdown or it can stick to business as usual and expand aviation, but it can’t have it both ways.” The letter is also one of the first indications of how the net zero target, recommended last week by the committee on climate change, and parliament’s vote to recognise a climate emergency, may be taken into account in future by civil servants giving advice to ministers on key issues such as transport and infrastructure. Green campaigners will be pressing the government to review existing policies on these issues in the light of the committee’s view that it is “necessary” for the UK to be net zero by 2050, arguing that policy decisions made previously are now invalid. Plan B wrote to the government on 2 May requesting a new review of the airports national policy statement (ANPS), under which the Heathrow expansion will take place, making that argument. In the letter to Plan B, seen by the Guardian, Caroline Low, the director of Heathrow expansion and aviation and maritime analysis at the Department for Transport (DfT), wrote: “I can confirm that the department will carefully consider this request [for a review of the airports national policy statement, which includes Heathrow]. “As well as giving careful consideration to the net zero report and the declaration of environment and climate emergency, mentioned in the request, it may be necessary to consider the committee on climate change’s recommended policy approach for aviation … and any relevant decisions taken by the government in the coming months as a result.” A DfT spokesperson said: “The expansion of Heathrow received overwhelming support from MPs because it would provide a massive economic boost to businesses and communities the length and breadth of Britain, all at no cost to the taxpayer and within our environmental obligations. “We take our commitment to the environment very seriously and we will give careful consideration to the net zero report. No decision has been taken to review the ANPS, however we are legally obliged to consider requests like this one.”  Last week, a case brought by Plan B and others that ministers must take the Paris climate agreement into account in considering Heathrow expansion was thrown out by the high court. Officials are also understood to believe that any decisions on the request for a review are some way off because the climate change committee will not produce its policy approach on aviation until later this year, so no decision on how to take its findings into consideration will be made until then. This means no recommendation to the secretary of state is likely until next year. Crosland responded: “The government can split hairs if they want, but the situation is too serious for that. Parliament approved Heathrow expansion on the basis of very different circumstances to those which now prevail. It’s just common sense the position calls for reconsideration. You can’t declare an emergency and then act like nothing’s changed.” The net zero report produced by the CCC was hailed as one of the biggest developments in the UK’s approach to climate change in the last decade. The recommendations will require vast changes to all aspects of the British economy, encompassing citizens, consumers, businesses, government and civil society. MPs passing the vote on a “climate emergency” also marked a historic moment in British politics, as it would, if implemented effectively, require the government to have regard for the climate in policy decisions across the board. Siân Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, said: “In this age of climate emergency, Heathrow expansion very clearly cannot go ahead. We need the government to acknowledge the emergency situation that previous policy choices have created. All building of new fossil fuel infrastructure has to end. That means banning fracking, stopping new road building and of course ending Heathrow expansion.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote about Hans Schellnhuber, Climate Advisor to Angela Merkel, and his yet-to-be unveiled  “Masterplan” written by him and his all knowing master elitists on the German Advisory Council on Global Change.
Looking a little deeper we find a strategy paper written last April, in the wake of the Copenhagen collapse, by Schellnhuber and his elitist members titled: Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success. The paper is a strategy Schellnhuber’s “Great Transformation” of society back on track. But before a society can be radically changed, it first has to be taken over. That’s what the strategy paper focuses on.
The paper clearly shows what these characters want – the strategy is summed up in the paper’s conclusion on page 12:
With the international alliances outlined here, European create the political capital and scope for action that it needs to take on a leading role in global climate policy.”
When reading such text, you have to know that it is filled with euphemisms. For example the term climate policy really means “reign”, e.g. global climate policy really means “global reign”. Schellnhuber’s strategy is to look for allies to isolate the USA and other free countries to assert Green reign. The conclusion discloses this aim:
The aim of the new European climate diplomacy would be to generate a critical mass of climate oriented partners so that a course can be set towards a climate-friendly world economy.
Here climate friendly economy is a euphemism for an economy that is so radically dictated that it can no longer emit CO2. It is a planned economy by elitists. It has nothing to do with democracy – it’s all about authoritarianism.
Clearly these master planners are on the Green path to domination. And they are not content with running just their own continent.  Like real control-freaks, they want the whole planet. How much clearer does this have to get? They are not talking about the European economy – they are talking about the “world economy”.

The alliances mentioned above are needed to help…
…to bridge the gap between the basic normative consensus on the need for compliance with the 2°C guard rail and the inadequacy of those structures and procedures in international cooperation that should be playing a key role in achieving such compliance.”
The 2°C guradrail sounds like a noble objective. But it is not.  That too is just a euphemism for draconian authoritarian transformation measures. To stay within the phoney 2°C warming limit, Schellnhuber claims that it is necessary to cut CO2 emissions by 80% or more by 2050 – That means a brutal and experimental – away from free market economy to a centrally regulated economy.
“Masterplan” to be released on Thursday
As far as the “Masterplan” goes we will know more about that on Thursday. It will be officially presented to the eager government at 10 am.
============================================
Whenever you read text from these master Green elitists, use the following short glossary of euphemisms to know what they really mean:
2°C guardrail = authoritarian / draconian restrictions (90% carbon reduction by 2050)
climate policy = reign
climate-friendly = submissive-to-authority
compliance = submission
Great Transformation = destruction of free market capitalism
sustainability = oppression
sustainable – oppressed

That’s a green way of saying that there will be no significant pollution to water. Clearly he wants the public to believe that this small scale leak, which does not even come close to a volcano in magnitude, is going to have an impact on our climate. This is just plain silliness.
Santen is on board a Greenpeace vessel and is taking air samples near the defective platform.
The platform has been in the news in Europe, and activists are doing all they can to spin the gas leak into a sort of Deepwater Horizon scale catastrophe. This is a sign of desperation.

As no water is being polluted, all they are left to say is that it will impact the climate. Imagine that folks, one platform leak will impact the climate. This tells you something about the state of the climate movement today. Grabbing at any straws they can.
The warmist CO2 Handel here writes:
Gas has been flowing out above the water surface and into the air for one week. The gas contains climate-damaging methane as well as poisonous sulfur dioxide.”
According to the German news service DPA, Santen will measure the air near the platform using gas chromatography.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman public radio Deutsche Welle has a recent online report about climate skepticism here titled: Scientists Request Honest Dialogue, which quotes two experts from the fields of climate and meteorology: Professor Hans von Storch and Sven Plöger. This post here focuses on the views of Professor Hans von Storch.
Exaggeration damages credibility
The Deutsche Welle writes about the growing loss of credibility in climate science and quotes: Professor Hans von Storch, Director of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht and the Climate Campus of the University. Deutsche Welle writes:
On the loss of credibility, climate science itself is to blame. The science has stirred up scientifically unfounded expectations, says von Storch. The demand that the public has to rapidly accept instructions on how to act in order to save the planet has blurred the boundaries between policy and science. As a result, science has not become something that has to do with “curiosity”, but rather gives the impression that it’s all about pushing a pre-conceived value-based agenda: “As scientists we have become political tools who are to deliver sought arguments to get citizens to do the right thing.”
If anything confirms this claim, it is the WBGU’s master plan unveiled by PIK Director Hans Schellnhuber to radically transform society in what he calls “The Great Transformation”. Indeed von Storch is right. Some elitist scientists are all about changing the current socio-political system, and so distort science in order to get the needed arguments.
Skeptics not taken seriously enough

What does von Storch think about the attitude of his colleagues with regards to skepticism? Here, von Storch, who is a warmist, expresses dissatisfaction with his climate colleagues and expresses his displeasure that they do not take the questions and arguments from skeptics seriously (emphasis added):
The problem is not ‘that the public is is too stupid, or uneducated’, but that science has failed to deliver answers to legitimate public questions. Instead they have said, “believe us – we are scientists’. There are many questions among individuals and they have only gotten a ‘stroppy reply,’ Storch finds.”
One example is a recent presentation round between bitter adversaries: skeptic scientists at the European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) vs warmist scientists of the alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), and the Max Planck Institute on April 20, 2011. The presentation was organised tooth-and-nail. According to the German online Bild der Wissenschaft here, the warmists made a presentation with EIKE scientists in attendance, who in turn challenged many of the warmist assertions. Bild Der Wissenschaft writes:
Both presenting scientists quickly left after the presentation. Obviously they had little interest to go beyond there presentation obligations and to speak with the climate skeptics.”
Unfortunately, Bild der Wissenschaft did not give the names of the two warmist scientists in the article it posted. I imagine EIKE will post something about it at their website in the near future. One has to say that the act of fleeing from tough skeptic questions does give the impression of warmist cowardice and insecurity. And no publicity had been made by the PIK  (where the presentation took place) to promote that particular event beforehand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve often wondered why Germany remains so joined at the hip with the climate change movement when everywhere else it is collapsing. One reason may be because of the constant weak non-science-based reports like the one presented at N24 German television.
CLICK HERE TO SEE 4:40 VIDEO  (much is in English)
Hat tip: Ron de Haan
The video features the coastal Namib desert, which is supposed to be one of the oldest on the planet. The clip starts in German where the desert is introduced and it is claimed that its unique biodiversity is now threatened (by man-made climate change?). Because the biodiversity is highly adapted to the desert’s unique conditions, any change is all the more critical.
After 50 seconds, the video goes to English with German subtitles. Note how Joe Henschel claims that if anything there changes, then it means “something is really wrong”. The implication is that it is caused by man of course. Again it’s the unfalsifiable science of man-made climate change.
After the interview with the first man, the reporter says in German what climate change will bring for the desert, namely more storms, storm damage and erosion – and so everyone there is threatened. All the fault of man, I guess. The reporter says the Namib desert could act as an early warning system. Life forms from neighboring environments could begin invading.

50-year hockey stick
After 2 min 50 seconds, some observations are given in English by a specialist. The report I guess tries to say that any weather change in Namibia is due to global climate change, which is due to man. The man claims that the weather in the Namib desert has changed suddenly over the last couple years:
The earlier climate records only go back about 50 years, and in geological time that is a very short period. But if we do look at the records we have, we find that the climate has been relatively constant for most of the reported time. In the last few years though we have had a number of unusual events.”
This of course  is very weak science. Remember it is based on only 50 years of observation. I’m not knocking Mr Henschel, but look at how N24 spins the story.
Perhaps similar changes occurred sometime before that. As Steve Goddard points out almost daily at http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/, many of the “unusual” events we see today also occurred back in the not so distant past – more than 50 years ago.
So if anyone has observations, data or information from the Namib desert from more than 50 years ago, Mr Henschel may be interested in them.
(Note: The above hockey stick chart is my own depiction of the Namibian climate)

"Action on climate change should make polluters pay and include compensation for people on low incomes, according to the social services sector. The Australian Council of Social Services and others have called for “at least” a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 coupled with regular indexation of the energy supplement to compensate welfare recipients. Throughout the election campaign the Coalition has attacked Labor’s plan for a 45% emissions reduction target and goal of 50% renewable energy with modelling from BAEconomics claiming this would increase wholesale electricity prices by 20% and reduce wages by 3% over a decade. Bill Shorten has rejected the modelling as propaganda – in part because it did not model the benefits of mitigating climate change – and argued that inaction on climate change makes solutions more expensive. The social services climate statement, released on Friday, backs the Labor emissions reduction target as a minimum, as well as the Greens policy to end subsidies for fossil fuel production and use. The statement calls for “a credible, low-cost and equitable plan to transition to a clean economy that includes a polluter pays principle, direct government investment and targeted support” for disadvantaged groups. “Climate change is not only a threat to our environment, it threatens people’s homes, livelihoods, health, quality of life, employment and increases risks and burdens for future generations,” it said. “It is a social justice and intergenerational equity issue. Climate change hits people living on low incomes or experiencing disadvantage first and hardest.” The social services bodies called for an increase in the unemployment benefit Newstart and to include the energy supplement in welfare recipients’ base payments so it grows in line with inflation rather than remaining frozen at $4.40 a week. The Coalition attempted to limit the supplement to new welfare recipients but was forced to back down in August when the measure was blocked by the Senate. The social service sector also recommended investment in home energy efficiency and production, including mandatory energy efficiency standards for rental housing, energy efficiency and solar for social housing and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to help lower power bills. The sector wants a climate change adaptation and resilience plans, including funding development of an Australian climate change social vulnerability map. The Coalition’s $2bn 15-year climate solutions fund would pay polluters to reduce emissions and includes a “safeguards mechanism” to limit pollution growth, although it has not spelled out how each sector will contribute to its 26% emissions reduction target."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back I sent an e-mail to the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), who we all know provide us with the fascinating 80°+N Arctic temperature charts.
With the Arctic being a crucial indicator of global warming, so we are told, I thought surely they must also have a plot of the annual 80°+N mean temperatures. Astonishingly they wrote back and said they don’t – but sent me the data and said I was welcome to have a go at it.
Ed Caryl volunteered to crunch the numbers and to do a little extra digging on the side. Here’s what he came up with.
====================================================
+80°North
 by Ed Caryl
Since 1958 the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) has been reporting temperatures above 80° North, the North pole and environs, using a gridded model, but basing the data on all available temperature measurements in the area. Pierre obtained all the daily data since 1958 from DMI, and asked me to reduce it to an annual mean temperature plot. Figure 1 is the result.

Figure 1: The annual temperature anomaly for the Arctic above 80° north. From DMI data.
One observes that since 1958 the annual average mean temperature has varied across a range 1.5° C wide, until 2005, when it warmed by just over 2°C above the long term average. One then asks, why?
Figure 2, the Dipole Anomaly in June 2010. —Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center courtesy NOAA/ESRL Physical Sciences Division
The first suspect named by the warmists is a phenomenon called the Arctic Dipole Anomaly. The dipole is high pressure over the Arctic regions on North America, the Beaufort Sea, and low pressure over the Asian Arctic, the Kara Sea. This causes winds from the south along the Siberian coast, pushing ice to the north, and north winds in the Fram Strait, pushing ice out of the Arctic and into North Atlantic. See Figure 2 for the conditions in June 2010. The reduced ice cover has resulted in higher annual temperatures. Many writers echo a claim that this pattern is new, and not seen prior to 1990, blaming it on “climate change”.
The Dipole Anomaly was only noticed this last decade, but I suspect that the phenomenon has been happening all along as a part of the regular AMO and NAO cycles, it is just that there was not sufficient instrumentation in the high arctic to bring it to notice, especially during previous warm periods in the 1920s and 30s. But there were measurements made at a few locations, and many ship logs, and written discussions of these earlier times. But those have been forgotten or ignored by present-day researchers. The failure to recognize and investigate the cyclic nature of nature, especially the interactions of cycles tens and hundreds of years long, has been the failure that has spawned the modern hysteria about “climate change.” (Please excuse the digression.)
The warmest year for most Arctic stations is 1938. Figure 3 is from A Light In Siberia, showing the average of isolated stations in the high Arctic rim, most of them on the coast of Siberia. These temperature records just catch the edge of the 1920 temperature rise.

Figure 3: The average temperature of 9 high Arctic weather stations.
Figure 3 also shows a rapid warming from 1935 to 1938, as well as the recent warming from 2004 to 2007, just like the DMI measurements. The same phenomenon is likely the cause of the temperature rises then and now. This reference was found here:
See: Overland, J.E. (2005) and Muyin Wang; ‘The third Arctic climate pattern: 1930s and early 2000s’, when saying: “The period from 1928–1935 also had a dipole structure in SLP, which contributed to the interdecadal arctic-wide warm temperature anomalies in the first half of the 20th century.”
So much for the Arctic Dipole being new.

“Meridional flows” from the north at Spitzbergen (Svalbard) are also mentioned in that reference. These are a result of an Arctic Dipole. They also write of an average annual increase of shipping access to the island from 94 days to 157 days over the period from 1918 to 1939. The year with the most southern sea ice was 1917, with no access to Spitsbergen’s coast. But there was a great warming in the interval from 1917 to 1922. The following was published in the journal Monthly Weather Review October 10, 1922 (emphasis added).
Dr. Hoel, who has just returned, reports the location of hitherto unknown coal deposits on the eastern shores of Advent Bay – deposits of vast extent and superior quality……The oceanographic observations have, however, been even more interesting. Ice conditions were exceptional. In fact, so little ice has never before been noted. The expedition all but established a record, sailing as far north as 81o29′ in ice-free water. This is the farthest north ever reached with modern oceanographic apparatus…..
“In connection with Dr. Hoel’s report, it is of interest to note the unusually warm summer in Arctic Norway and the observations of Capt. Martin Ingebrigtsen, who has sailed the eastern Arctic for 54 years past. He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1918, that since that time it has steadily gotten warmer, and that to-day the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of 1868 to 1917.
“Many old landmarks are so changed as to be unrecognisable. Where formerly great masses of ice were found, there are now often moraines, accumulations of earth and stones. At many points where glaciers formerly extended far into the sea they have entirely disappeared.
“The change in temperature, says Captain Ingebrigtsen, has also brought about great change in the flora and fauna of the Arctic. This summer he sought for white fish in Spitsbergen waters. Formerly great shoals of them were found there. This year he saw none, although he visited all the old fishing grounds.
“There were few seal in Spitzbergen waters this year, the catch being far under the average. This, however, did not surprise the captain. He pointed out that formerly the waters about Spitzbergen held an even summer temperature of about 3o Celsius; this year recorded temperatures up to 15o, and last winter the ocean did not freeze over even on the north coast of Spitsbergen.”
Here is a chart (Figure 4) of the winter warming at Spitsbergen. The chart begins at 1912, so the full extent of the warming is shown. There was over 10° C of warming in winter from the 1910’s to the 1930’s.

Figure 4: Winter temperature (December, January, and February) at Isfjord Radio weather station, Svalbard/Spitsbergen. Data from GISS.

Figure 5: +80° North Winter temperatures (in degrees Kelvin, as reported by DMI). This is also from DMI data. The bold line is the average of the monthly figures, and is charted in the December year. One more year is shown over Figure 1 because we have full data from last winter through February.
Any warming in the far north is mostly seen in the winter. Note that the winter warming in Figure 5 is more than twice the annual warming seen in Figure 1 in the same period. But also note that the current warming at +80° North is less than half the warming that was seen at Spitsbergen (Figure 4) in the early 1900’s. Figure 6 shows the modern warming at Jan Mayen, Svalbard airport and Bear Island. The modern and the 70’s warming is not nearly as dramatic as that in the early 20th Century, and that happened without the assistance of CO2.

Figure 6: Winter temperatures at Jan Mayen, Bjornoya (Bear Island) and Svalbard airport.

Figure 7. The winter AMO index, 1856 to the present. The bold trace is the average of the monthly data.
So what caused the warming, then and now? One answer, found here (Sergei Rodionov, Climate Logic), is that a shift to the east in the position of the Icelandic low, into Siberia, becoming the “Arctic dipole,” is responsible. This along with a high NAO index, a rising AMO, and ocean currents, makes the Barents Sea warmer than normal. Will this continue? S. Rodionov predicts that the warming will end in 2012, and a cooling trend will last until 2023. The short-term trend is already down. In Figure 5, the warmest winter was 2008. In Svalbard, Jan Mayen, and Bear Island, the downturn began earlier, in 2006. See Figure 6. I strongly recommend reading Rodionov’s article, which goes into great detail.
In the 1920’s the AMO was rising sharply, (see Figure 7) encouraging a dramatic temperature rise in the high Arctic, while currently the AMO is near or past it’s peak, stopping the temperature rise. The 1970’s cooling and warming tracked the AMO. This is all cycles. From the sun to the oceans, some cycles are long, like the Dansgaard/Oeschger
and Bond events, some are irregular like the ENSO cycles, some are tens of years long and regular, like the AMO cycle, some are short and regular like the sun. The sun also has
several long cycles. When these cycles get “in phase,” all encouraging heating or cooling at once, strange things can happen. (For more on Bond Events, google Bond Events Chiefio. He has some very interesting things to say.)

"Renee Blackman runs a health service covering a vast chunk of north-west Queensland – about 640,000 sq km, an area larger than Spain – that provides services to about 7,000 Aboriginal people in communities from Mount Isa to the Gulf. While the cultures and circumstances of these communities are diverse, Blackman says they share a common health threat: that the harmful impacts of poverty are magnified in remote locations.  Blackman, a Gubbi Gubbi woman and CEO of an Aboriginal community-controlled health service Gidgee Healing, sees poverty contributing to poor health in remote communities in many ways. People cannot afford healthy foods, to access or maintain housing, to buy vital medications, or to travel to regional centres such as Cairns or Townsville for surgery that would help them or their children, she says. But mostly, she says, poverty means people have more pressing priorities than whether their diabetes is being well controlled. “None of that matters if the priority is to put food on the table first, or a roof over the table,” she says. “Worrying about medication or a specialist appointment or an allied health wraparound service isn’t a priority.” Blackman says she gets really frustrated when health groups put out simplistic messages for people to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. It reminds her that so much health debate is far removed from the realities of people living in poverty. Likewise, there is also a disconnect between much of the mainstream debate about health, which tends to focus on funding of medical services and hospitals, and the evidence about what matters most for people’s health. The Western Australian government’s recent Sustainable Health Review cites US research suggesting that only 16% of a person’s overall health and wellbeing relates to clinical care and the biggest gains, especially for those at greatest risk of poor health, come from action on the social determinants of health. These are “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age”, and are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources. In the case of Gidgee Healing’s clients, the determinants of health include the ongoing legacy of colonisation, such as poverty and racism, as well as protective factors such as connection to culture and country. Tackling the social determinants of health is critical to address health inequities, which arise because people with the least social and economic power tend to have the worst health, live in unhealthier environments and have worse access to healthcare. A study cited in the last two editions of Australia’s Health (in 2016 and 2018) estimates that if action were taken on the social determinants to close the health gap between the most and least disadvantaged Australians, half a million people could be spared chronic illness, $2.3bn in annual hospital costs saved and pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions cut by 5.3 million. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services have a long history of working holistically and innovatively to address the wider determinants of health, and Gidgee Healing incorporates legal services, knowing that legal concerns “cause a lot of worry for families”, Blackman says. However, many of the levers for addressing the determinants of health lie outside of the health sector’s control. For example, Blackman’s vision for what would help Gidgee Healing clients includes increases to Newstart and other social security payments, with a loading for remoteness. She would also like to see better access to education and training for remote communities, many of which do not have high schools. As well, Blackman would like a “whole of government” approach to addressing the social determinants of health, as was recommended in 2008 by the World Health Organisation commission on social determinants of health. In the absence of such action, she says Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services have to work hard and be creative in the face of government silos in their efforts to provide holistic services. Blackman’s job is challenging enough at the best of times. But climate change and extreme weather events, such as recent flooding that cut road access to many remote communities for several weeks, are making it ever-more difficult. “You have got these massive weather events sweeping through our communities, decimating structures, infrastructure – which means health services,” she says. “If your health service is down, you can’t provide any type of healthcare; it’s almost like you are operating under war conditions sometimes, because things get totally obliterated and you have got to build back from scratch, yet you’ve got people who need your assistance.” Blackman and many other health professionals are seeing the impact of a perfect storm threatening the health of some of Australia’s most disadvantaged communities. Climate change is exacerbating the social and economic inequalities that already contribute to profound health inequities. Blackman describes elderly Aboriginal people with multiple health problems stuck in inadequate housing without air-conditioning during increasingly frequent extreme heatwaves. Sometimes it is so hot, she says, the bitumen melts, making it difficult for her health teams to reach communities in times of high need. As well, patients are presenting to Gidgee Healing clinics with conditions such as dehydration that might be preventable if they could afford their power bills and had appropriate housing. The mental health impacts are also huge, Blackman says, mentioning the deaths of hundreds of thousands of livestock during the floods. “This is devastation, this is loss, this is grief, we are already facing a suicide crisis in the north-west across all of the community, including the Aboriginal community,” she says. “You’re talking about a region that already has depleted access to mental health professionals.” Hurricane Katrina is often held up as a textbook example of how climate change hits poor people hardest, and not only because the poorest areas in New Orleans were worst affected by flooding. Much of the planning and emergency response catered to the better off – those with cars and the means to safely evacuate and arrange alternative accommodation. As Sharon Friel, professor of health equity at the Australian National University, outlines in a new book, Climate Change and the People’s Health, most of those who died because of Hurricane Katrina came from disadvantaged populations. These were also the groups that suffered most in the aftermath, as a result of damage to infrastructure and loss of livelihoods. “It was also lower-income groups, and in particular children and the elderly, who were at increased risk of developing severe mental health symptoms compared with their peers in higher income groups,” Friel writes. It is not only the direct and indirect impacts of climate change that worsen health inequities; policies to address climate change can have unintended consequences. Friel cites international evidence that the distribution of green spaces in cities to promote urban cooling and health tends to benefit mainly white and affluent communities. Friel’s book outlines myriad ways in which climate change interacts with other social determinants of health to create a multiplier effect that deepens and compounds health inequities. Yet policymakers have been slow to respond, although such concerns were clearly identified more than a decade ago, in the landmark WHO report on the social determinants of health, which said it was important to bring together “the two agendas of health equity and climate change”. While Friel says the relationships between climate change and health inequity are “messy and complex”, she argues that understanding there are common determinants of both problems provides an opportunity to “kill two birds with one stone”. Friel calls for intersectoral action, with a focus on equality, environmental sustainability and health equity, to tackle the underlying “consumptagenic system” that drives both problems. This system is “a network of policies, processes and modes of understanding and governance that fuels unhealthy, inequitable and environmentally destructive production and consumption”. In Victoria, a large community health service provider called Cohealth has had processes in place for at least five years to work with at-risk groups during extreme weather events, in recognition of the need to address climate change as a health threat, especially for disadvantaged populations. During heatwaves, the service checks on homeless people, public housing residents and people with mental illnesses to ensure they can take steps to stay safe. “The growing frustration of people in the health sector is, this work is eating into our budgets, it’s occupying the time of our staff – and yet there is little or no policy recognition of the way health resources are being taken to address these problems,” says Cohealth chief executive, Lyn Morgain. She adds that local governments and service providers have been left to carry an unfair burden due to inaction on climate and health by governments, especially the federal government. Morgain, who is also chair of the Social Determinants of Health Alliance and a former board member of the Australian Council of Social Service, notes that Acoss has been championing the need to apply an equity lens to climate policy, to assess whether new policy proposals across a range of portfolios advantage or disadvantage low-income households. Kellie Caught, senior advisor on climate and energy at Acoss, is calling for the next federal government to invest in vulnerability mapping to identify communities most at risk from climate change, in order to support development of local climate adaptation and resilience plans. Governments also need to invest in building the resilience of community organisations such as those providing disability, aged care, meals on wheels and services for homeless people, to ensure they have the capacity to undertake disaster management and resilience planning, and continue operating through extreme weather events, she says. Acoss is advocating for mandatory energy-efficiency standards for all rental properties, for state and federal governments to invest in upgrading energy efficiency and production in all social and community housing, and for a fund to help low-income earners such as pensioners upgrade their homes’ energy efficiency, as well as programs for remote and Indigenous communities. It is more than a decade since policymakers were presented with evidence showing that such measures bring concrete health benefits for low-income households. A widely cited randomised trial, published in 2007 in the BMJ, found that insulating low-income households in New Zealand led to a significantly warmer, drier indoor environment, and resulted in significant improvements in health and comfort, a lower risk of children having time off school or adults having sick days off work, and a trend for fewer hospital admissions for respiratory conditions. “Interventions of this kind, which focus on low-income communities and poorer quality housing, have the potential to reduce health inequalities,” found the researchers. The health of people in Burnie in north-west Tasmania is shaped by rates of poverty, unemployment and poor educational outcomes that are worse than the state’s average. At the public hospital, emergency physician Dr Melinda Venn is reminded every day how people who are poorer and sicker have difficulty accessing the services they need. She describes seeing patients who struggle to feed their families, or buy medications and who often can’t afford to put petrol in their cars to get to the doctor. Her prescription for what would help her community’s health and wellbeing is similar to Renee Blackman’s in north-west Queensland. It includes wide-ranging action to address poverty, including through raising the Newstart allowance and more generally ensuring liveable incomes, as well as access to affordable fresh food, public transport and higher education. Venn also stresses the importance of better funding for preventative health measures and primary healthcare. “Every day we see people come to the emergency department, either because they can’t afford to get into the GP or they can’t get into the GP,” she says. Dr Nick Towle, a medical educator at the University of Tasmania who helped organise a recent Doctors for the Environment Australia conference in Hobart, where delegates declared a climate emergency, says that addressing the intertwined issues of health inequities and climate change will require massive transformation in how governments operate. They must move beyond the current siloed approaches whereby, for example, the housing portfolio can be reluctant to invest in improving housing if savings are to the health portfolio. Towle says a systems approach would reimagine urban development so that communities are within cycling or walking distance of local food production, green spaces and infrastructure such as shops, primary healthcare and aged care centres, and with active and passive solar a requirement for all new developments. Like Venn, Towle stresses the need to invest far more in primary healthcare and the prevention of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, lung and cardiac disease, which are more common in poorer communities, and make people less resilient to the effects of heat, which he says “is emerging as a big silent killer”. Back in Mount Isa, Renee Blackman stresses the importance of local action in responding to both health inequities and climate change. Local governments, especially Indigenous local governments, should be given more support for tackling these issues, she says.  “At least talk to the people it’s going to affect,” she says. “As an Aboriginal organisation, we would never tread on someone else’s Country, without first asking, what do you need?” An assessment of the major parties’ track records and election promises shows Australia has a better chance of acting on poverty and climate change as critical health equity concerns if there is a change of government. The Acoss’s election policy tracker suggests the Greens have the best policies for addressing poverty and climate change, while the Climate and Health Alliance scorecard gives the Greens top marks (8 out of 8), followed by Labor (4.5 out of 8) and the LNP (zero out of 8). The Consumers Health Forum of Australia scorecard gives the Greens’ health policies the highest rating (21 out of a potential score of 37), followed by Labor (16/37) and the LNP (7/7). The Public Health Association of Australia has welcomed Labor’s and the Greens’ commitments on preventative health, while the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance has called on both major parties “to follow the lead of the Greens and commit to health policies that deliver both equity and efficiency”. Like many, the Consumers Health Forum is disappointed in the lack of focus on primary healthcare, saying “the absence of a transformational agenda for primary care is a missed opportunity this election”. Meanwhile, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association scorecard records the Liberal National party as having no explicit commitment to health equity and, days out from an election, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia says the Greens are the only party to have addressed rural health issues so far.

Representatives from the Liberals to the Greens, appearing on Monday night’s Q&A on the ABC, hopped into the media giant over its coverage of Bill Shorten and his speech referencing his mother’s life story. Last week the Daily Telegraph criticised Shorten on its front page for what it said was a deliberate omission that she had become a barrister late in life. The Labor leader had spoken on Q&A about how his mother, Ann, had been thwarted in her early ambition to study law and instead took a teaching scholarship. The Liberal’s campaign spokesman, Simon Birmingham, said the story “should not have been written and should not have been published”. “Bill dealt with it,” he said. “Scott dealt with it. I think in terms of media commentary and the way the media runs, Australia’s a country with a free media, [people] are free to choose not to read a newspaper that they think is biased, just as they’re free not to watch a television program that they think is biased.” But the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, went a step further. “News Corp is a malignant influence on our democracy,” he said to applause. How would a Labor government handle a hostile Murdoch press intent on undermining its policies? #QandA pic.twitter.com/bx0YTS4iiW “They’re not a media outlet. They’re the propaganda arm of the hard right of the Liberal party and becoming increasingly hysterical. They incubate hate. And the question really is what do we do about it?” His answer? To strengthen the regulator and give more money to the ABC, a move predictably greeted by applause from the ABC audience. But most of the last Q&A before this weekend’s federal election was taken up with a largely respectful debate about climate change and whether the Coalition had done enough to reverse global warming, which Di Natale said was putting the human race in danger. Birmingham insisted that the Coalition would meet or exceed the Kyoto targets that Australia signed up to. Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, emphasised the need to take “real action” towards the international commitments on climate change. “We have said we will have a climate change ambassador who would work with the South Pacific in particular,” she said. Helen Haines, the independent standing in the Victorian seat of Indi, linked it to the problems of the Murray-Darling basin and said rural people were prepared to make sacrifices to achieve a transition to an economy that addressed climate change. Di Natale predicted that the Greens candidate Julian Burnside would win in the plum Liberal seat of Kooyong because the Liberal vote had collapsed. “The PM of the country brings a lump of coal into the parliament and waves it around,” he said. “It was an embarrassment. An international embarrassment.  “And the Liberal party, you vote for the Liberal party, you’re voting for the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, the collapse of the Murray-Darling basin, more floods and more fires.” What will the panel do to address the impact of climate change and water scarcity, particularly in rural areas? #QandA pic.twitter.com/bbXvZCevH6 He also said the Greens were closing in on Higgins and could snatch it from the Liberals. The program canvassed how the Liberals’ policy to lower first homebuyers’ deposits to 5% would work. “The government will be a mortgage insurer?” asked Tony Jones, the presenter. “Essentially. That’s right,” Birmingham replied. “It’s about making sure rather than young people having to spend years extra paying rent and trying to still save, they’re able to get that first rung on the ladder of owning a home. They’re able to start paying their mortgage rather than paying rent. And build equity in their property. It sits alongside other things that we have done as a government, such as the utilisation of superannuation accounts.” Labor has immediately said it would match the policy, though it is now coming in for criticism from economists who warn that the plan could potentially push up house prices and trap young homebuyers with unsupportable levels of debt and negative equity should the housing market continue to fall. Birmingham said it would be up to the banks to ensure people did not get in over their heads. “In the end the same standards apply that banks are currently applying in terms of analysing the income, spending, saving habits and value of the property somebody is purchasing,” he said. “It’s about bringing forward that transaction potentially by years which can make a huge difference for young people.” Birmingham appeared to acknowledge that no modelling had been done before the policy was announced but said the government “had looked at the lived experience of NZ, which has had the policy in place for 10 years.” Plibersek said Labor was supporting it because it would make a modest difference to first homebuyers. But she said Labor’s policies on abolishing negative gearing on future investments in existing property would have the biggest impact on levelling the playing field for them. “Joe Hockey said get a better job,” she said. “Malcolm Turnbull said get rich parents and now, six days out from an election, Scott Morrison says, ‘I’ve got all the answers with this new scheme.’” Only the Greens said they saw risks in the policy. Di Natale agreed with Labor that negative gearing was the real issue but warned the low deposit measure could lead young people into taking loans they could not afford. “It’s not a sensible idea and I am disappointed that Labor has backed it in,” he said. The representatives of both major parties also struggled with questions about Newstart. Plibersek acknowledged in response to an audience question that she could not live on $39 a day and said Labor would review the payment. But Birmingham accused Labor of trying to give impression it would increase Newstart when it hadn’t actually budgeted for it. “You sound like you’re in opposition,” Jones said as he pressed for Birmingham to say what the Coalition would do. Di Natale drew wild applause when he said: “It is completely unacceptable in a county like Australia.” Haines agreed and promised that if elected she would work from the crossbenches to address the level of Newstart."

The cold of global warming. (Photo: NOAA)
2011 third coldest year of the decade.
First 2011 happens to have been the third coldest year in the last decade, according to satellite measurements and John Christy of the University of Alabama.
Globally averaged, Earth’s atmosphere was 0.15 C (0.27 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the 30-year average in 2011; That was less than half of the warming anomaly seen in 2010.”
USA was a full degree cooler than in 1999!
With constant nail-biting over warming, the media are obviously disconnected from reality, as data from the NOAA show that 2011 was cooler than 1999 and cooler than some of the years in the 1980s. Bastardi writes:
Despite claims that it continues to get warmer and warmer, this table from NOAA/NCDC indicates that 2011 was in the middle of the pack, going all the way back to 1980 (the start of the “global warming era”). Such remote years as 1981, 1986, 1987, and 1990 were hotter.”

Here’s the Spiegel interview with climate maverick Fritz Vahrenholt – in English!
“Will reduced solar activity counteract global warming in the coming decades? That is what outgoing German electric utility executive Fritz Vahrenholt claims in a new book. In an interview with SPIEGEL, he argues that the official United Nations forecasts on the severity of climate change are overstated and supported by weak science. Continue reading…”

"While Extinction Revolution was gearing up for another impressive protest, Barry Lopez was considering a pair of sparrows mating atop a cantilevered sign on New York’s Upper East Side. It wasn’t the most momentous of couplings, hardly the millions-strong gathering of geese he witnessed in his award-winning book Arctic Dreams or as moving as his account of buffalo sheltering from a late-season blizzard and singing the song of death in Winter Count, but Lopez is, as ever, on the lookout. Widely considered to be greatest of naturalist writers, Lopez calls the coupling “a refreshment for the eye”.  “I notice those things even in urban environments because they’re a pleasant contradiction to the hammering urban intensity and headlong progress that defines so much of the city.” Few writers have chronicled more exquisitely how natural landscapes shape and are shaped by human desires and imagination. At 74, his latest book, Horizon, is an attempt to describe his own life through his experience of six regions: Oregon’s Cape Foulweather, where Captain Cook first set foot in North America; the Galapagos, where he observes sea lions caught in a net calm themselves as he works to free them; the high Arctic, again, locale of his greatest work; Australia’s Botany Bay; equatorial Africa; and the ice shelves of Antarctica, where he notes that there is no longitude at the south pole because every direction is north. But today, Lopez is not here to discuss the broad sweep of his career, though he’s not averse to it. Several years ago he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. His message is pressing, and it’s not about the particularities of an urban environment: it concerns the planet’s intensifying biodiversity crisis. Lopez’s alert comes as the United Nations issued a report blaming human activity for the accelerating decline of Earth’s natural life-support systems that places one million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction. “Something very big is going on the like of which we have never seen,” Lopez tells me. “I’m trying to see the bigger thing that operates independently from the idea of nation state, what’s going on that’s transcultural, and who are the people worth listening to in a culture like ours where we have pretty much destroyed the elders.” “My supposition,” he continues, “is that we’re living in emergency times. In the west, we believe we are the most progressive and socially just, but a lot of that is just a hopeful illusion.” ﻿Like many of his generation, his conscience was triggered by the Vietnam war. He came to believe that he couldn’t be considered an educated person if he was informed only by white Christian men – “a solipsistic universe of people like myself”. He decided to seek the knowledge of traditional and Native peoples. “I wanted to apprentice myself to another world, in part because without it I would simply be thinking and enforcing a set of ideas that are held by relatively few people.” The knowledge he began to glean related to storytelling in those societies. The goal was to inform the reader of a world that exists on both empirical and metaphorical levels. “So you can be writing about stranded whales and underneath you can be writing about the tension between the real and the non-real. What you’re trying to do is to reach people metaphorically.” In those traditional societies, the willingness to experience life on a metaphorical level protects individuals from being ostracized. The more time Lopez spent in them, he says, the more he wanted to be around people “who are interested in taking care of each other, not just themselves”. The connection he found rests on a deeper level, that is through the environment and the animals that inhabit it. A story about an encounter with a polar bear is just that but to another listener, it’s about the deeper understanding of the other and why there is other. “To an outsider listener it sounds simplistic, but to an adept it’s the consolidation of complex ideas in a few words.” This is why listening to elders is key. In traditional societies, where stability trumps progress, elders’ function is to maintain stability. But in the west, we’re fixated on progress, whether that’s new cars or new gadgets. “This is seen as a progressive thing but it’s actually a waste of time and resources.” Indeed, he learned that endless growth was not the answer from traditional people. He recalls asking caribou hunters in Canada’s Brooks Range why they didn’t raise reindeer instead. The hunters told him it would change their lifestyle, which wouldn’t suit them. Lopez doesn’t understand why we “won’t listen to people who are not like ourselves when we are getting the message every day that climate change doesn’t care if you’re male or female, black or gay. We should be having our elders have that conversation and then we defer to their decision.” He adds: “I trust that they know what they’re doing, and the more time I spend in the middle of this the more do I see the profound difference between a headlong culture like ours, that is attracted to drugs, attracted to possessions and attracted to progress, that sets up artificial hierarchies – that culture is moving so fast there can be no deliberation. In traditional culture, there is no interest in progress – what you have is pretty good. The idea is to assess anything that threatens stability.” Horizon is full of such observations, even questioning the idea of environmental restoration – a kind of fascism, he suggests, that attempts “to erase the horror of what you see before you. It’s like pacifying a child – just a way to make you feel OK.” Throughout, Lopez is seeking ways to slow change. His point, he says, is that “every stabilizing force in society is undone by fundamentalist thinking, whether that’s religion or science or government. ﻿“In traditional society, the elders reject no one and consistently make the right decisions because they want the best for the group. Traditional people are focused on addressing situations that create instability and you have to face the fact they have been right for tens of thousands of years.” The results are plain to see. Lopez mentions the militia uprising in Sudan, the regimes in power in Brazil, the Philippines, Hungary – “all these Trumpsters coming into positions of power all over the world”. Depressing, certainly, and Lopez says he feels “as abused and intimidated as the next fellow”. Lopez knows also that there are going to be hard decisions to make. “We’re already applying triage,” he says. The job at hand is to make clear to people “how completely unprecedented and dangerous this situation is, and how we’ve created a suicidal society in order that some can buy a 70ft yacht”. As he tours the nation’s universities, the argument he advances hinges on what comes next if the idea of nation state is over. He asks students what comes after capitalism and democracy. It’s a question that inevitably produces consternation and hostility. Witness the reaction to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young congresswoman pilloried for raising uncomfortable topics, including profound changes in lifestyle that are required to even start to stabilize the destruction. “If you are incensed by moderately progressive ideas, you’re never going to get anywhere,” Lopez says. “If you have to demonize her or embarrass her, all you are demonstrating is the fear that drives your decisions, which is mostly no change. “AOC is not the problem and she’s barely speaking about the deeper things that have to be considered. This is an emergency, and the changes she is advocating are part of a furious effort to get things moving. God bless AOC. Thank God she’s out there shouting.” ﻿Lopez maintains he’s enthusiastic about humanity’s ability to cope with anything. But for someone who has made a career of bringing the beauty of the natural world to writing, surely it must be distressing to be discussing its collapse. “I had the privilege to do these things, and I would like the reader to feel a deepened sense of self-worth, a stronger sense of possibility and capability.” But yes, he says, the radical rearrangement of society that is required is beyond the reach of most people already struggling to survive. “You have to be selective about what you say. It has to be loving, not castigating, and do not destroy anybody’s sense of hope.” He mentions a poet, WS Merwin, whose poem Thanks he sometimes turns to for solace. “We must learn to love the mutilated world,” he says, paraphrasing its meaning. “We’re trying to swim in gasoline. It’s impossible, but we swim on.” Horizon by Barry Lopez is published by The Bodley Head (£25). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to klimaretter.de, a warmist site operated by socialists and green Utopians, Dave Roberts was invited by the Heinrich Böll Foundation as a speaker for climate blogs at the network conference re:publica in Berlin last month. Roberts, you will recall, is the activist at Grist who in 2006 called for Nuremberg-type trials for bastards who deny global warming.
Klimaretter.de interviewed Roberts here and asked him about the US failure to pass a climate bill and the power of American conservatives. He had some interesting responses. Here are some excerpts of questions and answers in paraphrased form (I’ve eliminated all the rambling).
klimaretter: After the wonderful election of Barack Obama, hopes to pass a climate were high. What happened?
Roberts: The idea that it would be enough to replace “bad people” with “good people” turned out to be utterly naive. Barack Obama seemed to be the Messiah we had been waiting for. But his charisma was not enough to solve the USA’s deep problems. The Republicans routinely used delay and disrupt tactics.
klimaretter: Why didn’t the law get passed?
Roberts: Obama thought he could quickly pass health care reform, and then use the momentum to pass a climate bill. But passing health care reform got bogged down and became a very difficult issue. The momentum got lost. So the climate bill died and the only thing left to do is to set our hopes on EPA and its authority to regulate CO2. The Republicans want to defund the EPA. The fight is tough, but it’s not over yet.
klimaretter: What makes the conservative climate skeptics so powerful in the USA? 
Roberts: The conservatives really know how to create an atmosphere of controversy in order to block climate protection measures. The Republicans are focused on spreading doubt and portraying scientific consensus as being in dispute. There are great parallels with the tactics used by the tobacco industry.
klimaretter: Will it be possible to expect progress in US climate protection over the next 2 Obama years?

Roberts (see English below): Das Klimagesetz ist jedenfalls erstmal tot – wahrscheinlich sogar auf etliche Jahre. Und auch wenn Obama wiedergewählt wird und die Demokraten im Repräsentantenhaus die Mehrheit zurückgewinnen muss man sich fragen, ob das reichen wird. Denn an dem Punkt waren wir schon einmal – und das Klimagesetz ist trotzdem grandios gescheitert.
In English: “The climate bill is now dead in any case – probably even for a number of years. And even if Obama gets re-elected and the Democrats regain the majority in the House of Representatives, one has to ask whether that will be enough. We were at that point once already, and the climate bill failed spectacularly.”
klimaretter: Will the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan have an impact on nuclear plans in the USA?
Roberts: The Fukushima issue here is being played down. The catastrophe will not change the course of nuclear power in the USA much. Obama’s energy secretary Steven Chu is a big proponent of nuclear power.
——————————————————————-
And so what is the reaction of green-eyed Germans to Robert’s dire message from the USA? Answer: “OH NEIN!”
For example, here’s how yet another socialist/green Utopian site, Klima Der Gerechtigkeit (in English: Climate Of Justice) reacts to the message and US analysis delivered by Roberts:
In a healthy world and in every other democracy, the climate bill would have been passed with huge majorities. Not so in the USA and its political system. No wonder David Roberts felt at times that he was on another planet when he visited Berlin.”
That comment was written by Arne Jungjohann, who is living in Washington. When he talks about “every other democracy”, he is referring to places like the defunct German “Democratic” Republic – former East Germany – the country that imprisoned its people behind a wall of concrete, barb wire and sharp shooters, and where everybody was spying on each other.
Spare us your lectures on “democracy”, Arne. In the USA the topic is being discussed openly, and not being rammed down the throats of citizens by obsessed dogmatists with masterplans. Go back and review history. Your twisted idea of democracy is sickening to any honest and moral person.

"As the midday sun beats down on Tuvalu, a slim slice of golden sand in remote Oceania, locals seek shelter under palm trees by the lagoon’s edge or retreat to the dark interiors of their homes. There is little else they can do to escape the sun’s powerful rays because there is no suncream in the entire country, despite strident efforts by locals to obtain some. Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world and located halfway between Australia and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Classified as a developing country by the United Nations, Tuvalu is on the frontline of climate change, and is already seeing devastating effects, including sea-level rise, coastal erosion, droughts and hotter annual temperatures. A department of the Princess Margaret hospital in the capital of Funafuti has been devoted to climate change-related illnesses, which have risen in the last decade, according to hospital figures. Locals complain that the increasing temperatures are becoming “unbearable”, and acting chief of public health Suria Eusala Paufolau says incidents of heat rash, heat stroke and dehydration are intensifying. As locals do their best to cope by avoiding the sun when they can and wearing long, protective clothing, one of the western world’s most basic defences against sun exposure is completely unavailable – sunscreen. Sunscreen was absent from every shop and supermarket in the capital of Funafuti when the Guardian visited in March. Meanwhile, products such as feminine hygiene wash, hair dye and baby cologne were widely available. “We don’t have sunscreen,” says one shop owner. “We’ve never had sunscreen.” Tuvaluans – especially women – say their only option for acquiring sunscreen is to purchase it from neighbouring Fiji – an expensive, two-and-a-half-hour flight away. Half a dozen local women questioned in the town square of Funafuti said if sunscreen was available they would buy it, citing ageing skin as their primary concern. “I am only 32 but I look older, we can’t get sunscreen here, we can’t get anything to protect our skin,” says one local woman, a housewife and mother of five. “Do you have any, can I please have some?” According to the World Health Organization, shortages of many essential medicines are common in Tuvalu, and the country is one of the top importers of health supplies anywhere in the world, according to the BMJ. Associate Professor Tony Reeder from the Otago University School of Medicine in New Zealand is an expert in skin cancer prevention and says it is alarming that sunscreen is not available to Tuvaluans. “Not having access to sunscreen is quite critical, especially for people who are exposed to the sun for long periods of time,” says Reeder. “There are quite a few barriers to the use of sunscreen because it is often seen as a western product, and it can be prohibitively expensive.” Reeder says subsidising the cost of sunscreen is one option. “There are moves by some countries to reclassify sunscreen as a pharmaceutical protective product. Polynesians need sun protection as well, sun damage has been recorded among Africans with black skin. So all types of skin can be damaged from exposure to the sun.” More pressing health concerns are the most likely reason sunscreen has been overlooked in Tuvalu, Reeder says. A 2015 study of skin disorders in Tuvalu conducted by Taiwanese dermatologists – the first ever undertaken – concluded “there is a distinct lack of knowledge on the prevalence of skin disorders in Tuvalu”. Elsewhere in the Pacific where sunscreen is widely available, some countries such as Palau and Hawaii have introduced a ban on the product, because some chemicals in sunscreens have been linked to deterioration of coral reefs."
"Labour have announced plans to fit solar panels to 1.75m homes lived in by socially housed or low-income households as part of its promised “green industrial revolution” to try to combat climate change and boost jobs. The programme is due to be announced by Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, at an event in Yorkshire on Thursday. It would involve solar panels being fitted to a million social homes as part of scheduled updates to social housing. Labour said this would provide enough power to give them free energy, saving an average of £117 a year on bills. Any spare power would be put into the national grid. Another 750,000 low-income households would have the chance to have the panels fitted through interest-free loans or grants. The partyestimated the policy would create 16,900 jobs and save 7.1m tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to taking 4m cars off the roads. It comes after Labour’s pledge in February to introduce a wider set of policies to simultaneously tackle the climate crisis and create large numbers of high-skilled jobs in the green economy. The idea echoes the green new deal proposed by leftwing Democrats in the US, and proposals put forward by the Green party in the UK. As part of the Labour plan, the party has committed to making sure at least 60% of the UK’s electricity and heat comes from renewable sources by 2030. The plan will involve what Labour calls a “just transition”, allowing people currently working in carbon-emitting industries to move into skilled green jobs. Corbyn said: “In this country, too often people are made to feel like the cost of saving the planet falls on them. Too many think of green measures as just another way for companies or the government to get money out of them, while the rich fly about in private jets and heat their empty mansions.” He claimed Labour’s green industrial revolution “will benefit working-class people with cheaper energy bills, more rewarding well-paid jobs and new industries to revive the parts of our country that have been held back for far too long”. Corbyn added: “By focusing on low-income households we will reduce fuel poverty and increase support for renewable energy. Social justice and climate justice as one. Environmental destruction and inequality not only can, but must be tackled at the same time.”"
"John Oliver has turned his focus to climate change in an urgent new episode of Last Week Tonight, referring to the situation as “critical”.   Oliver started his monologue by poking fun at the recycling ideas people present when it comes to saving the planet but then quickly took a serious turn. “These days, we’re inundated with new terrifying headlines on a regular basis,” he told his audience, citing the UN landmark study which stated that if carbon emissions remained steady, catastrophic environmental events will not only be inevitable but also more frequent. Oliver then narrowed his scope to dissect the Green New Deal, the non-binding resolution put forth by Congress newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “If you know nothing else about the Green New Deal, you now know that’s everyone’s talking about it and it was booed at a Trump rally, therefore it is a. famous and b. probably good.” He also mentioned that the Senate voted the Green New Deal down six weeks ago but that it is still at the forefront because of the bad press surrounding it, mostly from Republicans and conservative media. Conservative media have attacked the Green New Deal, claiming it wants to eliminate cows and airplane travel. Oliver clarified that these ideas do not appear in the brief legislation: “The whole Green New Deal is just 14 pages long. That is seven pages shorter than the menu for the Cheesecake Factory.” What the Green New Deal does do, however, is set out aggressive goals such as achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, meeting 100% of the country’s power demand through renewable energy, and creating millions of new jobs. Conservatives have been attacking it because of jokes put forth in an early press release, a mistake acknowledged by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Even so, Oliver corrected the idea of where cow methane comes from: “Most cow methane comes from them belching, not farting, and if you only remember one fact from tonight’s show, please don’t let it be that one.” Although there are many solutions to the problem of climate change, Oliver chose to focus on carbon pricing to let his audience “watch the rerun of Game of Thrones, so that you can see what garbage from craft services they’ve hidden as an Easter egg this week!” The host tried to impress upon his audience the severity of carbon: “The current situation of carbon is critical. Carbon emissions are, by far, the largest source of greenhouse gases. Yet, right now, it’s basically free to pollute the air with carbon dioxide …” He then noted this was strange: “We’ve universally agreed that polluting is bad and yet, it’s free to do it. When you litter, you pay a fine. When you drive above the speed limit, you pay a fine. When you steal 400 hamsters from PetSmart, tie them to a sled and race through the streets on a hamster sleigh, you pay a fine. Is that fine worth it? Of course it is! But you do pay it!” Oliver the discussed two ways that carbon pricing could be introduced: cap and trade or carbon tax. For the latter, “the problem there is mostly the word tax which has become a dirty word in politics”. He chose Canada’s carbon tax rollout as an example, where the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, slipped and called it a tax to conservative boos from his parliament. “If you’re a politician, you just can’t say the word ‘tax’ in the same way that if you’re an actor, you can’t say the word ‘Macbeth’, and if you’re president of the United States, you can’t say the word ‘origins’,” said Oliver, poking fun at Trump’s difficulty with a simple word. In response to Trudeau’s ‘tax’ slip-up, one Canadian conservative came forth with poetic rebuttal, in an attempt to repudiate the pricing, to which Oliver deadpanned: “Fire.” “Look, I don’t care where you stand on this issue, no one wants to hear a rhyme about carbon taxes from anybody, let alone some guy who looks like he got his entire wardrobe from Express John Oliver.” But he acknowledged the fight for carbon pricing was hard in Canada and in the United States, the last time it was on the table 10 years ago, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia took a rifle bullet to the legislation in a video. “That may seem idiotic to you because it is,” joked Oliver. “The Green New Deal has succeeded in getting people talking but that won’t mean anything unless that talk now turns to actions and putting a price on carbon could potentially be one of them, although, let me reiterate it will not be enough on its own by a long shot. We’re gonna need a lot of different policies working in tandem and we have to take action right now,” said Oliver."

So I’m a little late getting this out, and maybe this already got published at other sites in the meantime. Oh well, in any case, without further ado, here it is. Joe has got some questions.

How Do The AGW People Get Away With This?
by Joe Bastardi
A few graphics make the position of the AGW people completely absurd. It’s why I am so confident as to my position on this matter, and by the way it does have something to do with the weather because if you know where the weather has been, you have a better chance to know where it’s going.
Exhibit one, from my co-partner here at WeatherBell Joe D Aleo ( I wonder if we will share the same cell when the warmingistas come to get us. And will they let us have the same tattoo artist to brand us deniers?)

PDO and AMO are strongly correlated to the earths temps…now watch CO2 vs temps over the past century:

Even more damming than this, look at the past 10 years:

//-->




Or the last 15 years:

Which leads to the question: How do these people have any credibility? How do they get away with this?  It’s mind boggling that its gotten to a point where the EPA is dictating policy based on what is an obvious fraud, or if you want to be gentle about it, creates enough doubt to back off.
Here is something to consider.
Over a year ago I advised a client of mine at the time to purchase less air conditioners than for  2010 because the summer of 2011 would be cooler than the summer of 2010. Now there is talk that this is going to turn out like last summer, but assuming it won’t, the forecast was made. BEFORE LAST SUMMER. The client had to put in their order for air conditioners a year beforehand because they were ordering them FROM CHINA.
Now every red blooded American gets up in arms because all those jobs should be here in USA, right?  But why aren’t they? Well  in large part because of policy that is based on absurdities like this, a factory making anything here is now being clamped down on by the EPA so hard, so why bother? Its like Obama said:  ” So, if somebody wants to  build a coal plant, they can, it’s just that it will bankrupt them because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that will get emitted”.
That is a direct quote and is like his energy Sec saying that they seek to take away choices that people waste their money on. Astounding that things like that are being pushed by people in control,  or that they even got control in the first place. That is our fault, based on what is obviously flat out nonsense. But combine that with labor costs, and the fact the that the corporate tax rate in the US is higher than China, which few people in our nation seem to get, and this is what happens.
Now let’s say we wanted to make sure that a person here working in an air conditioner factory can make a decent wage from a helping hand ( how do like my populist line…from the Ghost of Tom Joad?)  Well, get rid of the EPA  running roughshod over factory owners, and lower the corporate tax rate to below China’s  ( it is so hard to believe that Chinese tax rates are lower) and you will find that companies will stay here and pay a decent wage to build air conditioners, But not if you are clamping down on people based on questionable, don’t-have-a-leg-to-stand-on ideas about co2 warming the planet.
Again, it defies logic as to how they got to where they did with this issue, and the facts are there for all to see.

"One spring morning in 2014, before breakfast or even coffee, John All, 49, a Mount Everest climber and then a professor at Western Kentucky University, was walking near his tent on a remote Himalayan peak in Nepal called Himlung when he broke through a thin layer of snow and clattered 70ft down a crevasse. He would have kept falling, almost certainly to his death, were it not for a small ice shelf spanning the fissure, upon which he miraculously, if painfully, landed. Stunned and injured – it turned out he’d broken 15 bones, dislocated his shoulder, and was bleeding internally – All gathered himself in the icy crypt and then, like any good scientist, began to document the ordeal. He thought of his teammates on the mountain, his students back at school, his mother at home in Georgia. They would want to know what had happened to him should he not make it, which seemed likely. The trip had been fraught since the beginning. The five-member team’s initial expedition to Everest had come to an abrupt end when a massive avalanche struck the Khumbu icefall and base camp, killing 16 Sherpas, including one from All’s team. After much deliberation, they re-routed to Himlung, about 160 miles west of Everest. But his teammates were struggling with altitude and fatigue and had descended lower, leaving All by himself at Camp II, on a small snowfield at nearly 20,000ft. Now here he was in the crevasse, peering at a pinhole of sunlight far above. Using his one functioning arm, All fished his Sony Cyber-shot HX7 camera from his jacket pocket and aimed it at himself. “Well,” he said, his face speckled with blood, “I’m pretty well fucked.” All’s teammates had descended to base camp, at least a day away. He would freeze to death before anyone could reach him, even if he had some way to contact them. (All had brought a satellite phone to the camp, but it was in his tent.) Despite his injuries, and the vertical walls of blue ice surrounding him, he would have to try to extract himself. For the next four hours, All wormed and squirmed his way toward the surface, wedging himself between the walls, chimneying diagonally toward the surface. He hacked one ice ax ahead, then stabbed his cramponed feet upward, moving inches at a time. The pain was searing, causing him to stop often, hyperventilating, trying not to pass out. During breaks he would film himself, noting his progress. Improbably, he reached the top and punched through the snow, flopping into the horizontal world, the late-afternoon sky brilliant and blue in the thin air. It took him another two hours to crawl to his tent, where he managed to send a text message from his satellite phone, programmed to post automatically to the American Climber Science Program’s Facebook page: “Please call Global Rescue. John broken arm, ribs, internal bleeding. Fell 70 ft crevasse. Climbed out. Himlung Camp 2,” he typed. “Please hurry.” Group members promptly called to launch a rescue. By the next day, he was at Norvic international hospital in Kathmandu, having been plucked from the mountain by helicopter, itself a dicey operation at such extreme altitude. While recovering in the hospital, All uploaded an edited version of his crevasse videos to YouTube, where they quickly went viral. The survival story drew comparisons to Aron Ralston’s in 127 Hours and the Everest classic Into Thin Air. All would go on to write his own book, Icefall: Adventures at the Wild Edges of our Dangerous, Changing Planet. This April, All returned to the Himalayas for the first time since his accident, bound for Everest. His life has changed considerably since his last visit, but his mission is much the same as it was in 2014: leading a team of scientists into the mountain range, two of whom will ascend Everest, while three others, including All, will attempt Everest’s 27,940ft next-door neighbor, Lhotse. The team will gather bits of snow and ice along the way, each sample another data point in the growing story of climate change. The data is intended to shed an increasingly bright light on a complex science – particularly the impact of pollution and dust in high-alpine terrain, what it says about global warming, and how that is affecting water resources stored in big mountains as glacial ice. Black carbon, a sooty residue from coal-fired power plants and other fossil-fuel-burning sources, gathers easily on snowy slopes, accelerating warming and melting. “The Himalayas are the water supply to a billion people,” All told me recently. “What happens to these glaciers over the next couple of decades is going to have a huge impact.” Before people climbed for (type-two) fun, they climbed for science. The first ascent of 15,777ft Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps, was pulled off in 1786 by two Frenchmen, Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard, largely because the pre-eminent Swiss geologist Horace Bénédict de Saussure, who was also a climber, had offered up prize money to the first people to reach the summit. Saussure was obsessed with mountains as a focus of his research; he believed they held the key to understanding the Earth. These initial summits – Saussure himself was the third person to ascend Mont Blanc, the following year – are widely considered to be the dawn of modern mountaineering. Few carry Saussure’s torch these days like John All. He, too, became fascinated with mountains and the stories they could tell about the natural world. Raised in Georgia, he made a false career start as an environmental lawyer before pivoting to science in the mid-90s. He moved to Tucson, Arizona, to pursue a PhD in renewable natural resources at the University of Arizona, where he hiked, climbed, and volunteered with search and rescue teams. His jones for mountaineering continued to expand, and in 2010, while spending a year in Nepal as a Fulbright scholar, he summited Everest via the North Col, in Tibet. As All’s life as a scientist grew and intensified, so did his adventures. He was held at gunpoint by marijuana farmers in Mexico and nearly mauled by a hyena on the African veldt. He traveled to South America and pulled off perilous ascents in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca, conducting climate research all along. At six foot five, with long blond hair, blue eyes, and a charming hint of southern drawl, his exploits weren’t devoid of romance; as Icefall mentions, various girlfriends joined him in the field. During one early trip, his partner at the time proposed to him after their car got stuck, stranding them in the desert. He said yes. (They had a son, Nathaniel, now 14, but the marriage didn’t last.) If you’re thinking that All sounds like the Indiana Jones of climate science, you wouldn’t be far off – though the reality is less glamorous than the Hollywood version. All’s journey back to Nepal’s high peaks has been long and arduous. Despite the modest celebrity he attained in the months after his accident, away from the cameras and reporters, he gulped painkillers to help his body remember how to move again; the narcotics erased entire swaths of memory, and he couldn’t work or do much of anything. In the fog of his debilitation, a serious recent girlfriend left him for someone else. “I was supposed to be this active, lively, adventure guy,” All said, “and I was just this broken-down dude on the couch.” All eventually got back on his feet, but after the difficult year-long recovery, he needed a reboot. In 2016, he left his teaching job in Kentucky for a full professor position at Western Washington University. At his new gig in Bellingham, All founded the Mountain Environments Research Institute. The organization would help formalize and institutionalize scientific expeditions to study climate change at high altitude. The team in Nepal includes two geology students from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, who will return to school when the team heads up to Everest. The Everest climbing squad includes Morgan Scott, a grad student at WWU, and James Holmes, from New York, treasurer for the American Climber Science Program, a Colorado-based not-for-profit organization that helps support science-based climbing trips. (All is its co-founder and executive director.) Joining All on Lhotse – the climbs share the same route until about 25,250ft – are Chris Dunn, a PhD student at the University of Colorado, and Graham Vickowski, a paramedic from Washington DC. The science program is twofold: during the approach to Everest, the team will collect plant data from more than 850 locations, repeating a study All directed in 2009. Higher on the mountain, they’ll gather glacier samples of snow, ice, and rock in order to analyze deposits of dust and black carbon. The glaciers play a vital role in what’s known as the planet’s albedo, the reflectivity of the earth’s surface. The more pollutants and dust that cover a glacier, the less reflective it becomes, absorbing solar energy and creating a feedback loop that gradually raises temperatures, accelerating glacial melt and recession. A 2019 report titled The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment noted that by 2100, temperatures in the northwest Himalayas are expected to have risen nearly 50% faster than the global average. Another study, from 2013, indicated that glaciers around Everest have shrunk by 13% since the 1960s, and the rate is increasing. Some scientists predict that at least one-third of glaciers in the Himalayas will be gone by the end of the century. Because the range is sandwiched between China and India, All hopes it’s possible to distinguish the source of various pollutants, and, in turn, influence conservation efforts in the planet’s two largest countries. The team arrived in advance base camp (ABC) on 16 April and began sorties above camp. Its summit attempts will take place this month, when appropriate weather windows open up and the team is rested and ready. Meanwhile, conditions appear to be quiet and stable on the mountain. They are, however, as All recently recounted on the team’s blog, quite warm. “The morning is clear and bright and the sun beats us unmercifully,” he wrote. “Hats, sunscreen, long sleeves, sunglasses, and lip balm. The snow melts more and more quickly.” This story was originally published by Outside, the leading publication for those who love the outdoors"
"A few days before the United Nations released a report warning that 1 million species, including 40% of all amphibians, could become extinct within decades, staff from Melbourne zoo were nursing chilled containers of frogs’ eggs to be taken to remote areas of sphagnum bog in the Mt Kosciuszko national park. The containers held 1,673 fertilised eggs of the critically endangered southern corroboree frog, a species near the top of Australia’s extinction watchlist. The eggs were packed into sphagnum moss for transport. Half were placed in one of 22 special disease-free areas that had been cleared of chytrid fungus, which is responsible for wiping out much of the wild population. The other half were placed in protected tubs in the wild, out of which the tadpoles will be able to climb once the eggs metamorphose. That will not happen until spring. The tadpoles, which come out of their eggs as soon as they are released into the water, will spend the cold winter months nestled into the moss beneath a layer of snow and ice. It has been a record breeding season for the zoo, and the largest release of eggs since the program began in 2001. In collaboration with Sydney’s Taronga zoo and Healesville sanctuary about 3,000 southern corroboree frogs have been released this year. Melbourne zoo has a breeding population of about 50 male frogs and 70 females, the oldest of which was captured as a tadpole in Kosciusko in 1999. For the past several weeks of the breeding season, carers at the zoo have been gathering the clear eggs and chilling them to slow down their development so they can be released together. “We use the sophisticated equipment of a wine chiller to keep them at a temperature of 8C,” the amphibian supervisor Damian Goodall says. “It’s a lot easier to transport them as eggs than as tadpoles.” Tadpoles, he says, need to be “carried in bags, like fish” which is not conducive to either bumpy 4WD travel or being dropped via helicopter. The release into the water mimics the natural process of water rising in the bogs at the end of summer, Goodall says, so the eggs often begin to hatch as soon as they are released. Conservationists who monitor the site in spring say they have heard the calls of male corroboree frogs in areas where the tadpoles had been released, and which had been bare of wild frogs for years. “If we weren’t doing any of these releases, pretty much this species would be extinct, because a lot of the more crowded sites where there used to be huge communities now don’t have any males calling,” Goodall says. He says the wild population of the southern corroboree frog, the closely related northern corroboree frog and the Baw Baw frog plummeted following bushfires about 15 years ago that burned out their habitat. All three critically endangered species were then crowded out of their traditional habitat by the smooth toadlet, an abundant native species that carries the deadly chytrid fungus. The three frog species are on a list of 21 priority native species for Zoos Victoria, 16 of which are subject to a captive breeding program. All but four are Victorian natives; the others are priority national species such as the Tasmanian devil and Lord Howe Island phasmid. Dr Marissa Parrott, a reproductive biologist, says Zoos Victoria has made a commitment that no Victorian terrestrial vertebrates will go extinct on its watch. “The UN report is terrifying but it’s not going to change what we are doing because we are already there,” Parrott says. “We already know how bad the situation is and we are already fighting extinction for these species that are on the brink.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the book out 6 days, parts of the the German mainstream media and green activists are finding the the whole affair really tough to digest. Some of the reactions have been downright nasty and Medieval.
The left wing German online TAZ here has a weekend article called “Climate Skeptics Are Like Viruses“, which looks at the controversy swirling about Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s new skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne“.
TAZ’s message is clear: In climate science, scientific scrutiny and enquiry are mental disorders coming from viruses. We all know what needs to be done with viruses.
IPCC lead author: skeptics no longer need to be heard!
In the TAZ piece, IPCC lead author Petra Döll is quoted as saying that skeptics don’t need to be heard. Lüning and Vahrenholt respond at their Die kalte Sonne site:
The attitude of refusal by the IPCC with respect to open scientific discussion and debate is now conspicuous. This is demomstrated by IPCC lead author Dr. Petra Döll in the German online taz in claiming that “climate skeptics” no longer need to be heard. Indeed it is questionable just how long this weird scientific approach can be maintained. Should we not expect a professional demeanor from scientists who are paid and supported by German tax revenue? Döll’s dubious reasoning: The climate skeptics ”just keep repeating the same arguments”.  Could it be that the so-called climate skeptics are forced to keep repeating because the current climate science establishment has yet to provide a satisfactory answer? There’s a lot that indicates this is the case. An assessment of the media one week after the launch of the book “Die kalte Sonne” has clearly shown: The media are relying on a hand-full of prominent experts whose arguments are showing to be everything but scientifically convincing. The statements of many experts and activist editors are characterized by misrepresentations, intentional omissions and errors.
Politicians have become aware of this problem. SPD socialist party Chairman writes in the the Sunday edition of the TAZ sonntaz that in all cases we have to hear the climate skeptics out, ‘and even if it is sometimes very difficult to do so.’ Perhaps he’s beginning to realize that something is amiss within the IPCC. Politicians have blindly relied on the IPCC for too long. Whatever the IPCC said, was law. When one considers how high the stakes really are in the climate debate, then one has to conclude that an independent review of the IPCC’s basic assumptions is essential, even just for the sake of transparency reasons. To avoid conflicts of interest, such a review should be conducted by neutral parties who are not involved in the climate debate. Of course this should be done by scientists, but the more they are from outside of climate science, the better. Climate science is not rocket science. An independent review by a commission is possible with independent scientists. In the event members come from a large research facility, then it must be assured that there is no sister institute that is dependent on climate science funding. The most important tool of such a commission is natural science common sense, which has been increasingly missing in the climate sciences over the last years.”

That’s a reasonable response. A commission to conduct a review of the IPCC is long overdue, as it is well-documented that the IPCC house is a mess.
But scrutinizing science is mentally ill – the TAZ wants to tell us
There’s another part of the TAZ report, which Lüning and Vahrenolt did not respond to (probably because of its sheer absurdity). Here’s what the end-of-the-world-obsessed TAZ adds:
Also psychologist Marius Raab asks that climate skeptics be listened to. Their ‘house of thoughts’ in the end fulfill many criteria for conspiracy theories, which Raab studies at the University of Bamberg. ‘A conspiracy theory is foremost a good story,’ he wrote to the sonntaz, “in structure and argumentation it is especially compelling and holds the invitation to get involved and thus to spread the word. Argumentation is one-sided, not scientific.'”
Reminds me of the old Soviet tactic of admitting political opponents to mental institutions in order to eliminate them. With the TAZ’s “virus” remark and adding the comments from shrink Raab, it’s clear that the TAZ has no interest in arguing the science and is perfectly content to engage in gutter journalism.
Finally, here’s an objective radio report (in German) Inforadio rbb on the book “Die kalte Sonne” .

"Jonathan Freedland (The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple, 11 May) refers to the urgency of climate change and points out, correctly, that this situation “cries out for cooperation with our neighbours”. But his logic is adrift when he links this with his wish for continued British membership of the EU. Firstly, such cooperation could happen via one of the other Europe-wide bodies of which the UK is a member, or via an intergovernmental group specific to that problem; there is no need for it to happen through the EU specifically or any such top-down supranational body.  Secondly, some of the EU’s core policies, such as economic growth and expanded continent-wide trading, are simply incompatible with what’s needed to stop the destruction of our ecosystem. There’s nothing inconsistent about supporting more urgent cooperation between neighbouring countries while opposing the principles and the policies of the EU – which is merely one particular political manifestation of such cooperative ideals, and a rather misguided one at that.Albert BealeLondon • Overfishing and damaging catch methods are the greatest threats to our oceans, and I commend George Monbiot for highlighting the issue (How to halt the greatest threat to the oceans? Stop eating fish, 9 May). But I disagree with his solutions. Up to 26m tonnes of fish caught annually are estimated to be illegal, unreported or unregulated. Bringing fisheries under sustainable management is essential to prevent the collapse of marine ecosystems. Governments have struggled to manage this global problem, but visit fisheryprogress.org and you will see how global fishing firms have worked with NGOs, regional authorities and vessel owners to establish regulations. Seafood companies have the resources to get everyone around the table to spur improvements. With their purchasing power, they can drive compliance with regulations. These rules not only support the recovery of overfished species, but also, as Monbiot notes, will ensure we have a healthy supply of seafood for generations to come.Darian McBainGlobal director of corporate affairs and sustainability, Thai Union • George Monbiot asserts that “even inshore fisheries are disastrously managed, through a combination of lax rules and a catastrophic failure to enforce them”. Inshore fisheries (0-6 nautical miles) are managed by 10 Inshore Fisheries & Conservation Authorities (Ifcas). Devon & Severn Ifca has an enforcement team and vessels fitted with forward-looking infrared cameras for distant observation. It has pioneered an inshore vessel monitoring system, mandatory for trawlers and scallop dredgers in our district. Between 2016 and 2018, Devon & Severn Ifca investigated 96 enforcement cases, and issued 28 warnings, three cautions and 25 penalties totalling £20,000. Fourteen cases were prosecuted, eight of which received fines of over £93,000. It has pioneered a system of permitting bylaws, allowing the management of trawling, netting, potting and diving for shellfish through 253 new measures.  The work done by Dorset & Severn Ifca shows that disastrous management and catastrophic failure of enforcement is not endemic. Prof Michael WilliamsDeputy chair, Devon & Severn Ifca • I was disappointed to see no coverage of the Mothers Rise Up climate march held in London on Sunday. It did not have any headline-grabbing civil disobedience or arrests, nor a well-known figurehead. But thousands of families came out in great numbers from across the UK, many with young children in tow, and marched, closing central London streets from Hyde Park to Parliament Square for a number of hours. There was a diverse range of speakers touching on pollution, worldwide women’s leadership in environmental movements and the shared weight of responsibility we hold.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNews magazine Stern here reports on the shocking woes of German flagship public television networks ARD and ZDF (Germany’s versions of the Beeb).Hat-tip reader DirkH
Face it, they’ve been spoiled over the decades by cushy, protected conditions and have grown arrogant – so much so that they feel it is their duty to politically upbring viewers. Call it unfair and unbalanced television in almost every respect.
It was just the other day that I happened to watch the evening news on ARD the first time in about 3 years. And I decided it will probably be another 3 years before I watch it again. I haven’t seen the lovely Mariette Slomka on ZDF in over 5 years. I just can’t take these people anymore.
So with the haughty, orthodox-green public networks profusely bleeding red, the private ones like RTL are left to plunder the spoils of the ratings war. Unless you live in Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela, privately run and financed TV is the trend.
How bad is it for ARD and ZDF? According to Stern:
Even more dismal are the numbers for the segment of 14 to 49-year olds: Here ARD and ZDF rank only in 5th and 6th behind RTL, ProSieben, Sat.1 and Vox. Should this trend continue, public television will stop playing any role in the future.”

Why the fall? Like anything that gets royally subsidized up the wazoo, it’s just a matter of time before the organization gets old, crusty, and uncreative. Like a fat cat on a cold rainy day, the management settles comfortably down onto its warm cushion for a long peaceful slumber. While the rest of the free market innovates and creates, the public networks eventually wake up and wonder what happened.
So, what will the public networks do now that they are forced to face the horrors of the free market? The first solution of course will be to first deny reality, and to make demands for more money in the form of higher mandatory, much-hated GEZ fees that citizens are all forced to cough up. “We just need a little more money to improve the quality,” they’ll insist.
Their hemorrhaging is both wonderful and bad. Bad because we’ll likely have to pay higher fees.
And they’ll probably start a massive media campaign to remind public how great they are, and that viewers really ought to come back. For example, this is already happening on NDR public radio.
What are the chances of a private network like Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News getting a foothold in Germany? Are you crazy! Oh horrors! A Fox News Deutschland would be 10 times worse than any Fukushima. The last thing the old media guard is interested in is “fair and balanced”, let alone an alley cat like Fox News.
Readers, how is public TV faring in your country?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith great sadness Der Spiegel reports here reports that a 17-year old Briton was killed by a polar bear attack on the island of Spitzbergen in the Arctic. Also another 16 year old and a 17 year old were injured, and 2 group leaders age 27 and 29 years respectively. The victims were part of an expedition organised by the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES).
According to a BSES press release, the tragic death earlier this morning involved one of the members of its expeditions in Svalbard. In addition to his death, four other members of the expedition sustained injuries, two of them severe. They were evacuated to Tromsø hospital. No other members of the expedition were injured.
Der Spiegel writes:
The office of the island’s Governor explained that the polar bear’s attack occurred near the Von-Post glacier. The group had 13 participants and had set up a camp of tents located 40 km from Longyearbyen when the polar bear attacked in the morning. ‘The bear attacked the people inside their tents,’ said police chief Erik Nygaard, according to NTB-information.”
According to Der Spiegel, the island is inhabited by about 2500 people and 3000 polar bears.
The BSES is a non-profit UK-based youth development charity. Founded in 1932 by the late Surgeon Commander G Murray Levick, a member of Scott’s final Antarctic Expedition of 1910-13. BSES is one of the longest running organisations of its type.
Polar bear kills are treated like potential murders
Expeditions are normally provided with firearms for protection. But as Der Spiegel reports, shooting a polar bear is legally risky – no joke:

If a polar bear is killed on the archipelago, then it automatically leads to a trial. In this case the authorities assume the role of defence attorney for the dead bear.”
So who is going to want to shoot?
Who knows, maybe all the tenderheartedness and sympathy that had developed for polar bears over the years in their bogus climate-caused plight may have contributed to the death of the young man. Let’s all be nice to Mr. Polar Bear. The combination of getting too close and not taking the threat from the seemingly cuddly animals could have led to the group putting it guard down. This is pure speculation on my part, of course. Surely the authorities will conduct an intense investigation.
The BSES website explains its primary purpose:
Based at the Royal Geographical Society, BSES provides opportunities for young people of all abilities between the ages of 16 and 23 to take part in adventurous exploration that involves scientific research in wilderness areas. The expeditions can last for several months and the location tends to be different each year but could be anywhere from the Arctic to the Himalayas. The aim of BSES is to help the personal development of young people, through the challenge of living and working in remote and demanding areas of the world.”
The online UK Telegraph shows that close encounters with polar bears are not unusual and have occurred in the past. A disaster has probably been long in the works. Click here to see an incident that involved a BSES Expedition and a polar bear in 2006.
Finally, again speculation, the relatively youthful age of the expedition leaders also indicates to me that the group may not have had the experience needed to properly judge the risks and dangers involved. There are going to be lots of really tough questions in the days and weeks ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNatural Cycles
by Ed Caryl
Solar and ocean cycles indicate that cooling times lay ahead over the coming decades.
One argument against the CAGW hypothesis is the influence of natural cycles controlling weather and climate. In nature, there are many phenomena that are cyclic.

Figure 1. This is solar cycle variation 1975 to 2005, the recent solar maximum. Source: Wikimedia Commons.
The sunspot cycles are particularly obvious. Do these cycles influence the earth’s climate? Here is a table of documented cycles. They range from the shortest cycle found in sunspot numbers, 3.7 years, to the ice-age repeat-time of 100,000 years.

Table 1. This is a list of known cycles and data sources. The links are to the source documents. The background colors suggest related cycles.
The problem with pinning down the exact lengths and relationships of these cycles are two-fold. First, the signal is noisy…very noisy. Some of the noise is due to measurement inaccuracy, and some due to the fact that the real signal is noisy and chaotic. Second, there is modulation present on the signals; they vary a great deal in frequency and amplitude. Some of the modulation is regular, producing predictable effects on the main frequency (the “side-bands” noted in Table 1), and some is noisy and unpredictable.
The sunspot Schwabe cycle varies from 8 to 14 years. The thousand-year long cycles also vary by hundreds of years. But there are still patterns one can see in the lengths. The 3.7-year cycle is one-third of the 11.1-year Schwabe cycle. The 22-year Hale cycle is two Schwabe cycles. The wet/dry cycles observed in the western U. S. and other places are one Schwabe cycle or two Hale cycles. The AMO is three Hale cycles. The Gleissberg cycle is four Hale cycles. These are all related to the sun’s magnetic cycles.
The longer period cycles are also sun cycles; the periodicity is reflected in carbon-14 and other isotopes detected in ice cores, tree rings, and other sources. The primary periods seem to be 210, 420, 710, 1500, and 2200 years, with variation around each of those lengths caused by frequency and amplitude modulation, the shape of the waveform, and “beats” with the Hale cycle. (When you mix two frequencies you get third and fourth frequencies that are frequency 1 minus frequency two and frequency 1 plus frequency two). The Suess/deVries cycle is the spacing between the various named solar minimums: Dalton, Maunder, Sporer, etc. The longer 420-year cycle is twice the 210-year cycle. The 710-year cycle is a half-D-O/Bond event cycle and one-third the Hallstatt cycle.

Do we see these cycles in climate? Yes, of course. As mentioned above, wet/dry cycles, the AMO, and the cooling during solar minimums, are well known. The 200-year cycle discussed in the Lui et al paper, and here, is seen from Tibet to Antarctica. The D-O and Bond event cycles are climate-warming cycles that occur during ice ages and in interglacial times like the present. S. Fred Singer thinks that the recent warming was a Bond event. So does the Chiefio. So does this author. But the warming is over. Vahrenholt is correct, though he may have not gone far enough in his predictions.
Can predictions be made? Where are we in these on-going cycles? Nicola Scafetta uses the cycles from the 20 – 22-year Hale cycle and the 60 to 66-year AMO cycle to predict
much less warming in this century that the IPCC predicts. Dr. Scafetta makes passing mention of the longer cycles but does not factor them into his prediction. We are 210 years from the Dalton minimum of the early 19th century, and 400 years from the Maunder minimum. We are due.
Predictions for solar cycle 25 have it at Maunder minimum levels with a sunspot count under 10. This is a Grand Minimum. The solar cycle length is also getting longer. There seems to be a relationship between solar cycle length, sunspot number, and global temperature. If this relationship holds, we will see cooling of 0.5°C or more in the coming
decades.
This cooling has already begun in the Atlantic Arctic and interior continental areas. See Temperature History – Part 2 and BEST Fails to Account…, Figure 10.
Habibullo I. Abdussamatov of the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia predicts a reduction in Total Solar Irradience (TSI) of 0.5% by the mid-21 st century and another Little Ice Age lasting until 2100. S. Duhau and C. de Jager of the University of Buenos Aires and the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, respectively, also forecast a Grand
Minimum in exactly the same time frame and “of the long type”.
Matthew Penn and William Livingston say that sunspots will disappear completely by 2016 to 2022, due to the magnetic fields reducing to a point to low to reveal them.
Counting Vahrenholt and Lüning, the above are seven predictions by seven different methods. All predict cooling in the coming years.
Some of the temperature trend predictions are for cooling to begin in 2014. After examining many temperature records all over the world, I believe that the cooling has already begun.

Figure 2. This is the annual global temperature trend for 2010 to 2011, Note in the upper right corner a figure indicating a global cooling of 0.12°C. Source GISS.
Figure 2 shows a global cooling year over year for last year of 0.12°C. Much of that is Canadian Arctic, Southern Russia, Africa, South Asia, Oceana, and the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Arctic Ocean has yet to accumulate ice to cool Northern Siberia late in the melt season, so that region still shows warm. This will soon change. Next year the cold will come to Europe and Russia earlier because there will be more and earlier ice in the Arctic Ocean. This will become more pronounced in future years. Don’t sell your thermal underwear!

Not again! Early forecasts point to another cold winter for Europe. (Photo credit: NOAA)
I’ve found some early winter prognoses of what Central Europe and Germany. I used to rely on Joe Bastardi for the euro winter forecasts, and he had a habit of being  correct. But he’s busy with his new Weatherbell now, and I’m not aware of him making euro-forecasts.
So I’ve had to look at other sources, and so far preliminary forecasts are signaling a snowy and cold Central European winter.
killikus.de here makes a comprehensive analysis for central Europe (in German) and presents its prognosis in its introductory box:
Prognosis for the winter weather and Christmas weather for Winter 2011/2012
Snow and water without end! Winter 2011/12 will be wetter than summer 2011.”
Killikus.de writes that the North Atlantic stream assured us warm and mild winters over the last decades, but since 2008 that situation has changed.
So since the year 2008 it is increasingly colder in the winter months and also wetter. As it appears now, the cold wet climate will pick up in the coming winter months.”
That means we ought to think about having snow shovels and road salt ready. And don’t put off the winter tyres. Killikus.de also cites an old North German farmer’s rule:

‘There are always 7 fat years that get followed by 7 lean years.’ The 7 fat years ended on 31 December 2008, and so ‘the 7 lean years will end on 31 December 2015’.  Until then, expect lots of rain and very cold winters.”
Killikus.de then explains how this is due to natural variations in northern hemisphere.
wetterprognose-wettervorhersage.de writes that the period September-November will be too cold and at times “considerably too cold”, and adds that eastern Europe and Scandinavia will lack precipitation. For the winter months of December – February:
…Eastern and Northern Europe will be significantly too cold. In Germany the 2011/2012 winter prognosis today looks as follows: mainly normal, but with cold spilling in at times from the east or north – considerably too much precipitation in January and February, whereby January 2012 will be rated too cold (January is the coldest winter month). The probability for a normal to cold 2011/2012 winter is higher than a winter that will be too warm.”
www.duessel-wetter.de does not make a winter forecast, but offers a fall forecast. First it writes that things dont’t look good for late September: Hope for a nice late summer in the middle of September has significantly diminished.
Only southeastern Germany will temperatures get above average! Otherwise things don’t look at all good. It looks like so-so autumn weather.
For Germany that means cool and wet. Duessel-wetter.de’s autumn forecast calls for a 32% chance the fall will be cooler, 30% chance it will be around normal, and a 38% chance it will be too warm. It should be pointed out that 38% chance is very low in these global warming times. Often  in the past chances of a warmer-than-usual winter were pegged at 70% or 80%…because it was thought CO2 was such a dominant driver.
Finally the National Weather Service  chart also indicates to cold for Europe in the months ahead:

"Bill Nye is done messing around. Look out, because while you might not typically associate angry talk with the normally-mild-mannered “Science Guy” Nye, when it comes to the threat of global climate change, he has – understandably, perhaps – lost his patience. And how. The beloved science educator and television personality, best known for his children’s program Bill Nye the Science Guy, appeared on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver on Sunday in a segment on the plan to fight climate change, and started throwing the F-word about – a lot. (The plan is sponsored by the US House of Representatives’ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the longtime environmental advocate and Senator Ed Markey, and is known as the Green New Deal.) bill nye just grounded me and sent me to my room and i can’t come out until i make the planet stop melting pic.twitter.com/Uck1Qt2mau The non-binding resolution, as Oliver pointed out in the segment, has been especially polarizing, and is regularly ridiculed in bad faith by Republicans, despite the scale of the climate-based issues it merely suggests might be a good idea to address, such as carbon-pricing. In a short bit, Nye appears to explain why that concept might help. “When something costs more, people buy less of it,” Nye says in a makeshift science lab, cutting to the chase. He goes on to explain why burning less fuel in our cars or burning less coal might help prevent fires, floods, and crop failures. And then he says, because Oliver is a “42-year-old man who needs his attention sustained with tricks, here’s some fucking Mentos in a bottle of Diet Coke”, an experiment with mints and soda that appears to delight the host. After explaining the idea being carbon taxes, and the difficulty politicians have getting people to accept the idea of a new tax, Nye returns for another experiment to cut through all the talk. “By the end of this century, if emissions keep rising, the average temperature on Earth could go up another four to eight degrees,” Nye says, losing his patience. “What I’m saying is the planet is on fucking fire,” he says while taking a torch to a globe. “There are a lot of things we could do to put it out. Are any of them free? No, of course not. Nothing’s free, you idiots. Grow the fuck up. You’re not children any more. I didn’t mind explaining photosynthesis to you when you were 12. But you’re adults now, and this is an actual crisis, got it? Safety glasses off, motherfuckers.”"
"As global warming has worsened in recent years, environmentalists and union members have often protested against each other, whether over fracking, oil pipelines, coal production or the Green New Deal. But an innovative new labor-environmentalist effort in New York – to build offshore wind turbines to power up to 6m homes – is a sharp departure from all that feuding and shows that these two groups can work together to advance renewable energy and reduce dependence on carbon-based energy.  Giving this plan a vital boost, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has announced plans to have the state’s energy authority invest billions of dollars to build hundreds of offshore wind turbines. For Cuomo, this plan is key to New York state’s ambitious mandate to obtain 70% of its energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by 2030. Pushed by a professor at Cornell University, more than a dozen unions came together to develop what they call Climate Jobs New York, a plan that they say will create more than 10,000 jobs; jobs that they agree should be middle-class, union jobs. “We brought together more than a dozen unions, and said things are not good at the national level in terms of how unions are relating to environmental organizations and the climate movement,” said Lara Skinner, the labor relations professor at Cornell who spearheaded this effort. She noted that several unions were furious at environmentalists for opposing fracking and the Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines, which many unions viewed as a boon for job creation. “Climate change impacts working people,” Skinner added. “There are some major opportunities here for labor if we can get ahead of this thing. What we’ve done is a very investment-led strategy, a very jobs-led strategy.” The offshore wind turbines are at the heart of the climate plan the unions developed, but it also calls for installing more solar panels, improving and expanding mass transit and renovating buildings to make them more energy efficient. The unions’ plan talks repeatedly of a “just transition” so that workers who lose good-paying jobs when, for instance, coal-fired power plants close could be trained for good-paying new renewable energy jobs. “This is a very practical approach in that we’re not going to the extreme saying tomorrow there should be no fossil fuel. We understand that an immediate transition is not going to happen,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, a federation of construction unions. “We recognize that our climate is in danger and climate change is real. We’re certainly concerned about future generations.” In an unusual move, more than a dozen unions and labor federations developed the climate plan, without inviting environmental groups to participate in the early discussions. One fear was that if the two sides were together from the start, there might be fights over fracking and pipelines that blew up and prevented progress on other fronts. One union leader involved in the effort said: “The labor movement and environmental community agree on probably 90% of things, so we shouldn’t focus on the things that are going to destroy goodwill.” In the US at present, just 30 megawatts of energy are obtained from offshore wind – a wind farm with five turbines off Rhode Island. Cuomo plans to go far behind that, calling for New York to obtain 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind, 300 times what the US now obtains from that source. What Cuomo calls his Green New Deal calls for building hundreds of huge turbines about 15 miles off the Long Island and New Jersey coasts. As a first step, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has solicited bids for 800 megawatts of offshore wind. One bid calls for turbines that are 850ft tall, nearly three times the height of the Statue of Liberty, with blades that are as long as a football field. “Offshore wind is poised to be the next major clean energy resource for the United States,” said Alicia Barton, president of the energy development authority. The project will require welders, plumbers and pipefitters to install the turbines, carpenters and millwrights to build the foundations, utility workers to connect them to the power grid, painters to paint them to prevent rust and myriad construction workers to build a new seaport to handle the colossal turbine parts. New York officials have agreed all these workers will receive a prevailing wage, the amount paid to a majority of workers in their field in a particular region. The state also agreed to have project labor agreements for the turbine work before workers are hired that set the terms and conditions of employment and help avoid strikes. The construction unions that developed the plan included the electrical workers, laborers and operating engineers. “If we were going to reposition unions on the issue of climate change, we had to start with the unions that had traditional concerns about it,” Skinner said. “We’re trying to figure out how to reposition unions on this issue so they’re an engine to tackle the climate crisis.” Skinner said the New York effort could serve as a model for labor-environmentalist cooperation in other states. Among the other unions that have joined the New York effort were the Transport Workers Union, the New York State Nurses Association and large New York locals of the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. “I have been an advocate for 20 years, and this is one of my proudest moments,” said Lisa Dix, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in New York and has often clashed with unions. Dix worked with Skinner and the unions in finalizing their plan. “We have a huge opportunity ahead of us if we can focus on all the great things we’re going to do to build this economy together,” Dix said. She noted that 30 environmental groups have embraced and are pushing the Climate Jobs New York plan.  “This will be a huge economic driver,” said Doreen Harris, director of large-scale renewables for the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority. “We will see significant benefits coming to New York from these investments. A broad, new industry will be set up in the north-east with New York as a hub.”"
"Governments around the world must introduce carbon taxes, halt plans for new coal plants and accelerate the closure of existing ones if damage to the Pacific from climate change is to be limited, the UN secretary general has told Pacific leaders on his first visit to the region. Antonio Guterres met leaders of Pacific countries in Fiji, on a trip that will also see him visit Vanuatu, considered one of the countries most vulnerable to natural disasters due to climate change, and Tuvalu, which is at risk of sinking under rising waters.  Speaking after meetings in Suva on Wednesday, Guterres acknowledged the region was “on the frontline of climate change” and its people were “important allies in the fight against it”. “Here in the Pacific, sea-level rise in some countries is four times greater than the global average and is an existential threat to some island states,” he said. “My messages to governments around the world from the Pacific are clear: first, shift taxes from salaries to carbon. Tax pollution, not people. Second, stop subsidising fossil fuels. Taxpayer money should not be used to boost hurricanes, spread drought and heatwaves, melt glaciers, and bleach corals. Third, stop building new coal plants by 2020.” His comments came in the closing days of the Australian election campaign, where climate action is a key issue.  Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum told Guterres they were “running out of time” and asked him to share a message of urgency with the world, saying they were facing “an unprecedented global catastrophe”. “The blue Pacific – our great ocean continent, our thousands of islands, our strong and resilient people – is running out of time,” said forum leaders in a statement. “All countries, with no caveats, must agree to take decisive and transformative action to reduce global emissions ... If we do not, we will lose. We will lose our homes, our ways of life, our wellbeing and our livelihoods. We know this because we are experiencing loss already.” Guterres said climate change particularly affected women, offering the example of the effect of salinisation of food crops on pregnant women and newborn health, and said women needed to be involved in all decisions related to climate change. “There can be no successful response to a changing climate without also changing mindsets about the role of women in prevention and response,” he said. Dr Tess Newton Cain, a Pacific analyst and visiting fellow at the Australian National University, said this message was particularly important given there was only one national Pacific leader who was a woman – Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands. She also said Guterres’ visit was very timely in light of the climate summit in September and that Pacific voices should be key in shaping the agenda. “What I was particularly struck by was that he was at pains to flag very clearly that not only are Pacific countries on the frontlines when it comes to being victims of climate change impacts but more importantly they’re on the frontline when it comes to resilience and innovation and global leadership,” she said. “These are small countries that have really not allowed themselves to be seen as hapless victims but they have grasped opportunities to take things forward and lead by example, it’s very pleasing that the UN secretary general has acknowledged that.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe scene of the accident occurring earlier today looks as grisly as a war zone.
Motorists were blinded by a sandstorm on the A19 motorway near the German coastal port city of Rostock. In all, almost 50 cars were involved in the massive pile up, with 10 dead and almost 100 injured. 17 cars and three trucks caught fire.
The online Der Spiegel has a spectacular video here that gives you a good idea of the zero-visibility conditions drivers had to contend with – with little warning – causing them a nightmare. The online Bild daily also has a photo gallery here.
This is what a sandstorm can look like. This one in Iraq, from Wikipedia (Photo credit: US Marine Corps)
Though speed limits are being imposed increasingly on Germany’s famous autobahns, there are still many sections that have no speed limit. Cars traveling 120 miles per hour and more are not uncommon.
At the scene of this accident, that particular section of autobahn also had no speed limit, and high-speed drivers were caught by off guard as the sudden sandstorm cut visibility across the motorway to almost zero with little warning, causing drivers traveling in both directions to slam on the brakes and resulting in the deadly pile-up. Bild newspaper reports:
Cars crashed into other cars with such force that some were found 50 meters off the autobahn in a field. At this location on the autobahn there is no speed limit. But you could see the sand coming, it should have been possible to brake’, said truck drive [Ralf] Schulz.“
Der Spiegel says “an unusual weather phenomena is suspected to have triggered the chain of crashes”, saying that hurricane force winds whipped up the sand and formed tornado like conditions. But when one views the film footage, one sees that the dust cloud is no more than a few meters above the ground.
Actually, as reader Ron de Haan points out, this is a dust storm from plowed agricultural fields in the area. The German press though are calling it a sandstorm.

"For Britain’s major political parties Thursday’s local elections proved that every silver lining has a cloud. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party did not have a good night yet it was the Conservatives who faced the darkest and stormiest skies. The Liberal Democrats did well by comparison with the truly dreadful results they posted in 2015. But the biggest winners were the nation’s smallest parties. Independent councillors flourished and the political stalemate in Westminster found expression in the rise of local authorities where no party had overall control. If any one of the mainstream parties could say they won on Thursday it was the Greens, buoyed by the government’s public acceptance that their arguments about an impending climate emergency had won the day. The political arm of the environmental movement had its best night for years. Viewed through the most salient of national issues – Brexit – it would be easy to construct an analysis in which the voters had laid the blame at the feet of the two major Westminster parties either for failing to deliver on the results of referendum in 2016 or for failing to find a way to repudiate them. Both the Conservatives’ Theresa May and Labour’s Mr Corbyn recognised that this instant precis of events would be attractive and sought to defuse its allure by saying they will “sort out” Brexit. This is too roughly hewn an argument.  Local elections are often seen as a “real world” test of public opinion in the years between national elections, but their superficial similarities with national politics distort any analysis that does not pay proper attention to the more significant differences. This year’s local elections are no different. Thursday’s turnout is likely to be in step with previous local contests this decade where just a third of voters turned up. This one fact makes impossible a detailed read-through to a national election picture when two-thirds of the electorate cast their ballots. Although this week’s elections were held in 248 English councils, six mayoral districts and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland, none took place in Wales, Scotland and London. The elections on Thursday were a local affair: pavement issues make a real difference and voters tossed out administrations who just perform badly or were mired in scandal. Missing from the ballot paper were many of the new insurgents. In socially liberal pro-EU Britain, Liberal Democrats went unchallenged by the upstarts at Change UK. Meanwhile in Brexitland, a lifeless Ukip was the only option open for voters unhappy at the failure of the UK to depart from the EU. Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, which has captured the headlines and drawn large crowds, was not on the ballot – saving the Tories from an even greater embarrassment. Tory leave voters had nowhere to go. Things still look dismal for Mrs May. Her party’s projected vote share from the local elections has slipped behind the vote it achieves in national opinion polls. The Tories lost more than 1,000 seats and control of dozens of councils. Ballots were disproportionately located in what are usually regarded as the Tory shires, so the result is a genuinely bad one. The prime minister remains stoic in the face of calls for her to go. But she is more than ever the figurehead rather than the leader of a party that has lost all discipline. Mr Corbyn is unchallenged, but he ought to be worried. Given that it is defending a poor performance in 2015, Labour went backwards in terms of the number of councillors. It did win some high-profile contests. However, there must be a concern that its coalition of older, less-educated, working-class voters and younger, liberal metropolitan graduates is wilting in the heat of the Brexit argument. Winning wealthy urban seats while losing party heartlands ought to provoke a bout of soul-searching in all those who believe that Britain badly needs an effective Labour government. British politics could fragment ever further, with unpredictable results. With European elections impending, there is a lesson for both Labour and the Tories: they cannot easily profit as the Brexit process drifts on and on, but their insurgent rivals might."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wrote about this not long ago here, on why the conservatives in Germany, under Merkel’s leadership, have been getting clobbered in the polls. In a nutshell:
It’s your constant endorsement of the opposition Greens, stupid!”
You don’t get more votes by endorsing the silly green positions of your opponents – you get votes by attacking and exposing them.
Yesterday the online Die Welt reported here (FRONT PAGE!) that the youth of the once-conservative CDU party is taking a second look at the greenshirt movement and Angela Merkel’s weird direction. Finally they are showing signs of having had it with all the green crap pasted on the party platform.
For example the leader of Germany’s Young Consevatives Philipp Mißfelderis speaking up and taking Merkel to task. Die Welt titles the story:
Mißfelder Aims Massive Criticism at CDU Leadership”

High time. Everyone should now be standing up and hollering at the top of our lungs in support. Foremost he calls the orientation with the Greens as a mistake and adds:
A CDU ‘that orients itself with the Greens’ underestimates the people’s fundamental will for liberty, says Mißfelder. Also in the big cities the CDU ought not to fix iteself on issues like climate change and integration, like the party leadership thinksn: safety, order and cleanliness are also issues that mobilize voters more than we sometimes think.“
Of course, Mißfelder has a long way to go before he can expect to capitalize politically. If he really wants to score points, then he’ll just come out and call climate science and policy what it is: just a huge scam that is defrauding the public and taxpayers of their money and liberty.
The tough comments from Mißfelder come at the heels of CDU faction chief in the state parliament of Hesse, Christean Wagner, read here, also launched a screed against Angela Merkel and the party’s overall direction, which he dubbed as being void of any profile. “The blame rests on Merkel – she has watered down the party”.
Wagner added:
She has to delineate more clearly from the Socialists, Greens, and Communist parties for self-responsibility and work for the majority of the people – for freedom and social market economy, for Christian values and the nation, for domestic and foreign security, for the homeland, family and tradition.”
Focusing on these things sure would be nice – instead of wasting money and resources on the fantasy of rescuing the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDogmatism is a dangerous thing – especially when dealing with economics and when it attempts to dictate markets. Some examples follow below.
1.) EU climate policy leads to more CO2 emissions
German blog Oekowatch writes about a press release from the German Association of Energy and Power Economics (VIK), which concludes that ever stricter EU climate policies cause economic damage to Europe while resulting in increased CO2 emission.
The press release states that many studies conducted do not take an honest look at the CO2 picture. Shifting CO2-intensive industries away from Europe does not lead to a rescue of the climate, but winds up resulting in even more CO2 getting produced overseas instead. Here’s an example:
And so German CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2010 actually dropped 13%; but when CO2 emissions that are involved in the imported products are taken into account, the picture changes. Then the total net CO2 output rises by 23%. The picture is similar in other EU countries.”
The press release offered some stern advice for our action-hero climate-rescuing politicians in the EU:
The politicians in the EU really have to wake up and recognise that the unilateral leading position in climate position is producing completely false results.”
The press release summarises that EU draconian climate policy harms everything – environment, economics, and the basis for future generations:
The current climate policy in the EU and also in Germany harms the the environment and the people in Germany /EU. The EU cannot rescue the world’s climate alone. ‘It is also part of generational justice to not deny our children and grandchildren a functioning economic basis.’ says Dr. Annette Loske, General Managing Director of the VIK.”
2.) Biofuel deforestation, slavery, and hunger
Another brilliant example of how master plans to hypothetically rescue the planet turn into real death and destruction is described by warmist site Klimaretter here. Ethanol production from sugar cane  in Brazil has gotten so out of hand that it is leading to massive deforestation, slavery, inhumane work conditions, less production of food crops, and widespread hunger. Reuters warned  recently:
Surging global prices of basic foodstuffs raise the risk that the food crisis of 2007-2008 in developing countries will be repeated, the head of the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Monday.
And adds:
The FAO has asked developed countries to re-examine their biofuels strategies — which include large subsidies — since these have diverted 120 million tonnes of cereals away from human consumption to convert them to fuels.

//-->




Developed countries give $13 billion in annual subsidies and protection to encourage biofuels production, Diouf said. In the United States, corn stocks have dipped to near 15-year lows as more of the crop is used for making ethanol.”
3.)  200,000 deaths per year and more misery
Benny Peiser’s Global Warming Policy Foundation website here has a story on how U.S. and European policy to increase production of ethanol and other biofuels has added to global death and disease.
Research by the World Bank indicates that the increase in biofuels production over 2004 levels would push more than 35 million additional people into absolute poverty in 2010 in developing countries. Using statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Indur Goklany estimates that this would lead to at least 192,000 excess deaths per year, plus disease resulting in the loss of 6.7 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per year.”
4.)  500,000 kids going blind annually – because of green dogmatism.
Finally, we all remember how the activist banning of DDT led to the deaths of millions. Another example of how blind and dogmatic thinking leads to disaster is the ban of golden rice. EIKE features this video where Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore explains the disaster of Golden Rice (starting at the 2:05 mark):

Half a million kids go blind every year in the rice-eating countries because of vitamin A deficiency. Golden rice, which Ingo Potrykus invented 12 years ago, could cure this overnight, and yet the activists have prevented it from being planted in Asia and Africa.”
Read more here about golden rice: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice.
Clearly the people who are suffering the most from climate and green schemes are the poor in Africa, Asia and South America. These dogmatic policies are all concocted by folks in Europe and North America with the intent to preserve the planet – poor people be damned. Call it eco-colonialism.

"Perhaps there’s a reason why still too few of us pay heed to warnings about how we are killing the planet by cruel and unusual methods. How can you persuade people to stop endangering other species and start protecting the environment when they don’t seem concerned about torturing themselves? According to Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, almost one in four (230,000) of Scotland’s children are officially recognised as living in poverty, one of the highest rates in Europe. And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by 2022. The charity’s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one: “It means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in 21st-century Scotland.”  We are rarely more than a few weeks between revelations about another public health crisis in Scotland’s communities. The causes are wearyingly familiar to all those who have been paying attention. The communities that bear the brunt of these crises are the same as those that did so a hundred years ago. So if no government north and south of the border over the course of the century has been able to effect enough change in the living (and dying) circumstances of these neighbourhoods, how on earth can we be confident they will take steps to stop us torturing the planet? According to a UN report last week, about one million species of animals, plants and insects are facing extinction in the near future. No species, it seems, is considered too big or too plentiful to die. The pattern of irresponsibility mirrors that which characterises our efforts to end human poverty. We know what is required and we have the means to effect it. We even know the specific neighbourhoods and streets requiring most help to address poverty, while David Attenborough has told us exactly where to find the threatened species. We also know that if we don’t improve our means of producing food and energy and take greater care in disposing of waste there is a real risk of irrevocably destroying the ecosystem that sustains the existence of animals and humans. I think we’re also entitled to ask if there is a point at which we declare a state of emergency to rescue ourselves and our environment. Scotland could take the lead. This country imagines itself as providing a gold standard in caring for the environment. At the STUC conference in Dundee in April Nicola Sturgeon pledged to make Scotland carbon-neutral and thus make it “a healthier, wealthier and fairer nation”. The traditional embedded interests that have always influenced UK domestic policy would suggest that nothing will ever be allowed to interfere with free market priorities. The first minister should declare a state of national environmental emergency. It should take the form of a sort of national boot camp. Under this, the government would award itself special powers to impose a form of compulsory national service to save the planet and ourselves. It would apply to all over the age of 16. The following is a list of measures to get the ball rolling: no overseas travel (unless by boat) for two years. This would reduce our carbon footprint to around a manageable size four. It would also give an almighty boost to Scotland’s tourist trade and the fragile economy of the Highlands and Islands. Lots of jobs would be created and hard-pressed families would save money by not going on ridiculous trips to Florida and Cancun they can’t really afford. Compulsory beekeeping. Every Scottish family would be required to sign up to a national beekeeping register. This would enjoin them to volunteer for a minimum time each week looking after the wee furry fellas at the community beehive centre. We’d not only save the bees, which are a key building block of our ecosystem, it would get the kids out, give them a sense of purpose and improve their mental health. Mandatory adoption of an endangered animal. Every Scottish family would be required to adopt an endangered animal and help pay for its welfare. I adopted a couple of amur leopards a few years ago called Henrik and Lubo for a very small annual consideration. Regrettably, I let it lapse but am now scanning the internet for other threatened beasties to help out. Leave the Munros alone (for a wee while at least). I think some of our wild and beautiful places deserve a break from the intense human behaviour they’ve been subjected to over recent decades when Munro-bagging has become a chi-chi lifestyle accoutrement. I’d limit permits to much more sustainable levels. To ensure we are all getting exercise the Scottish government must establish compulsory attendance at community Falun Gong sessions. Compulsory lights out. Every family would be required to spend one day a week without any form of energy supply. This would be monitored by smart meters and Alexa (who we all know is spying on us anyway). Not only would it make us carbon-neutral more quickly but it would engender a sense of community and family togetherness in the candlelight. It would also boost the Scottish population, which an independent Scotland requires for a buoyant economy. Any unforeseen costs in rolling out the national boot camp would, in future, be met by the £163m annual savings on paying for Trident. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist"

European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Vice President Michael Limburg was denied making a climate science-critical speech at the University of Leipzig.  Are we slipping back into the science Dark Ages in Europe?Press Release from EIKE:
“University of Leipzig censors critical climate conference*. Fundamental freedom of science gets trampled.
Blatant censorship of dissenting scientific opinions on the subject of climate change and its causes is the post-modern trend. After recent attempts to ban the scientifically undesirable paper by renown scientists Spencer & Braswell (details here) and the ban of the climate-critical conference at the Belgian Society of European Engineers and Industrialists (SEII) by IPCC Vice Chair Prof. J. van Ypersele (details here), the Faculty for Physics and Geosciences of the University of Leipzig is the next to suppress open scientific debate. University of Leipzig Dean Prof. Dr. Jürgen Haase Tuesday barred a climate seminar organized by geography professor Werner Kirstein, as wells as the use of the University auditorium and participation by European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Vice President Michael Limburg as the main speaker.Fortunately the ban was later relaxed and the seminar was allowed to go ahead.
The reason for originally having banned the seminar was a dissertation authored by Michael Limburg, which was critical of climate-science and was submitted to the faculty in March 2010. Two reviewers rejected the dissertation claiming, among other points, that it was inadequate. This is why Limburg was not welcome as a speaker, according to a letter from the Dean. The fact that the same dissertation had been recommended for acceptance by 4 other renowned professors went unmentioned by Haase. Limburg immediately challenged the ban.
What was so inconvenient about Limburg’s dissertation?
Under the supervision of Prof. Werner Kirstein, Limburg had written a dissertation that examined the quality of historical global temperature and sea level data in detail. His conclusions were damning. Using accepted rules for science and measurement, Limburg’s results showed that the datasets did not allow sea level and temperature change over the last 120-150 years to be determined anywhere near the alleged accuracies of millimetres or tenths of a degree Celsius respectively as claimed by the IPCC. The range of uncertainty, in both global mean temperature and sea level, is considerably greater than the total respective changes given by the IPCC. Every factor in attributing the possible causes of the changes was, at best, scientifically questionable.
Naturally, the faculty searched – and found – the “right” reviewers for assessing Limburg’s dissertation. In his decision to ban Limburg from speaking, Haase quoted only the objectively unfair and negative assessments. The fact that four other university professors had recommended the dissertation be accepted got no mention by Haase. Limburg officially contested the assessment delivered by the two reviewers, but they have taken their time to respond. Up to today there is still no response. Now a legal battle appears inevitable. Science has again been cast aside.
The high point of the whole affair is the open attempt by the University of Leipzig to silence Lim¬burg – even though he had been officially invited by a full professor. The Leipzig University faculty appears to be completely oblivious to this unworthy conduct.
Open debate is essential for the progress of science
This brings up Voltaire, the most famous philosopher of our time, and his words to his harshest opponent: ‘Sir, I do not agree with your opinion and I fully oppose you. But I would give up my life to assure that you will always be allowed to publicly express your opinion’. At the University of Leipzig, there has to be some colleagues among the philosophy faculty who are familiar with those words. But it looks as if the University leadership is not among them.”

"Your article describes Bill Nye, the children’s science presenter, getting justly angry about climate change (Bill Nye: ‘The planet’s on fire, you idiots’, G2, 15 May). But today’s children are not the first generation to have a sharp awakening to our violation of the environment – pollution was a major concern for youngsters of the 1970s. As a child, my cultural heroes were environmentalists. The Wombles recycled rubbish, singing: “Pick up the pieces and make them into something new / Is what we do.” Bagpuss was an expert in thrift: “We will fix it like new, new, new,” sang the mice. As a teenager, instead of buying new, I embraced the 1970s revival of handicrafts and made my own leather bags, floaty skirts and bead jewellery. Cars were a rarity and I travelled by bus, bike or on foot and got to know my neighbours.  Reducing our carbon footprint could take us back to the 1970s. But would that be completely bad? Today’s stressed youngsters might well enjoy the benefits of a less commercial society. After the anger, there may be space for a better way of life.Clare HobbaSt Albans • Commentary on the Met Gala (Fab-u-lous! The campest Met Gala ever, G2, 8 May), fashion’s most exclusive evening, touched upon all but one aspect of the event: environmental impact. The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government’s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste. The crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change. The pinnacle of slow fashion – wherein ideas typically take nine months to materialise into a single product – may seem an odd method for changing the throwaway culture of fast fashion. However, the Met Gala’s role in fostering creativity to heights generally considered extravagant should be seen as the ideal platform for innovation. Competing ideas for how to green glamour at the level of high fashion, which can more readily assume risk, would pave the way for the gradual adoption of more sustainable methods by the wider fashion industry. The 2019 Met Gala carpet was pink. The case is overwhelming for next year’s carpet to be green.Alice MunnellyAthlone, Co Westmeath, Ireland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The current election campaign discussions on climate change fails to address the real challenges that face the nation. The super-partisan nature of the debate and the focus on mythical costs of action risks significantly harming our prosperity and resulting in another decade of squandered economic opportunity. I work for an organisation that represents institutional investors like super funds with total funds under management of over $2tn. Super funds invest to ensure superannuation holders can retire with dignity. The average superannuation holder will retire around 2050 so what we do to address climate change matters a lot to their retirement funds.  Investors and the companies they invest in and own are exposed to policies that governments put in place. What governments decide also influences if they invest, where they invest and what they invest in. Major investors and companies are run by smart people. They know that climate change is real and that governments will eventually have to implement significant policies to reduce emissions. It is not credible to think otherwise. Community concern is growing as the impacts of extreme weather events escalate, global markets are shifting, technologies like renewable energy are the cheapest investment options for new electricity generation, and Australia has ratified an international treaty – the Paris agreement – that will require the nation to achieve net zero emissions. This realisation has material impacts. Companies are acting in response to real-world realities and because the investors that own them are asking them to get their act together. This means that regardless of what governments are doing they are factoring in proxy carbon taxes into their investment decisions and business plans. Some prices are low and others are up to $140/tonne in 2040 (to put this in context, the starting price under the Gillard government carbon pricing scheme was just over $20/tonne). There is already a shadow carbon price in the Australian economy. What they are also doing is looking for low and zero-carbon investment opportunities. If you know action is coming you get ready to maximise the opportunities of the new investment boom and reduce the cost of complying with emissions-reductions obligations. Energy-intensive companies are investing in renewable energy to manage electricity costs, investors are developing zero-emissions property portfolios, and asset managers are investing in carbon forestry in Australia and across the region. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The proportion on investors implementing low-carbon strategies grew from just over 50% in 2017 to around 90% last year. The other consequence of the current policy paralysis is that if you are unclear what the future climate policy framework will look like, while you will prepare and invest in low-risk activities, you will be hesitant to make major investments required to accelerate the transition to a net zero emissions economy. One of the most significant barriers impacting long-term investment and accessing new economic opportunities is climate policy uncertainty. Institutional investors have to make long-term returns on their investments for the benefit of superannuation holders. Lack of credible, durable and predictable policy frameworks in Australia means investors will look to other countries where policy is more predictable or if they so invest in Australia they will charge higher-risk premiums on investments to hedge against policy risk. This also means it is more difficult for investors to pursue emerging zero-carbon investment opportunities. Despite the rhetoric, Australia’s current policy proposal does nothing to address the fundamental drives behind the economic costs of policy uncertainty. It fails to integrate energy and climate policy and we have no plans for how Australia will achieve net zero emissions in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. If this continues the government would be saying to business to sit on their hands and do little for another decade. This is inconsistent with rational business decision-making and even their legal obligations to manage their business and investments in the interests of shareholders and superannuation holders. Financial regulators and central banks in Australia and around the world are recognising that climate change represents a systemic risk to economies and financial system, and there is increasing scrutiny on whether investors and companies have the governance structures and business plans in place to address growing climate change impacts and manage the transition to net zero emissions. Put simply, the absence of credible climate policy has a negative impact on the economy and investment decisions. This comes through electricity bills as investments are delayed in new electricity generation investment. It delays infrastructure as investors try to work out what the impact of climate change and climate policy will be on the value of the asset over the long term. It threatens long-term superannuation returns because the economic impacts of failing to address climate change over the long-term make the global financial crisis look like a walk in the park. All of this is lost in the conversation because some in the media and politics want to focus on hypothetical modelling of a fantasy economy by Brian Fisher. For transparency, I have been involved in economic modelling of climate policy myself. This means I understand some of its limitations and what it is useful for. I have written before on some of the problems with this kind of analysis, and economists more qualified than me have shown why Fisher’s work has limited value in policy making. What I will point out is that this work ignores the economic cost of policy uncertainty in the analysis. Fisher’s modelling ignores a key economic benefit of reducing emissions in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. As work undertaken for the Department of Foreign Affairs concluded, “the uncertainty arising from a lack of policy commitment has a large impact on investment and real GDP in the Australian economy. Even a relatively small risk premium shock can have significant consequences for investment in energy production and also on overall economic activity which feeds through all sectors of the economy.” It also assumes that business is doing nothing to respond to global market trends and the signals their regulators are sending them. So as politicians and the media make sport with imaginary costs of reducing emissions, a deeper economic risk from the failure to implement credible climate policy is building in the economy. Investors and companies are getting ready to unleash a new wave of investment across Australia. This economic opportunity will only be realised if we move past scare campaigns and start acting seriously on climate change. • Erwin Jackson is director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRichard Wagner at the German site Die Achse Des Guten  (The Axis of Good) takes an excellent look at the feasibility of powering society solely with renewable energy (sun, wind, biofuel) and through energy savings. It’s a challenge many engineers are grappling with.

All images here are from: http://wattsupwiththat wind-turbines-video/.
But earlier a reader here at NTZ (DirkH I think) commented that many young German engineers naively come into the industry, as if on a religious mission to rescue the planet from the Biblical catastrophe of climate meltdown, in search of that all-elusive energy supply that is both cheap with no adverse effects, or to find ways to go without.
That engineers come into the industry with such religious mindsets is already a very troubling sign. It tells us they have not even taken the first step of checking the “problem” to see if the proposed solution itself could be much worse. Have the “green” engineers really looked at the data that supposedly underpins the “climate problem”?
The answer is “no”. If they had, they would not be proposing the expensive solutions they are now being proposed (unless it’s all about making money and the future be damned).
A good engineer checks the data behind the “problem” and does not make up problems just to give himself something to do. Good engineers have a good sense for economics. Bad ones do not.
Green engineers are among the worst and most dangerous
Overall, German engineers are second to none in many fields such as petroleum, chemicals, automotive, machine building, project management and so on. But in renewable energy, they are careless, naive, ideological and ignorant -and so have become a hazard to society – particularly economically and with respect to the risks their solutions pose down the line. It’s our children and grandchildren that will have to inherit the mess they leave behind.

This generation of “green” engineers will likely be the first to cause far more problems than they solve. When data is recklessly and maliciously neglected, it’s inevitable.
Already we have seen their solutions turn into disasters. Some examples: biofuels on the food supply and monoculture, windmills and solar panels with respect to aesthetics, supply consistency and cost. Think about the impacts of mercury-laden energy saving lights in our landfills. Nobody really thought about these impacts. It was all driven by blind government policy.
In all cases it’s: “Whether these solutions work or not, it won’t be our problem – so take the money while you can, and run”. We see it at GE, Siemens, the solar industry and a host of others. The list is too long to get into.
These opportunists and swindlers never stopped once to think that the science could be wrong, or couldn’t care less. They don’t want to know it’s wrong. “It’s to save the climate (and make tons of money guaranteed by government policy).” This is selfish opportunism – not engineering.
So will it work?
Richard Wagner at Die Achse Des Guten provides us the answer using an example.
Because I accused the Greens of being hostile to technology, one reader asked me the clever question of whether or not the green technologies of sun and wind power systems were products of engineering, and thus of technology.
The question where technology begins and where it ends is certainly an intriguing issue. One can discuss it all evening long, both in the limelight or by candle light. But it would not address the core of the issue. Also the production of bicycles is a significant part of our economy. Yet, nobody has ever seriously asked if it would be possible to replace commercial jets with flying bicycles.
But this is precisely what the Greens are attempting in the energy issue. This is, and will remain, a question of technology and resources needed for the technology at hand. The objective of every energy debate should be the creation and the assurance of the energy extent that we need in order to progress further.”
And not finding ways to force others to go without. And saving energy is a waste if the costs of doing so far exceed the savings and benefits. Green engineers need to broaden their scope of analysis and depth of thinking. They need to get away from ideology, and to get back to art of engineering.

"Ireland’s parliament has become the second after Britain’s to declare a climate emergency, a decision hailed by the Swedish teenage environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg as “great news”. An amendment to a parliamentary report declaring a climate emergency and calling on the parliament “to examine how [the Irish government] can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss” was accepted without a vote late on Thursday.  The Irish Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, who moved the amendment, called the decision “historic”. Thunberg, the 16-year-old activist who has spearheaded protests across Europe and is becoming one of the most passionate voices of the green movement, urged more nations to follow suit. “Great news from Ireland!! Who is next?” she tweeted. Britain’s parliament became the first in the world to declare a climate emergency, passing the largely symbolic motion on 1 May. The step followed 11 days of street protests in London by the Extinction Rebellion environmental campaign group. Extinction Rebellion’s ultimate goal is to slash global greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025 and to end biodiversity loss, steps that have won the backing of left-leaning politicians across the world. The British government is eyeing a 2050 target date to reach net zero emissions, which it says can be achieved without causing substantial economic damage and at a relatively low cost."
"If the government put a figure on the lifetime cost of dealing with childhood obesity, it may well find that money would be saved in the long run if schools were funded to provide healthy breakfasts and lunches for all children (Obesity-related hospital admissions rise by 15%, 9 May). This might also contribute to an improvement in educational outcomes since hungry children, as well as those who are full of E numbers, struggle to engage with learning. Furthermore, if these lunches were vegetarian it would contribute to a significant reduction in carbon emissions caused by rearing animals for meat.  We need some joined-up thinking in order to address the many and complex challenges we face – and making the link between obesity, educational outcomes and the environment would be a good start.Fiona CarnieAlternatives in Education, Bath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Werner Weber of the Technical University of Dortmund is the author of that infamous, consensus-shattering article “The CO2 Lies” appearing in Bild newspaper on Monday – also see here – which featured the new skeptic book that is causing an uproar in German climate science, written by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning.
Now he is throwing in a few more shots of dissent, as he answers a message he received from another (seemingly indignant) North German professor (see below).
Naturally he has since received lots of mail, and not all of it friendly. For example here’s the message from the “indignant” professor, who wrote:
Dear Prof Weber,
I’m completely shocked by your article in Bild. What do you expect to accomplish with this?”
Here we see that in climate science, some professors have completely forgotten how science really works, and so need to be reminded. Here’s Professor Weber’s reply, which he published at “Die kalte Sonne site“. I’ve translated it in English with permission (slightly edited for clarity, emphasis added):
Dear Prof. [Completely Shocked],
I assume you belong to the climate scientists who subscribe to the assessments that the IPCC well represents. But to me you are not known as one of the protagonists of the IPCC’s opinion, like the directors and employees of the PIK [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research], whom I’ve collided with before.
I came from the outside, after about 40 years of experience in the highly competitive field of condensed matter physics that involves the intense interaction between experiment and theory, a field with a culture of discourse that takes all controverisal and divergent opinions seriously.

The field of climate science appeared to me as being very dogmatic right from the start, at least concerning the fundamentals. In no time flat, the motto became: “the science is settled”. Those who now challenge the fundamental statements on climate are, in the best cases labelled as dimwits, and in the worst case they get labelled as “deniers”, analogous to a “Holocaust denier”. Let’s take Al Gore for example, admittedly a politician, or Pachauri, the IPCC spokesman, admittedly an engineer. But the statements made by leading representatives from the PIK were hardly different.
In the meantime I’ve worked myself halfway into the field of climate science. Even the most fundamental principles hold no water when truly subjected to closer scrutiny, and much, which doesn’t fit the overall narrative, is flat out ignored – and much involving key, central issues. In my guest piece in the book by Vahrenholt/Lüning “Die Kalte Sonne”, I clearly illustrated an example of this.
I’d be happy to present my arguments in a seminar presentation at your location if you wish.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Werner Weber
Technical University of Dortmund

"The proliferation of single-use plastic around the world is accelerating climate change and should be urgently halted, a report warns. Plastic production is expanding worldwide, fuelled in part by the fracking boom in the US. The report says plastic contributes to greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its lifecycle, from its production to its refining and the way it is managed as a waste product. This plastic binge threatens attempts to meet the Paris climate agreement. It means that by 2050 plastic will be responsible for up to 13% of the total “carbon budget” – equivalent to 615 coal-fired power plants – says the research published on Thursday. The contribution of plastic production and disposal to climate change has been largely hidden, say the authors of the report by the Center for International Environmental Law, which estimates the greenhouse gas footprint of plastic from the cradle to the grave for the first time. While plastic pollution in the oceans has become a high-profile concern, the effect on climate change of the ubiquitous use of plastic has not been a focus. “After the extraction of fossil fuels to produce plastic, the carbon footprint of a material which has become ubiquitous across the globe continues through the refining process, and on well past its useful life as a drinks bottle or plastic bag, through the way it is disposed of and the plastic afterlife,” the report says. The authors say disposable plastic found in packaging and fast-moving consumer goods forms the largest and fastest-growing segment of the plastic economy. They are calling for urgent action to stem production and flow of throwaway plastic. “At current levels, greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C,” the report says. “With the petrochemical and plastic industries planning a massive expansion in production, the problem is on track to get much worse.” The key actions which the authors say are required are: • Immediately end the production and use of single-use, disposable plastic. • Stop development of new oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure. • Foster the transition to zero-waste communities. • Implement a system where polluters pay for the impact of their products – known as extended producer responsibility. “Plastic is one of the most ubiquitous materials in the economy and among the most pervasive and persistent pollutants on Earth,” say the authors. “It has become an inescapable part of the material world, flowing constantly through the human experience in everything from plastic bottles, bags, food packaging, and clothing to prosthetics, car parts, and construction materials.” Throwaway plastic packaging makes up 40% of the demand for plastic, fuelling a boom in production from 2m tonnes in the 1950s to 380m tonnes in 2015. By the end of 2015, 8.3bn metric tonnes of plastic had been produced – two-thirds of which has been released into the environment and remains there. “Packaging is one of the most problematic types of plastic waste, as it is typically designed for single use, ubiquitous in trash, and extremely difficult to recycle. A constant increase in the use of flexible and multilayered packaging has been adding challenges to collection, separation, and recycling,” the researchers said. Forty per cent of plastic packaging waste is disposed of at sanitary landfills, 14% goes to incineration facilities and 14% is collected for recycling. Incineration creates the most CO2 emissions among the plastic waste management methods. Nearly all plastic – 99% – is made from fossil fuels. Refining the material is the most greenhouse gas intensive part of the plastic lifecycle, and major expansions in the US and elsewhere will accelerate climate change, the report says. A Shell ethane cracker being constructed in Pennsylvania could emit up to 2.25m tonnes of CO2 each year and a new ethylene plant at ExxonMobil’s refinery in Baytown, Texas, could release up to 1.4m tonnes. The annual emissions from just these two new facilities would be equal to adding almost 800,000 cars to the road, the report says. In 2019 the lifecycle of global plastic production – from extraction to disposal – was equivalent to the impact on the climate of 189 500MW coal-fired power stations. By 2050, the report predicts, the global plastic footprint will be equivalent to 615 coal plants running at full capacity. “Plastic is among the most significant and rapidly growing sources of industrial greenhouse gas emissions,” the report says. “Emissions from plastic emerge not only from the production and manufacture of plastic itself, but from every stage in the plastic lifecycle – from the extraction and transport of the fossil fuels that are the primary feedstocks for plastic, to refining and manufacturing, to waste management, to the plastic that enters the environment.” Carroll Muffett, one of the authors, said: “It has long been clear that plastic threatens the global environment and puts human health at risk. This report demonstrates that plastic, like the rest of the fossil economy, is putting the climate at risk as well.”"
"Roads in the centre of Edinburgh were closed to traffic for the first time on Sunday as the city joined the Open Streets movement to reduce air pollution.  Cities around the world have temporarily opened streets to people by closing them to cars, vans and other motorised vehicles on a regular basis. The City of Edinburgh council said it was the first city in the UK to join the Open Streets movement and would be closing roads to traffic on the first Sunday of every month as part of an 18-month trial. Councillor Lesley Macinnes said: “We’ve seen how successful similar schemes internationally have proved by encouraging active travel, improving air quality and creating a safer, more relaxed atmosphere so I can’t wait to see this take shape in the capital. “Climate change is a real threat to society, it’s clear that we have to act, and Open Streets is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. We are wholeheartedly committed to creating an accessible, sustainable and people-friendly city.” Open-air yoga, giant chess games, music and tai chi were among the activities on offer on Sunday."
"Bill Shorten has left open the option of boosting wages for aged care workers, saying the fact that Labor is supporting early childhood educators in this election “does not mean that we won’t work to help aged care work force in the future”. In a solo appearance on Q&A on Monday night, the Labor leader was asked why he was making a special case for subsidising the salaries of childcare workers, but not aged care workers. Labor has promised to increase the pay of early childhood educators by 20% over eight years, an average increase of $11,300 above any award rises. Shorten said Labor was confident it could deliver assistance for childcare now and would wait to see the outcome of the royal commission into aged care before determining whether to roll out assistance there too. He said the analysis of which sectors were being helped and which were not in the event Labor wins should not be a “Hunger Games” exercise or a competition for “who is the most miserable”. Shorten said early childhood educators were the first people entrusted with children outside the family home and “because it’s a feminised industry the vast bulk workforce of women have been underpaid forever”. “That’s why we are going to look after early childhood educators [but] my answer shows we’re thinking about what to do in aged care too.” After the 28 April announcement of Labor’s wage subsidy policy, which is forecast to cost $9.9bn over a decade, Shorten initially left the door open to extending the concept to other sectors, noting that childcare had been selected to “go first”. But after the policy, which also includes free childcare for families earning less than $69,000, was swiftly blasted by the Morrison government as “socialism” and a bribe to unions representing childcare workers, Labor’s workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, shut down the idea it could be applied to other sectors. While Shorten again signalled on Monday night the concept could be used elsewhere, O’Connor said a couple of days after the policy launch there were “no plans” to extend the model to other sectors. “Childcare is a special case,” he told the ABC. “Childcare has been historically underpaid.” Scott Morrison has declined to appear solo on the Q&A program. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, went on the program just after the April budget. Over more than an hour, Shorten faced hostile questions about Labor’s revenue measures, including dividend imputation and changes to negative gearing, and launched an unapologetic defence of his policies. He was challenged to oppose the controversial Queensland Adani coalmine as a test of Labor’s commitment to climate change. Shorten said Labor would adhere to the science and the law and not create sovereign risk. “There is no doubt in my mind that we’re moving to more renewables,” he said. “There’s no doubt in my mind that coal-fired power is getting more expensive and renewables are getting cheaper. “But at the end of the day we have to have a framework of laws. We have to have a framework for investment.” Shorten was asked what he had learned from Kevin Rudd’s declaration that climate change was the great moral challenge of our time, and his subsequent retreat from emissions trading in 2009. “What I learned out of 2009, you can stand for something or fall for everything and we’re going to stand and fight on climate change,” he said. “We’re not retreating”. Shorten again said Labor would consider an increase in the Newstart payment after a review undertaken if Labor wins, but declined to put a dollar amount on it. He also signalled there would be substantial reform in Indigenous affairs, to be led by Pat Dodson. Shorten characterised Indigenous disadvantage as a “national disaster, a national emergency”. Asked about his persistent unpopularity with voters, he said he had seen off two prime ministers as leader of the opposition, and Labor had a unified and stable team who would ensure its pre-election commitments were delivered. Shorten pointed out that Malcolm Turnbull, who had been popular with the public, and feted by some journalists as the “Sun King”, was now watching the program from New York rather than from the Lodge. He said if he won the prime ministership, he would listen to the community and seek to be inclusive. “If I’m elected prime minister, we’re going to do the public meetings and go out and listen to people, so my style of leadership is to listen. “My style of leadership is to get the best out of people. This isn’t just an idle statement. Love us or hate us, the Labor party for the last five and a half years has been stable. Not for nothing did Bob Hawke say if you can’t run your own party you can’t run the country.”"

By Ed Caryl
Because pilots need to know the local weather conditions, most temperature-measuring sites are at airports worldwide. Airports, in turn, tend to be where the airport users are, near cities. As cities grow, so do the airports. As the airports and cities grow, the number of aircraft and aircraft operations grow. As operations (take-offs and landings) grow, more kerosene (Jet fuel, JP-1 and JP-4) is burned. It is widely recognized that large airports near large cities are in urban-heat-islands (UHI), but is it the local population or the amount of fuel burned that causes the UHI? And what is the error in temperature measurements?
Twenty airports in the central United States were found with long, continuous, temperature records. They ranged in size from the small airport at North Platte, Nebraska, to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International airport. The local populations ranged from 24,000 to 3.2 million. When counting aircraft operations, only multi-engine jet and turbine engine operations were used, commercial and military. General aviation aircraft operations were ignored. A Cessna 172, after all, burns about as much fuel on take-off as a Boeing 727 auxiliary power unit uses while sitting at the gate, that is, in comparison, not much.
The 20 airports were: Albuquerque NM, Bismarck ND, Cheyenne WY, Duluth MN, Eau Claire WI, Eppley Field (Omaha, NE), Lincoln NE, Memphis TN, Minneapolis MN, North Platt NE, 0klahoma City OK, Peoria IL, Pueblo CO, Salt Lake City UT, Sioux City IA, Springfield IL, St Louis MO, Topeka KS, Urbana IL, and Wichita KS.
The temperature trend used in Figure 1 is the linear trend over the 66-years from 1934 to 2000, inclusive, to include both the hottest year in the previous cycle to the hottest years in the current cycle. Temperatures are from the GIStemp web site here. The default (raw) annual data was used for each location.

Figure 1. This is a plot of the Temperature Trend for 20 U. S. airports versus local population and number of daily jet aircraft operations. The vertical scales are both logarithmic, thus the linear trends are seen as log curves.
The twenty airports in this plot sort themselves into three groups. The first group of eight seems the least contaminated by local heat sources, and plot along linear trends with R2 values of 0.862 for population and 0.7876 for operations. It makes sense that the population and aircraft operations should track closely, because the percentage of people that fly should be somewhat the same everywhere.
The second group of eight is smaller cities with fewer flights, and seems slightly more contaminated by local heat sources. Some sources were identified, and proved to be airport facilities like Instrument Landing System (ILS) equipment and runway approach lighting. The same rough ratio of people and flights holds, though the number of operations warms the environment slightly more than the people.

At the remaining four airports, the UHI from population completely breaks down, and only air operations have any significance. These four were examined closely. All had local heat sources within 50 meters of the temperature sensors. At three, what appear to be ILS buildings are close by, at the fourth; a generator building was the culprit (Figure 2).




Figure 2. This is the site at Cheyenne, Wyoming airport. The generator building is downhill about 40 meters from the temperature sensor A (heat rises). The image is from Google here.
It is clear from Figure 1 that in the absence of population and burned jet fuel, the temperature trend in the mid-U. S., from 1934 to 2000, has been cooling by about one degree C. It is also clear that the UHI affect in the vicinity of large cities and their airports, is about 1.5°C. Yes, fossil fuel use leads to warming, especially at airports. But if those are the only places being measured, it is like a blind-man describing an elephant touching only the trunk.

Figure 3. This is the cooling trend at 56 rural sites in the U. S. since 2000.
Since 2000, the U. S. has cooled one further degree, for a total since 1934, of 2.5°C. It is time for Messieurs Jones, Hansen, and Mann to switch back to global cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate change because of man is causing more death and drought – especially in Africa, so claim the “experts”.
But what we have to remember is that many of these “experts are not reliable spend their time sitting in air conditioned offices in Zurich, London, or Manhattan and never really have gone out in the field and taken real scientific measurements. Many in fact just spew crap in the form of alarmist press releases to the gullible media. Hat-tip: International Business Times.

Der Spiegel above brings a report on the Sahel Region of Africa, interviewing Dutch geographer Chris Reij of the University of Amsterdam. Reij says the opposite is occurring: the Sahara is shrinking. It is not expanding.
Reij has been visiting and documenting “the greening of the Sahel Zone” for decades. According to Reij at the the 0:28 mark:

The Sahara is not expanding. Sure there are still some areas of drought. But it is a popular myth that is gladly spread by the media that the Sahara is creeping southwards more and more every year. Also serious organizations claim this agaian and again. But it’s not true.”
As Der Spiegel shows at 0:58, trees are growing where 20 years ago there was only sand. And people are learning to manage the land and to reforest the area. “Here there’s more success than what people believe,” says Reij.
Der Spiegel concludes:
The Sahel zone is called the ground zero of climate change by UN officials. But now it’s getting green because of people on site have learned to help themselves.”
Thanks, Der Spiegel, for this bit of reality from Africa.

"Vince Cable has warned that Liberal Democrats are “being underestimated again” in terms of their potential to make gains in the European elections. At a launch for the party’s election manifesto in Shoreditch, east London, its leader insisted they were “the biggest and best organised of the remain parties” in their preparations for the 23 May vote.  While climate change and cutting crime rates were high on the agenda, the event laid down the Lib Dems’ main aim to “stop Brexit” and hold a second referendum. Earlier on Thursday Cable unveiled the slogan for the party’s campaign to remain in the EU – “Bollocks to Brexit” – a phrase so frank, he claimed, that a supporter had fainted upon hearing it. In last week’s local elections the Lib Dems made big gains, leaving them in control of 18 councils and with 676 councillors. Appearing on his 76th birthday, Cable, said: “I’m optimistic, buoyed up by last week. Everybody underestimated us, and I think they’re underestimating us again.” He has confirmed that he plans to step aside after fighting the European election campaign in time for a new leader to be in place by the summer. While he championed EU freedom of movement as “a precious thing”, the MP for Twickenham also said being a part of the union meant the country was better at tackling threats like data cooperation and protecting itself from being bullied by the US president, Donald Trump. “We don’t deal with the Trump problem by grovelling and inviting him here for state business,” he added. Also speaking at the launch, the former secretary of state for climate change and Lib Dem MP for Kingston and Surbiton Sir Ed Davey said: “Sometimes people say they don’t know what we stand for – I think they get the message now.” Emphasising the importance of European arrest warrants, the EU’s law enforcement body Europol and other intelligence-sharing services in fighting “organised crime gangs, terrorists, murderers and rapists”, he said that “we also need to stop Brexit to stop the criminals.” “The world’s most dangerous criminals want Brexit to go ahead,” he added. “The criminals know that the security deal that has not yet even been agreed is weak, pathetic and will make every British citizen less safe than now. Brexit is a thousand crimes or more waiting to happen.”  Investment in the NHS, building affordable homes to help young people on to the housing ladder and more funding for schools were also listed as key issues for the party. Jo Swinson, Lib Dem MP for East Dunbartonshire, invoked the “tide of populism, with nationalism rolling in, Trump in the east and Putin in the west”. She added: “Surely this is not the time to turn our backs on our closest allies, our closest neighbours who share our liberal values.” "

If there’s a growing consensus about anything, it is that the man-made climate catastrophe is not going to happen, and that the scientists who believe to the contrary are becoming an ever increasingly obscure, fringe minority. Call them the natural-cause denialists.
Maybe many scientists are starting to feel that blaming everything on CO2 and neglecting the powerful sun, oceans and soot, among other factors, was a pretty stupid thing to do after all.
So it should not be a surprise that 2 more leading warmist German climate scientists Prof. Mojib Latif of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences and Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology have come out and conceded in newspaper interviews in the recent days that natural factors do have significant impacts on climate.
Latif says that half of the 0.8°C of global warming we’ve seen since 1850 is due to natural causes. Marotzke says that ocean cycles stopped the warming over the last 12 years.
At the “Die kälte Sonne” website, which was set up to counter false attacks on the book’s science, authors Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt direct our attention to the story and write as follows (reproduced with permission):
In an interview on February 9, 2012, with the Austrian daily Die Presse, renowned climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif confirmed 2 fundamental assumptions made in the book “Die kalte Sonne”. Latif thus openly agrees with the view of authors Vahrenholt and Lüning that natural climate factors are responsible for about half of the 0.8°C of warming since the start of industrialization in 1850. A similar 50/50 ratio of anthropogenic vs natural climate drivers is also assumed by Professor Nicola Scafetta of Duke University in North Carolina (see page 135 in the book) as well as by physicist Prof. Nir Shaviv of Jerusalem (see page 86) in their models.

Here Latif is clearly positioning himself in contradiction to the claims made by the IPCC, which pegged the natural climate factors as having an influence of only single digit percentages. The all important magnitude of the so-called radiative forcings are for CO2 (1.66 W/m²) and the sun (0.12 W/m²), and are thus worlds apart.
Moreover, Latif confirmed in the interview that the stop in global warming over the last 12 years was caused by ocean cycles. Authors Vahrenholt and Lüning have the very same opinion in their book. Anything else would be surprising as the book itself is in part based on Latif’s work. Interestingly, even climate scientist Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Plank Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg said in an interview yesterday with the TAZ daily that ocean cycles were the main reason for the stopped global warming since the year 2000. Thus the darling aerosol joker used by the IPCC is stripped of it’s importance.
Now that the first knee-jerk reactions to the book within the German climate science community are just about behind us, a real detailed look at the scientific content of the book “Die kalte Sonne” is beginning. Here it will hopefully become rapidly clear that the book offers a realistic interpretation that is supported by the results of numerous peer-reviewed scientific papers.”
Very profound admissions. So natural factors sun and oceans are real factors – aerosols are stripped of their importance. Conclusion: CO2 is disappearing as a major climate factor with every passing day – making the IPCC models obselete!
It needs to be pointed out that Jochem Marotzke less than 5 years ago warned: “There’s not much time remaining!” Now today he says the ocean cycles (unexpectedly) have given us 12 extra years, thus conceding they indeed do have major impacts on the climate after all. Yes, he seems to be learning something.
And simple logic tells us that if these ocean cycles have had an impact over the last 12 years, then it must also be conceded that the negative phases of the PDO and AMO will also continue to have an impact in the decades ahead. Anything else is just not serious.
Of course Latif and Marotzke may try to deny or underplay their latest admissions, which they probably do not even realise they have made. But their words are on the record for everybody to see. Read them yourselves!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language online The Local, here, brings us an example of how overzealous and authoritarian greens masquerading as concerned environmentalists can be. Hat-tip DirkH.
Winfried Kretschmann, the newly elected green governor of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, has not only announced that he will decide the course of the southern German state, but also the course of the two luxury car makers Mercedes Benz and Porsche headquartered there.
Just forget the top managers at the world’s leading luxury car makers, whose expertise and managerial skill have made Mercedes and Porsche gold plated brand names over the last decades. Forget companies writing their own mission statements and producing their own visions for the future. And forget companies navigating through the uncertainties of the future and drawing up middle-term and long-term business plans. All this now has been taken over by the supremacist Greens, at least in Baden-Württemberg.
No longer will Porsche and Mercedes engineer and manufacture the world’s top luxury automobiles and sports cars on their own terms, but rather they will have to content themselves with ignoring the wishes of their markets and shift to building cars that suit the expectations of a few green masterminds. Kretschmann says:
I expect that premium producers create energy and resource-efficient product lines. That could be a little more expensive, as most of those who buy limousines can take it. Above all, Daimler and Porsche should see themselves as mobility companies in five years’ time – and no longer just as car factories.”
You got that? Your cars aren’t expensive enough. Personally, I drive a modest Mercedes C-Class, and if Mercedes bends to the will of these enviro-Stalinists, then it will definitely be the very last one I buy. I have no interest in buying a car from a company that hands the management reins over to a bunch of arrogant dogmatist zealots. The Local writes:
‘Petrol-greedy luxury limousines are not the future,’ he said. ‘We should no longer only export cars, but also a new idea of what a chic car is in the future. I believe that the companies think this way too’.”
Getting people off the streets and autobahns
The target of all this is to restrict people’s mobility. According to The Local, this green Burgermeister-Meisterburger has also announced an array of decrees, much to the delight of his green, spear-carrying, attack-hungry warriors. The Local writes:
The incoming Green-led state government of Baden-Württemberg has unveiled plans to introduce a speed limit on the autobahns and replace vehicle tax with road tolls. It also wants to build wind farms in the region.”

The Local adds:
The road tax should apply to all roads, he said, and should be, ‘as individualised as possible, thus related to time, place, length of road use and type of car.’ This should reduce traffic in total, he said.”
This is shorthand for: “We’re going to put the screws to poorer people and those living out in the countryside (in nature), and make mobility affordable only for the well-heeled.
Industrialising the Black Forest with windmills

The windfarms he mentions above of course will be built inland, and not offsore in the North or Baltic seas where the wind blows enough for them to reach just over 20% of their rated capacity. Inland, however, they’ll have to be content with reaching just over 15% of their rated capacity. This means they will have to put up about 7 times more wind generators to deliver 100% capacity – that is when the wind blows hard enough. And when the wind doesn’t blow, then it doesn’t matter how many you install – you’ll be forced to import nuclear power, from across the border, from France.
Where exactly will the windparks go? The Local writes:
‘Wind farms would also form a part of the state’s future,’ said Kretschmann. ‘There will be completely new windparks – large, modern facilities – above all in the Mittelgebirge, on the Schwäbisch Alb and in the Black Forest,’ he said.”
Citizens in these areas, organise, and fight this onslaught on your landscape and heritage. These pseudo-greens are going to industrialise your landscape with ugly moving white giants. They did it in my hometown in Vermont, and the beauty there is now gone. Like in Vermont, big, profiteering industrial bastards are behind it all, and they will profit handsomely from it. It has nothing to do with environmentalism.
What does Dear Leader Kretschmann say about windmills polluting the landscape?
‘A change of the industrial society changes the landscape; that is the price that we have to pay for progress. One cannot discard nuclear power, damn coal-generated electricity, want to maintain living standards and at the same time demand that the landscape should not change.’
Interesting times are ahead.
All of it, we will recall, is based on the loony proposition, floated by charlatan scientists, that man controls the climate. Germany pursues yet again another version of the 1000-year empire. Time to present this guy with a cuckoo-clock – because cuckoo is where he’s headed.

and here: Police raid organic farm
=========================================
The German Die Welt online here reports that veterinary and medical experts are now saying that biogas plants may be the source of the lethal E. coli bacteria now running rampant through Germany. Although the disaster is nowhere the scale we saw in Bhopal, India, so far we have seen 18 dead and over 500 hospitalized. And needless to say, millions of Europeans are spooked.
Die Welt writes:
Ernst-Günther Hellwig, director of the Agricultural and Veterinary Academy in Horstmar, warns that the bacteria likely comes from new sources, saying the epidemic is a house-made German problem. ‘It is possible that the EHEC contagion comes from biogas plants,’ he said.”
Die Welt also reports that Hellwig has long been critical of biogas plants. Yet biogas industry proponents claim there is no connection between the current E. coli outbreak and biogas plant operations.
Hellwig is not alone in this belief. Die Welt also writes that laboratory director Bernd Schottdorf, founder of the 1500-employee private medical laboratory Schottdorf MVZ in Augsburg, the biggest in Europe, also thinks the connection is possible. “Spores survive the biogas plants’ prescribed hygienization of 70°C without a problem“, he says. “We don’t know if the hygienization is properly carried out at all biogas plants.” When waste product from biogas plants is spread on fields, they can contaminate the vegetables.

North Germany’s unusual dry weather and drought conditions, where it did not rain for weeks during the springtime, may have played a role in the spread of the deadly bacteria. Spores can stay on plants for a long time, as they don’t get washed off by rain. The biogas plant substrate, which is a by-product and is used as a fertilizer, probably didn’t get washed off the crops by any rain. Currently there are 6800 biogas plants in Germany and their inspection is disorganised.
North German drought and dirty irrigation and “unwashed” crops
Manure slurry spreaders also used for irrigation.
Die Welt also writes that experts believe the unusually dry spring weather also may have led farmers to irrigate their crops using their liquid-manure spreaders. Farmers sometimes irrigate crops during dry spells using liquid manure spreaders, as this German manufacturer suggests here (scroll down to Liquid manure Distribution and irrigation systems).
The problem is that these liquid manure tanks are of course dirty and so contaminate the water, which in turn contaminates the crops. And then if it doesn’t rain for days or weeks, the crops stay contaminated through the time they are harvested.
Some points are clear: 1) The source of the E. coli is Northern Germany, which is home to many biogas plants and where agricultural manure fertilizer is widely used. The weather in the run-up to the start of the epidemic was very dry. Indeed, more detective work is needed to trace back the cause.
The online  FOCUS magazine here also brings up the biogas plant issue, hat-tip DirkH.
Biogas plants are also suspected of causing DEADLY BOTULISM in North German Agriculture, read here. Looks like all the well-intentioned green growing is leading to a trail of death and illness instead of natural health and cleanliness.

"This has been called the climate change election, and with good reason: concern about the climate and environment has never been greater. A Lowy Institute poll found nearly two out of three adults believe climate change is the most serious threat to Australia’s national interests, an 18-point-increase in five years. It was taken before a landmark UN global assessment defined the extent of the unprecedented biodiversity crisis facing the planet, with a million species at risk of extinction and potentially dire consequences for human society.  Australia has a big stake in these issues. It is one of the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters on a per-capita basis and in the top 20 for total pollution, with a footprint greater than Britain or France. It is already experiencing the effects of climate change, including increased heatwaves and mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and is the global leader in mammal extinction. There are clear choices between the parties on these issues at this election. Guardian Australia looks at how the policies of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens line up. Carbon pollution in Australia has been rising since the Coalition repealed carbon price laws in 2014. The country is on track to meet its modest Kyoto protocol target – that emissions be 5% lower in 2020 than in 2000 – but not 2030 targets. Coalition Under the Paris climate deal, the Coalition says it will cut emissions to 26% less than they were in 2005 by 2030. It is significantly less than what scientists advising the government say is necessary for Australia to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris deal (a 45%-63% cut by 2030 compared with 2005). Scott Morrison explained in February how he planned to meet this goal. About eight points of the cut would come from using what are known as Kyoto carry-over credits. Unlike international and domestic carbon credits created through offset projects, Kyoto carry-over credits do not represent an actual reduction in carbon dioxide. They are effectively bonus credits that Australia wants to award itself for beating its low 2020 target. It is unclear if they will be allowed under the Paris deal; other developed countries have said they will not use them. Developing countries do not have the option. The Coalition nominates two other significant sources of emissions reduction. One is the direct action emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as the climate solutions fund, under which farmers and businesses bid for cash from taxpayers to cut pollution. The government announced in February it would spend an extra $2bn on it over 10 years, but that was stretched to 15 years in the April budget, including just $189m over the next four. While some projects backed by the fund are widely considered worthwhile, an investigation by Guardian Australia has found questions over its design and uncertainty over what taxpayers were getting for their money. The biggest flaw is in the administration of the other half of the direct action program, known as the safeguard mechanism. It was supposed to put a limit on industrial emissions to ensure they did not just wipe out the cuts taxpayers are buying through the emissions reduction fund, but in practice industrial emitters have mostly been allowed to increase pollution without penalty. The Coalition has criticised Labor for planning to use the safeguard mechanism to do what government frontbencher Greg Hunt designed it to do: reduce emissions. The other major measure on the Coalition’s carbon budget chart (see p8) is “technological improvements”, which have not been explained. An analysis by scientists from Climate Analytics released on Friday found the Coalition’s target was insufficient to deal with the climate challenge and said there was no evidence the government planned to release further policies. Labor Labor has a more ambitious emissions target: a 45% cut by 2030, which Climate Analytics says falls just within what is necessary for Australia to play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5C, and net zero emissions by 2050. Rather than an across-the-board carbon price similar to what it introduced in 2011, it is promising different policies for different parts of the economy. On electricity, it wants to bring in a national energy guarantee, a policy devised and abandoned by the Coalition. Similarly, for heavy industry, it plans to toughen up the government’s safeguard mechanism to set limits and reduce them over time. It is yet to say what the limits would be and the trajectory – how fast they would be cut – but it says both the electricity and industrial sectors will have to meet the 45% target. It wants 50% of new cars to be electric by 2030 and has pledged vehicle emissions standards to limit transport pollution, building on work done under the Coalition but not adopted. It would boost the use of carbon offsets from Australia, allow business to buy an undefined amount from offsets from overseas and has suggested it would limit land clearing. Despite some scary headlines about costs, Labor’s ambition and direction has been praised by policy analysts and scientists. But unanswered questions remain. It has not released a carbon budget explaining how it would hit the 45% target. And it has been accused of hypocrisy for a promise to spend $1.5bn to boost natural gas supply in Queensland and to connect the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo sub-basin to the east coast. Green groups say the emissions that result could dwarf those from Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine. Speaking of which: Labor has struggled to articulate a position on the mine. Shorten has expressed personal reservations but not committed to either blocking or supporting it. Greens The Greens want emissions cut by between 63% and 82% by 2030 compared with 2005, and zero emissions by 2040. Their policies include ending fossil fuel subsidies, phasing out fossil fuel mining and electricity generation by 2030, vehicle emissions standards that become a ban on new petrol-fueled cars by 2030 and an economy-wide carbon price to reflect the true cost of pollution. A new public authority, Renew Australia, would lead the transition to low emissions. Climate Analytics says the Greens’ goals sit well within what the scientific literature says would be Australia’s fair share of emissions cuts. Coalition The government does not have a renewable energy policy for beyond 2020. It stresses there was significant investment – about $20bn – on large-scale clean energy last year. Most of this has come from the national renewable energy target, which it considered abolishing under Tony Abbott but ultimately reduced under a deal with Labor. The target won’t fund new generation after next year but existing support is maintained through to 2030. While the industry is surging, and the Australia Energy Market Operator has found there was likely to be about 46% clean energy by 2030 on the current trajectory, analysts expect new investment to fall if the target is not replaced. The Coalition’s big clean energy play is hydro. It is putting $1.4bn into Snowy Hydro 2.0, which is not expected to be operational until 2024, and supporting the “battery of the nation” project in Tasmania. Both promise “pumped hydro” – energy storage that can be called when needed. These projects have been found to make economic sense only if more coal plants close, but Morrison denies this is the plan. The government has indicated it would underwrite some new energy projects, having released a shortlist of 12. The list includes one coal upgrade project in New South Wales. Labor Bill Shorten has promised 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. He says he will aim to win support in parliament for the national energy guarantee, which would force energy companies to reduce emissions and meet reliability obligations. If unsuccessful, he would tip $10bn into the government’s green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and create a $5bn fund to modernise the power grid. Other promises include $200m over the next four years for a household battery program, with a goal of 1m homes having batteries by 2025. Greens The Greens want the electricity grid to be 100% renewable energy by 2030. They would extend and boost the renewable energy target and back public investment, feed-in tariffs and regulations for clean generation, storage and energy conservation. Green groups, academics and lawyers have been campaigning for changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the national environment law introduced by the Howard government 20 years ago. They say the law is designed to maintain the minimum viable population of a species or habitat while developments are approved, that the environment minister of the day has too much discretion over decisions and that Australia’s natural estate is declining rapidly on its watch. Coalition The government rejects claims the EPBC Act is not fit for purpose. It would review it, as required under the legislation, but not replace it. It promises a $100m environment restoration fund to clean up coasts and waterways, protect threatened species, boost recycling and reduce waste. Up to $10m of this would be dedicated to creating safe havens for threatened species. Scientific assessments of the policy range from not adequate to poor, especially in light of a 38% cut to the federal environment department budget. Fewer than 40% of threatened species had recovery plans last year to prevent their extinction, and the department has admitted it does not know if the recovery plans that are in place are being implemented. The Coalition does not have a policy to limit land clearing, one of the major threats to biodiversity. Morrison’s response to the shocking picture painted by the UN biodiversity report was to warn about the impact of “green tape” on business and to claim the government had passed legislation that does not actually exist. Labor Shorten says he would introduce new environment laws and a federal environment protection authority to oversee them, meeting a call from the Labor environment action network. There has been little detail on what the laws would do and what powers the authority would have. Its environment spokesman, Tony Burke, has said not to expect the changes in the first year of a Shorten government. The ALP promises a $100m native species protection fund, $200m over five years to double the number of Indigenous rangers managing the land and $200m for urban rivers and corridors. It would reverse the Coalition’s reduction in marine protected areas. Scientists said Labor’s plan appeared to be a positive initial step towards addressing the disaster highlighted by the UN but many questions remained unanswered. They stressed the need not just to protect threatened species, but to save and restore ecosystems to prevent further decline, and said more funding would be required. Greens The minor party also backs new environmental laws and a federal environmental protection authority but stresses it must be independent of politicians and have real teeth. It has proposed a $2bn nature fund to tackle invasive species, create new safe havens for threatened mammals, fund recovery plans for at-risk species, pay for 10,000 environment managers and boost the number of Indigenous rangers. It promises an expanded, science-based network of marine parks and an end to native forest logging. Scientists consider their policies the most thorough, though it has been noted that – as with the major parties – they are not making explicit the impact biodiversity loss would have on the economy. With China shutting down its market for Australia’s recycling and growing community desire to cut rubbish, all parties have made commitments to reduce plastic and deal with other waste. The commonwealth, the states and the territories have a goal of 100% of Australia’s packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 at the latest. Coalition The government promises $100m for a recycling investment fund, $20m to accelerate recycling of batteries, electrical goods and plastic oil containers and wants to halve food waste by 2030. It would spend $20m researching new ways to deal with plastics, including using recycled material in manufacturing and construction. Green group WWF has criticised the government for not promising to ban single-use plastic. It says the European Union, which is targeting 10 types of single-use plastics, should be the benchmark. Labor The ALP says it will ban lightweight, single-use plastic bags and micro-beads by 2021 and create a national container deposit scheme that would pay people for recycling drink vessels. Other commitments include a $60m national recycling fund and targets for federal government purchasing of recycled products. Greens In addition to phasing out single-use plastics, the Greens would bring in a national container deposit scheme and similar programs for electronic waste, tyres and mattresses. They want an extra $500m over five years for infrastructure and a plastics research centre. Their headline goal is zero waste. The world’s biggest living structure suffered mass coral death due to increased ocean temperatures in 2016 and 2017, a disaster that has drawn attention across the globe. Coalition The government’s 2050 reef plan is designed to reduce local pressures and increase resilience to climate change, but not deal with climate change itself, the biggest threat facing the reef. Last year it gave $444m to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a charity set up by business leaders that at the time of the announcement had only six full-time staff. The money is to be spent on improving water quality, crown-of-thorns starfish control and research. The Coalition has not explained why the foundation was chosen over government agencies. Labor The ALP says it would strip the foundation of most funding and reinvest it with public agencies dedicated to reef protection. It promises to work internationally to improve the response to climate change and to protect biodiversity and oceans. Greens The Greens say they would commit $2bn to improve water quality and stress the need for substantial action on climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wanted to hit the sack but a video clip in English of some excerpts from an interview of John Holdren by German intellectual paper DIE ZEIT. Click here::
http://www.zeit.de/wissen/2011-03/holdren-chefberater-obama
At about the 3:40 mark, Holdren is asked what will be the sciences of the future and the challenges. This takes him to climate change:
We are fortunately getting better, and we need to get better at understanding some very big systems, science systems issues including for example the science of ecosystems, the formation and fertilisation of soil, the pollination of crops, the regulation of climate. All of these things I think sometimes get lost in the discussion of the importance of infotech and nanotech and biotech. We need to understand how the parts fit togther, how they work because we are not yet remotely ready technologically to make planet earth into a speceship where all systems are designed by engineers. We still need nature, We need to understand how it works.”
I thought the science was settled. But  Holden now admits that we still need to understand how it all fits together – how it works. So how CO2 controls linearly controls the temperature, we we keep seeing in their charts, is a bit puzzling to me.

"Two long pipes imported from Iceland pump air out into the audience while glowing platforms designed to resemble multiple icebergs sit mounted on a stage behind two curtains made of chain. This isn’t your ordinary show, which stands to reason considering Björk isn’t your ordinary artist.  In fact, nothing the Icelandic singer-songwriter has done in her singular, 26-year solo career has been confined to normalcy or the concept of boxes or borders, with Björk gaining an acclaimed reputation as the ultimate experimenter in not only music, but fashion and visuals. Perhaps that’s why when The Shed, the new theater located in New York City’s recently opened Hudson Yards complex, was looking for a marquee name to help open their state-of-the-art space, they commissioned an artist who can explore the room for all it’s worth. Björk’s Cornucopia, a masterclass in exploration, is a show that’s being billed as her “most elaborate staged concert to date”, which plays with ideas of sound, lighting, costumes, video projection and set design. Created by Björk and directed by the acclaimed Argentinian film-maker Lucrecia Martel, making her theatrical debut, the production is concocted to be an immersive experience and is funneled straight from the singer’s unique psyche. It’s strung together using selections from her 2017 album Utopia, a bright record rooted in love and the bliss of romance. (She’s described it in the past as her “Tinder” album.) The overarching theme of Cornucopia, as well as the one that permeates most of Björk’s work is nature, with the majority of the imagery coming from flowers and fauna. (After all, to some she is chiefly remembered as the artist who wore a swan dress to the 2001 Academy Awards; the relic is currently displayed about 40 blocks uptown as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Camp exhibition.) Supporting the visuals, natural sounds are employed, with one instrumentalist pouring water into a basin hooked to a microphone; the splashing liquid timed to the melody. Björk explores her shimmering utopia with the help of an eclectic cast. Chief among them are the Hamrahlid, a buoyant Icelandic children’s choir who, in addition to supporting the singer in a variety of songs, also serve as Cornucopia’s opening act, belting out both covers from Bjork’s vast discography and traditional Icelandic songs. There’s also Viibra, the moniker of an all-female flute septet that flanked the stage boasting flowing white costumes who, in succession, frequently jut their instruments in the air mid-song. The septet also supports Björk’s previously stated mission statement that Cornucopia is about females supporting each other. It’s an idea that’s brought to life when four members of the septet play a large, specially made circular flute that’s suspended from the air. (It requires the breath from all four to work.) Fresh off his high-profile appearance at Coachella, serpentwithfeet also joined Björk on stage for Blissing Me, a remix of her Utopia track. The two brought the collaboration to life in a surprising R&B mashup, with Björk’s tender vocals juxtaposed to the thumping of serpentwithfeet’s LGBTQ love ballad. (Example lyrics: He reminds me of the love in me.) With an artist so firmly rooted in the natural world, the performance also doubled as a dire warning on climate change. Halfway through the production, a message about the dangers of pulling out of the Paris climate accord is projected. As the show, which celebrates the beauty of the Earth nears its end, a powerful message courtesy the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is presented. “You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes,” she says via a video message, portions of which were greeted by cheers from the audience. “Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. If the solutions in this system are so impossible to find, then maybe we should change the system itself.” Björk’s Cornucopia will be at The Shed in New York through 1 June 2019."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to reviews of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s controversial best-selling Die kalte Sonne book, now sweeping across Germany, Dr. Peter Heller, think tank member and contributor at the German Science Skeptical blog, has published what up to now has been one of the most thoughtful and insightful essays – a welcome change from all the shallow and emotional reviews we’ve seen from the knee-jerk warmists.
One of Heller’s main points is that anyone claiming climate can be predicted and is now solely “created” by man is as scientific as the theory of finger-snap-and-behold creationism. The following is an excerpt translated from Heller’s essay (emphasis added).
Vahrenholt and Lüning do not assume the role of scientists, but that of science journalists. The demand to present the book’s assertions in an appropriate form using the appropriate tool (such as publication in a suitable journal) for scientific internal debate just proves once again the totalitarian demand of the climate creationists. Not only are they blind with respect to the already acquired findings that contradict their world view, but they are also no longer able to distinguish between a scientific activity, and the reporting of that activity.
Vahrenholt und Lüning led me to the term “climate creationist“. In the same way their book helps to put energy policy back on the track of rationality, it could also promote the return of reason in climate debate. In my view their main message is: We do not know what the future has in store for us. […] Somehow this simple knowledge has become lost in our society over the past decades.
Vahrenholt und Lüning deserve credit for thrusting the indefiniteness of our climatic future back into the public consciousness. They show us how natural factors could counter an anthropogenic warming.

Whoever refuses to permit such thoughts is acting unscientifically and against the pursuit of truth. And whoever opts to ignore these ideas, or even fights to create an environment that does not allow them to be even expressed, is also guilty of the same – just as someone who through religious fundamentalism is convinced of the creation of the world by a Creator, an Intelligent Designer. The theory of evolution describes the principles to which the development of life on Earth are subject. It neither provides a basis for the existence of mankind itself, nor for any other specific life form, nor does it provide any prognosis for the future. In fact it only tells us that random coincidences mutually interact. It’s completely open as what comes out as a product.
Where the conventional creationist sees a (supernatural) creator and designer behind the living environment, the climate creationist views man as the sole creator of the (future) climate. Die kalte Sonne holds up a mirror and shows us how they have meandered far away from science.
Particularly very important to observe is what Vahrenholt and Lüning only mention between the lines. Namely the question of to what extent does a possible warming of the lower layers of the atmosphere have whatsoever on man. Here the climate creationists see a huge danger and thus completely ignore possible adaptation strategies by human societies – completely in contradiction to the experiences of the last thousands of years.”
Neglecting strategies for adaptation is one way of creating your own eventual premature downfall. Unfortunately we are dealing with climate fundamentalists, zealots, and not scientists.
Anyone who knows the German language is urged to read Heller’s essay at Science Skeptical.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German-based European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) reports here on a paper just published by German scientists Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and Rainer Link appearing in the IJMPC Journal (International Journal of Modern Physics C), see here.
The full paper is available as a pdf file here in English.
The authors claim that CO2 does have a modest warming effect on the global temperature, but:
The effect is harmless (to the contrary, CO2-increases and slight global warming are beneficial for man and thus desirable) and show that the overly alarmist prognoses for future climate developments as fully inappropriate.”
The two authors applied a simplified model to determine a climate sensitivity for mean global warming for a hypothetical doubling of CO2 concentration to be 1.1 °C based on radiative flux without feedback effects.
The conclusion states (emphasis added):
This paper demonstrates that a basic 1-dimensional 1-layer model with different atmospheric and top of atmosphere long wave radiation fluxes and temperatures, and including the reflections of the long wave radiation at the surface of the Earth and atmosphere can reproduce with excellent agreement the observed global average surface temperatures and radiation fluxes. This requires that all emission and absorption processes are correctly introduced into the model. In particular the direct emission of long wave radiation from Earth to space and the temperature dependence of latent and sensible heat have to be taken into account. Our model yields a change in the surface temperature of the Earth of roughly 1.1°C for an additional radiative forcing of 3.7 W/m2 – caused for instance by a hypothetical doubling of the present CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is in good agreement with the appropriate IPCC value, if no feedback ampli cation (or attenuation) is considered.”
Debate papers welcome
Readers are encouraged to join the discussion at the EIKE website linked above. Comments in English are welcome as well. Anyone who believes to have good physical critical points to introduce against the publication and is prepared to join the IJMPC peer-review process is warmly welcome to present a debate paper to the IJMPC.

"Of the nearly two dozen Democrats running for president, only two campaigns have so far laid out deadlines for transforming American life to slash the pollution that is warming the planet’s climate. The world’s scientists warn that governments have about 11 years to put in place strategies to cut emissions from power plants, cars, buildings, factories and land use. Once the next US president takes office, they will have nine years.  Passing large-scale climate legislation or writing new regulations for industry could take years, even if it is the next president’s primary priority. Any new administration will need to enter office with a detailed proposal and timeline to make a dent in the country’s share of climate pollution, experts agree. “The more that we delay, the harder it will be,” said Sonia Aggarwal, vice-president of the climate policy group Energy Innovation. “The sooner we get started, the more we’ll see deployment of new and increasingly very low-cost technologies that can reduce emissions.” Aggarwal said the changes required are “nothing short of remaking our economy” at a “fundamental level”. Energy Innovation advocates for tackling the biggest and least complicated emissions cuts first. That includes switching to clean sources of electricity and scaling back super-polluting gases, including methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and fluorinated gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. But as Democrats cast Donald Trump and other Republicans as resistant to even acknowledging the crisis, most Democratic candidates have yet to reach that level of detail in their policy proposals.  The Washington governor Jay Inslee and Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke want the US to be carbon-neutral within the next three decades. Both have unveiled detailed climate policy plans. Inslee would set milestones for three sectors that could drive major reductions: power, transportation and buildings. He has earned praise for his specificity. O’Rourke would also spend $5 tn on green infrastructure. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed banning new coalmining and oil drilling on public lands, which could cut US emissions but fall short of what scientists say is needed. A House climate committee will consider the idea. Some advocates say it is too soon to judge Democratic candidates on climate, with the 2020 election season starting earlier than ever. “At this early stage in the campaign, the most important thing is that the candidates get the policy right and commit to making climate change a top priority,” said Varshini Prakash, the leader of the youth-run Sunrise Movement. She said the group is looking for candidates who will “put the full weight of the government behind a transformation of our economy and society”. Lynn Scarlett, a vice-president for policy at the Nature Conservancy, said, “Regardless of the details, it is encouraging to see how elevated this issue has become. “We recognize that successfully getting policy across any finish line often means going in with some broad principles and some broad paradigm but using the legislative process in a give-and-take to work out the devilish details,” Scarlett continued. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders speaks frequently about the urgency of the climate change problem and supports a Green New Deal to fight global warming while making life more equitable for the poor and people of color. In 2015, Sanders unveiled a plan to cut US carbon emissions 80% by 2050, but so far this campaign season he has not laid out a timeline for the broad strategies he supports. Sanders has signed a pledge to refuse donations from fossil fuel interests, but other prominent Democrats have not, including the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, California senator Kamala Harris and former vice-president Joe Biden. Booker has an environmental justice plan to crack down on pollution in vulnerable communities, but he has not set a timeline for cutting carbon emissions. Harris is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal but has otherwise said little about what she would do. Biden entered the race last month, marketing himself as the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump. Biden was the first senator to propose climate legislation, but he has not endorsed a Green New Deal or any other specific policies recently. RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic party environmental caucus and political director of Climate Hawks Vote, said the campaigns are progressing on climate but running out of time. “We have two plans and a lot of buy-in on some concepts that have not been fleshed out into plans,” Miller said. One poll of Democrats recently showed climate change is their top issue. A United Nations report warned this week that as the Earth absorbs rising temperatures, human society is in jeopardy. Miller said with the first debate in less than two months, candidates should be expanding on their ideas more. “The sooner you lay out a plan early on, the sooner you stand out,” Miller said."

has a piece on the hype surrounding hurricane Irene, which we recall was supposed to end up being the most super-charged hurricane to hit the Northeast US in a quarter century.
Hurricane hype blows back against the warmists. (NASA photo)
It ended up being a hurricane of hype, and nothing else. But the FAZ writes if Irene had been a mega-size hurricane, it would have been just what the doctor ordered for unlocking the climate politics gridlock in the USA.
There, interest in climate change has slid so deep into the basement that even ex-presidential candidate and climate protection activist Al Gore has to be really worried about the impact of his new campaign which will begin on September 14.”
For Al Gore, Irene could have served as the ideal climate wake-up call. He certainly would have seized the opportunity to exploit it in citing it as the latest example of climate catastrophe. Can you imagine his disappointment? Unfortunately for Gore and the warmists, Irene fizzled and is now ironically being used by skeptics to illustrate rampant climate hysteria and media hype instead. The FAZ writes:
Indeed the climate-political winds turned in the opposite direction. Instead of acting as a ‘harbinger of climate change’, as the New York Times had written on Saturday, the tropical storm worked massively against hurricane and climate science.
Half-assed, superfluous, and damaging – these are some attacks that scientists now find themselves having to deal with because, though they were correct with their time forecasts, they were nowhere near correct with the hurricane’s strength forecast.”
Here the FAZ doesn’t know that the forecasters were also incorrect with the projected route of the hurricane, as forecasters made huge adjustments with each route  forecast cone they issued. And by the time the hurricane made landfall it had degraded down to a mere Cat 1 hurricane, and shortly thereafter to a tropical storm. By this time, the entire US national weather and climate forecasting network and large parts of the media had become a laughing stock.
The alarmists are trying to argue back, sometimes with what appear to be quite dubious claims. Stefan Rahmstorf, citing Nature, claims that for every 1°C of temperature rise, there is a 31% increase in Cat 4 or 5 storms. The FAZ also brings up Kerry Emanuel:

At the Hurricane Conference, leading American expert Kerry Emanuel showed for the Atlantic that the correlation of sea temperature and hurricane energy has strengthened over the last five years.”
Really? Looking at the last fives years, one would have to assume the globe is cooling rapidly.
GLOBAL HURRICANE FREQUENCY
 
Source:  http://policlimate.com/tropical/index.html
What does expert Ryan N. Maue say about climate and hurricanes?
But, the overall trend is flat proving conclusively that there is NO “overall” global increase in hurricanes, minor or major. Since natural variability such as El Nino and La Nina is the primary driver of global hurricane variability, any discussion of “climate change” impacts on TCs is woefully incomplete without acknowledging the effects of ENSO on global TC activity.”
Politically, Irene has turned out to be the ideal storm – for the skeptics! Indeed attention has been drawn to where the alarmists least want it: facts and reality.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo doubt Europeans this year have been enjoying a relatively mild winter this year, unlike the previous 3 winters. But it may be too early to start planning for spring. Mother Nature has a way punishing the overly optimistic.
At www.wetter24.de the ProfiKarten (professional charts) provide computer generated forecasts in the form of nice color charts. The first chart shows the outlook for 7 days – more of the same mild weather:
The cold is restricted to Scandinavia and Northern Russia.
But at the 10-day mark things really start to change. Of course when the computers grind through the next batch of data, the picture may change. 10-day forecasts are still not that accurate. For now, here’s the latest 10-day picture for Europe (temperature):
Note how the cold plunges through Eastern Europe and makes its way deep into Germany. After 14 days, much of Europe is forecast to be gripped by bitter cold:
So you might want to hold off putting the winter gear away!

Share this...FacebookTwitterMedia jubilation in the wake of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. And there should be.
But back in 2006, under a different President, the media reacted much differently when the US forces whacked another equally brutal and cold-blooded killer – Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He’s the butcher who taped the decapitation of Nicolas Berg (a video so chilling that I have refused to watch it). Abu Musab al-Zarqawi carried out numerous viscious acts of terrorism, beheadings and murder throughout Iraq.
You’d think the media would have rejoiced in the same way back then when al-Zarqawi was terminated?
Not a bit. Instead they sniffed and, openly accused our equally heroic US forces of brutality, cover-up and inhumane treatment – even depriving the poor butcher of his Miranda rights. Take for example the pathetic Democratic Underground website, which wrote:
U.S. troops arriving on the scene wrapped the man’s head in an Arab robe and began beating him, said the local man, who refused to give his name or show his face to the camera. His account could not be independently verified. The U.S. military made no mention of any physical contact between U.S. troops and al-Zarqawi other than an attempt to provide him with medical attention.
Here’s my theory: The US found Zarqawi still alive and he died/killed in custody. Then they called in the fighter jets to bomb his house after he was dead to cover up their deeds. In the process they killed 6(?) civilians including at least 1 child. If this is true then all 7 deaths should be considered murder.”
Or look at the equally pathetic CBS, who had no qualms about floating the allegations of excessive use of force by US forces – quoting some dubious witness named Mohammed:
‘When the Americans arrived they took him out of the ambulance, they beat him on his stomach and wrapped his head with his dishdasha, then they stomped on his stomach and his chest until he died and blood came out of his nose,’ Mohammed said, without saying how he knew the man was dead.”

Oh my God – such brutality. Even if it were true, I’d say good for them.
Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert with RAND Corp.,  couldn’t find anything positive in the killing of al Zarqawi, and is quoted in USA Today as saying:
Americans ‘take a kind of ‘Wanted’ poster approach” to the fight against terrorism and ‘therefore believe that if another desperado bites the dust, the war is over and we can ride off into the sunset’. In fact, Jenkins said, the long-term effect of Zarqawi’s death is likely to be slight, because the main players in Iraq’s violence — Baathist hard-liners, Shiite militias and Iraqi organized crime elements — remain.”
The AP and MSNBC here  gave Al Qaeda a voice to spread encouragement among their followers, quoting an Al Qaeda website:
We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s something the alarmist warmists can put in their pipes and smoke.
A new paper titled El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability from the Late Cretaceous Marca Shale of California authored by Andrew Davies, Alan E.S. Kemp, Graham P. Weedon, and John A. Barron shows that a permanent El Nino did not exist during that particular greenhouse episode.
The latest Cretaceous laminated Marca Shale of California permits a seasonal-scale reconstruction of water column flux events and hence interannual paleoclimate variability. The paper’s abstract continues (emphasis added):

Time series analysis of interannual variability in terrigenous sediment and diatom flux and in the degree of bioturbation indicates strong periodicities in the quasi-biennial (2.1–2.8 yr) and lowfrequency (4.1–6.3 yr) bands both characteristic of ENSO forcing, as well as decadal frequencies. This evidence for robust Late Cretaceous ENSO variability does not support the theory of a “permanent El Niño,” in the sense of a continual El Niño–like state, in periods of warmer climate.”

In the paper’s conclusion we find:

There is therefore little support for the existence of a ‘permanent El Niño’ in the Late Cretaceous, in the sense of the continual El Niño state depicted by Fedorov et al. (2006). […] there was robust ENSO variability in past “greenhouse” episodes and that future warming will be unlikely to promote a permanent El Niño state.”

This is not the first paper to suggest that. You can read about an earlier paper here.
So much for the scare that the CO2 emitted by man would propel the planet into a permanent El Nino burn-up, as Ray Pierrehumbert and climate models suggested here at RealCrock:
How will the El Niño phenomenon be affected by a global warming?
…how ENSO will respond to a global warming is still not settled. However, it seems that one common trait among some climate models is the indication that a global warming may result in a more a general El Niño-type average state (eg. Collins et al. 2005, Climate Dynamics, 24, 89-104. 19 and here).”
So much for “settled science”.

"Scott Morrison’s office has declined to say what legislation he was referring to when he said he had “been taking action” on a landmark UN report about the extinction of a million different species. On Monday, the UN released a comprehensive, multi-year report that revealed human society was under threat from the unprecedented extinction of the Earth’s animals and plants. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said the report “scared him”, during a debate on Wednesday. On Tuesday Morrison responded to the report saying: “We already introduced and passed legislation through the Senate actually dealing with that very issue in the last week of the parliament. We’ve been taking action on that.” But no legislation regarding animal conservation or the environment passed in the final week of parliament. When asked what the legislation was, the prime minister’s office did not reply. The office of the environment minister, Melissa Price, also did not respond when asked what legislation Morrison was referring to. The only legislation regarding animals that passed within the last few months is the industrial chemicals bill 2017, which set new regulations on testing cosmetics on animals. It was passed by both houses on 18 February – not in the last week of parliament, which was in April. Neither the prime minister nor the environment minister responded to clarify if this was the bill Morrison was referring to or whether he made an error. Tim Beshara, the federal policy director of the Wilderness Society, said Morrison appeared to have “alluded to a bill that doesn’t exist”. “The last bill to pass the Senate from the environment portfolio was about changing the board structure of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in 2018,” he said. “It looks like the prime minister of Australia is so desperate to move the debate off the environment as an issue that he has alluded to a bill that doesn’t exist so that journalists would stop asking questions about it.” Beshara said the cosmetics testing bill was “not about species extinction or the environment” and only helped “the rabbits in laboratories run by the cosmetics industry”. On Wednesday Morrison also railed against the expansion of environmental regulations, calling them “green tape”. He told the Sydney Morning Herald the expansion of “green tape” – including native vegetation laws – was delaying projects like mining and “costs jobs”. “[Labor] want to hypercharge an environment protection authority which will basically interfere and seek to slow down and prevent projects all around the country,” he said. Beshara said the timing of this with the mass extinction report showed “excellent comedic timing”. “What he is calling ‘green tape’, most Australians would call basic environmental protections,” he said. “I don’t expect the prime minister to know their numbats from their bandicoots, but I do expect them to know what bills their government has passed, and to respond to a globally significant UN report like this with the seriousness it deserves.” Also on Wednesday, Littleproud said the report showed Australia needed to invest in science and technology to give farmers the tools to adapt. He also highlighted the government’s commitment to spend $30m on an agricultural stewardship fund to help deal with biodiversity. Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said Littleproud deserved an award “as the first Morrison government minister flushed out and forced to respond to the UN report”. “Everyone else is in witness protection,” he said. He affirmed that Labor would deliver on its promise to introduce a federal environment protection agency. Earlier in January, Morrison’s media office also erroneously identified a different bill as helping the environment. The prime minister had told ABC News Breakfast in January that “environmental legislation … [that] is important for native species” was a priority for his government. When asked, Morrison’s staff said he was referring to “the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation amendment”. The prime minister’s office later said it had made an error, and Morrison was in fact referring to the industrial chemicals bill and its ban on animal testing."
