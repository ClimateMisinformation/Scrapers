Share this...FacebookTwitterMarch was an extremely cold month in Europe, especially in the southern part of eastern Germany. Veteran meteorologist Thomas Globig of MDR television gave us the March data for that region in the following video:

Meteorologist Thomas Globig on MDR German television. Hat-tip: www.readers-edition.de/
In the video Globig tells the viewers that in the city of Jena, March/2013 was the coldest since 1853, i.e. in 160 years!
Uncharacteristically for German television, Globig, an old pro in meteorology, someone who has been looking at weather patterns for decades, took some hard shots at the latest theory that claims low Arctic sea-ice in late summer causes extreme cold in late winter. At the 2:35 mark:
I’ve been hearing from some media that it’s all because of the ice melt in the Arctic. That is when the Arctic gets warmer, here it gets colder. Naturally that’s all nonsense! Back then [in 1853] there was no large summer ice melt in the Arctic. Therefore the whole thing has nothing to do with a trend. It is simply just plain weather!”
Readers Edition writes:
That’s a clear declaration of war aimed at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who here attempts to construct a relationship between the cold March and the sea ice melt in the Arctic.”
Thomas Globig adds: “It looks like we are going to have to discard some of the climate forecasts into the dustbin”.

Two days ago it tweeted a message telling the public that it only “feels like its cooling“. You see, the last 5 bitter-cold winters are just in our heads.

Figure 1: The DWD tweets: “Climate press conference of the DWD: #Temperature will continue rising globally – inspite it feels like it’s cooling #Winter.”
With every press release coming out of the DWD, two things are becoming clear: 1) It is becoming increasingly activist and misleading and 2) its statements are more and more confused and contradictory.
Temperatures are rising, even if they are stagnant
It seems the DWD can’t decide whether temperatures are rising or stagnating. Its latest (2013) press release says (my emphasis):
Global temperature, despite the current stagnation, is rising over the long term. ‘The Earth’s mean temperature has stagnated over the last 15 years at a high level. However, it is not necessary to rewrite the story of climate change,’ underscores Dr. Paul Becker, Vice President of the German Weather Service (DWD) at its annual climate press conference of the Federal Authorities in Berlin.”
In 2013 they write global temperature has stagnated over the last 15 years.
But in May 2012 they wrote:
The long-term trend of rising temperatures in Germany and worldwide continues uninterrrupted.”
Well, which statement is the false one?
Of course the DWD may protest and claim the warming is long-term trend and the stagnation is not. Is it really? Let’s take a look at the temperature data for Germany since 1890.

Figure 2: Germany’s annual mean temperature chart. Source: EIKE.
Above we see a more or less flat trend from 1890 to 1985, i.e. 95 years. It is only from 1985 to 2000 (15 years) that we have seen a temperature jump. And then from 2000 until now we have a declining trend. How can the brief rise of 1985 – 2000 be called “longterm” and the last 15 years not?
The following chart shows Germany’s mean annual temperature for the last 15 years.

Figure 3: Germany’s annual mean temperature. Data source: Deutsche Wetterdienst, Chart by: EIKE
The models from “climate scientists” projected 0.4°C of warming for the above shown period. But in reality, precisely the opposite occurred! The German Weather Service provides no explanation for this. Instead they simply tell readers that it’s getting warmer (over the long-term) and tweet that the cold is only in our heads.

Using the cold 1961-1990 period as a reference
Another trick the DWD likes to use is the cold period of 1960 – 1990 as the reference. This is how they come up with all the warm anomalies for today. The DWD writes on global temperatures:
Although the years 2011 and 2012 did not set any records globally – they are among the 12 warmest years since 1880 with an annual mean temperature of of 0.5°C over the 1961-1990 reference period.”
On Germany’s mean annual temperatures, again they use the cold 1960 to 1990 period (many weather outfits use the 1980 – 2010 period), see Figure 2.
Also the mean temperature of 9.1°C for 2012 was significantly over the mean of 8.2°C. The year 2012 was thus the 16th warmest since 1881. According to evaluations conducted by the DWD, 24 of the last 30 years in Germany were too warm.”
That is if you compare the last 30 years to the cold 1961-1990 period. This is how DWD creates headlines.
DWD says he (felt) cooling is caused by natural drivers
Natural influences currently are masking the man-made climate change. Even a few years without records, or isolated weather periods – for example a winter that is too cool – are thus not suitable to draw real statements on climate change. The question of climate change must be viewed over the long-term. We cannot expect that temperature increase to occur as smoothly as the CO2 increase in the atmosphere. Climate is impacted by many factors. Among them solar irradiance and volcanic activity, as well as large internal variability of the climate, for example the regular changes in the sea surface temperature in the Pacific through Eö Nino and La Nina.
Here they make it a point to totally ignore the powerful PDO and AMO cycles, who positive phases occurred precisely during the 1980 – 2000 warming. Best not to bring that up.
The DWD press release concedes there are many unknowns:
Becker: “All these effects overlap each other and  to some extent mask man-made climate change  – of which there is no doubt. Today for this reason we still cannot say which factors are 2/3 of the impact on our climate. But we’re convinced: Over the long run the man-made impact is the strongest and thus a further temperature increase is coming.”
This brings us to an old question that remains unanswered today: “If unknown factors are acting to cool global temperature today, then why are these very factors not repsonsible for the warming from 1980 to 2000?
The DWD spreads the fear of a public health crisis
The DWD finishes the press release by stoking up public health disaster scenarios resulting from climate change and embellishing in some unbridled speculation. Here it seems to be extending its outdated logo-chart way out to yonder. The DWD writes:
The temperature increase will not only be limited to outdoors, but will also impact indoors. Climate scientists have determined that from May to September for the upper Rhine region, in an average year, 15% of the average nighttime indoor temperatures are over 25°C. By the middle of this century, that figure will rise to 35%.”
The increasingly alarmist DWD also writes that life for people with allergies could get a lot more miserable.
People with allergies are going to suffer from pollen a lot more. […] Becker: ‘The bad news for people who have allergies is: They are going to have to struggle with other types of pollen and are going to have to live with longer pollen seasons.’ Just these few mentioned aspects show, according to DWD estimates,  what explosiveness as a whole the expected changes could have for the people in our country.”
This is ludicrous speculation based extrapolating the outdated curve that it uses as its logo. It’s hard to think of any orgnaization that has deteoriated so much in the klast few years.
It was once one of the world’s most renown and respected weather institutes. But in the recent years, during a time of cooling German temperatures no less, it has meandered off deep into the realms of the unserious, and is rapidly approaching the preposterous and absurd.
It’s not the climate that is radically changing – but rather it’s the institutions that monitor it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne by one the great warmist scientists today are finding it ever harder to come to terms with brutalities of climate reality, and are gradually being exposed as incompetent science buffoons. Back in 2011 Tamino’s (Grant Foster’s) careful analysis led him to conclude (my emphasis):
To answer the question posed in the title of this post: presently, Earth is warming at about 1.7 deg.C per century.  There’s good reason to believe that it’ll be warming even faster in the upcoming decades.  And there’s good reason to believe that this spells trouble for life on earth — including human life.”
And:
The conclusion is inescapable: the globe is warming, and shows absolutely no sign whatever of stopping or even slowing its warming. Any talk of “cooling” or even a “levelling off” of global warming over the last decade is absolute nonsense.”
Now just 2 years later, even the biggest warmists are conceding global temperatures have levelled. Hat-tip Dana Nuccitelli. My, how 2 years can change things.
I wonder if statistics designer Tamino (Grant Foster) is now ready to rein in all his big warming talk and apply some downward corrections. My guess is that he isn’t, and he will continue insisting that the models are infallible (though they’ve been totally wrong since the start):

Grant Foster sees no signs of levelling off. Source: drroyspencer.com/.
“Good reason for faster warming,” he writes. Really?
What reasons do you see, Mr. Foster? Models certainly aren’t reasons. To the contrary, model performance so far is actually excellent reason not to believe there is going to be faster warming.
Scientists like Foster would do well to wake up to reality very soon before find themselves totally marooned in Absurdistan.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman politicians are in race to see who can come up looking like the most dedicated world climate rescuer. So the ideas we hear coming from them often get really nutty.

To become a thing of the past? Soon German kids won’t know what meat is anymore. Public domain photo.
German tabloid Bild here a few days ago reported that Germany’s powerful Green party is calling for a ban of meat consumption. Of course the Greens are aware that it is not possible to restrict meat overnight, and so they are calling for a first major step: a “Veggie Day” once a week.
Bild writes:
The Greens want to forbid our meat!
The Greens want to enact a nationwide vegetarian day after the national elections [in September]. Once a week there is to be NO meat or meat sauce on the menu at public cafeterias!”
Veggie Day protects the climate!
Moreover, Bild paraphrases Green faction chief Renate Künast:
It’s also good for the climate, and leads to higher quality animal keeping. Moreover you’ll appreciate the Sunday roast much more after a ‘Veggie Day’, Künast says.”

Bild writes that the idea has already taken hold in the first cities in Germany: In Bremen no meat is offered one day a week at the cafeterias of public offices, schools and kindergartens.
Bild quotes Bremen’s socialist mayor:
 This is how everyone can make ‘a personal contribution’ to climate protection , says Bremen’s SPD mayor Jens Böhrnsen.”
But meat lovers ought not panic just right now. This eco-tyranny and climate protection delusions have already been rejected in other cities, Bild writes:
In Stuttgart in 2011 the ban of meat failed: Employees rebelled against ‘Veggie Day’ and simply refused to be told that they were to go without meat.”
Us meat-lovers can relax some, but we must always remain vigilant against the green zombies like Künast and Böhrnsen.
And don’t rely on the conservative Christian in-name-only CDU party to defend your rights; they are just as bad as the greens. Recall that they too are deep into the “climate protection” delusions themselves.
Ultimately, politicians want to control our entire lives: our health records, healthcare, light bulbs, the electricity we buy.
Already they are monitoring all our internet activity, our reading habits via e-books, our financial transactions, our cell phones, and they are monitoring us in our living rooms through digital televisions. So it’s only natural that they also want to tell us how, what, and when to eat.
Proposed food bans are nothing new. Denmark once tried to make fat a luxury for the rich. But that didn’t work out. Not because of a conservative party, but because the people spoke out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the last few days, Central Europe has been enjoying springlike sunshine with double-digit Celsius temperatures. Some readings rose to near 15°C (59°F). However, this will end brutally by the end of the week. At Twitter, meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net posted the chart of what’s ahead, for example, for the central German city of Hannover:

Chart source: Dominik Jung at Twitter
Note how temperatures will plummet to under -10°C by next week. Meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt says the coming March temperature plummet will be the worst since 1987. He writes:
Snow may accumulate even in the flatlands. Temperatures down to -15°C will arrive during the course of next week. It will be a cold blast of the sort we last saw in 1987.”
German online Bild here presents a video of the coming cold. Yet another freeze-thaw cycle – and I thought the streets were already a mess!
Germany’s and Austria’s 2012/13 DJF winter summary:
Meanwhile, the German Weather Service, Deutsche Wetterdienst, (DWD) issued its summary report for the 2012/13 DJF meteorological winter for Germany, which pretty much represents Central Europe.
This winter has been characterized by its darker, colder and snowier conditions. It was the most sunless German winter since measurements began in 1951. On average tthe sun appeared for only 96 hours over the three-month period, which is only 62% of the mean of 154 hours.

As a whole, the 2012/13 winter for Germany was 0.6°C colder than the 1981-2010 average. That’s the 5th time in a row that winter has been colder than normal.
Germany as a whole was had above average precipitation. On average 210 l/m² of precipitation fell in the winter of 2012/13 – the long-term average is 181 l/m². On 21 January almost all of Germany was covered by snow.
Record snowfall in Austria
Austria’s ZAMG Weather Service writes that the DJF winter was characterised by having the lowest amount of sunshine since 1904. Sunshine was 37% below normal.
The mean temperature for the 3-month period over Austria was 0.1°C colder than the long-term 1981-2010 average.
Precipitation across Austria was well above normal, with new snowfall records being set in some regions. Austria’s 2012/13 winter saw 35% more precipitation than the 1981-2010 mean. The ZAMG writes that Reichenau an der Rax saw 330 mm of precipitation over the three-month period, the most since records began in 1865. In Bregenz 263 cm of new snow fell over the period – 4 times the average. On February 9 Bregenz set a new record for snow amount since measurements began in 1936.
Eisenstadt saw three times more snow than average and Vienna saw two times more snowfall than the 30-year long-term mean. Snowfall records were set at a number of other locations.
In both the German and Austrian summaries, there’s no mention of “climate change”, which otherwise almost always appears in reports when warmer than normal temperatures are the case.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the sporadic, unpredictable supply of solar and wind energies increasingly become a part of Germany’s power mix, the country’s electrical grid is becoming more and more unstable and thus vulnerable to a massive power outage.
Dr. Klaus Peter Krause has an article at www.freiewelt.net called “Renewable, but not controllable“, which looks at Germany’s ever more precarious power grid, all thanks to its madly rushed foray into renewable energies, particularly wind and sun. Krause describes the situation in Germany as: “Getting closer to a power outage – The energy policy of madness“.
In the article he brings up a presentation by 2 German power grid experts, Dr. Bernd Benser and Prof. Helmut Alt, which was made at an event organized by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).
Most people have experienced a power outage at one time or another, and so may view it as only a nuisance. However, such power outages are almost always very local, isolated, and usually last only a few minutes or a couple of hours at most. But a prolonged, large-scale power outage would be much more than just a nuisance. It would be a catastrophe for a developed country like Germany. Fortunately, few of us have ever experienced that. That may change soon.
Peter Krause reports on how Benser and Alt described what would happen if a large-scale power outage did hit Germany:
What happens when the power goes out
Benser and Alt warned of the consequences of such a power outage and described what it would mean. Here’s just an excerpt: The communication system would immediately go silent or would collapse, if it could function, because of overloading, Fire departments, aid organizations and law enforcement could no longer be reached, payment systems would come to s standstill, ATM machines would no longer dispense cash, water supply and wastewater removal would no longer operate, traffic would jam up completely due to non-functioning traffic lights and signals, entire logistics systems would collapse, production systems would stop functioning, refrigeration systems would stop and perishables would rapidly spoil, air conditioning would cease at in large poultry farms, cows would not be milked, in buildings the electrical blinds for windows would not operate in the morning, also (after 4 hours, at times after just 2 hours) plundering would have to be expected, the medical care system would be crippled as about 90 percent of German hospitals are unable to supply themselves with emergency power for more than 48 hours. According to Benser, six days are needed to bring power back online after a total power outage. “‘n the worst case, we estimate 200,000 dead.“ In high-tech Germany, the most important things practically stop functioning. A large scale power blackout is a national catastrophe scenario.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel June 2006: “For the Baltic ringed seal climate change could mean its demise warned a team of scientists at the Baltic Sea Experiment (Baltex) conference in Goteborg. This is because the warming leads to the ice on the Baltic Sea to melt earlier and earlier every year.”
Seven years later, in 2013, The Local reports: “Late-season freeze sets Baltic ice record”
Hat-tip: pekke/a>.
Gee how could this happen? Some German scientists are claiming that this winter hasn’t been that cold. For example Prof. Peter Lemke of the Alfred Wegener Institute says:
In the typical winter months of December and January it was in Germany a bit too warm. In February the mean temperature on the other hand was a bit below normal. That means at the end of the 3-month period it was pretty much evened out, and looking back we had a completely normal winter.”
Prof. Mojib Latif has been appearing in the media confirming the same basic message. One has to wonder if the two scientists have become totally detached from reality.
The Baltic Sea and other scientists do not appear to agree with the global-warming-obsessed Lemke and Latif. The Local writes:

Ice breakers navigating the Gulf of Bothnia have been astounded at the record spread of ice on the Baltic Sea, while scientists say they have never seen anything like it.
‘Since record keeping began in the sixties, we’ve never encountered anything like this before,’ ice breaker Ulf Gulldne told the local newspaper Örnsköldsviks Allehanda.
On March 29th, 176,000 square kilometers of the Baltic Sea was covered in ice, a record for the time of year.”
To blame is the long protracted winter with its unusually cold temperatures. The Local quotes a captain of an ice-breaker:
I’ve never seen this much ice this late in the season,” said Karl Herlin, captain of the icebreaker Atle.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe website of geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, authors of the new book: “The Neglected Sun“, has a general solar activity progress report with some interesting observations on solar cycle 24 and comments about upcoming solar cycle 25.
=================================
The Sun In July 2013 – News and Some Statistics
By Frank Bosse
According to the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC) in Brussels, the “official” solar sunspot number (SSN) last month was 57.0. Thus it reached only 57% of the mean value of cycles 1-23 in the corresponding time period, see graph below: “Average Solar Cycle”:

The chart is a plot of sunspot number (SSN) versus months after the start of the cycle.dark blue: mean value of cycles 1-23, red curve is the current cycle 24, and the gray curve is cycle no. 5.
If you calculate using the entire Cycle 24. then we get an activity level that is only about 45% of the mean value. The comparison of all cycles up to the current month:

You have to go back all the way to 1827 (SC 7) to find a comparably small activity like what we have seen since 2009. Leif Svalgaard once called the sun a “messy place” in order to tell us that our mother star is always full of surprises. Could there be an unexpected increase in Solar Cycle 24 activity coming up and what is the probability of that happening? Here the solar sunspot number anomalies of the previous chart (ASSA 56 – the accumulated solar sunspot anomaly after 56 months after the start of the cycle) is compared to the total sum of the anomalies (ASSA acc) of the previous cycles 1-23:

Result: There’s a very high probability (average 88%) that we will continue to see an extremely weak solar cycle. A lot indicates an anomaly of -2400 at the end of Cycle 24. Signs show that we are already past the maximum. Also renowned the website spaceweather.com determined this on 26 July 2013. Readers of our monthly Sonneninfo already suspected this earlier (see “The sun in June 2013 – on the way to a grand minimum? New work on the possible consequences“). Here the polar solar fields were depicted. Last month also confirmed the measurement data: The polarity has switched and the maximum is behind us. So how long will the weakening of SC24 take?
This question is hardly unimportant for telling us what to expect from the upcoming SC25. It has long been known that a long solar cycle of weaker activity is followed by a similar cycle, and vice versa. When you plot the length of the previous cycle with accumulated sunspot anomaly (“ASSA acc”) together with the following cycle, you get this interesting diagram:

Blue curve shows SCn (months) *(-1); Red curve ASSA (SCn+1)
The inverted cycle length of Cycle 1 (blue) was compared with the ASSA acc (red) of the subsequent Cycle 2. Just the length of Cycle 23 (May 1996 until November 2008: 150 months instead of 131.5=10.9 years on average) should have led to the prediction of a weaker Cycle 24, the correlation is over 0.7. In the meantime David Hathaway of NASA has recognized: “Relationships have been found between the size of the next cycle maximum and the length of the previous cycle…”.
Summarizing: The current Cycle 24 is in total the weakest since 1820, the probability of a change into stronger activity is only 12% and the length of the cycle can certainly be a useable indicator for the development of the upcoming SC 25. If solar scientists Livingtson and Penn are correct, SC 25 may be even weaker than SC 24  should the magnetic field strength B in the lower chart fall to 1400 Gauss on average. Below this limit no sunspot can be created, as you can see at the bottom of the chart. The last time that happened, it is suspected, was during the solar Maunder Minimum from 1645-1715.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe political beauty about climate data is that it can be easily manipulated in order to fool the public.
The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently released its State of the Climate in 2012: Highlights. To no one’s surprise, the report gives the reader the impression that warming is galloping ahead out of control. But their data show just the opposite.

The NOAA says 2012 was the 8th or 9th warmest on record, but fails to mention it was one of the coolest of the decade, and thus confirms the cooling trend. (Above sequence estimated using the chart. Trend line is only approximate). Also see: woodfortrees.org from:1998. 
When one carefully reads the report, we find that the NOAA findings actually do confirm precisely what the skeptics have been claiming all along:
1. The Earth has stopped warming.
2. The climate models exaggerated future warming. CO2 climate sensitivity is much lower than we first thought.
That’s the real issue at hand.
On global temperatures, the NOAA report itself states (my emphasis): “Four major independent datasets show 2012 was among the 10 warmest years on record, ranking either 8th or 9th, depending upon the dataset used.

Source: NOAA
2012 one of the coldest this decade
But if 2012 is only the 8th or 9th warmest and we are told again and again that almost all the warmest years occurred since 2000, then it can only mean that 2012 was one of the coolest so far this century.
And indeed the above NOAA chart confirms just that. Moreover, the stagnation of the last 15 years defies all computer model projections, thus confirming that the models all exaggerated CO2 climate sensitivity. In order for the models to be correct, the global temperature over the last 6 years would have to be 0.2 to 0.3°F warmer.
We suppose that the NOAA and NASA will soon be going to work readjusting the 1998 to 2005 data downwards to get the curve shape they need. Such dubious (and perhaps criminal) manipulation of data has long since become NASA’s “scientific” approach over the recent years. It kind of reminds us of the days when Stalin tried to change history by cutting and pasting photos.

NOAA admits using random weather anecdotes as “data” to show warming
Now that we see that the global temperature data show there’s been NO WARMING and that the models all exaggerate, how does NOAA arrive at the conclusion that the globe is warming? Answer: They use scattered weather anecdotes as evidence. Something that even 6th grade students learn not to do. Their science is that bad.
The NOAA even admits this: “The report used dozens of climate indicators to track and identify changes and overall trends to the global climate system.” These “climate indicators,” as you are about to see, are merely cherry-picked weather events.
For example the NOAA writes that the Arctic sea ice extent last year reached a record low “during the satellite era“. However, the satellite era only goes back 33 years, and the NOAA couldn’t be bothered to tell readers that low Arctic sea ice also persisted in the 1950s and is all part of natural cycles, and is thus not “unprecedented“. Also read here.
The NOAA in its report also uses a single 4-week-long period of weather over Greenland last summer as conclusive data that our planet is warming. But this is just a weather event.
Another remarkable single event that the NOAA uses is: “A weak La Niña dissipated during spring 2012 and, for the first time in several years, neither El Niño nor La Niña … prevailed for the majority of the year.” A La Niña naturally disappearing is evidence of global warming? You gotta be kidding.
NOAA’s scientific incompetence reaches a new high
The NOAA just released it’s State of the Climate: Extreme Events chart:
Again the NOAA confuses weather events as “climate events”. The scientists at the NOAA are no longer able to distinguish between a single tropical storm like Sandy and climate. Scientific incompetence has reached a new high.
If you think scientists just couldn’t get anymore incompetent, then think again. NOAA scientists even appear to believe that cold events are now signs of warming. It includes expanding Antarctic sea ice as evidence the globe is warming:
Antarctica sea ice extent reaches record high … reached a record high of 7.51 million square miles on September 26. This is 0.5 percent higher than the previous record high extent of 7.47 million square miles that occurred in 2006 and seven percent higher than the record low maximum sea ice extent of 6.96 million square miles that occurred in 1986.”
When the traditional fundamental data stop supporting your claims and you’re scientifically desperate, then I guess you have to resort to fringe weather anecdotes. Who would have thought that the NOAA would devolve to such a low level?
And as the warming stagnation continues, expect a lot more comedy to come from the NOAA in the years ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt started with the Farmer’s Almanac. We’ve been hearing lots of talk about another brutal winter being in store.

Although seasonal forecasts are speculative at best, meteorology indeed has advanced to a point where it is possible to get an idea of what direction the upcoming season is tending towards. Farmers have been doing this successfully for centuries.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi in his Saturday Summary at the 7-minute mark looks at the latest NCEP NCAR global winter forecast for 2013/14. The charts point to another “brutal winter for Europe“. The forecast sees blocking and a negative NAO. Joe also tweeted that “SST analog package combined with low solar, and climate cycle (similar to early 50s)  argue for nasty Euro Winter“.
Joe is not alone in pointing out that weather services are looking at a brutal European winter. German meteorologist Dominik Jung tweeted the following chart from the French CFS meteorological services which shows really nasty cold in store for January.

German meteorologist Dominik Jung tweets that a bitter cold one could be in store for Europe. Chart: CFS
Moreover, the online web.de/magazine here carries the title: “Winter 2013/2014 is going to be really cold”, citing “one of the most well-known long-term models of the American Weather Service“.
Web.de writes:

It looks like the 2013/2014 winter is going to be extremely frosty. Jung has evaluated the data: ‘Looking at these charts, it’s going to be really cold.'”
Web.de adds that signs show the winter could be a long, protracted affair:
The cold air flow from Eastern Europe to Central Europe could strengthen considerably. […] Also the cold winter weather should continue through February and the Southwest could be hit by the Russian beast from the east. This scenario could extend into deep into March. ‘After the last five much-too-cold winters, this development would be no real surprise and well within the realms of the possible,’ says meteorologist Jung.”
If this forecast (fraught with uncertainty) should pan out out to be true, then it would be a record six colder-than-normal winters in a row for Europe. You just couldn’t drift further away from global warming. Six in a row would be nothing short of spectacular. Such a long, protracted winter as described above would make it one of the worst in 100 years.
But not every meteorologist is convinced that long-term seasonal forecasts are of any value. Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann at Twitter, for example, scoffs at such prognoses, writing that it’s mainly stuff “from the charlatan department“.
Again we have reiterate that these forecasts are truly speculative, and all the meteorologist point this out. So there really is no need to get pissy about it.
I’m a bit skeptical of the long-term winter forecasts as well, though not as much as Mr. Kachelmann. Large global scale weather patterns can change quickly. For example there’s still lots of uncertainty as to what will happen with the ENSO in the months ahead, and if you can’t predict the ENSO for the next few months, then how can you predict the other global seasonal patterns? Another example is the hurricane season. How often have hurricane season predictions been wrong?
On the other hand, we now have more than 100 years of detailed weather data that now allow us to recognize certain repeating patterns, and so seasonal tendency forecasts are becoming a reality. You can’t just dismiss them offhand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi’s Weatherbell page here features the latest “Saturday Summary´, something I now look forward to every week.
First in North America, weather models at about the 2:45 mark show that things could get awfully brutal for an extended period. Already the 7 – 14 day forecast looks ugly:


Chart sources: National Centers for Environmental Prediction wxmaps.org/html
Joe calls it “a heck of a weather period coming up”.
Here in Europe we’ve had a nice spell of mild weather since Christmas-time, and some of you may be thinking of getting started already on some springtime chores. Well, don’t put the snow shovels and antifreeze away just yet. Models have been converging on and are pointing to another “Beast from the East” getting poised to shock-freeze the continent.

It’s too early to say just how brutal it may get. But should a protracted, deep cold develop, then it’ll be interesting to see how Germany’s now vulnerable electricity grid will hold up. A number of institute’s have been warming that if the winter turns hard, Germany’s power grid could collapse – thanks to the huge gap in baseload capacity left by the German government’s hasty shutdown of 8 nuclear reactors in the wake of Fukushima in 2011.
Here’s the Weatherbell chart for early-mid February:

Chart source: weatherbell.com/
Of course 30-day general forecasts are nothing certain, and things could develop differently. But should anything like this indeed develop, then look at the cold headed for Germany, Eastern and Central Europe. I really do hope they have every source of electricity generation ready on standby because they are going to need it.
Germany’s leaders, in my view, have been playing an irresponsible game of Russian Roulette with its citizens when it comes the nation’s power grid and supply, winging it and praying they’ll somehow eek by another winter. This winter they may not be so lucky. I can see the headlines already.
Enjoy the last few remaining days of mild weather. After that, hope that the Beast from the East shows a little compassion. Unfortunately, Mother Nature rarely does so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn 22 June 2013 the Swiss newspaper Basler Zeitung published an interview with climate historian Christian Pfister . Director of Business, Social, and Environmental History at the University of Bern, Switzerland. There’s been a lot of grumbling in Europe this spring due to the cold and wet weather, and so the Swiss daily decided to check what#s behind it all.

Suspected witches being hanged in England, published in 1655, public domain image.
According to Pfister, the weather has always been fickle throughout history, and is nothing unusual today.
Not surprisingly hysterical minds in the past also blamed bad weather on humans. The Basler Zeitung writes, “Christian Pfister advises us to calm down with regards to the cold, heat, winds, hail and storms. There’s been far worse than what we’ve seen this year” and reminds us that “We are powerless against the weather“.
Here are some excerpts of the interview:
Is the weather freaking out, or are we freaking out because we think the weather is freaking out?
Let me tell you what happens when the weather really freaks out. Imagine that it has hardly rained over the last 11 months. The leaves fall drom the trees in the middle of the summer, cattle die of thirst, forest fires rage. You can walk far into Lake Constanz like during a very dry winter, the Rhine dwindles to a creek. The water boils.

When did that happen?
In 1540. An almost one-year long drought, from Toscana to the north German border, from France to Poland. A blanket of smoke from the burning forests covered the continent, just like we saw in Russia in 2010. Then came the anti-summer in 1588: It rained and storms raged during 88 of 92 days. The grape harvest could fit in a hat. We had never seen such a summer, wrote the admirals of the Spanish Armada, it was like the British fleet that struck back then in the English Channel.
How can people be blamed for bad weather? 
When the weather was continuously cold and wet, as was the case this spring, those who were hit needed to find someone to blame. In most cases it was women who were accused of witchcraft. The accusers often assumed a conspiracy of witches who had sexual misconduct with the devil was at work. For this reason, suspects were tortured until they named their co-conspirators, who then were next. Entire groups of women were burned at the stake. Today we estimate that from 1430 to 1650 in Europe 60,000 women were executed as witches, not only because of, but most often because of weather-sorcery. It cannot be excluded that during that time, witches would have been burned after having a spring like that of 2013.”
Today hysterical climate alarmists blame industrial witches for today’s weather misfortunes, and accuse them of having a pact with the devil. These alarmists claim that they have science on their side and that they know the truth.
Today in modern times the psychological affliction of weather hysteria still persists with many lawmakers, scientists, and activists demanding that people start performing rituals in order to get Nature to bestow nicer weather. Back to the Dark Ages!

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to preliminary findings of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen (AGEB), Germany has consumed far more energy in the first half of this year than a year earlier, up 4 percent.

 Germany burns more coal because of cold weather. Image (cropped) by Arnold Paul, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license.
Alarmist site Klimaretter here, quoting the AGEB report, attributes the increased energy use to “the comparably long winter and the cool spring“. The AGEB writes that economic development played no role in the increased consumption.
According to the AGEB, consumption of natural gas rose almost 10%. Black coal consumption, a major contributor to CO2 emissions, jumped 8%.
Consumption of the massively subsidized renewable energy jumped only 4%. Most of the increase was due to biomass and hydro-power. According to the statistics, wind energy supplied 10% less energy into the grid during the period than a year earlier.
The bulk of Germany’s energy consumption continues to be supplied by fossil fuels, about 1/3 by oil, a quarter by natural gas, and 23% by coal. Only 11.7% was supplied by renewable energy in the first half of 2013, despite the massive subsidies. Renewable energy’s share in the energy mix remains unchanged from a year earlier.
In summary Germany’s investment in the energy transition to renewable energy has cost consumers tens of billions of euros, but has only resulted in higher (not lower!) CO2 emissions, its share remains stagnant, and energy bills for the poor have skyrocketed.
Ironically, experts blame the lack of progress in curbing energy use and combatting global-warming emissions on the persistent cold weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Handelsblatt today writes about the newly imposed import tariffs the EU has levied to keep out low-cost, affordable solar panels made in China.
The subheading below the title reads:
With punitive tariffs on solar products, the EU has angered China. The government in Peking has condemned the import tariffs and is now retaliating: with a new anti-dumping process against wine from the EU.”
Here we see who the real intended targets of this retaliation are mainly France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. All these countries are already reeling from high unemployment and find themselves on the brink of social instability. So far Germany seems more or less spared by China’s retaliation. Germany did not support imposing import duties on Chinese solar products. Germany’s Minister of Economics Philipp Rösler (FDP) calls the tariffs “false” and considers them “a big mistake”.
Benny Peiser here calls the move by the EU: “A trade war that can’t be won” launched by “green fanatics“.
The proponents of these tariffs, which will be a whopping 47.6% by August, are putting the jobs of millions of Europeans at stake – only to protect an unviable industry that happens to be the symbol of the Great Green Transformation. Indeed it’s tantamount to throwing the whole baby ward out with the bath water.
For years the EU claimed that solar panels needed to be subsidised so that economies of scale could be achieved, and thus make them cheap, affordable and one day perhaps competitive on the energy market. Thanks to China, that goal was closer than ever. Is the EU rewarding China for this? No. The EU instead is now punishing China for doing what it said needed to be done. Worse, in the end, it is the European consumer who will be punished by this short-sighted protectionist move.
The Handelsblatt writes:

According to Customs, China imported 290 million liters of wine from the EU last year. Imports from the EU make up about two thirds of the total wine imports by China.
We suppose this is not a problem for Europe. The government will just buy up the warehouses of unsold wine and literally pour it down the drain…also at taxpayer expense of course.
Wine is only one option from many that China has to choose from. Other possibilities, if push comes to shove, are Airbus planes, machinery, chemicals, and a vast array of technology.
So what’s behind the trade tariffs? As Benny Peiser writes: green fanatics and a massive solar industry lobby.
Peiser sums it up: “This began as a story about a misguided green attempt to prop up a stumbling industry, but it’s quickly becoming another tale illustrating Europe’s global impotence.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn relatively windy Germany many people think wind turbines are a reliable investment. After all, especially near the North and Baltic seas, the wind blows almost all the time, and surely wind energy is competitive, even when generated onshore.
But that’s proving to be a total myth, so reports Germany’s leftist-greenie daily, TAZ.
According to the TAZ, wind energy investors were misled by exaggerated projections from the wind industry. Many wind parks in Germany are now struggling to break even. The TAZ writes:
Many years wind energy has been considerably exaggerated. Hardly a wind park has produced the earnings that had been promised to private investors. […]. This the result that accountant Werner Daldorf of Kassel has come with after evaluating more than 1150 year-end financial statements from the year 2000 to 2011 coming from 175 wind parks. All the wind parks that were examined were installed before 2006.”
The TAZ adds that the wind parks reached only 86% of their projected turnover. The TAZ quotes Daldorf:
 About half of all onshore wind parks are running so poorly that the investors can be happy to get back their limited partnership capital in 20 years.“
That’s a long time. Sounds like it’s much safer to put your money in CDs (certificates of deposits) at your local savings bank. The TAZ continues:
37 percent of the year-end financial statements even showed a negative cash-flow – the repayment of the loan was higher than what the wind park brought in.”
I know the problem with my home solar system. Even with the high rates the power company is forced to pay me, I’m just barely breaking even. As I wrote earlier here, I’ll be happy to see my money back in 12+ years. And after that I’ll probably make enough money to pay for the disposal costs at the end of the system’s lifetime (20 years).

Meteorological wind models were inflated
The TAZ writes that the disappointing results are mostly due to the “over-estimation of wind income potential“. Wind models exaggerated wind projections. The TAZ adds:
In the earlier times a wind index – as would be evident later– was anticipated that was noticeably higher than the actually observed meteorological conditions.”
Sound familiar? In fact the entire green industry was spurred on by an anticipated temperature index – as would be shown later– that was noticeably higher than the actually observed meteorological conditions.
Has the wind-power promotion industry corrected their models? The TAZ has the answer:
The so-called BDB, or also the Keiler-Häuser Index, on which the wind experts rely on, were corrected downwards multiple times, the last time in December 2011. ‘In the view of the BWE German Wind Energy Association expert, it is now correct,’ says association spokesman Matthias Hochstätter.”
Gee, I’m sure all the people who invested years ago all feel a whole lot better about that now.
Note that all this disappointment is happening in Germany, a country that gets a rather healthy dose of wind. So when you look at wind parks being installed onshore in other dubious places, like my home state of Vermont, or Ontario, Canada, or wherever, many such places rarely see strong winds – often seeing days or even weeks of doldrums – and thus we can expect they will have even far greater trouble getting a return on their investments.
My prediction? In 20 years we should expect to see a landscape blighted by rusty, old, broken-down wind towers. All monuments commemorating a period environmental madness that had emanated from Al Gore’s brain and swept across the world like a global pandemic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline Spiegel magazine (SPON) has an article today by Axel Bojanowski titled: “Sea level rise: Greenland melting more slowly than expected“.
Bojanowski writes:
Melting in Greenland is a decisive factor on how fast the sea level rises. Now research on five glaciers on the country are showing: The northern ice cap will indeed melt more gradually than assumed.”
This dumps cold water on the global climate catastrophe scenarios that the German government-funded climate institutes, media, and politicians of every party like to trumpet.
The Spiegel article cites a new study here that finds “melting Greenland glaciers will lead to less sea level rise over the next 200 years than earlier feared” and that “the accelerated ice loss of the past decades will not continue at the same rate.”
The Spiegel story contradicts an older 2010 New York Times 2010 doom and gloom portrayal of Greenland, which cited Stefan Rahmstorf, who said:
The past clearly shows that sea-level rise is getting faster and faster the warmer it gets. Why should that process stop? If it gets warmer, ice will melt faster.”
Of course we know that it hasn’t gotten warmer at all in 15 years, and may have even cooled slightly, and so the process naturally will not accelerate.

Rahmstorf is a leading scientist at the notoriously climate-catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. He once accused Spiegel of “climate scientist bashing” and “defamation”. Why? Because Spiegel dared to question his brand of bed-wetting alarmist climate science.
Bojanowski at SPON writes that the scientists reported here at Nature that a melting calculated under strongly rising temperatures for all of Greenland would lead to a sea level rise of maximum 18 cm…”well within the prognoses of the UN IPCC.”
But with global temperature data showing no warming in 15 years, oceanic cycles like the PDO and AMO turning negative, solar activity tanking, and many scientists projecting a slight to moderate cooling over the next decades, these newest prognoses may very well turn out to be exaggerated as well, especially for the next 50 years. Many parts of Greenland are indeed thickening.
In summary, it’s all very much in dispute. But we know things just don’t disintegrate like they do in Rahmstorf’s wild collapsing-world fantasies.
Bojanowski writes that glacier behavior is complex, and that predictions are fraught with uncertainty: “…the strong increase in ice loss of the past years will not continue in a linear manner, but instead will tend to moderate, the scientists suspect“. Remember – the scientists are assuming strong warming, which is not even happening.
The scientists say their predictions are “only a rough estimation that has to be fine-tuned with respect to the strong individual different dynamics“. Spiegel adds: “Calculations over ice melt in Greenland fluctuate because only very few glaciers have been systematically observed over many years.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo mark the start of the new decade, NoTricksZone and its readers made a climate bet (see right side bar) against two warmists from Skeptical Science: Rob Honeycutt and Dana Nuccitelli (and others). Also see update-5. The warmists are pledging more than $14,000.00!
Rob overall has been a good sport and is a pleasure to deal with. Dana, on the other hand, has been, shall we say, a bit abrasive.

The coolists are clearly in the lead. Chart by Robin Pittwood – Kiwi Thinker
The bet is on whether or not the current 2011-2020 decade would be warmer or cooler than the previous 2001-2010 decade. NTZ and its readers say it will be cooler or the same. Messieurs Honeycutt and Nuccitelli say it’s going to get warmer for sure. After all, man is spewing more CO2 into the atmosphere than ever. The money won will be donated to a charity for children in need.
Almost two and half years have now passed and I think it’s a good time to see how the bet is coming along. Thanks to Robin Pittwood and his Kiwi Thinker blog, we now have preliminary results for the first 2 years and 5 months.
Clearly in the chart above we see that the current decade is running a bit cooler than the last one. In fact, temperatures haven’t warmed in 15 years.
Of course it’s still early and nobody really knows what tricks Mother Nature could play. But Rob and Dana really should be scratching their heads, though. Okay, the bet was made before they found out that oceans eat up warming. Indeed it is warming, they insist, but the cooling is just covering it up! You just wait…the warming will be back, they keep saying. And when it comes back, it’ll be for real. Besides, cooling is caused by warming anyway. Right?
Problem is, nobody knows when the warming will be back. Even the Prince of Global Warming Darkness himself, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber of the Palace of Doom and Gloom in Potsdam recently said the warming may be delayed even another decade. Doesn’t look good, Rob and Dana.

Like I wrote, it’s remotely possible that it will warm a bit this decade, and maybe Rob and Dana could even eke out a victory. But will a few hundredths or even a tenth of a degree be enough?
Not really because of the model projections are rising much faster and the divergence between observed temperature and model projections will be more glaring than ever. Even if the two do pull off an upset, it’ll be a hollow victory. They’ll still have lost the science argument, which is all about sensitivity. By the end of the decade, it could be that we will not have seen any significant warming in over 22 years.

Temperature would have to jump 0.4°C in the next 7 years just to be at the lower range of the model projections. Chart: www.drroyspencer.com/
To be on the safe side, I’ve asked Robin Pittwood to disclose his calculations and the data he used to produce his non-hockey stick chart.
First he told me he had lost the data, then he told me that it was private property and that I was not privy to it. Next he said it was not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, and so he didn’t have to provide it. He also asked why he should provide it to me if my sole aim was just to find something wrong with it. Then he said I had to be a scientist to see it. During all of this he told the press that I was just a hack of Big Oil and the coal industry. But I never relented, and so he eventually coughed it up. /sarc 🙂

Where’s David Viner when you need him?
The northern hemisphere is experiencing near record high snow cover, Moscow just got buried by record snow, today Boston faces record snow, and now ski resorts in France are shutting down because of too much snow!
English language The Local here reports that “most ski resorts pray for heavy snow each winter but the people of Cauterets in the French Pyrénées may have overdone it this year. The resort had to close this week after seven metres of snow fell in recent weeks. Sixty workers at the resort, stationed 1,800 metres high in the mountains, have been working around the clock to try and clear away the snow so the resort can reopen on Friday.”
Continue reading snow causes closure of french ski resort here.
Viner isn’t the only climate scientist goofball in Europe who predicted snow would become rare. Professor Mojib Latif of Germany also made a similar claim (Spiegel Online) in 2000, copycatting Viner:
Winters with strong frosts and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will no longer exist at out latitudes.”

Latif in fact has made a number of spectacular predictions, as the following German YouTube video shows:

Latif’s prediction in 2009 for Germany in 2050:
“Temperature s will reach 50°C!”
In 1990 Latif said:
“By 2050 global temperatures may rise 3 – 4°C“.
But in 1997 he said:
“Winters will be ice cold for the next 20 years!”
It reminds me of what baseball commentator Bob Uecker once said of Michael Jordan trying to play Major League Baseball: “Keep swinging, eventually the ball will hit the bat!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday we know that this claim should have been a very easy-to-detect gross blunder.
The skeptic website klimamanifest-von-heiligenroth.de/ last week posted a freshly produced video (in German) that puts the spotlight on the director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber.

Klimamanifest video, Part 1 of 10. In 2009 Schellnhuber claimed that the Himalayan melt by 2035 was “very easy to calculate”.
Schellnhuber is also the Chairman of the WBGU advisory council to the German government, which is pushing for a “Great Transformation” of global society to one that is “sustainable” and not based on fossil fuels.
The creator of the above video, Rainer Hoffmann, had spent three months researching past statements made by Schellnhuber. The result is a 10-part series called: The 10 Inconvenient Truths of Climate Pope Hans Schellnhuber. It exposes a number of troubling, contradictory statements made by the Potsdam Institute director over the past years.
According to the klimamanifest site, the above video was inspired by comments Schellnhuber had made on German public television on May 27, 2013, where he once again warned of a planet warming by 4°C by the end of the century.
Part 1, above, was released last Monday and the remaining 9 parts will follow each Monday for the next 9 weeks. NoTricksZone will report on each episode as they are released.
Part I: Schellnhuber claimed the Himalayas melt of 2035 was “very easy to calculate”
At the 0:50 mark Schellnhuber is shown in an exclusive interview on ZDF German public television on October 30, 2009, explaining the risks of the globe’s “third ice cap“: the Tibetan Plateau, whose summertime melt water feeds a number major Asian rivers that help support 2.5 billion people in the region. Schellnhuber at the 2:06 mark:
If now, and one can calculate this very easily, in the next 30, 40 years, with 2°C of warming this will with certainty happen, um, when these large glaciers disappear for the most part, these rivers will dry up in the summertime. And in winter, this is the other side of the story, the precipitation will fall as rain in the valley; that means the floods will be far more dramatic, no?”
Clearly we see that in 2009, two years after the 4AR had been issued in 2007, Schellnhuber was preaching the Himalayan 2035 glacier meltdown, even claiming he could “calculate the melt very easily” and that major rivers like the Yangtze, Ganges, Mekong´, etc. would dry up. But just over 2 months later, the media found out that what had been “very easy to calculate” was a huge whopping error. The above video shows two clips: one on 19 January 2010 and one on 11 February 2010 that say the 2035 Himalayan ice melt was a huge blunder. Moreover, the 3SAT report at the 4:20 mark of the above video points out yet another whopping error made by the 2007 IPCC report:
It should have been clear to experts that the scenario was pure nonsense, and not because so much ice in this region could ever melt in just 25 years, but also because the Himalayan glacier area given in the IPCC report was completely false. It is only 33,000 square kilometers and not a grotesque 500,000.”
Suddenly 93% of “the Earth’s the third pole” disappears.

At the 4.47 mark Ottmar Edenhofer, deputy director of the PIK, forgets about what his boss had said was “very easy to calculate“, and shifts the blame for the Himalayan blunder on the IPCC overall peer-review process:
This is in now way excusable, and naturally we have to make sure that we make the peer-review of the text much more efficient.”
A remarkable piece of advice when one considers that Edenhofer’s boss, Schellnhuber, had claimed earlier that the Himalayan glacier melt by 2035 was “certainty”.
At the 5:40 mark, BR television on 3 June 2012 asks how the gross Himalaya error found its way into the IPCC report. The answer is delivered by Professor Hans von Storch at the 6:05 mark:
I think one of the reasons why it was there is because of they worked sloppily. Perhaps it had something to do with, so to say, the desire for the right result.”
Yet, no journalists ever bothered to follow up and ask Schellnhuber why he had peddled such an absurd prognosis back in 2009. In an interview with Spiegel on October 6, 2010, Schellnhuber acts like he had never made the ridiculous Himalayan 2035 melting prediction. In the Spiegel interview (7:10 mark) he is quoted (highlighted in yellow):
There were just a few bad mistakes, but they were very troublesome. The IPCC is in the public spotlight and there is so much at play and errors of this magnitude mustn’t happen. The IPCC has to do its homework in order to overcome the current credibility crisis.”
Clearly Schellnhuber wants us to believe that he had never peddled the “easy to calculate” 2035 Himalayan ice melt scenario. Journalist Karsten Schwanke, who had done the interview with Schellnhuber on ZDF television back in 2009, wrote in an e-mail on February 1, 2010 (see 8:00 min mark):
It is of course huge crap that such errors go through the entire IPCC. I thought they all worked to check everything a thousand times. Personally I was always skeptical about this melt warning. Ice at 7000 or 8000 meters elevation, why would it melt? It’s way too cold. At most it could sublimate if it stopped snowing. But the India monsoons bring new snow every summer. I just don’t understand it.”
In summary what turned out to be one of climate science’s most embarrassing blunders, was also one Schellnhuber’s most “certain” and “very easy to calculate” scenarios.
Finally at the 8:40 mark of the video, Schellnhuber is taped in an interview saying:
I believe that there has never been a socially relevant area examined by science that has been more meticulously checked for errors than climate science.”
I don’t see how any expert could have been more misleading.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, all of Germany’s political parties and media, whether socialist, green, liberal or conservative, embraced and voted into law the green energy feed-in act (EEG). The few remaining outspoken opponents were marginalized as political Neanderthals and climate deniers.
Now fast-forward 5 years to today. My oh my how perceptions have changed. As the costs and the technical folly become more apparent, major back-pedaling is beginning. Once the darling of the media, Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) is now coming under heavy fire. Energy prices have been skyrocketing, and CO2 emissions aren’t going down by any measure.
The latest to fire harsh criticism is leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) in an online piece titled: Too much is too much. The introduction:
The transition to renewable energy is becoming a giant re-distribution machine. The subsidy is careening out of control. There’s far more green energy than planned. The price for emission certificates are plunging. Coal is experiencing a Renaissance. And the world is emitting more CO2 than ever.”
Granted the FAZ still is in favor or green energies, but not like this. The FAZ calls the current implementation of Germany’s green energy feed-in act a “giant redistribution machine” that is “dividing the nation“, where a “majority now fear further rising energy costs“. The surcharge for green energy will soon rise to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost “double what power is traded for on the power commodity exchanges“. Consumers are now paying 30 euro-cents ($0.38) per kilowatt-hour.

The FAZ adds that the green energy subsidy “has completely gone out of control“.  Worse, the lobby of those who have benefitted massively from these subsidies has turned into a behemoth that no politician dares to challenge. The German green energy feed-in act does not only impact the German power market, but “grotesquely distorts” the European power market, writes the FAZ.
And because green energies have been massively subsidized to the detriment of other power sources, other subsidies have to enacted to counter the market distortions. The result: more subsidies for power companies to keep reserve plants on stand-by, or to pay wind park operators to shut down when there’s too much power being fed in. The green energy revolution has turned into a subsidy bonanza where investors have no risks.
Another massive error described by the FAZ article was the belief that fossil fuels would get more expensive. That hasn’t happened The opposite is true. New oil and gas reserves, thanks to fracking, for example, have caused these fuels to plummet in price. The FAZ writes:
The gas price there has already fallen 75%. Because coal there is being replaced gas, the emissions of carbon dioxide in the USA has fallen to the lowest level in 20 years. That’s perverse. Through fracking, America reaches its climate targets which it never signed on to while self anointed model climate student Germany is emitting more CO2 than last year.”
Now that the opposition greens and socialists are plummeting in German opinion polls, look for Angela Merkel and her government to take steps to shut down the ruinous renewable energy subsidy orgy soon after next weekend’s national elections.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: The press release reappears! Maybe the embarrassment of taking it down surpassed that of having it up.
================================
In December the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) issued a press release about a study model simulation claiming that greater snowfalls over Antarctica would increase ice discharge into the oceans, and thus speed up sea level rise, by Winkelmann, R., Levermann, A., Martin, M.A., Frieler, K. (2012): Increased future ice discharge from Antarctica owing to higher snowfall. Nature [doi:10.1038/nature11616].

Press release on lead author’s Ricarda Winkelmann’s controversial paper disappears. Photo source: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research/M. Martin.
Anthony Watts and his readers at WUWT had a field day with that story. NTZ also chimed in, read here.
Although the claim pushed the limits of science absurdity into new territory, many media outlets still ran with the story anyway, not bothering to see if it held water. For example, Spiegel had the headline Snowfall increases ice melt in the Antarctic and Stern reported here, as did nuch of the German mainstream media…all telling readers that the PIK claim was yet more cause for even higher alarm.
The task of asking tough questions, once again, was left to the blogs.
As it turned out the story was not even based much on observed data, but more on crystal ball computer models. The claims by the PIK were dubious to say the very least. In not time at all they were torn apart and landed in the dustbin. For example, Don Easterbrook commented at WUWT:
Papers like this are why I don’t bother to read Nature anymore–it has lost all scientific credibility by publishing such nonsense. The authors apparently didn’t bother to check the temperature records at the South Pole and Vostok, which go back to 1957 and show no warming whatsoever over the past 55 years.”

Now it appears that even the PIK got embarrassed about it, and has quietly removed the press release they had issued here on 12 December. Do you find it? It’s also been removed from their German language page.
But it hasn’t totally disappeared. You still can find it with a bit of effort, if you know the address, It just isn’t anywhere prominent.
What explanation does the PIK offer for taking down the press release? One reader wrote to me in an e-mail: “From Ms Winkelmann, I still have yet to receive a reply after having sent here a query where I stuck to the facts back in December.”
It goes to show that there are some things left out there that are still too embarrassing to publish – even for the PIK.
===========================
UPDATE: It turns out that Ms Winkelmann is rather inexperienced in the field. She is not even a climate scientist. Flagship newspaper FAZ here, for example, wrote in 2011 (my emphasis): Hat-tip: DirkH
But: ‘Originally I do not come from climate science. Rather I come from the Chaos Theory.’ Ricarda Winkelmann is 26 years old and a professional climate modeller down to the tips of her hair. […]
Together with her colleagues at the PIK and scientists from Alaska, Ricarda Winkelmann developed admittedly the most advanced ice sheet and ice shelf model: About 10,000 program lines make up the super-computer model that simulates the fundamental processes of the polar ice sheets: The ice flow to the sea, the melting on the surface of the lower bedrock, ice collection above, the formation of crevices and including calving at the edge.”
Only 10,000 lines to simulate all that all over Antarctica? Only 26 years old, no experience and not even a climate scientist? If all that doesn’t sound like a half-baked operation. No wonder her team ended up with the preposterous result that more snowfall over Antarctica leads to faster sea level rise.

This is a conclusion that many independent scholars have arrived at. That feeling of intellectual superiority, infallibility, obsessive intolerance to other views, and being convinced you know what is best for everyone else have a common thread.

The latest on this troubling relationship is an article by the Jerusalem Post titled: The Nazi Roots Of The Green Movement. By BENJAMIN WEINTHAL.
Academic and journalistic research over the past five years shows the key role of Nazi figures in the party’s founding and development. […]
After strong similarities were revealed between an initiative by Germany’s neo- Nazi NPD party last year in a state parliament to demarcate Israeli products and a Green Party federal initiative in the Bundestag to impose a similar system on Israeli goods, critics pointed to the “Brown” — the color symbolizing Nazism – roots of the Green Party in an effort to explain the punitive measure directed at Jewish businesses.
The popular pro-Israel website Lizas Welt tweeted last month, “Not sure what the Greens actually have against Nazis. They even sometimes copy from them.”

This should not surprise anyone, as the Greens are notorious for their delusions of towering superiority, condescending arrogance and their belief they are the ones who ought to be running the world. The Wall Street Journal, noting their snobby, condescending attitude, once wrote a commentary titled: “The Green Supremacists“.
NoTricksZone has looked at the phenomenon on multiple occasions:
– Blut und Boden: Browns feel at home with green ideology.
– Greens and intellectual purity.
– FOCUS: Green movement has very brown roots
– Leading Pollster: Green movement shows shades of Brown
– Intolerance – Green calls for intellectual purity
– Green indoctrination
– Green as an anti-humanistic ideology.
– More intellectual purification, intolerance.
That’s for starters. The phenomenon is undeniable. The Greens of course will deny in the strongest terms that they have anything to do with Nazism – but actions speak much louder than words. The whole world is beginning to notice.
Surely there are many good Greens out there who have nothing but good intentions. For those we ask you to pause a moment and reflect on the kooky movement you’ve hitched your wagon to. Take a look at the global temperature data for the last 15 years. Hello!
I’ll refrain today from linking to that 10:10 No Pressure video as yet another exhibit.

SMA Solar Technology AG Informs Employees About Necessary Corporate Downsizing
The Managing Board of SMA Solar Technology AG (SMA) today informed the company’s employees at an employee meeting about further planned personnel adjustments. To respond to the changing conditions in the global photovoltaic market and the associated strong decline in sales, a gradual downsizing of 700 full-time positions in Germany is planned by December 31, 2014.
“We are expecting an extended period of consolidation in the solar sector. For the first time in many years, measured in Euros, the global photovoltaic market will decline in 2013. As market leader, we will be especially affected by this. In such a short space of time, we are not able to offset the sharp decrease in sales – nearly 50% since 2010 –with the ongoing measures for increasing productivity and saving on material costs alone. We have therefore been forced to make even more far-reaching changes than planned to our personnel structure over the coming months,” explains SMA Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon.
At the employee meeting, the company announced that in relation to the cutoff date of March 31, 2013, a total of 700 full-time positions will be downscaled in Germany by the end of 2014. This corresponds to around 800 employees, as the layoffs will affect both full-time and part-time employees. By the end of 2014, full-time positions in Germany will be at 3 000.
In recent weeks, the Managing Board has led constructive negotiations with the Works Council to ensure that any personnel adjustments are handled in the most socially responsible way. These negotiations are still in progress. The options of a further voluntary separation scheme or a transfer of the affected employees to a transitional company are under discussion. At present, the Managing Board is unable to exclude the possibility of compulsory terminations for operational reasons if the stated measures do not result in the required reduction in staff. “The planned downsizing is unavoidable if SMA is to emerge strengthened from the current consolidation phase in the solar sector. When making decisions about these cutbacks, we have used our best judgement and have kept an eye on our shared values,” says Pierre-Pascal Urbon.
The planned reduction in staff will affect all SMA divisions and corporate center in Germany. IT and development specialists will not be affected. SMA plans to continue investing, particularly in the area of technology development to strengthen the company’s ability to operate in the future and to systematically extend the global technology leadership. The Managing Board believes that the long-term prospects in the industry and for the company are good. “Our future energy supply will be largely decentralized and will be based on renewable energies. We will actively help to shape the transformation in the energy sector through the development of entirely new product platforms, our excellent service and our global presence,” explains Pierre-Pascal Urbon.
About SMA
The SMA Group generated sales of €1.5 billion in 2012 and is the global market leader for solar inverters, a key component of all PV plants and, as an energy management group, offers innovative key technologies for future power supply structures. It is headquartered in Niestetal, near Kassel, Germany, and is represented internationally in 21 countries. The Group employs more than 5,000 people worldwide. SMA’s broad product portfolio includes a compatible inverter for every type of module on the market and for all plant sizes. The product range includes both inverters for photovoltaic plants connected to the grid as well as inverters for off-grid systems. SMA is therefore able to provide ideal technical inverter solutions for all plant sizes and types. Since 2008, the Group’s parent company, SMA Solar Technology AG, has been listed on the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (S92) and also in the TecDAX index. In recent years, SMA has received numerous awards for excellence as an employer and achieved first place in the nationwide “Great Place to Work®” competition in 2011 and 2012 and fourth place in 2013.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s not every morning one wakes up and finds you’ve been quoted by the New York Times. That’s what happened to me this morning.

CO2 losing its fizz. Public domain photo. 
In his article, A Change in Temperature, Justin Gillis tells his readers that the issue of CO2 climate sensitivity has become more hotly disputed than ever, but warns catastrophe still looms.
Here are just a few comments I have:
1) The New York Times first have to learn that science is not about insisting you are correct, or being obsessed with a popular pet hypothesis. In the article Justin Gillis and scientist James Annan come across as having a very hard time departing from the hypothesis that CO2 climate sensitivity is high.
2. CO2 lags temperature, history has proven. Moreover, although CO2 has risen tremendously (in relative terms) over the last 15 years, the global temperature has not. For the last 15 years, sensitivity has been zero. Worse, there’s strong, mounting evidence that there isn’t going to be any warming for another 10 or 20 years at least. (Hint: oceans).
3. There’s no correlation between CO2 and temperature. Of the last 130 years, CO2 has risen 100% of the time, but temperature have risen only during 45 of those years (1920-45 and 1978-98). That’s a very lousy correlation. And you only need to look back at the previous Eemian interglacial. While CO2 was steady at about 260 ppm, the temperature dropped 6°C.
Now it’s CO2 quadrupling
4. But what I find particularly interesting about Gillis’s latest article is that the once much ballyhooed consensus is totally shattered, and the overall warmist retreat now taking place. It is clear that scientists are now abandoning the high CO2 sensitivity values in droves. Naturally we don’t expect them to abandon the high values and to run right over to the low CO2 climate sensitivity values. The next logical step is that they adopt the middle sensitivity values, and act like those are going to be catastrophic as well.

…several recent papers have offered best estimates for climate sensitivity that are below four degrees Fahrenheit, rather than the previous best estimate of just above five degrees, and they have also suggested that the highest estimates are pretty implausible. Notice that these recent calculations fall well within the long-accepted range — just on the lower end of it.”
But even mid-range sensitivity values are becoming difficult for people like Annan to defend, and so now they’re forced to consider undramatic low CO2 sensitivity values.
It will certainly be good news if these recent papers stand up to critical scrutiny, something that will take at least a year or two to figure out.”
And German journalist science Jürgen Schönstein writes about the NYT article at ScienceBlogs here:
(Annan assumes that the warming from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will be at the lower end of the projected ‘range’).
The problem here, however, is that with low CO2 climate sensitivity it gets really hard to conjure up catastrophic warming scenarios with a doubling of CO2. So what to do?
No problem. Gillis and Annan present their latest trick: They talk about tripling or even quadrupling of CO2 to get the catastrophe which they are so obsessed with, and claim it’s really plausible.
Some experts think the level of the heat-trapping gas could triple or even quadruple before emissions are reined in. […] Even if climate sensitivity turns out to be on the low end of the range, total emissions may wind up being so excessive as to drive the earth toward dangerous temperature increases.”
There you have it. Now climate scientists and the catastrophe-obsessed media are now forced, for perhaps the very first time, to talk about CO2 quadrupling in order to get the much wanted catastrophe scenarios.

It has circled the globe more than  53,500 times. FOX writes that “the joint U.S. and French satellite was decommissioned this week after its last remaining transmitter failed, according to a NASA statement“.
The satellite scanned the ocean surface and mapped sea level for more than 95 percent of the planet’s ice-free ocean area. According to Jason-1’s readings, it has detected a rise of nearly 1.6 inches over the last 20 years. Its radar altimeter determined sea levels to within a few centimeters.

NASA lost contact with the satellite on June 21 and efforts to re-establish it have failed.
NASA scientists say sea surface height changes with temperature so altimeter measurements are means to determine how much heat is stored in any given area of the ocean and how that changes. Jason-1 also recorded Pacific Ocean cycles. NASA scientist Lee-Lueng Fu at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena says, “These Pacific Ocean climate cycles are responsible for major shifts in sea level, ocean temperatures and rainfall every two to five years, and can sometimes be so large that worldwide weather patterns are affected. Jason-1 data has been instrumental in monitoring and predicting these ever-changing cycles.”
Jason-1 worked together with Topex-Poseidon, which was launched in 1992 and was decommissioned in 2006.
Jason-2, launched in 2008, will continue recording ocean data. Jason-3 is scheduled for launch in March 2015. They will work together with Envisat in mapping the Earth’s surface.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember a few years ago when Dr. Mark Serreze, Director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, nsidc.org, talked about the Arctic being in a death spiral because of sea ice was disappearing due to man-made global warming? Well, I’ve found another one of his death spirals…this one in Antarctica, which has been breaking sea ice records daily.

Antarctic Sea Ice chart – inverted so that even alarmist scientists can read it. 
Call it the Antarctic open sea water death spiral.
Remember that alarmist scientists normally only see warming death spirals, and not cooling ones. So to help them out, I’ve turned the Antarctic sea ice chart upside down. When you do that, the sea Antarctic ice chart looks like the summer Arctic ice melt. Now we can clearly see the Antarctic open-sea-water death spiral.
Soon penguins won’t know what open sea water is!
Of course, now we should all worry about albedo reflecting the heat back into space instead of getting absorbed by the dark sea water. This lack of heat will then cause accelerated ice growth. By 2050 the entire south pole may be covered with sea ice year round.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWatching the reaction from the greens, media, climate scientists, and a number of politicians here in Germany reminds me of the time when I was in 6th grade and a friend of mine and I threw a dead mouse in a group of 3rd grade schoolgirls out on the school yard. That sent them off in all directions screaming hysterically. 🙂

Order yours at: WattsUpWithThat 
Well that’s pretty much the reaction we’ve seen with many of the adults (grown men) here in Germany when Scripps announced that CO2 concentration had reached the 400 ppm level. You see, the day before when the concentration was 399.99 ppm, everybody was just going about their business; life was normal. But when the CO2 concentration reached 400 ppm, the gates of hell opened.
As one of the few calm people here, I now find myself busy dispensing on-site counseling to the emotionally shocked and hysterical in the report’s aftermath, and so I don’t have so much time. But here’s some reaction we’ve seen over the last few hours from the media, greens and “leading scientists”:
Green party honcho, drama-queen Dr. Herrmann Ott:
Exceeding the 400 ppm threshold of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere symbolizes the drama of galloping climate change and the threats to our civilization connected with it. […] To avert the unimaginable consequences of a continued dramatic increase in CO2, immediate and effective climate protection must have top priority!”
The leftist daily TAZ quoted Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego [translated, not the original quote]:
‘We are moving into dangerous territory,’ said Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. […] In his view the efforts to reduce CO2 have failed. Some impacts of climate change are now irreversible.”

The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has reached a historical high. […] Policymakers have to finally take action.”
Stephan Bakan of Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg (via klimaretter.de):
The climate models show that independent of short-term fluctuations, the global mean temperature of the lower atmosphere continues to rise with increasing CO2 concentration. With every increase we are moving towards the 450ppm level. And the time remaining for effective emissions reduction reduces accordingly.”
450 ppm? At least now we know when to expect the next outbreak of mass hysteria.
Jelle Bijma of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research in Bremerhaven, reported by klimaretter.de):
With this we surpass the 400 ppm mark for the first time in 25 million years. […] The Earth’s climate does not fundamentally react to the rise in CO2 in a linear fashion, explained Bijma. However there seems to be a relationship: The continued increase in greenhouse gas concentration as a whole strengthens the tendency to warming of the atmosphere. The higher the CO2 concentration, the graver are the consequences of climate change.”
The German Green Party wrote at their site:
Reaching the 400 ppm mark and the foreseeable increase in CO2 concentrations mean a much warmer world, and foremost a more volatile world connected with a sea level that is meters higher. […] It has probably been 3 million years since CO2 concentrations have been so high. […] To avert the consequences of a further dramatic increase in CO2 emissions, we must immediately and effectively protect the climate.”
There’s much more of course. But I’ve got to get back to calming the hysterical here. I’m telling them that over the Earth’s history CO2 have meandered over a broad range of 180 ppm to as high as 7000 ppm. At 150 life really starts having problems. During the ice ages we were dangerously low, below 200 ppm. At 400 ppm we now at least have a small buffer against extinction.
At the moment they are blocking it all out, of course. But tomorrow when they wake up, they will see that the earth is still there. It’s a slow process that moves one step at a time. They’ll wake up 5 mornings in a row, then do so for a whole year, and then for a decade, and more, and the world will still be there. Most by then will have relaxed and returned to a functional life.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel has stopped believing. The flagship news magazine writes:
Global warming has stalled for 15 years. Experts thus are having doubts on the reliability of their prognoses. The temperature development is moving along the lowest margins of the UN scenarios.”
Science reporter Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here looks at the performance of climate models, claiming that a few aren’t doing too bad, while the alarmist ones are failing. As a successful model he cites Myles Allen of Oxford University and his colleagues. Yet most fail, and thus Bojanowski writes:
For this reason some scientists now harbor the hope that the pessimistic climate prognoses could be wrong.”
They are, and tomorrow’s post will show just how miserably poor the models have been. In fact if policymakers had acted opposite of what the models suggested, far better policy would have been the result.
In the report, what Bojanowski is telling us is: sure, many models are not doing well, but I found one that is kind of right.

When you look objectively at the performance of climate models over the last 20 years, there’s really only one rational conclusion that can be drawn: Their performance has been deplorable.
To explain why the alarmist models “could be” wrong, Bojanowski cites former Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology Director Lennart Bengtsson, who calls the current global temperature development “mind boggling“, saying that although CO2 emissions have increased drasticly, “global warming is prgressing considerably slower than expected.”
The same is true when it comes to the tropics, where warming was supposed to be galloping away by now, Bojanowski writes. Both Bengtsson and Spiegel are somewhat astonished that the Earth refuses to warm up. Bojanowski sums it up in Part 2:
Thus there is hope that climate change is progressing less dramaticly than suspected.”
Here you have to read between the lines. What Spiegel really wants to say is: We’ve stopped believing in the climate catastrophe. The climate models have performed like crap, but we are not yet ready to come out and admit it.
Remember, admitting you’ve been wrong for a quarter century takes time.

Reader Loodt Pretorius writes:
Amazon UK will release the book The Neglected Sun on 12 September and are taking pre-release orders at £10.99, a big discount to the Amazon USA price. This may be of interest to your English readers and followers in Europe.”
That is indeed a great price. For the German version I paid 25 euros last year. At the price of £10.99, you may want to think about getting copies to give out as Christmas or birthday presents.
The English version has been updated.
The German version created a wave of outrage among the warmists and one of the authors, Fritz Vahrenholt, had to get personal body guards. So do be careful being seen reading this book in public. Some Birkenstock-wearing, granola-eating planet-rescuer may attack you.
The book cites hundreds of peer-reviewed papers that the new IPCC 5AR will surely ignore.
Even though I had followed and blogged about climate science for years, this book helped fill in lots of knowledge gaps that I had earlier.
After reading the first chapter of the English version, which I’ve had the chance to see in advance, I can assure that you won’t be able to put it down. The warmists aren’t going to like this book.

The climate calamitologists depend on a continuous calamity supply: high temperature records, the occasional flood, forest fires, tornadoes striking cities, and hurricanes wiping out coastal areas, preferably the heavily populated. Some tropical storm Sandy damage to Staten Island will probably remain un-repaired simply because it is proximate to New York City and all the media therein. It’s very handy for photo-ops and as background for TV climate docu-drama talking heads. As everyone seems to be making money from these copyrighted pictures, none are included here.
The current spate of stories about temperature records in the western U. S. is a case in point. These temperature “records” are all produced by locations that are designed to produce temperature records. The automated station at Bad Water in Death Valley is just one example. As John Daly pointed out, and Anthony Watts reiterated, the station is backed up against a western-facing cliff, right in front of a black-top highway and centered on the black-top parking area, with a white salt pan to the west to reflect the afternoon heat. Just go to Google Street View on the highway and spin the view around. The whole area looks like a giant boy-scout solar bake-oven. Sooner or later, this spot will produce a world record high temperature, which will be publicized across the world as proof of global warming/climate change/extreme weather, or whatever the buzz-phrase de jour.
Another example is Mercury, Nevada. You don’t suppose the name refers to the local summer temperature, do you? Both weather stations there are at the airport (of course). The station next the the asphalt is the one setting records (of course). One gets tired of pointing out that all weather stations at airports are surrounded by large expanses of tarmac (Black), and little else, except the occasional taxiing jet hairdryer-on-steroids. Both airports and aircraft have increased in size during this period of “global warming.” Could there possibly be a connection? I still await that article in the approved, peer-reviewed literature.
The loss of 19 firefighters in Arizona during a west coast heat wave was a gift from heaven for the Calamitologists. But please don’t notice that they died attempting to save homes built in a forest. These homes should not have been there, or at least should have been protected by firebreaks constructed before the fire and not during the fire as these brave men were attempting. Thirty years ago, this calamity would not have happened because the homes would not have been there.
Much has been made of natural disasters blamed on climate change. Few people point out that the opportunity for disaster has increased due to the growth of cites. Look at this picture of Texas from the ISS.

Source NASA, Public Domain. Texas at night from the International Space Station: Houston, lower right center; Dallas-Fort Worth, upper center; San Antonio, left center; Austin to the right of San Antonio; Port Arthur, lower right; Galveston, lower left.
Large parts of even the huge state of Texas are now covered by city. The odds of a tornado touching down in a populated area are increasing with the development of each suburb. That path of light from San Antonio to Dallas is Interstate Highway 35. Any tornado crossing that highway appears to have about a 50% chance of striking a populated area. Only a few years ago in that area, only beef cattle and the occasional oil rig were in danger. The recent storms that caused damage in the Oklahoma City area are also examples of tornadoes in areas where only 30 years ago there was only farmland. In “tornado alley” (the American plains states) with declining tornado activity, in spite of increased detection capability, (see here), (and more data here), the increasing size of cities is insuring a steady rise in urban damage, playing right into the hands of the Calamitologists.
None of the things described above have anything to do with climate and everything to do with population and infrastructure growth. But sooner or later the economic policies followed by the West will begin to limit growth. Any decrease in urban damage will be because there less urban value to damage. Weather will still do what it normally does.

In the video (German) at the 1:10 mark he says Central Europe will be cooling down considerably at the end of the coming week and that winter weather with snow may be making its way down below 1500 m in the Alps.
Of course in the past such weather was nothing that unusual for the Alps this time of year. But in our age of global warming, snow was supposed to become rare even in the wintertime, let alone early the fall or spring.
Winters are here to stay
One thing can be said with high certainty: snow in September pretty much tells us that winters are going to be around for a very long time, and they aren’t going to disappear like some fortune-telling climate scientists told us. Here are some of their notorious failed winter climate predictions:
“Winters with strong frost and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will cease to exist at our latitudes.” Mojib Latif, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 1 April 2000.
and
“Good bye winter. Never again snow?” Spiegel, 1 April 2000.

“Spring will begin in January starting in 2030.” Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010.
and
“Ice, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters.” Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010
(See many more here)
Having been thoroughly embarrassed by all these false predictions, many of the hysterical global warming scientists are now claiming that the recent spate of cold European winters are actually a sign of global warming.
Over the last couple weeks, there has been a flurry of forecasts of a bitter cold 2013/2014 winter to hit Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe. But Kachelmann dismisses these forecasts, pretty much calling them wild-ass guesses and claiming no one can make useful seasonal forecasts.
Other meteorologists, however, like Joe Bastardi and Dominik Jung, believe that tendencies one way or the other can be determined, based on historical data and repeating climate cycles that have emerged from the 130 years of data.
I think it’s high time to talk to a few old farmers and see what they think.
Overall, this all reminds me of the story of NASA predicting a cold winter because they had observed Indians stocking up more firewood than usual.

Cooling Will Be Worse Than We Thought
By Joe Bastardi, weatherbell.com/
At Weatherbell.com, we try to show people the ‘why’ before the ‘what’.  My father taught me that if you are right, then you should have the reason why first, and not excuses for being wrong later.
From where I stand, the reasons why we are right are clear. But the barrage of excuses coming from the other side is growing shriller with each passing day. And the idea that people spouting the CO2 idea are being driven from the field in spite of the overwhelming evidence against them is nonsense. When facts don’t matter, it’s not the facts that will force them to quit. This is well beyond science. Any rational person can see what is going on and can say that in the least there is enough doubt to stop the madness that demonizes those that disagree. In reality, their point has been driven from the field.
What I am doing here is giving you the ‘why’ before the ‘what’. What I’m amazed at is how people can keep seeing things that are opposite of what they claimed would happen 5 years ago, simply change the terminology and then say the things they say. That kind of mentality is one that does not accept any answer except the one they think it should be. So the fight is not on a level of a normal argument. The arguing is with people who believe they possess the “truth” and that anything short of their “truth” cannot be tolerated.
But we must smile and fight with facts. Debunk, and try not to demean.
In any case the following link will be very helpful in trying to get my point across, and I am going to use relative humidity and mixing ratios to show some of this: weather.cod.edu.pdf.
Here is why this should be simple: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. So what is the source of energy to the Earth? Answer: the sun. If outgoing radiation equals incoming, then there is no trapping and all this hullabaloo is a moot point. Since that is the case, the game should be over.
However if you want to start confusing the issue, then you assign major importance to very minor items, control the language, and then you can control the perception.
The fact is that the Earth has been warming since the very cold period of the 1700s (Little Ice Age). It just so happened sunspots were in the tank, and it was cold. When sunspot activity increased, the Earth responded by getting warmer. Should be simple, right? The link to the oceans in the overall rise that has occurred is obvious in the graph below (from the outstanding site: Climate4you.com/.

Figure 1: CO2 concentration and global temperature.
 The cumulative effect of the warm AMO and PDO added heat to the atmosphere, so temps rose from the late 1970s to around 2000. After the air absorbed the heat, it leveled off, the PDO flipped, and we started trending down.
Simply using the PDO, as seen in the chart below from Wikipedia, shows an almost direct correlation:
The warm years from the late 1970s to a bit beyond 2000, the latest downturn can be seen as well. The Pacific is much larger than the Atlantic, but the Atlantic turned warm in the mid-1990s so it is still not fully on board with the cooling. But when it does turn, chances are global temps will respond as one would expect knowing the heat capacity of the ocean is 1000 times that of the atmosphere. This chart alone should cast doubt, if not slay, the CO2 dragon being a major climate factor, if any at all. It’s simply too small to do what these people spouting this agenda-driven idea say it will.

Figure 2: Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)
Again the overall rise of the past 200 years is easily explained by sunspots, which is why a lot of people are nervous about cooling. After all, if you are claiming the sun caused the warming, and you take it away, and the oceans flip to their negative phase, and a couple of volcanoes blow to boot, then there is real trouble. Hence the triple crown of cooling, which I showed on national TV 4 years ago when explaining why the cooling would commence, and by 2030 temperatures would return to levels seen in the late 1970s.
As for CO2, the rise may be due in part to a lag that FOLLOWS warming, and doesn’t cause it. Since the 1950s, the only time CO2 was correlated was when the oceans warmed. This is not brain surgery.
There is science and pseudo-science. Science comes up with an idea like the oceans are causing warming, and when they cool, the air cools. Pseudo-science says: well CO2 is adding to this, but how much? IT’S A QUESTION THAT CAN NEVER BE ANSWERED. Does the question then become: Would we already be heading into a mini ice age were it not for CO2 saving us?  How do you answer that?  Untold amounts of money are being thrown at a question that isn’t even something of consideration.

Now here is the problem. Temps have been dropping as you can see…not a lot, but some. But what should be very disturbing for planners and people looking forward is that the Relative Humidity is dropping. That means the wet bulb has dropped more than the temperatures. 

Figure 3: 300 mb (top); 600 mb (middle) 1000 mb (bottom).
Why is the RH dropping? Think about it. A cooling Pacific, especially in the tropics, means less water vapor available to the system. So we get the initial temperature drop off because of the cooling Pacific is no longer adding to the warmth of the air – primarily in the tropics. But the RH is dropping too.
Where it’s dry, it does warm up and the large dry land areas do warm in the summer season, until such the entire earth/ocean system adjusts (the AMO flips to cold too). But the drop of RH, seen above in the chart is a big hint!
Notice how at this time, the 1000 mb is lagging. Eventually, though, the transport of moisture from the lagging low levels will cool the mid levels (increased moisture leading to temperatures falling toward the wet bulb),  leading to more instability, more cloudiness. Until a balance is reached, the earth’s temps will cool. Perhaps faster!
A look at the skew T and the mixing ratio relationship to temperature really drives my point home about why this is a distortion of temps and not warming. By distortion I mean its obviously warmer in the northern areas, but THE COOLING IN THE TROPICAL AREAS, EVEN THOUGH MUCH SMALLER, CARRIES HAS A FAR GREATER IMPACT ON THE WEATHER AND CLIMATE.
A way to think about it like 2 people that weigh the  same, but one may have more mass in one part of the body than the other.
An example of this can be seen when one looks at what it takes to change the mixing ratio 2g/kg at 30°C vs -20°C.
Look at how the mixing ratios increase dramatically with higher temps. In other words, suppose we lower the temps 1°C at 30°C (from Wikipedia chart).

Figure 4: Mixing ratios
Doing so, we would change the mixing ratio by about 2g/kg. Now how much of a rise at -20C would we need to offset that? At -20°C the mixing ratio is about 0.7 g/kg. To move up 2 g to 2.7 g/kg, we would have to raise the temp about 15°C.
The changes in temperatures in the tropics have a much greater overall impact on the climate than those in the Arctic. It is, if you will, easy to warm cold, dry air, but to cool warm tropical air is much harder.  So if the Earth’s temperature is about steady, or falling off a bit as we saw in the graph above, and the Arctic is still warm, the compensating drop in the tropics means more to the Earth’s climate than the same movement of temps in the Arctic  It becomes a predictor of what has to happen as the PDO continues cold and the AMO turns cold…the warmer northern polar regions will cool. A degree is not a degree when it comes to the climate system. A one-degree movement up and down where wet bulb temperatures are 30°C have far greater effects on the system than a 1-degree change where its near 0. That is the message behind the mixing ratio example above.
Now let me ask you this question, in terms of the climate system, which is far more important: 1) the tropical oceans and the air masses around them, or  2) what is going on in the Arctic? The answer is given above.
Again this is simply saying there is a natural large-scale thermostat called the ocean. The warmer the ocean, the more it drives the whole climate system.
The slight cooling with dropping RH is a sign of bigger things to come. This means the wet bulbs are falling faster than the actual temps. It is a predictor of future temperature drops (it’s worse than we thought). For usually when the RH falls, the temperatures rise.  But in this case, temps are already falling and the RH is falling too!
At the very least I expect temperatures by 2030 to return to where they were in the late 1970s, which was the end of the last cold PDO phase and, by the way, the start of the satellite era: the most objective form of measurements.
Is the cooling worse than I thought? We are going to find out in the coming decades.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBelow Rainer Hoffmann presents Part 3 of his “10 Inconvenient Truths About Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber“. I wrote about Part 1 here, and Part 2 focused on Schellnhuber’s claiming that climate models provide projections, forecasts, scenarios, prognoses, depending on the situation being served at hand.
Part 3 below shows a whopper: Schellnhuber claiming that the complex, chaotic climate system can all be reduced down to a “simple linear relationship” with CO2 emissions.

The video starts by explaining how climate is a highly complex, chaotic non-linear system that cannot be defined by any single variable. At the 2:14 mark IPCC scientist Mojib Latif explains that calculating the future outcome of a system as complex as the climate is an impossible task. This is confirmed by Prof Andreas Bott at the 6:33 mark, “The systems of equations are non-linear, and thus not predictable.” The first 14 minutes of the film explain this in detail.
Even the 2001 IPCC reports tells us:
In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
But not everyone agrees with this.

For one, in 2009 Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research told us that climate is actually a simple system where global temperature behaves linearly with CO2 concentration. At the 15:00 mark Schellnhuber said on Phoenix public television on November 23, 2009:
We have been able to show at our institute, also our friends at Oxford, and at the University of Victoria in Vancouver Island, that there is an extremely simple, quasi linear relationship between the global mean temperature, that is the increase and the total amount of CO2 that will be blown into the atmosphere over the next four or five decades. The entire complexity of our climate system can be reduced to this simple linear relationship. Nature has done this favor as an exception.”
What a con-job. Schellnhuber then goes on to claim that scientists know exactly how much CO2 is allowed to be blown into the atmosphere before the climate systems tips: “750 billion tonnes of CO2 over the next 4 decades“.
So when it appeared the planet was warming, Schellnhuber told us that climate was a simple linear equation involving 2 variables. So what does Schellnhuber say today now that the data show there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years despite rising CO2?
Look at what Schellnhuber says on April 17, 2013. At the 17:34 mark Schellnhuber is shown blaming non-linearity for the absence of warming over 15 years.
So quickly can a con-artist turn on a dime.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman EU Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer has posted a very interesting view on Obama’s recently announced new climate initiatives, which aim to reduce USA’s CO2 emissions 50% by 2030.
Photo: MEP Holger Krahmer, EU
The reductions are supposedly to come mainly from “the shut down of coal power plants and the introduction of more renewable energies“.
But Krahmer calls Obama’s plan “a bluff”, and Europe is falling for it.
The announced efforts are in truth not efforts, and the reductions in CO2 emissions for the USA can be reached without any additional cost. American CO2 emissions have been falling for years, and have been so without any action from the government – ever since affordable gas from unconventional sources has started replacing coal as a source of energy. One could call the shale gas revolution also the market-economy energy revolution. […]

One look at the numbers shows: Coal’s share of the USA’s energy mix has been steadily dropping since 2007, from 48.9% to 37.4% in 2012. On the other hand, the share of natural gas has gone from 21.7% to 30.4% for the same time period.”
America’s use of renewable energy has also increased, but are still practically insignificant in the overall energy mix. Obama’s initiative is one that tries to grab credit for what the free-market economy is doing on its own already. As a result of the reduction in coal, Krahmer writes:
American CO2 emissions in the same time period dropped 13.5%. Of course it would not be serious to make a straight line extrapolation to the year 2030, but one can see that gas in the USA will continue its boom and that it will lead to a shift in the energy mix in favor of gas. Obama’s climate promises are only anticipating a development that is completely independent of any measures by the US government. In other words: It’s a reduction in US-CO2 emissions that is based on the fortune of having huge gas reserves at its disposal, and it is going to cost the USA nothing. Making promises that don’t cost anything is easy. And Obama did precisely that at his recent speech at Georgetown University.”
Krahmer then asks what shall the USA do with its vast coal reserves, which the country will no longer need. Krahmer writes that the answer is a no-brainer:
The coal will be exported. In 2012 the USA exported 125.7 million tonnes. In 2007 the amount was only 59.1 million tonnes. In just five years the USA was able to double its coal exports. The grateful customers of this American coal just happens to be self-anointed climate protection bulwark Europe, which in 2012 took in half of the total US coal exports. When Obama is serious about his climate promises, then he is not casting into question – as he announced – the financial support for coal power plant construction in foreign countries, but rather the export of American coal. Because this is not to be expected, nothing more needs to be said in regards to the free trade agreement with Europe.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago we saw how wind power in Britain at one point had fallen to just a fraction of one percent in supplying national demand. The situation was hardly better in Germany.
The following chart provided by Wilfried Heck here shows Germany’s electric power consumption and the energy fed in by wind and sun for the period of 24 February to March 3rd.

Chart by Wilfried Heck. Date and time shown by horizontal axis, power by vertical axis.
The chart above shows the time period broken down into 656 fifteen-minute time intervals. The mean value of the total consumption (blue) is 57,595 MW. The total electrical energy consumed for the period depicted was 9,445,650 MW-hrs. However, wind and sun were only able to supply 6.22 % and 2.12 % respectively, thus yielding a total contribution of 8.34% over the entire period.
Peak demand for 2013 was 73.283 MW occurring on 24 January 2013 at 7 p.m. But at that time, the sun had long been below the horizon and was not able to contribute anything. Heck writes: “And the wind? With 31,300 MW of installed capacity, it was able to only feed in 1479.1 MW into the German grid, thus contributing a measly 2% share of the electric power supply.”
The chart clearly shows times when wind and sun energy were practical doing nothing. So when the sun doesn’t shine (which is more often than not in Germany) and when the wind isn’t blowing strongly, the country needs all the old power plants back on line. 200% capacity is needed to assure 100% supply, and this in relatively windy regions.
Moreover, when the sun does shine and/or the wind blows, conventional power plants end up operating at levels well below their optimum efficiency, and thus do very little to cut back on emissions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes I really wonder about the people major media outlets choose to interview. The ones with the most spectacularly catastrophic visions get all the attention.
German scientist Lutz Wicke (photo right) said in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) that “future generations will curse us climate scientists” and that we now find ourselves in an “absolutely desperate situation” with regards to climate protection.
H/t: Oliver Geden @Twitter.
Wicke’s alarmist interview comes on the heels of the 4th International Petersberger Climate Dialogue in Berlin, which was supposed to lay the groundwork for the next UN climate conference in Warsaw in November. Representatives from 35 countries atteneded the Berlin Petersberger Climate Dialoge. However, little if any progress was achieved.
If Lutz Wicke is an indication, then activist scientists are becoming increasingly frustrated, outraged and impatient.
Wicke is from the Institute for Environmental Management at the ESCP Europe and in the interview “he is demanding that climate scientists worldwide join together and exert more influence on policymaking.”
Wicke says there’s absolutely no reason for optimism when it comes to nations finding an effective agreement to stem global warming.
Wicke has visions of Sahara-like summers
Wicke expects global temperature this century to rise 4°C, which, he says “means 8°C in the Mediterranaen region“:
Then in the summertime we will have heat waves there like in the Sahara. The living space of billions of people will destroyed.”
Wicke seems to suffer from acute climaphobia and to be obsessed with end-of-world scenarios. One thing is certain: he’s intent on spreading his fear to the readers of the Süddeutsche.
For a long time, the lack of progress in implementing an eco-authoritarianism on the world was blamed on political leaders, especially those from the USA, China and India. But now Wicke says climate scientists must take a share of the blame:
…they should have appropriately advised the political leaders. That didn’t happen. Even climate politicians are not expert enough to tell us in detail how agreements are to be designed so that a reduction in emissions can be reached.”
Wicke angry that states failed to boss citizens around
Here Wicke advocates that climate-paranoid scientists write international agreements for politicians. It gets better. A little later on in the interview he says:
It is crystal clear that states worldwide are not able to require themselves to appropriately reduce their emissions of climate gases, or to comply to these requirements. They can’t influence their citizens and the economy so that they accept it.”
In Wicke’s view, states just aren’t capable of bossing around their citizens and getting them to commit economic suicide. European climate alarmists are growing impatient.
Later in the interview Wicke suggests limiting per capita CO2 emissions globally to five tons per person, or taxing fossil fuels so much that they’ll be too expensive to use.

So why aren’t these brilliant ideas not being discussed, the Süddeutsche asks? Wicke:
Among other other things, climate scientists have been much too quiet about this.”
Wicke says scientists should write the international agreements
Amusingly, the Süddeutsche asks Wicke if climate scienists really are the right people to hammer out international agreements. Wicke:
Who, when not us, should politcians, who we meet at climate conferences, should make concrete proposals? Climate science cannot restrict itself to develoiping computer models. For that, the matter is just too important and dramatic.”
Then he says climate scientists need more funding so that they can do the things they need to do to rescue the planet.
Wicke: climate scientists can rescue the future generations
Wicke disagrees with Hans von Storch, who says science should deliver the results and leave the job of policymaking to the policymakers and citizenry. But Wicke insists:
Scientists cannot act like it’s all none of their business. We can’t just provide the diagnosis and then quit. We also have to try to prevent the prognoses from happening. This is about the destiny of future generations.”
Gee, who really stands to benefit in that deal? What would a roofing company be tempted to tell a homeowner who isn’t allowed to get a second opinion?
By now we get the sense that this Wicke scientist obviously is interested in only one thing. And we thought Schellnhuber was bad.
The Süddeutsche then correctly points out that scienitists in the past have made many false prognoses, so can the scientists really be trusted? Wicke:
The models must undergo continuous correction, that’s completely clear. But in the meantime the biggest problems we had at the start of climate science have been overcome. Also in the next 7-year IPCC report there will again certainly be small corrections to the earlier prognoses. But the certainty of how things will develop will be even greater. And we can thus expect the worst fears to be confirmed … with business as usual there will be with a high probability an increase in temperature of around 6°C by 2100. […]
If we do nothing now, then also us climate scientists will be cursed by the future generationsfor not having done enough to avoid the catastrophes – even though we knew they would happen.”
Just for Wicke, and his followers, here’s a chart showing what “small corrections” are needed:

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor a science claimed to have been settled already years ago, there sure are lots of new, profound questions popping up. For example: Why has global warming stopped? or Why are European winters getting bitter cold? or Why have the models been so wrong? or Where are the hurricanes!
Now there’s another question that has been unsettling scientists as of late: Why is Antarctic sea ice expanding?

Antarctica sea ice anomaly. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/jpg.
This is one question a German research institute now aims to answer. Antarctica has long been a painful thorn in the warmists’ side. Hopefully a real answer will be found, and not some concocted plausible-sounding explanation of the sort we’ve been getting lately.
Germany’s polar research center Alfred Wegener Institute located in Bremerhaven has issued a press release about its upcoming expedition to Antarctica.

Below I’ve highlighted the part describing one of the purposes of the expedition:
Bremerhaven, 6 June 2013. A group of researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research is flying to South Africa today. However this trip south is no summer holiday, but rather the start of a special journey: on Saturday, 8 June 2013 the research vessel Polarstern will be embarking on an expedition to the Antarctic winter. 49 researchers from institutes in twelve countries together with 44 crew members will spend a good two months in the Southern Ocean. They will be exploring the sea ice, the atmosphere and the ocean, until the expedition comes to an end on 12 August in Punta Arenas, Chile. 
The research ice-breaker Polarstern is one of the few ships in the world that is able to navigate the Antarctic Ocean in the winter. At this time of the year the Weddell Sea, which is the destination of the expedition, is covered by sea ice, and the members of the expedition team will face temperatures of around minus 30 degrees Celsius and the polar night with only a few hours of twilight. These special conditions have meant that not enough research has been carried out into several physical, chemical and biological processes in the Antarctic winter. The Antarctic plays a key role in the Earth System: It is where the so-called deep water, which drives global ocean currents, is formed.
Chief scientist Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke from the Alfred Wegener Institute has assembled an international team and is taking the most modern research equipment on the expedition in order to obtain baseline data in the wintery Antarctic. On the Greenwich Meridian through to the Antarctic coast the team plans to investigate, for example, the fundamental question of why Antarctic sea ice is expanding slightly whilst the sea ice cover in the Arctic is steadily shrinking.
The second half of the expedition then moves on to the incipient spring: the planned route takes the Polarstern from the Antarctic coast in a north-westerly direction, away from the polar night and into the rising sun. The second central question addressed by the research programme looks at which mechanisms permit the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean to come back to life after the long, cold and dark winter. You can also follow the route of the Polarstern live here: http://expedition.awi.de/.”

CNN reports here on the latest UN World Happiness Report, issued from the comfy confines of their New York or Geneva offices. I’m a little confused here. Is the report from the UN or Columbia University? Is there really a difference?
The study assessed people’s happiness in 156 countries, based on western metrics having to do with economics, social support, generosity, mental illness, etc..
Europe ranks highest in happiness
Their findings: Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden are the world’s happiest countries, and Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Benin and Togo are the unhappiest.
Let’s all rush to be like hip Europeans, the report wants to tell us. But can we really trust the elitist authors of the report? One could easily interpret the report as racist. Look at the study’s message: Northern European, socialist secular societies (the whitest of the whites) are the happiest. Sub-Saharan African countries, on the other hand, are just all so miserable. Of course the authors surely are not at all racist, but they are indeed very ARROGANT.
I don’t trust the yardstick used by the authors here, and I ask: Are the European countries really the happiest?
Europe is a basket case in terms of suicide rates
Let’s look at suicide rates. Surely it must be very very low among all those happy European countries. But according to Wikipedia statistics here, it appears happy Europeans aren’t coping very well at all with all their “happiness”. They seem to be jumping off bridges with uncontrollable glee. According to suicide statistics, many of the “happiest countries in the world” are also among the top 50 when it comes to suicide rate!

Worldwide, No.1 happy Denmark ranks No. 41 in suicides, No. 2 happy country Norway ranks No. 35 in suicides, No. 3 Switzerland ranks 45th in suicides, No. 4 happy country Holland ranks a relatively non-suicidal no. 53 and no. 5 Sweden in terms of happiness comes in at no. 44 in not wanting to live. Quite happy Finland, ranked no. 7, is also quite happy about ending it all, coming in at a whopping no. 19 in suicides.
Europe on suicide watch
Europe likes to insist that it’s happy, but the statistics show that the continent is a basket case when it comes to suicides. Thirteen of the top 20 countries in terms of suicide rate are in Europe.
Lo and behold, not a single African country is in the top 30 for suicides. I guess they’re just too unhappy to jump off bridges.
In summary what we have is a group of elitists trying to convince the whole world that we should all live like secular, socialist Europeans. This study is certainly blinded and biased by western arrogance. You can throw it in the dustbin. It’s just more quack science in service of an agenda.
Climate change ending Happy Days for northerners!
There’s a new study out claiming that climate change leads to depression. Ironically the study comes from Canada, also a nation ranked high on the happiness list. Seems like they are having unhappiness problems, and are content to blame it on climate change. The study’s abstract writes (my emphasis):
Recently, research is beginning to indicate that changes in climate, and the subsequent disruption to the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health, may cause increased incidences and prevalence of mental health issues, emotional responses, and large-scale sociopsychological changes. Through a multi-year, community-led, exploratory case study conducted in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, this research […] reported that changes in weather, snow and ice stability and extent, and wildlife and vegetation patterns attributed to climate change were negatively impacting mental health and well-being due to disruptions in land-based activities and a loss of place-based solace and cultural identity. Participants reported that changes in climate and environment increased family stress, enhanced the possibility of increased drug and alcohol usage, amplified previous traumas and mental health stressors, and were implicated in increased potential for suicide ideation. While a preliminary case study, these exploratory findings indicate that climate change is becoming an additional mental health stressor for resource-dependent communities and provide a baseline for further research.
So there you have it today. Two studies that are complete nonsense.

What follows is the letter that Bengtsson and the 3 other scientists had published January 21, 2013 by the Swedish major daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter in English (my emphasis):
=======================================
Misinterpreted climate report threatens the credibility of scientists
The World Bank’s  recent climate report was not saying that we necessarily face an extreme global temperature increase – but was about the potential consequences of such. It is one of several examples of how climate information can be misinterpreted and ultimately damage the credibility of researchers, writes leading climate scientists.
Recently, the World Bank published a report entitled ‘Turn down the heat: Why a 4° C warmer world must be avoided’.
The report received wide media exposure with its dramatic title, and in that it was the World Bank, which published it. The Bank had commissioned a German institute in Potsdam to write the report. It does not contain an analysis of the Earth’s climate, but primarily deals with the consequences of a supposed global temperature rise of 4°C. No detailed analysis was made of the probability of such a change. This was not clear in the Swedish debate.
As a warming of 4°C during this century is extremely worrying, it is important to try to assess how reasonable such a strong warming is. Individual model simulations have calculated global warming by 2100 of +6°C or more, but these have been deemed highly unlikely by the UN climate panel (IPCC 2007). The slow global warming, especially over the past 15 years, has reinforced this view.
Since the 1800s, the concentration of carbon dioxide along with other greenhouse gases have increased by about 75 per cent. Meanwhile, the earth’s average temperature has increased by about 0.8°C. Such a temperature increase is much smaller than the model calculations provide and only takes into account the increase in greenhouse gases as the cause. There may be compensatory cooling from aerosol particles, but systematic errors in the model calculations can not be excluded.
There is great uncertainty over how sensitive the climate system is to human influence and thus how high the carbon content must be to provide a warming of 4°C. Even with a high climate sensitivity a level of at least 1000 ppmv is probably required. This would require annual carbon emissions significantly higher than today.
An increase in temperature leads to an increase of the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. This leads to a climate with more extreme precipitation with a tendency for increased precipitation at high latitudes and in the equatorial region and reduced rainfall in many parts of the areas just outside the tropics. One exposed area is the Mediterranean region. Given the dominant natural variations in the weather from year to year, it is not yet possible to reliably determine whether a systematic change in precipitation has occurred.
The increase in sea level is a result of ocean thermal expansion and mass contribution from melting of mountain glaciers and land ice. The increase based on recent satellite measurements amount to an average of about 3 mm/year (approximately 2 mm/year due to water mass addition, about half from mountain glaciers and the other half from land ice).
During the past 20 years, no acceleration of the increase of the sea level occurred. No apparent relationship between sea levels and global temperature changes during the 1900s appears to exist.

Extreme weather events create a great deal of attention because of the loss of life and extensive economic damage. With  a generalized global warming, one can expect more extreme high temperatures, but also fewer extremely low temperatures, for which there are now indications.
Tropical storms are often attributed to global warming. Current examples include Hurricane Sandy that plagued parts of the U.S. East Coast in late October 2012 and the typhoon Bopha that hit the Philippines a month later.
The mass media conveyed in many cases the perception that these tropical hurricanes were a result of the greenhouse effect. But there are no indications of an increasing trend in the intensity or number of tropical hurricanes.  The large increase in damage caused by severe storms in different parts of the world is caused mainly by people increasingly living and working in more exposed locations.
The most obvious consequences of climatic change during the last decades is the melting of mountain glaciers over most of the earth and of summer sea ice in the Arctic.
Although it is not entirely inconceivable that similar reductions may have occurred in previous centuries, it is likely that the reduction of summer sea ice in the Arctic is unique. Model calculations support the view that this is linked to an increasing greenhouse effect.
In summary, we believe that a temperature increase of as much as 4° C during this century is very unlikely. Nor is there any basis for claims that tropical hurricanes have become more extreme and more frequent.
We believe that the media, instead of blowing up the results of individual publications should give special attention to the specific international organization – IPCC – which by the international community has been charged with the continuous and comprehensive synthesis of a large body of research on the climate thus putting individual reports like the The World Bank’s in a larger perspective. The next IPCC assessment will be published in September 2013.
We want to use this article in no way to detract from the problem of global warming and its possible consequences. We only want to warn that misguided information may have the effect that the credibility of scientists can be questioned and that measures to deal with climate change may receive the wrong priorities. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has in their analysis of energy issues assumed that reducing carbon emissions will have high priority in global politics and that very large investments over time are needed to replace fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives.
Society must also be prepared for climatic changes in order to protect the population against extreme weather events and systematic changes in climate, whether as a result of global warming or not.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMark Levin’s Landmark Legal Foundation has filed an opposition to the EPA’s motion for summary judgement in the “Greenhouse Gases” case in U.S. Supreme Court. Looks like the EPA has been much less than forthcoming when dealing with Freedom of Information Act requests and is hiding something.

Mark Levin goes to the Supreme Court in an attempt to pry open the EPA. Photo by: Mark Taylor, Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
Landmark writes at its site that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is attempting to “shut down the leading challenge to its claim that it has the statutory power to regulate carbon dioxide and other ‘greenhouse gases’ from millions of sources around the country“.
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Landmark, former administrator Lisa P. Jackson, current administrator Bob Perciasepe, and Jackson’s chief of staff’s records “all appear to have been excluded from the search for responsive records. The LLF Their exclusion appears to be the result of EPA’s apparent bad faith implementation of an agreement to narrow the scope of search to EPA’s senior officials in the Washington, D.C. headquarters.”
The FOIA request sought records that would “reveal whether or not EPA’s political officials were participating in the improper manipulation of the Agency’s regulatory agenda” with the aim of helping President Barack Obama in the 2012 general election.
In the court filing, the plaintiff Landmark claims the EPA “has engaged in a breathless pattern of obfuscation and apparent deception in its response to Landmark’s FOIA.” So much for the most transparent administration ever.

The EPA refused releasing records, citing “privacy exemption” rights, which the LLF calls “not legally justified”.
An agency must justify withholding responsive records, and bears the burden of defending its withholding of records responsive to a FOIA request. Landmark writes that the EPA failed to perform an adequate search and failed to properly justify withholdings in response to Landmark’s FOIA request, saying that it “unreasonably and improperly limited the search”.
Landmark calls the Agency’s declaration “vague, conclusory, and does not describe a search sufficient for summary judgment”.
The conclusion of Landmark’s filing reads:

The record in this case leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the search and the good faith conduct of EPA officials in the processing of Landmark’s FOIA request at issue in this cause of action. Accordingly, EPA is not entitled to summary judgment. The Court should deny the motion and instead should order EPA to submit to discovery in order to afford Landmark the opportunity to determine the circumstances surrounding EPA’s improper limitation of the scope of its search for responsive records — including whether EPA employees have acted in bad faith; and to determine the actual scope of EPA’s search for responsive records. Finally, the Court should award Landmark its attorneys fees and costs incurred to conduct such discovery.”

With the formidable Landmark Legal Foundation taking the EPA to get public information, and attorney Chris Horner doing the same, the EPA is coming under massive pressure to honor the pledge of transparency that the President promised earlier. Eventually it’s all going to come out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDonna Laframboise here at No Frakking Consensus refers us to a recent article on a “scientific study” that confirms dissent and skepticism over climate science is spreading globally and rapidly – in the form of books.
In the field of science that’s really good news because that’s how science progresses. It’s also essential for assuring a thriving democracy and holding off tyrants.
But it’s not good for devout global warming followers, like Cristine Russell of the Columbia Journalism Review, or the two authors of a new peer-reviewed paper by Riley E. Dunlap of Oklahoma State University and Peter J. Jacques of the University of Central Florida. Dunlap and Jacques’s paper was published in February by the journal American Behavioral Scientist and claims that conservative think-tanks are behind a wave of skeptical books now spreading across the globe. 
One can’t help but get the impression that both of these American sociologists themselves are obsessed with the notion of a vast right-wing conspiracy being behind the global pandemic of sceptic climate books.
Although the two authors are abnormally hostile, aggressive and paranoid to those having a different opinion on climate science, their paper is a clear confirmation that climate science dissent and skepticism are alive and well globally.
Russell writes that “the authors noted that there had been an ‘explosion’ of books since 2007” since Al Gore’s AIT. “108 books were published between 1982 and 2010, half of them between 2005 and 2010, and 15 of them in 2010 alone.”
She adds:
While 66 of the 108 climate denial books came from American authors (61 percent), another 19 books (18 percent) came from the UK, followed by seven from Canada, and six from Australia. The rest came from nations such as Denmark, France, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Germany, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Since 2000, four of every 10 denial books have come from authors outside the US—evidence, say Dunlap and Jacques, of “the success of the US conservative movement in helping diffuse denial internationally.”
Thanks Ms Russell, Messieurs Dunlap and Jacques, for this very uplifting progress report. Hopefully someday you’ll see the benefits of dissent and open debate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe know that according to the catastrophe-obsessed nut-jobs, everything bad is enhanced or caused by global warming. So this won’t surprise you.
A new journal article appearing in Oceanography by scientists Charles H. Greene, Jennifer Francis und Bruce Monger at Cornell University now suggests that Hurricane Sandy was related to human-caused climate change. The article is short, and is worth reading just for the laughs.

Hurricane Sandy was just too weird to not have been caused by AGW, scientists suggest. Photo source: http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/GOESEast.php, public domain photo.
According to the journal article, the relatively open late summer waters in the Arctic disturbs the Arctic polar Jet Stream and thus causes weird weather down in the middle latitudes. The scientists write that Sandy did not lose strength after making landfall “because it was supercharged with energy derived from a southward dip in the jet stream over the Mississippi Valley that ushered in an invasion of cold Arctic air (Figure 1).”
Of course nobody is going to dispute how the course and strength of Sandy developed. That’s well-documented. But to say that the weather patterns that led to Sandy’s development were due to human caused global warming indicates a science that is desperately clinging to life.

As evidence of a link to global warming, the authors say that Sandy taking a sharp turn west was “something never observed before in records going back to 1851”. In other words because the weather did not behave normally, global warming had to have been behind it. Moreover, the authors write: “To literally top it off, the storm surge combined with full-moon high tides and huge ocean waves to produce recordhigh water levels that exceeded the worst-case predictions for certain parts of New York City.”
Almost in comic fashion, the authors also attempt to pre-emptively defend themselves against the expected (well-deserved) criticism, basically saying that Sandy’s behavior and the weather patterns surrounding the storm were so unususual that it had to be have been due to the global warming-induced Arctic ice melt.
And maybe so was that freak car accident that occurred on last weekend’s icy streets.
They reason:
Although a direct causal link has not been established…perhaps the likelihood of greenhouse warming playing a significant role in Sandy’s evolution as an extra-tropical superstorm is at least as plausible as the idea that this storm was simply a freak of nature.”
This today passes as science. Sad.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust when you thought going green could not get more outrageous, now comes one of the most enraging plans imaginable: erecting a large-scale wind park next to the sacred D Day beaches of Normandy, where thousands of soldiers died to liberate France and Europe in 1944.

Members of an American landing party lend helping hands to other members of their organization whose landing craft was sunk be enemy action of the coast of France. These survivors reached Omaha Beach, by using a life raft. Photographer: Weintraub, 6 June 1944. Image source: U.S. federal government, the image is in the public domain.
The English-language The Local from France reports here that “A controversy is brewing over plans to construct 75 windmills in Normandy, next to the site of the D-Day landings in WWII. Opponents of the French project say the windpark would be an act of desecration. […] desecrates the memory of the liberators.”
The Local writes that the project is being proposed by French power company EDF, which plans to construct seventy five 100-meter tall windmills near the beaches where British and Canadian forces landed and thousands lost their lives. The Local adds:

‘These beaches belong to history. It’s from here that the liberation of the world began. If you allow the comparison, I don’t think the Germans would permit the construction of a wind park next to the ruins of a concentration camp. These are sacred areas,’ said Karel Scheerlinck, a Belgian who lives in the town.”
Is this how some people in France say “merci”? Talk about ingrates. For a nation that prides itself in being sophisticated, this idea sure is an example of very poor manners and bad upbringing by some among them.
This is an idea they’d be wise to scrap immediately.

Just a few years ago global warming experts (like David Viner and Mojib Latif) were forecasting balmy, snowless winters for Europe. Now we see just the opposite is taking place.
For the US, Joe says that before the Atlantic turns colder, springs are likely to be colder like in the 1950s.
On Al Gore, Joe Bastardi wonders if he ever looks at anything that challenges his belief.

Do They Even Look?
Baffled German Government Concedes! “Global Warming Has Stopped…Warming Pause Is Remarkable…Unexpected”
This is a headline in my friend Pierre Gosselin’s Blog “No Tricks Zone.” The article is here for you to read, but in it, there is an admission that global warming has stopped and it’s baffling as to why.
There is much to be gained from this about the methods of people pushing this issue. The headline above uses the word “baffled.” It should not be, and here is why: Most environmentalists simply will not look at anything that can challenge their idea. The turn to colder in Europe and the far East has been easier to forecast than the US following the turn to colder in the Pacific Decadol Oscillation. The linkage to colder is much faster in these areas, when the Atlantic is in its warm cycle as it still is (I have a de-icing company that supplies both areas, so being right is crucial.) In the US, it lags because…”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt took them 15 years to notice it: CO2 is not driving the climate.
German online daily Hamburger Abendblatt here has a story titled: Global Warming Takes A Break, citing the leaked copy of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which is due to be released in September, 2013. The Hamburger Abendblatt writes (emphasis aded):
The preliminary text is very clear that the global temperature increase does not follow the continuous rise of CO2 emissions. That’s water on the water-wheel of climate skeptics, who argue that it is more the impacts of the sun that warm the Earth, and greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, less so.”
The Hamburger Abendblatt asks:
Just how reliable are computer simulations that, although they correctly predicted the CO2 increase of the last 15 years, were completely off with the temperature development?”
Global temperatures have stagnated since the new millennium began. To answer that question, the German daily asks (alarmist) professor Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute für Meteorology in Hamburg. He told the Abendblatt: “Such plateaus also show up in our models. In such periods heat is absorbed more by the depths of the oceans. We can’t explain why this is so.”

Maybe plateaus do show up in the models here and there. But none of the models showed a plateau for the last 15 years.
Marotzke then insists that the record low Arctic sea ice extent measured last summer shows that things are heating up. Yet, strangely, he develops amnesia when it come to the Antarctic record high sea ice extent recorded last fall.
The Abendblatt also writes that Marotzke is also annoyed that the IPCC AR5 draft was released prematurely, claiming that “it didn’t belong in public” and that “It is like stealing an unfinished car from the factory and then complaining that it is not complete.”
Marotzke adds:
Anyone who signs up via the Internet and says he is an expert participates in the process. He only has to name 5 publications, which however are not assessed by the IPCC. We simply expect the information to be true. This openness makes us vulnerable.”
Concerning his “unfinished car” analogy, I think here Marotzke is saying that they forgot to put on the hood to hide the fact that the car doesn’t have, and never will have, a CO2 engine.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCan we trust the media?
Germany’s massive public funded radio and television demonstrates to us that the answer is: not always. Yesterday many media outlets reported on the 2-year anniversary of Japan’s “earthquake/tsunami/Fukushima” disaster. The way some German public television and radio outlets are presenting the disaster 2 years later would probably make even North Korean state media officials blush.
For example, (hat-tip EIKE) flagship German public television ARD presented the story yesterday, claiming:
Japan remembers the victims of the devastating earthquake and tsunami catastrophe of 2 years ago. A scale 9 earthquake had shaken the northeast of the country and caused a tsunami. This caused a reactor accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Almost 16,000 people died. Thousands are still missing.”
I heard the very same deception earlier yesterday morning on German public NDR DisInfo radio. The reality, of course, is that so far not a single death has been attributed to the Fukushima accident. But that’s the last thing Germany’s manipulative public media want their audiences to believe.

“Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Today Japan is remembering the victims of the devastating earthquake and tsunami catastrophe of two years ago. A powerful earthquake of 9 had shaken the northeast part of the country and unleashed an up to 20-meter tsunami. A reactor accident resulted at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Thereby 16,000 people were killed. Thousands are still missing.”
Even bolder and misleading about it was anchor Thorsten Schröder (see video and quote above) of the ARD Tagesschau, early yesterday morning.
In a functioning democracy, a good public media editor would make sure that the facts are presented clearly and accurately. But a slimey, manipulative editor might take the chance to intentionally mislead the people, and later defend his action by saying: well, you can’t prove it! and that “there is no reason to be talking about a blatantly false report or the like“.
German reporting by ARD and ZDF public television and radio on climate change is no less manipulative. Climate change is real and is happening right now. Never mind the all the cold winters we’ve been having, they keep telling us, ignoring the real data.
Germany’s green public media have long been on a mission to upbring citizens on responsible energy use, climate, and environmentalism. So we suspect here they just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to remind viewers and listeners that nuclear is bad and kills thousands.
Germany’s now famous Energiewende – energy transition from fossil and nuclear energy to renewables – is coming under increasing fire from the public due to its trillion-euro and still rising price tag, and the media are desperate for a story to convince the public that it is still “the right thing to do”. Fukushima was an opportunity to help do just that.

The avalanche starts to roll: British weather service drastically scales back its prognoses for warming
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited with permission by P Gosselin)
The British weather service is one of the first important organisations to pull the emergency brake and drastically scale back its warming prognoses for 2020. After 15 years of no warming, it’s obvious that the models have been re-evaluated by the UK Met Office and that they have given up on the notion of an imminent global warming surge (see report at Tallbloke’s Talkshop).
The old prognoses showed a temperature increase of almost 0.5°C by the end of the current decade. Now the scientists expect the temperature will stay more or less stable, perhaps rising a tenth of a degree.
An animated comparator of the old and new prognosis is provided by Bob Tisdale.

Before and after comparison of the old and new UK Met Office temperature prognosis. Source: Bob Tisdale, also see Tallbloke’s Talkshop.
Former Max-Planck Institute of Meteorology Director Hartmut Graßl and GISS director James Hansen are not going to be amused. Their legendary heat prognoses have lost yet more backing from today’s science (see our blog articles: “Graßl’s warming prognoses of 1990 risks dramatic collapse” and “What happened with James Hansen’s temperature forecast of 1988? Time for a look back“).

Share this...FacebookTwitterOcean warming, caused by man-made global warming, was supposed to lead to the destruction of the corals we were told again and again.
But now a new study published at the Marine Pollution Bulletin shows that corals are far more resilient than first thought. More bad news for the catastrophe-obsessed climate kooks.
The National Oceanography Centre here reports:
A number of coral species survive at seawater temperatures far higher than estimates for the tropics during the next century.
We associate coral reefs with tropical seas of around 28 degrees so in that mindset even slight warming can have devastating effects on corals. But in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, corals survive seawater temperatures of up to 36 degrees Celsius every summer, heat levels that would kill corals elsewhere. Corals have adapted.
Reefs are made up of many species of coral, each of which have a mutually beneficial, or “symbiotic”, relationship with algae living in their tissue. These algae supply vital nutrition to the host but are sensitive to environmental changes including increases in seawater temperature. […]

‘In Gulf corals, both the coral host and the associated algal partners need to withstand the high seawater temperatures,’ said Dr Wiedenmann who led the study.
But the scientists were surprised to discover that the algae in Gulf corals belong to a group not known for its thermal tolerance.
‘We see that the algae are indeed special but in a way that we did not expect,’ said Dr Wiedenmann. ‘The algae that we found in most of the corals in Abu Dhabi reefs were previously described as a ‘generalist strain’ that is usually not found in corals exposed to high levels of heat stress.’
‘The system seems to be more complex than it is commonly thought…’ “

How long have corals been around and what temperature extremes have they survived before? The results of the study are hardly a surprise.

Most of the attendees are retired German scientists and experts who are free to speak their minds without fear of occupational retaliation or loss of privileges.
EIKE is a privately funded institute that critically and objectively looks at climate science and the data behind it. Having taken a comprehensive look at the science, they’ve reached a conclusion that is best summed up by veteran meteorologist and EIKE spokesman Klaus-Eckhart Puls at the 0:28 mark:
Politicians have empowered an absurd science called ‘climate protection’. In it they strive to attain a certain climate by turning CO2 knobs and meeting a 2°C target within a climate system that we know is highly complex. It’s simply absurd.”
Puls says the same about politicians calling plant-food CO2 a pollutant or a “climate killer“.
At the 1:58 mark expert meteorologist Prof. Dr. Walter Fett comments on climate models and water vapor feedbacks:

This [assumed] positive feedback is not some natural physical law. It’s a demand that has to be made so that it works. You can also see it the other way around, … that there’s a negative feedback that has a stabilizing effect for the atmosphere.”
Vice President Michael Limburg adds at the 3-minute mark that the transition to renewable energy only “makes the best energy available expensive” and is leading “to an exodus of jobs and businesses2 out of Germany.” The film adds that renewable energies in Germany thus far have been a failure and has only driven up costs.
At the 4:10 mark Dr. Bernd Benser tells the audience that renewable energies have made the German power grid unstable. Power companies had to intervene on 267 days and warns that should projected amounts of volatile renewable energy be fed in into the power grid over the coming years, then the possibility of blackouts becomes very real. “Blackouts for Germany all because of dubious climate models.”
Later in the video Klaus Angerer calls for more openness for shale gas, calling it a “game-changer” in the energy markets. Here he reminds the audience that shale gas has led to a boom in the USA and has reduced CO2 emissions at the same time.
EIKE urges politicians to base there decisions on the facts, and not dubious models. Klaus-Eckhard Puls summarizes:
We have to be able to finally ask ourselves after 25 years of of the catastrophe research why we have to pay billions, which could be used to fight hunger worldwide, to keep hearing over and over the same future scenarios using certain boundary conditions over which we know too little about and from which we cannot get any kind of reliable results. It shows the failure of the climate models across the entire board at the moment.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch, Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre in Germany, interviewed with the Austrian online kleinezeitung here. In the interview the renowned German professor looks at the proposed causes of the recent cold winter, his new book Die Klimafalle, and global warming in general.
The interview focused on a number of climate-related topics, but what follows are mainly his comments on the explanation that a warm Arctic in late summer causes cold in Central Europe in the late winter. Also included are some comments he made on climate science in general.
On the warm Arctic causing cold winters:
HvS: Here I’d be careful. With climate activity, countless factors interact with each other, and lots of explanations are possible. Using models it has been shown that this special mechanism could function that way. But that does not mean in any way that it is the deciding factor.
Can the cause of the cold winters be identified?
HvS: One has to ask why are such explanations first found after the event appears. It indeed would have been much nicer if someone had said already in the year 2000: By the way, you have to expect harder winters in Europe because the Arctic ice is retreating in the summer. This claim today then would have been far more convincing. But it was the other way around: We noticed that something strange had happened, and then an explanation was constructed. Other explanations would also be possible.
Does the cold spring justify global warming skepticism?
HvS: No, I wouldn’t say that. But it is understandable that people are casting doubt and questioning things. In the past lots of sins were made in the communication surrounding climate change. The impression was aroused that there would no longer be cold winters, that snow was a thing of the past. If things had been clearly communicated right from the start, there would be less distrust today.

Why do you say the climate debate has reached a dead end?
HvS: In a kind of co-production, science and politics have generated the impression that certain political actions have to be taken based on resilient scientific results. Here citizens and society have no say in this, and are expected to just sit there and listen to the clever scientists explain how the situation is and what policy has to be implemented. This is almost a Medieval political understanding.
But isn’t the science good enough to base policy on?
HvS: Of course it is; the findings today are very sure and for the most part undisputed. But that doesn’t mean this applies to all the other claims that we’ve heard in the media and also from scientists. For example that hurricanes are getting worse, or that there will be hardly any snowy winters here. These embellishments are being presented as undisputed. Then the debate proceeds so that either you buy the whole package with all the exaggerations, or be labelled a skeptic who denies everything. It’s either you’re with us, or against us – as George W. Bush said.
How seriously can one really project climate development?
HvS: Actually nothing can be projected. What we offer are scenarios, i.e. possible developments under certain conditions. The results are scattered over a relatively wide range because of the uncertainties.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerd Heidecke of the online WAZ daily reports on a new survey conducted by polling institute Forsa, commissioned by the Ruhr Region Initiative. The pollsters asked over 1000 people about energy in the industrial heartland of North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Hat-tip Benny Peiser at Achse des Guten.
The title of the WAZ report is: “People in the Ruhr Region having doubts about the transition to renewable energy“.
For German standards, the poll produced some shocking results. Heidecke writes:
Among the people, skepticism about the transition to renewable energy is growing. According to a poll […] especially in the Ruhr Region, only a few believe in a rapid transformation of the energy sector. Many are worried about the energy costs.”

Heidecke also writes “that there’s great doubt the energy transition will succeed as planned” and that the abrupt change of course in the energy policy in the wake of Fukushima “does not correspond to the wishes of the citizens“.

In Germany only 9% of the population believe it will be possible to cover Germany ‘s energy demands with only renewable energy sources (only 6% in the Ruhr Region). In a nutshell: Germans no longer believe in the pipe dream and have already given up on it. In 2011, that figure was 39%.
Only hardcore greens still believe it’s possible (like the reality-detached Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Reserch – PIK).

Forsa concludes that a majority of citizens are more worried about energy being affordable and less so about it being green. Heidecke writes that the Ruhr Region Initiative moderator Bodo Hombach, who commissioned the poll, “was surprised by the great skepticism among the citizens concerning the transition to green energy“. Hombach said:
There’s a need for argumentation on all sides. Without the necessary acceptance, things will turn awry.”
The survey’s summary concludes:
The euphoria of politicians with regards to the transition to renewable energies is not spreading to the citizens. For the majority it is more important to have enough affordable energy available than it is to have ‘green’ energy.”
With only 9% of the German population believing it’ll work, proponents of green energy really have their work cut out for them.
Reading between the lines of the poll, people being more concerned about affordability tells us there is no longer much alarmism left. Being green to save the climate is not that important anymore. Five cold winters in a row does tend to refocus perceptions and bring people back to their senses.
The greens should recall what Winston Churchill once said: “With success, there are two kinds – initial success, and ultimate success.” Renewable energy had a lot of initial success, but ultimate success will be extremely elusive.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here links to an article published by Stimme Russlands (Voice of Russia). The article is titled: Die Welt vor einer Eiszeit, in English: The World On The Verge Of An Ice Age.
Reports of global cooling are becoming more frequent. FLASHBACK: 30 experts predict cooling.

NASA photo (public domain)
You’ll notice that this Voice of Russia report is more than a month old, and so one wonders why it was never picked up by the western mainstream media.
The article writes that Russian scientists are predicting that “a little ice age will begin in 2014“. The article adds:
They reject the claim of global warming and call it a marketing trick.”
Wow! That’s heavy.
When it comes to warming and the man-made CO2 greenhouse gas effect, the Voice of Russia writes that “Russian scientist Vladimir Bashkin is categorically in disagreement. He claims that the climatic changes are characterized by cycles and have nothing to do in any way with the activities of man.”

The Voice of Russia continues:
Together with his colleague Rauf Galiullin from the Institute for Fundamental Problems of Biology of the Russian Academy Of Science, he demonstrates that the current warming is a reverberation of the planet coming out of the ‘Little Ice Age’ and that in the near future, of course measured on geological timescales, we are at the threshold of an ice age.”
The Voice of Russia quotes Bashkin:
The periods of a cooling and a warming follow each other at 30-40 year intervals. In Russia for example there was a warming in the 1930s, a time when seafaring at the Northern Sea Route was possible, then a cooling followed during the wartime years, and then warming followed in the 1970s, etc.. The current warming period ended at the end of the millennium.“
Note here that the Russian scientists confirm that the Arctic sea ice extent was also low in the 1930s. This tells us that nothing is really so unusual in the Arctic today.
The Voice of Russia then explains that the cooling is related to “a change in solar activity” and that this “also has an impact on our climate“. Bashkin adds:
The scientific research of the climate of the past geological epoch causes us to doubt the motives behind the demands of the IPCC. […] “The greenhouse effect that is connected with the anthropogenic factor is about 4 or 5 percent of that from natural emissions. The eruption of a volcano produces more. A real contribution to the greenhouse effect is made by normal water vapor. Thank God nobody has gotten the idea that this too needs to be regulated.“
The Voice of Russia continues: “The world’s oceans contain 60 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere. When the temperature of the planet rises, it begins to be quickly released. This leads to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and not vice versa. A global warming that so many are talking about is not so much a scientific problem, rather it is much more a marketing trick. […] We do not have global warming ahead of us, rather we have global cooling, the Russian scientist claims. However, we do not need to fear the cooling because it will take place gradually and won’t be noticeable until the middle of the 21st century.”
The scientists add that part of the motive behind the “marketing trick” is to manipulate the market for fossil fuels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie kalte Sonne website posted an article yesterday about a Skeptical Science video folly.
============================================
Climate activist group close to IPCC removes video: The science on which it was based, from Stefan Rahmstorf, is no longer the scientific consensus
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning (translated/edited by P Gosselin)
For years Skeptical Science has been actively defending the climate catastrophe model scenarios of the IPCC. The name of the website was purposely selected to mislead, as it is not skeptical of the climate catastrophe, like the name implies. Rather it is more skeptical of climate skeptics (“Getting skeptical about global warming skepticism”). At the website, a group of activists discusses the more common climate-skeptical points and attempts to refute them scientifically, which more often than not fails. A look at the discussion there reveals shocking results. For example, an incomplete temperature chart was used as the basis of discussion for showing the climatic impacts of the sun. The temperature plateau of the last 15 years was mysteriously missing.
On 10 January 2013, a new 2-minute video was featured at Skeptical Science, which used the argumentation of Stefan Rahmstorf (Foster & Rahmstorf 2011) to show that the stop in temperature rise of the last years was indeed in agreement with the current IPCC models. So all was well at the IPCC. However, all that changed. A wave of new publications has shown a significantly reduced CO2 climate sensitivity and a stronger influence by ocean cycles. Moreover, scientists dismantled the methodical approach used in the video, and thus the one used by Foster & Rahmstorf (2011). Then about a month later on 21 February 2013, Skeptical Science pulled the emergency brake by taking down the video altogether. When you call up the video at YouTube, there’s nothing to see. At the Skeptical Science site the following message is found:
Update 21/02/2013: Troy Masters is doing some interesting analysis on the methods employed here and by Foster and Rahmstorf. On the basis of his results and my latest analysis I now think that the uncertainties presented here are significantly underestimated, and that the attribution of short term temperature trends is far from settled. There remains a lot of interesting work to be done on this subject.”
On 21 May 2013 Skeptical Science then published an even more detailed error discussion at its site. These efforts are openly welcome, and do help re-establish some confidence in climate science. However the broad rejection of the Foster & Rahmstorf approach by the IPCC colleagues does not come as a surprise. Already on February 4, Die kalte Sonne blog contributor Frank Bosse did a comprehensive error analysis of the dubious Rahmstorf paper. In his blog article “How much man-made influence is there in climate change?” Bosse criticized, writing:

We remove what we know very well and conclude from it: Whatever is left, must be anthropogenic. In the end that’s how you could describe the approach used by F/R 2011. This indeed may be a good strategy to use on TV quiz shows (the process of elimination) and may function reasonably well because there is only a very limited number of possible answers. However in science there’s always something new that gets found. One example is the effect of black carbon, or soot. It has been assigned a warming effect that is approximately  2/3 the effect of the IPCC-assumed CO2 warming effect (see our article ‘Soot is a much greater climate killer than previously thought. Must the CO2 effect now be scaled back?‘). The space that is left for CO2 in the overall equation is becoming increasingly smaller.  Who knows  what we will soon know with greater certainty and what we will be able to remove from the overall equation. Research on solar impacts on our climate is now proceeding at full speed and goes beyond the total solar irradiance (TSI). See our article ‘New US National Research Council Report on the Climate Effect of the Sun‘).”
At his KlimaLounge blog Ramstorf has been silent about the video folly. No comment. The large June 2013 flood seems to be taking most of his media attention.
With all the folly surrounding the video, it’s understandable that readers would want to view it as the latest sorrowful example in the recent science story. Although the original video has been removed by Skeptical Science and is no longer available to the public, some other dedicated climate catastrophe warrior has the video in his Youtube film repertoire. It’ll be interesting to see for how much longer (PS: you may want to save a copy – quickly!):

One question still remains open: Why didn’t Rahmstorf’s science-colleagues even lift a finger when the Foster & Rahmstorf 2011 paper appeared? Did it really have to take 2 years to discover that the simplistic methodical approach was incomplete? Other than scientific reasons, could other reasons be involved here?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe local Austrian daily Vorarlberg Online has a summary of this year’s winter in terms of costs for its region, written by Geraldine Rainer. She writes that the winter of 2012/13 has been an expensive one for the state and municipalities.

Arlberg. Photo released into the public domain by its author, Johnfmh.
This year’s Austrian winter is typical for much of Europe as the continent continues its battle against one of the most brutal in decades in terms of snow and cold.
According to Rainer, there have been many more snow days this year than normal, which has lead to much higher road-salt consumption in the Vorarlberg area: 10,500 tonnes thus far. By comparison only 7600 tonnes were used the winter before. “The higher consumption is due mainly to the greater number of days with snow and higher snowfall in the lower regions, especially around Unterland,“ says state road commissioner Ernst Geiger. And the winter is not over yet.
Under the featured photo in Vorarlberg Online report, the text reads: “Little sun, lots of snow – the 2012/13 winter is going to be one of the most expensive when it comes to snow-clearing.”
Cold snowy winters indeed involve much higher costs. The cities of Dornbirn of Feldkirch, for example, are already more than one third over their budgets this winter when it comes to road maintenance and plowing costs, Geiger writes.
Not only is the snow-clearing straining budgets, but so are the frost-related damages to asphalt road surfaces. “The current winter has seen much greater damage than in previous winters,” Geiger said. The final extent of the damage won’t be known until April.
Looking at the condition of streets here in North Germany, we see stretch after stretch of potholes, frost heaves, and ripped asphalt. It’s Europe’s story this year. The costs of this winter are just beginning to be tallied up.

Green Party top honcho Claudia Roth left an astonishing message at Facebook where she comments about the 2-year anniversary of the mega earthquake and tsunami that rattled northeastern Japan in March, 2011. Here’s a shot of her Facebook message (before it disappears):
+++ Story now a headline at Die Welt here! +++

Today two years ago occurred the devastating atomic catastrophe of Fukushima, which after Chernobyl once again has left an entire region and with it the entire world looking down an atomic precipice. In the catastrophe in Japan a total of 16,000 people died, more than 2700 are still considered missing. Hundreds of thousands are living away from the irradiated homes. Today our thoughts are with the victims and their families. The Fukushima catastrophe has once again shown us just how uncontrollable and deadly the high risk atomic technology is. Therefore we have to make every conceivable effort in Germany, and also in Europe and worldwide, to bring about the transformation to renewable energy as rapidly as possible instead of pushing it off, as the CDU-FDP are trying to do again. Fukushima is warning us.”
Claudia Roth is a highly influential politcian in Germany. She is not some uninformed twit off the street. In her comment she is communicating that it wasn’t the tsunami that caused all the deaths in Japan – rather it was the Fukushima accident, through man’s negligence. This is as grotesque of a revision of history and hideous lie as you’ll ever find.
The fact is that not a single death has been attributed to the Fukushima accident to this day. Surely some will likely get ill and may die later on, but name one product that isn’t capable of killing.
This tells us just how desperate the greens have gotten and the means they’ll resort to in salvaging their green project of renewable energy. Now they have to shamelessly lie and fabricate an entirely new historical record that fits their agenda.
Can we believe them on climate science?
Now at Bild.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother major European media outlet is asking: Where’s the global warming?
Image right: The August 7 edition of Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten featured a major 2-page article on the globe’s 15-years of missing warming and the potential solar causes and implications.
Moreover, they are featuring prominent skeptic scientists who are warning of a potential little ice age and dismissing CO2 as a major climate driver. And all of this just before the release of the IPCC’s 5AR, no less!
Hat-tip: NTZ reader Arne Garbøl
The August 7 print edition of the Danish Jyllands-Posten, the famous daily that published the “Muhammad caricatures“, features a full 2-page article bearing the headline: “The behavior of the sun may trigger a new little ice age” followed by the sub-headline: “Defying all predictions, the globe may be on the road towards a new little ice age with much colder winters.”
So now even the once very green Danish media is now spreading the seeds of doubt. So quickly can “settled science” become controversial and hotly disputed. The climate debate is far from over. And when it does end, it looks increasingly as if it’ll end in favor of the skeptics.
The JP writes that “many will be startled” by the news that a little ice age is a real possibility. Indeed, western citizens have been conditioned to think that nothing except warming is possible. Few have prepared for any other possibility.
In its latest 2-page report, the JP now appears to tell its readers that our views on climate science have to be much more open minded and unshackled from the chains of dogmatism.
JP starts by reminding readers that it was just over 100 years ago that the world had clawed itself out of the little ice age, which extended from 1400 – 1900, a time when the Thames river often froze over. All paths in determining the cause of the little ice age all seem to converge to a single factor: solar activity.
The Jyllands-Posten quotes David Hathaway:
‘We now have the lowest solar activity in 100 years,’ David Hathaway from American space research institute NASA newly concluded in connection to the release of new figures for the sun’s activity. He said the activity for the ongoing cycle is half of the previous cycle, and he predicted an even lower activity for the next cycle, which will hit us in few years.”
Suddenly even the greenest of media outlets among us are contemplating what the consequences of a quiet sun may be. The JP then quotes Irish solar specialist Ian Elliott, who says these consequences could be dramatic:
It indicates that we may be on the path to a new little ice age. It seems likely we are on the path to a period with very low solar activity, which could mean that we may have some very cold winters.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Elliott then cites the ice-cold winters of 2009 and 2010 as early signs.
JP then cites at length Danish astrophysicist Henrik Svensmark, who needs no introduction:
Since the 1940s and up to 10 years ago we have had the highest solar activity in 1000 years. The last time we had solar activity that high was when we had the Medieval Warm Period from year 1000 to around 1300. … Historically there has been a close connection between solar activity and temperature for the last 1000 years. Therefore the sun’s activity will also have influence the coming many years. … The unusual thing right now is that sun’s activity is decreasing while there’s a great increase in atmospheric CO2. For that reason the question is how much the earth will cool in a time of decreasing solar activity. … The development is beautifully consistent with a cooling effect of the solar activity in the same period. This could mean that the temperature will not rise for the next 30 years or maybe begin to decrease.”
JP also quotes Svensmark on the subject of the IPCC: “…many of the climate models used by IPCC and others overestimate the influence of CO2 and underestimate the influence of the sun. … The IPCC is very one-sided, so I don’t think there will be anything reasonable in the next report.”
Where did all the heat go?
In the second part (see right) of the JP’s feature story on climate science, the daily asks whatever happened to all the missing warming?
Despite predictions that the temperature on the globe should rise with a huge speed, nothing has really happened the last 10-15 years. However climate scientists are insisting we are in the middle of the heaviest global warming maybe ever, and that the temperature will rise with at least 2-4 degrees towards the year 2100.”
JP asks scientist Sebastian Mernild of the Glaciology and Climate Change Laboratory Center for Scientific Studies in Chile, who insists that ocean currents have taken the heat “down to the deep sea”.
Once unthinkable just a few years ago, the European media and JP are now starting to admit the oceans are a poorly understood wild card in the climate equation after all. JP openly states, “The oceans are generally regarded as the big wildcard in the climate discussion.” Jylland Posten ends its 2-page feature story with questions and comments by Svensmark:
How should ocean water under 700 meters be warmed up without a warming in the upper part? … In the period 1990-2000 you could see a rise in the ocean temperatures, which fit with the greenhouse effect. But it hasn’t been seen for the last 10 years. Temperatures don’t rise without the heat content in the sea increasing. Several thousand buoys put into the sea to measure temperature haven’t registered any rise in sea temperatures.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the Little Ice Age brought widespread crop failures, mass starvation, and disease in populated Europe some centuries ago, the enlightened ones blamed the climate-related misery and misfortune on the black magic of sorcerers and witches – who were promptly tried and burned at the stake. In other cultures, people performed rain-dances, human sacrifices, or other bizarre rituals, all in a futile attempt to appease the weather gods. Of course the victims of these rituals were often political opponents.
Today nothing has changed apparently, as Spiegel poignantly demonstrates with its latest online round of hysterics titled: Flut-Drama in Deutschland: Wir sind schuldig!  In English: Flood Drama in Germany: We’re to Blame! by Jakob Augstein.
According to Augstein, today’s German flooding is a result of man’s sins against the climate. Climate deniers are mostly to blame for the “Katastrophe“. He writes:
High water of the century is rolling across southern and eastern Germany. Now is an opportunity to take the deniers of climate change for a tour of the dikes, and to take the preachers of growth to Magdeburg. But they would just say they are not to blame. And we would all agree!”
If you thought Augstein sounded like some zealot inquisitor from the Dark Ages who zealously prosecuted at witch trials, you wouldn’t be far off. His hysterical language and mindset are the same. In publishing his ridiculous commentary, Spiegel looks like it is stuck in the Dark Ages. Little wonder that renowned astrophysicists like Murry Salby are calling climate science a “cult science“.
In describing the flooding disaster in his commentary, it’s clear for Augstein:  “Our way of living is not coming without a price.”
He adds:
The question is: What proof do the climate change deniers need before they open their eyes? What is it going to take to get the preachers of growth to learn?
Like during the Dark Ages, weather misfortunes are proof enough for the high priests and witch-trial seeking prosecutors like Augstein. Who needs scientific data when we have Maxeiner, Miersch and Magdeburg?

Today modern climate statistics show that hurricanes/accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) are near lows, tornadoes show no trend, and global temperature has been flat 15 years. Worse, ALL the crystal ball warming projections of the “renowned” scientists have been completely wrong from the start.

All 73 models got it completely wrong. Source: drroyspencer.com/
Yet, Spiegel thinks we should just ignore all the hard data and simply accept a single spring flood as a “moment of clairvoyance“.
In his tirade, Augstein singles out pro-growth economics professor Karl-Heinz Paqué, who he says is to be thanked for making sure the Enquete Commission Report to the German government of last week became a “document of failure“. He goes after skeptic journalists Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxeiner for discrediting the results of climate science in the “right-wing corner” of a leading daily, saying that the German government was correct in singling them out and slandering them as infidels.
Augstein sees little hope that people will adopt the green religion (good news!) and warns us by bringing up the downfall of earlier human civilizations.
Those who follow old ways under new living conditions will end up extinct. That’s what did in the people of Easter Island, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Mayans. We should not be surprised if we are next.”
Ironically, all of those earlier civilizations perished because of natural climate change, and for some extinction came because they tried to solve their climate problems precisely with neurotic rituals like human sacrifices, and rain-dancing. Today Augstein and Spiegel are advocating we do the same, but with different rituals: changing light bulbs, going by foot and buying locally. Ask the people whose homes were flooded in Magdeburg if their energy saving lights, carbon credits and buying locally kept the waters back. Human rituals, no matter how righteously and ceremoniously carried out, aren’t going to control the weather.
Science is not about accepting what “renowned” scientists insist we believe, and not daring to question their authority. To the contrary, it is precisely about not accepting what they insist we believe, and it is about scrutinising and putting what they tell us to rigorous test. Anything else is just the superstition of fools, which belongs to the dustbin of history – to join the Dark Ages, witch-hunters, and Augstein.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday is the 80-year anniversary of mass book burning by Nazi Germany in 1933, one of the darkest chapters of human civilization.

Literary and philosophical works that did not conform to the ideological standards of the Nationalist Socialist Party were collected from prestigious university libraries and burned in public. They included some of the greatest works ever written. Much of the burning was zealously carried out by students and academics.
Wikipedia writes: “On April 6th, 1933, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Association proclaimed a nationwide ‘Action against the Un-German Spirit’, which was to climax in a literary purge or ‘cleansing’ (‘Säuberung’) by fire. The students described the ‘action’ as a response to a worldwide Jewish ‘smear campaign’ against Germany.”
Today the German media are carrying many reports and reflecting on this dark, shameful chapter.

Book burning, calls for executions are back today in climate science
Many of us might think: “Well, this happened 80 years ago, and could never happen today, especially in Europe or America.” Think again. It just happened on a small but poignant manner in sunny, enlightened California, at the University of San Jose Department of Meteorology and Climate Science. Read about it here at WUWT.
Recently a University of Graz professor called for the execution of climate science skeptics. Aren’t the parallels eerie? This ought lead us to pause and reflect deeply for a moment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHolger Thuss, President of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) at Facebook brings up a report appearing at the online FOCUS just last September. In the report the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research (PIK) warned that summers in eastern Germany would suffer from “water shortages”.
That’s what their models had shown.
FOCUS wrote (my emphasis):
Scientists have played out climate scenarios for Germany’s regions until the year 2100. It appears clear: Expensive times are coming especially for Eastern Germany. Heat deaths and water shortages in the summer, existential fear of flooding in the winter.”

Floods grip southern and eastern Germany. Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research models had forecast droughts for summers. Photo credit: Stefan Penninger, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
FOCUS quotes PIK director Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, chief fantasizer-prophet of future climate catastrophes:
Eastern Germany will probably be hit harder with heat waves in the summer and more precipitation in the winter.” Using today’s laws, power plants located near rivers will have to be shut down at times because the cooling water will be too warm.”
FOCUS wrote that in the future:

Because of the significantly reduced precipitation, for example the already much drier Brandenburg region will see its moisture go further in the negative.”
Today large parts of eastern Germany are under water. The PIK’s model projections all fly in the face of reality.
All 10 of the last summers saw normal or above normal precipitation
And we are not talking about just a single year. Meteorologist Dominik Jung wrote a few months ago that the PIK models also fly in the face of summertime statistics for the last 10 years in a row! Every summer in Germany over the last 10 years has seen normal or above normal precipitation!
What does EIKE president Holger Thuss say at Facebook?
Unbelievable but true! German climate scientists (PIK) have predicted, using advanced computer models last year, that the Elbe River would almost dry out in the summertime in the future. Such people spend 20 million euros a year for their ‘science’.”
So throw the failed PIK precipitation models on the scrap heap along with the other 73 epic fail temperature models coming from an array of other “leading” institutes.
Talk about a complete waste of money.
What’s even more amazing is that lots of policymakers were actually stupid enough to believe them, taking them as golden truth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFaster than a speeding bullet! Much smarter than anyone else! Able to stop global warming in a single bound! Quick Robin! To the PIK-cave!
It’s official. Hans-Joachim (John) Schellnhuber is effectively Germany’s latest comic action hero. His mission: to save the planet from the villains causing catastrophic global warming. Hat-tip: www.kaltesonne.de/.
Publishers Jacoby & Stuart, in cooperation with the German Ministry for Education and Research, headed by Dr. Annette Schavan (who is currently being stripped of her doctorate title because of plagiarism) will be releasing a 140-page comic book titled: “The Great Transformation – Environment – This Is How We Take The Curve”.
The book is targeted at children 14 years old and up, and can be pre-ordered at Amazon.de here. Here’s Amazon’s short description:
Top-class science in an easy to understand way! Climate change can not be denied any longer, and if our society is to still function in 50 years, then we have to learn sustainable and living and working. To do this, science, politics, and citizens have to learn to work together. A council of high-ranking scientists advises policymakers on how to do this. And in order for us to be involved, our book presents the scientific core principles in comic form in an easy-to-understand manner. With regards to climate change, species extinctions and shortage of natural resources, the view that we are no longer able to simply continue living as we are is become clear. We have to drastically reduce our consumption of fossil fuels and learn to do business sustainably. How this can be done is shown by nine independent scientists who make up the German government’s German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). In the form of comic interviews with each of them, it is depicted what is fact and what needs to be done. Geoscience, climate science, business and technology, politics and everyday culture must work with each other in order to achieve the essential Great Transformation.”
The book features the nine catastrophe-obsessed Germans sitting on the WBGU, which is calling for the Great Transformation of our society, as the planet saving heroes.
Yes, it seems they’ve gone absolutely bloody mad. Nine hand-wringing German academics are sure and convinced of what the rest of the world needs. And the government is actually stupid (dangerous) enough to believe them.
Excerpts of the book can be seen here in German. For example, on page 14, high-priest Schellnhuber tells readers what’s causing the global warming: agriculture and fossil fuels:

 
Page 15 depicts Schellnhuber standing at the PIK (Einstein’s Tower), where he works, telling us:
Many areas of the environment are already showing crisis developments. Soil and fresh water resources, forests and seas are being overused or destroyed. Biological diversity is dwindling dramatically.”

Page 19 shows Schellnhuber telling us that the temperature must not rise more than 2°C. President Obama is on the phone saying:
I’m really worried that we haven’t made the international progress that is necessary.”
Squandering your first four years didn’t help.
The next frame shows patient earth in bed with a fever. Dr. Schellnhuber says:
As a comparison when your body temperature rises just 2°C, the we are talking about a fever. When the temperature climbs over 40°C (104°F), then the organs fail one after the other, and eventually the entire human body collapses.”

Page 20 depicts Schellnhuber comparing our current course with that of the Titanic, and thus it is absolutely necessary to decarbonize while there’s still a chance.
And so go the book’s 140 pages. It probably would be funny were it not to be read and believed by Germany’s children. It’s a meisterwerk of propaganda, aimed at shaping the the minds of children.
This is not a cynical joke written solely by some fringe scientists – rather it was written in cooperation with the German federal government. The book is totally absent of any balance.
It will be officially presented by the WBGU, which in the book portrays itself as the redeemers of the planet, on March 1st.
I’d have to buy the book to find out more about who the rest of the bad guys are. So far the available excerpts show the fossil fuel industry, their customers and agriculture as the villains.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSun reveals its full climate power: Equator-pole temperature gradient fluctuates in sync with the sun
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning
(Translated with permission by P Gosselin)
The geological factual basis is clear: Fluctuations in solar activity significantly influenced the development of the climate throughout the history of the Earth.
 

Figure 1: Solar activity (red) in sync with the North Pole-equator temperature gradient (blue). Chart from Soon and Legates 2013.
Today’s IPCC is clueless. With its simplistic approach, the IPCC is not able to reproduce the documented climate fluctuations of the past. The gross fundamental errors aren’t of any help at all for the most powerful computers. In the search for additional links in the sun-climate-impact, Willie Soon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and David Legates of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment at the University of Delaware came across an exciting relationship. In a mutual study that appeared in the February 2013 Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, the scientists were able to show a relationship between solar activity fluctuations and the temperature gradient between the North Pole and the equator over a timescale of multiple decades.
This means that the craft of modelling has got lots of homework to do. Up to now the models have not been able to simulate this effect. Now they are forced to check over, sort out, supplement, and improve their formulas. It’s back to the drawing board!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDoubts over climate science are snowballing among the elite media in Europe.
A wave of “climate science skepticism” in the media and other institutions is sweeping across Europe (see below).
The latest to shock the warmists is Switzerland’s leading daily Neue Züricher Zeitung (New Zurich Newspaper – NZZ), which obviously has noticed that things aren’t warming up like they were once projected. In its latest report the NZZ has declared the science as: very much in dispute. H/t: Tomislav Rus at Facebook.
The title of the NZZ’s latest piece: The Missing «Hotspot» In The Sky.
The NZZ writes that according to climate models, the air in the middle troposphere was supposed to warm up strongly, “however measurements show that the temperature has risen much less than previously forecast. More and more scientists are admitting that there is problem. […] gradually the impression that the climate models for the region of the equator have a problem is growing.”
The NZZ looks at the model prognoses of the troposphere, which projected a warming at an altitude of 8 to 12 km. It’s not showing up, it writes, and now scientists are scratching their heads.
The NZZ adds:
On average the CMIP5 models have over-estimated the warming of the troposphere, writes a team led by California scientist Benjamin Santer recently wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in a draft for the first part of the UN IPCC assessment report, which will be published this year, the authors admitted a discrepancy for almost all models.”
It is dawning on the NZZ that the models are just nowhere near properly describing the Earth’s atmosphere and climate development. The Swiss daily is finally realizing that there is perhaps far more to the climate than just trace gas CO2:
In the climate system there are so many feedback mechanisms at work that today no scientist knows what would come out of the corrected models – first one has to know what the correction will look like.”
NZZ sums up the dilemma scientists now face:
To start with, when it comes to the ‘hotspot’, the scientists are dealing with a nut that is still too hard for them to crack.”
The Swiss NZZ is hardly the only flagship daily that has skepticism beginning to pour out of its media pages. What follows are some recent examples of reports that are sending quakes and tremors throughout Europe’s climate institutes, and causing pillars to crack.
Europe’s leading media casting serious doubt:
Spiegel here and here:
Global warming has stalled for 15 years. Experts thus are having doubts on the reliability of their prognoses.”
Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten:
Nothing indicates that climate here is running amok in global warming. […]  The fact is that we can’t see a link between the warming and the increased sea level. The global warming has until now been totally harmless.”
Die Welt here:

Scientists warn of ice age“
Bild here and here,
Russian scientist sees next ice age approaching. Starting in 2014 it will start getting colder and colder. […] it was the fifth winter in a row that has been colder than normal, which is in complete contradiction to the climate prognoses of 13 years ago. Back then winters with snow and ice in Germany were viewed as an obsolete model.”
And the Telegraph in the UK:
Global warming: time to rein back on doom and gloom?”
Moreover, leading European meteorologists have been outing:
Sweden’s renowned Lennart Bengtsson:
…lower tropical troposphere, 20°S –20°N, has only got about a third of the warming compared to what is predicted by present climate models.”
Germany’s Dominik Jung here:
In the year 2000 the climate experts prophesied that winters with ice and snow in Germany would no longer exist. That this claim is false is shown by current facts, and in many regions with just a glance out the window!”
Dr. Karsten Brandt:
…it is also a fact that the horror scenarios produced for Germany are without any scientific merit.”
Warmist scientists have great doubts
Also leading warmist scientists like Hans von Storch and Fritz Vahrenholt have released best-selling books, expressing serious doubts on the computer projected climate catastrophe and aiming sharp criticism at the attempted political coup by the over zealously activist scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
Chasm between models and observations undeniable
So what’s behind the overall movement? Is skepticism just the latest hip trend?  Warming after all, is old and people are just sick of hearing about it – especially when shoveling snow during Easter.
It’s much more than just a trend. The real rocket fuel behind the media skepticism is the widening chasm between model projections and actually observed data. Each year the chasm grows wider, and now has reached such dimensions that even diehard warmist media are not even able to deny it. Time to fold.
Now they are hacking out a back door escape.

Share this...FacebookTwitterObviously the German Weather Service (DWD) just couldn’t be bothered to update the chart it prominently features as part of its website logo. Perhaps it’s because an updated version would completely spoil the desired message of “uninterrupted warming“.

Figure 1: Part of the DWD internet logo totally misleads the public. Source of graphic: DWD
The chart-part of the DWD logo is definitely misleading, and likely controversial legally. Notice how the curve starts to fade already in 2005 (compare to Figure 2 below) and ends in the warm year of 2007, conveniently leaving out the colder years that follow, which would almost totally spoil the impression of warming.
Worse, only the section from about 1975 [correction: 1955] to 2006 is shown – the only section that shows real warming from the entire 120-year long chart. The rest is ignored!
No wonder Harald Martensen was fooled and bought a house at the Baltic Sea, thinking it would become the new Mediterranean.
Apparently the DWD allowed former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to have a peek at the up-to-date chart. Schröder went ahead and purchased a home down south in sunny, warm Turkey, which is supposed to burn up because of global warming.

I happen to have the up-to-date Germany temperature data for the readers.

Germany’s annual mean temperature chart (Use the light blue curve, which is uncorrected for the urban heat island effect). Oh look! Now the temperature is cooling. Source: EIKE/.
I’m not a lawyer, but I think there’s an excellent chance to legally force the DWD to take down this old, very deceptive logo. False advertising. More importantly, the DWD ought to update it in order to maintain accuracy. The institute is supposed to help provide accurate forecasts based on real data, and not false ones based on speculation.
Over the last few years, lots of businesses planned for warm winters, and got burned by cold ones.
Here’s a chart showing the last 15 years, from EIKE/.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNorthern hemisphere winters in the big picture
 by Juraj Vanovcan (Slovakia)
According to the climate models, anthropogenic warming is supposed to predominantly manifest itself by increasing the winter temperatures th the middle latitudes – caused by the increased “greenhouse effect“ or increased amount of long wave infrared radiation LWIR from the sky to the surface. Children won’t know what the snow is, was the meme in 2000s after a string of warm winters in Europe.

Central England temperature vs Arctic oscillation index.
Only a decade later, things changed and cold and snowy winters are now becoming the norm and not the exception over all of Europe. Now the warming is the cause of invasions of cold Arctic air into mid-latitudes, some climatologists insist. They are basically admitting that not LWIR, but prevailing direction of air circulation makes a winter season warmer or colder than average. Of course there is another popular ad-hoc theory plugging the hole. It relates to the loss of summer ice to weather half a year later.
Coming back to air circulation, its direction is dependent on atmospheric highs and lows and the stability of their position. This known phenomenon is characterized by Arctic Oscillation (AO) or North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Negative AO means increased frequency of Arctic air plunging to the mid-latitudes, while a positive AO means milder winters with persistent southwestern flow into Europe.
Looking back at history and combining AO index with the winter temperatures from Central England Temperature record (CET), there is a clear relation between the two. A decade of mild winters during the 1920s is indistinguishable, temperature-wise, from the decades after 1990. Cold winters coincide with periods of negative AO, the last one in early 1980s and again in recent years.
What’s interesting is the trend in AO since 1990, which is clearly negative. Now, let’s compare this observation with Chapter 10.3.5.6. in the last IPCC AR4 report, which says:
…In the recent multi-model analyses, more than half of the models exhibit a positive trend in the NAM (NAO)…
…Although the magnitude of the trends shows a large variation among different models, Miller et al. (2006) find that none of the 14 models exhibits a trend towards a lower NAM index and higher arctic SLP (sea level pressure)…

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




…In another multi-model analysis, Stephenson et al. (2006) show that of the 15 models able to simulate the NAO pressure dipole, 13 predict a positive increase in the NAO index with increasing CO2 concentrations…
…The average of IPCC-AR4 simulations from 13 models suggests the increase of the NAM index becomes statistically significant early in the 21st century (Figure 10.17a, Miller et al., 2006)…”
and finally
In summary, the future changes in the extratropical circulation variability are likely to be characterized by increases in positive phases of both the NAM and the SAM.”
Again, observations are in stark opposition to climate models. Claims, that warming basically causes negative AO period is nowhere to be found in “peer-reviewed” literature from those times when winters were mild and spring came in March as usual.
Be sure, that in case of mild winter, it should be exactly as scientists predicted because in today’s world of climate, everything is exactly “as models predicted”, even if it contradicts itself and none of the models had actually predicted it.
To sum it up:
1) It is obvious that winters, at least in NW Europe, are dominated by AO/NAO.
2) During the the last century, AO cycles bear no relation to CO2 level or “human influence”.
3) Since a 1990 positive AO spike, its trend has been negative, which is in agreement with the increasingly colder observed winters.
4) None of the models predicted negative phase of AO.
5) AGW theory is just riding on the warm period of the NAO (and AMO), which has already ended.
As Albert Einstein once said, a good theory predicts things in advance and a bad theory needs additional adjustments after each new discovery. The problem with the anthropogenic warming theory is: it cannot sustain anything new. For every new and unexpected climate or weather trend a special sub-theory must be developed, and it doesn’t matter if they often completely contradict each other.
“There are 3 roads to ruin yourself: women, gambling and scientists. The most pleasant is with women. The quickest is with gambling. But the surest is following the advice of scientists.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Yesterday I left 2 regular comments at Kemfert’s Facebook site, but they have both since disappeared. Obviously she is not open to other views – we’re so surprised.
Paul Hockenos at the European Energy Review (EER) reports that “energy expert” Dr. Claudia_Kemfert, Director of the Energy, Transportation, and Environment Unit at the prestigious Deutsche Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (German Institute for Economic Research) in Berlin “has had enough of the ‘Energiewende-bashing’ that she feels has stymied the progress of the country’s energy transition and sullied its reputation.”

Dr. Claudia Kemfert of the German Institute for Economic Research frets over exposed ills of “green” energies. Photo source: Facebook/Claudia-Kemfert.
Energiewende is the German term coined for the country’s transition away from nuclear and fossil fuels and over to renewable energies.
Over the last months the gruesome details of the reality of green energies have surfaced. Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, for example, recently informed the public that the transformation over to green energy would cost Germany 1 trillion euros by 2039 (all for a theoretical global warming prevention of a few hundredths of a degree Celsius by the year 2100).

Moreover, renewable energies such as wind and sun have proven to be wildly fluctuating, unreliable sources whose lifetimes are estimated to be only half of what manufacturers had promised.
Kemfert, however, remains obstinate and closed-minded, and doesn’t want to hear any of it. EER writes that she “has set out to explode the myths and lies that are being spread by Energiewende-sceptics“. Kemfert is quoted saying (my emphasis):
When these myths are repeated again and again, they sink in. Not so long ago Germans were extremely concerned about climate change and the dangers of nuclear power. Now they’re scared of the Energiewende.”
As Germany suffers through a record fifth colder-than-normal winter in a row and global mean temperature stalling for 15 years, Germans are having serious doubts about catastrophic warming.
Also 600,000 poor families having their power turned off every year because they can no longer pay skyrocketing electric bills represents a real present danger, and not some year 2100 computer scenario.
Kemfert, unfortunately, appears unaware of these realities, and insists we deny them and simply have faith that wind and sun are the way to go.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo. 1, multi-million circulation national daily Bild here has an unflattering piece about Al Gore and his newly found mega-riches titled: “Al Gore earned 75 million euros – in one month!”
So profitable can the global warming scam be! Never mind that there hasn’t been a bit of warming in 15 years.
The Bild piece starts with:
Rich, richer, Gore! The former vice president of the USA, Albert ‘Al’ Gore, alone in January earned 75 million euros. Now he has an estimated wealth of 153 million euros (200 million dollars)!
[…] That’s an increase in wealth of 11,000%!”
Much of this comes from spreading fear over global warming (which, again, hasn’t happened in 15 years). The more fear that Gore spreads, the more his investments in green energy and “climate-protection” technologies and activities pay off.
Bild also informs readers that Gore earned huge amounts from sales of shares of Apple and “Current Network TV“.
This was sold in January for 382 million euros to ‘Al-Jazeera,’ a TV network in Qatar. An estimated 70 million euros found their way into Gore’s bank account. The politician is a stakeholder in various companies and investment funds. Among other things, he’s a co-founder of ‘Generation Investment Management’, which made a profit from 2008 to 2010 of 166 million euros.”
Not too shabby.

Gee, suddenly where are all the anti-capitalist, anti-speculation greens? Bild also tells its readers of another source of income:
Because of his popularity, Gore receives a fee from industry associations, symposiums, and other events of up to 130,000 euros – per speech!”
So what on Earth could Gore be possibly doing with all that climate-cash? Bild tells us:
With his millions, Gore bought a 20-room mansion in Nashville/Tennessee and a luxury beach house in Montecito, California. So nice losing can be: Had Al Gore won the US presidential election election in 2000 against George W. Bush, he would have earned ‘only’ 306,000 euros per year.”
Most Germans have a strong aversion to wealth of this sort. An unflattering piece for Al Gore. Bad publicity to say the least.
Hat-tip: Meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne, by e-mail.
PS: Another reader wrote: “Yeah, this is how someone can get filthy rich with supposed climate-protection. No wonder so many so-called environmental scientists and countless institutes want to imitate him.”
Things are beginning to come around for Al Gore and his scam.

Revkin actually published the content of that e-mail at the the New York Times Dot Earth site here (scroll down to comments).
Here’s the comment left by Revkin, quoting Annan’s e-mail (emphasis added):
The climate scientist James Annan sent these thoughts by email:
‘Well, the press release is a bit strange, because it sounds like it is talking about the Aldrin et al paper which was published some time ago, to no great fanfare. I don’t know if they have a further update to that.
Anyway, there have now been several recent papers showing much the same – numerous factors including: the increase in positive forcing (CO2 and the recent work on black carbon), decrease in estimated negative forcing (aerosols), combined with the stubborn refusal of the planet to warm as had been predicted over the last decade, all makes a high climate sensitivity increasingly untenable. A value (slightly) under 2 is certainly looking a whole lot more plausible than anything above 4.5.’

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie kalte Sonne website here has just posted the video presentation of Murry Salby in Hamburg in April. If anyone ever demolished the dubious CO2 AGW science, it’s Salby!

Most of the presentation is very mathematical and technical. But the last 10 minutes sums everything up very nicely for the laypersons.
Die kalte Sonne writes:
Prof. Murry Salby, climate scientist at Macquarie University of Sydney, made a presentation in Hamburg on April 18th as part of a European tour. Prof. Salby is author of the textbook Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate (Cambridge University Press) and Fundamentals of Atmospheric Physics (Academic Press) and is renowned worldwide as an astrophysicist. He recently caused excitement with new findings on the relationship of the 12C- and 13C isotopes and the development of CO2-concentration. From the findings he concluded that the anthropogenic emissions only had a slight impact on the global CO2-concentrations. They are are mainly a consequence of temperature changes. This relationship is known up to now only from the warming phases after the last ice ages. Prof. Salby extends this relationship to our current climate development.
The video recording of the presentation, which was organised by the host Helmut Schmidt University, is now available at Youtube (above).”
Near the end (1:02:50) Salby on CO2 and temperature:
Their divergence over the last decade and a half is now unequivocal. In the models global temperature tracks CO2 almost perfectly. In the real world it clearly doesn’t.” 
Salby then presents two charts for comparison, which I’ve arranged side-by-side: the model world vs real world:

Model world (left) vs real world (right). Graphics from Murry Salby presentation.
1:04:05 mark he sums it up neatly:
CO2 then evolves not like temperature, as it does in the model, but like the integral of temperature. In dotted blue is the integral of observed temperature. It closely tracks observed CO2 – even after the 1990s when the observed record of CO2 and temperature clearly diverged. If CO2 tracks the integral of temperature, which it clearly does, it cannot track temperature, which it clearly doesn’t.
In the model, CO2 and temperature are related directly. In the real world they are also related, but differently. The distinctly different relationship between CO2 and global temperature represents a fundamental difference in the global energy balance between its evolution in the model world and the real world. If the global energy balance is wrong, everything else is window dressing.”
The points of Salby’s presentation lead to the following implications:
– In the Real World global temperature is not controlled exclusively by CO2, as it is in the Model World.
– In significant part, however, CO2 is controlled by Global Temperature, as it is in the Proxy Record.”
At the end of the presentation, Salby implies, quoting Richard Feynman, that CO2 science today can be described as “Cult Science”.
He sums up quoting Feynman: “If it differs from observations, then it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Carbon Cycle, Nature or Nurture – Part 2
By Ed Caryl
In the last post, The Carbon Cycle, Nature or Nurture, sea surface temperatures were shown to have a large influence on CO2 rise in the atmosphere. This influence is so large, that changes in fossil fuel burning cannot be seen. In this article, the sea surface temperature influence will be subtracted to examine what remains in a continued search for man’s impact.
To begin that search, the first step is to annualize the sea surface temperature and the change in CO2. This results in Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows the annualized data for sea surface temperature and CO2 change.
 
Figure 2 is a scatter diagram of annualized SST anomaly versus CO2 change. Note the R2 value near 0.69.
1960 is near the beginning of the modern rise in CO2 that concerns everyone. It is assumed for this exercise that the sea surface temperature before the CO2 rise began was 0.1°C below the temperature anomaly baseline, and that the SST trend of 0.0105°C equals the CO2 trend of 0.0542 Gigatons per year. With those values assumed, the SST influence can be subtracted, resulting in Figure 3.

Figure 3 is the change in CO2 with SST influence subtracted.
The features on the blue trace are dominated by volcanic activity. From left to right, the negative, cooling peaks are due to Mt. Agung in 1962 to 1964, Fuego in 1971 and 1975, Mt. St. Helens in 1980, El Chichon in 1982 to 1984, Mt Pinatubo in 1991 to 1993, and a cluster of volcanoes in 2000 to 2002, dominated by Soufriere Hills and Nyamiragira. All these were large stratospheric sulphur dioxide sources. Mt Pinatubo was the largest, injecting 20 Megatons of SO2 into the atmosphere.
Oh yes, I nearly forgot. What about man’s influence?

Figure 4: Man’s influence on CO2 in the atmosphere after subtracting SST. R2 = 0.019.
That near zero R2 illustrates that man’s changing carbon emissions do not appear in the overall CO2 data, especially after removing SST influence. Man’s contribution is totally absorbed in the biosphere in real-time. There is no anthropogenic signature. Any carbon emission change is invisible in SST driven change and the continuous noise provided by volcanoes. There is no persistence, no CO2 lifetime beyond the present year. Man does not add to the load. All the “green” efforts are silly, misguided, but hideously expensive exercises in futility. Nature is producing all the CO2, and when the sun stops driving sea surface temperatures, CO2 will fall again.
“The true beauty of nature is her amplitude; she exists neither for nor because of us, and possesses a staying power that all our nuclear arsenals cannot threaten (much as we can easily destroy our puny selves).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday Germany’s No. 1 daily (circulation over 3.5 million), Bild online, carried the shock headline story: “Russian scientist sees next ice age approaching. Starting in 2014 it will start getting colder and colder +++ migration of people cannot be excluded“.

Renowned Russian scientist Chabibullo Abdussamatov warns of a harsher global climate beginning in 2014 and extending for decades. Photo credit: NOAA public domain photo.
Other media outlets are reporting as well, see here, here, and here.
Stories in Germany about global cooling, hard winters, and ice ages have been popping up faster than dandelions in May lately. Global warming is beginning to look historical.
Bild starts by reporting that finally the snow and ice gripping Russia since October are beginning to thaw. “That’s why most Russians shake their heads skeptically when the topic of global warming pops up,“ Bild writes. 
While some scientists say the cold is due to global warming, “one scientist at the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg sees it completely differently: He sees the next ice age approaching soon!”
Astrophysicist Chabibullo Abdussamatov claims that the sun will radiate significantly less warmth in the coming years. “Consequently a ‘little ice age’ lies ahead.”

Bild adds that Abdussamatov says the Earth has had a negative energy budget since 1990, but that the oceans have been able to compensate with its stored energy. But the Russian scientist now says that’s over. Bild writes:
Beginning around 2014 the average annual temperature will begin to drop, and by 2050 it will be about 1.5°C cooler than today when the low point is reached. Also the water temperature in the world’s oceans will fall about 1°C.”
Personally, I think Abdussamatov is being too pessimistic. He says solar activity will be responsible for the decline, and says the 1.5°C temperature drop will be enough for Greenland to reglaciate. Other effects will be “a return to real hard Russian winters“, and cooler summers. Moreover he says the cooling will really start getting underway in 2015.
Abdussamatov is not the only scientist who is seriously skeptical of global warming. Bild writes that Andrei Fursov, Director of the Center for Russian Science at the Moscow University of Intellectual Sciences warns about the apocalyptic scenarios floating around. “The feared global warming left the worry of the ozone hole in the shadows. In the meantime, the ozone hole has since closed up by itself.”
Fursov says in an interview:
The ice at the poles is really melting, but that does necessarily have anything to do with greenhouse gases.”
Interesting that Abdussamatov sees a negative energy balance since 1990. An interesting view from Russia that needs to be looked at.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight…and starvation leads to obesity.
The alarmists at the German Potsdam Climate Institute now claim global warming leads to colder and snowier winters, which lead to accelerated ice melt in Antarctica. In their latest blog article, Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt say this is like claiming eating more makes you lose weight.
===================================================
New PIK logic from Potsdam: Heavier snowfalls causing glacier shrinkage (and when you eat more, you lose weight
Ricarda Winkelmann is standing on the ice, blond hair in the wind, the German Polarstern ice-breaking research vessel is clearly visible in the background. She’s beaming because she has finally arrived on the 7th continent, which holds a multitude of secrets. Her red parka keeps her warm and protects her. Luckily there are no polar bears here, and so there is no danger to the penguins.
That’s how one could interpret the attractive photo that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) included with its press release of 12 December 2012. The title: More ice loss through snowfall on Antarctica.  This is how the fight against climate change gets a nice look, and is fresh wind for the PIK climate machinery.
Let’s look more closely at the title: “More ice loss through snowfall on Antarctica“. Now the ice in Antarctica is suppsedly melting faster than ever. The blame for this is heavier snowfall? How intersting. But that just doesn’t seem very logical. Didn’t we learn at school that glaciers grow when it snows more? And when it snows less, then they shrink. Now suddenly this is supposed to no longer apply? Very peculiar. That’s like saying global warming leads to colder winters.
Let’s look at the PIK press release:
Stronger snowfall increases future ice discharge from Antarctica. Global warming leads to more precipitation as warmer air holds more moisture – hence earlier research suggested the Antarctic ice sheet might grow under climate change. Now a study published in Nature shows that a lot of the ice gain due to increased snowfall is countered by an acceleration of ice-flow to the ocean. […] Between 30 and 65 percent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall in Antarctica is countervailed by enhanced ice loss along the coastline,” says lead-author Ricarda Winkelmann.”
There’s a lot in the lines above. These mysterious claims are repeated elsewhere in other words, which we now examine.
First they explain why it is going to snow more in Antarctica in the future, namely because the air will become more humid because of the warming. That sounds plausible enough. And then a rather unusual claim pops up: Are the previous studies showing that growth of the Antarctic ice sheet suddenly wrong? This is what their unfortunate formulation suggests.
The last sentence of that part, however, finally brings clarification: “30 and 65 percent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall in Antarctica is countervailed by enhanced ice loss along the coastline”. Conversely, that means that 70 to 35% remains and thus causes the Antarctic ice sheet to grow. And this Antarctic sheet growth directly contradicts what the title of the study suggests: “more ice loss”.

Here we get the impression that this was poorly formulated on purpose in order to mislead the reader. This is deceptive to the highest degree. A correct title could have been, for example: “Antarctic ice sheet will continue to grow, but more slowly than previously expected.” Why wasn’t the title formulated clearly? Is the latest literature on the subject still not available in Potsdam? New ice measurements show that the Antarctic ice sheet is indeed growing (See our blog article “New ICEsat-Satellite data are in: Antarctic ice sheet has grown in mass“). Instead we read the following statement in the PIK press release, which completely misleads the layperson:
During the last decade, the Antarctic ice-sheet has lost volume at a rate comparable to that of Greenland.”
That has got to be a joke because it’s wrong from front to back.
In a recent study, Dutch scientists investigated the Antarctic ice sheet for the period 1979 – 2010. Here the entire value was examined for Western and Eastern Antarctica. The scientists were not able to find any significant trend. Ice mass as a whole hardly changed. The scientists led by Jan Lenaerts of the University of Utrecht published their results in the Geophysical Research Letters in February 2012. In Januar 2012 the Dutch team had already published a paper on melt in Antarctica for the period 1979-2010 in the Geophysical Research Letters. Here as well no trend was found.
So what could have possibly led to this deficient press release? What’s behind the poor formulation, omissions, and erroneous information?
Was it the irresistable urge to spread more fear about the climate danger? Could the fact that the study’s co-author Anders Levermannn is also a lead author on the sea level chapter in the next IPCC report also have something to do with it? Could it be that the study is a part of Ricarda Winkelmann’s doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Stefan Rahmstorf?
And let’s look to see if the German media bothered to take a close look at the press release. The Handelsblatt certainly did not (“Heavier snowfalls can lead to greater ice loss in Antarctica”). German prestige weekly Der Spiegel also chose a misleading title: (“Snowfall increases ice melt”).
And Die Welt was quite enraptured by the computer simulations that looked all the way to the year 2500. Unfortunately, however, the very same models could not even predict the global warming stop of the last 15 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAsthma – The New Climate Change Danger – Or is it?
By Ed Caryl
In the new state-by-state report from the White House, a new scourge caused by climate change has reared it’s ugly head. Asthma! (Gasp…choke…wheeze!).
In nearly every state, asthma seems to be the big concern, with hospital admissions and costs described in detail. No other disease is mentioned. Is Asthma the only disease that climate change is responsible for? Evidently. And Obama & Co. think it is really important we combat it.
Asthma has been around for as long as man has been around. The name is from the ancient Greeks. It is mentioned in Egyptian hieroglyphs, so it is clear that asthma cannot be solely caused by climate change. The implication is that warming has somehow made it worse.
Asthma is a disease caused by allergies. The allergens can be nearly anything in the environment. Outdoors, pollen is a famously common allergen in certain seasons. Indoors, the usual allergens are organic dusts of all kinds: Dust mites and their excreta, pet dander, mold, building materials that out-gas solvents, other chemicals, and gases, like sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, formaldehyde, and in one citation, carbon dioxide. That CO2 could be an allergen seems very strange, as CO2 is present at about 4% concentration in every exhaled breath. If CO2 were an allergen, an asthmatic would not survive breathing. So simply raising the inhaled CO2 concentration from 300 to 400 parts per million in the air shouldn’t be a problem.
The answer is, of course, that the CO2 rise due to the normal rise in temperature as we warm from the Little Ice Age, has increased plant life, increasing pollen counts outdoors. Indoors, we now insulate all houses, and seal them against cold  in the winter and heat in the summer, this traps the indoor pollutants mentioned above. At least that is one theory.
But, why tie asthma to climate? First, it is very prevalent. Some 8% of Americans suffer from asthma. Everyone either has it or knows someone that has it. But does asthma rise to the top of everyone’s daily concerns? Probably not. Less than 0.1% of asthma sufferers die from it. According to the Center for Disease Control, of the 2,468,435 people that died in 2010, 3,404 died from asthma. That is 1.1 deaths per 100,000 people. When all the things you can die of are rank ordered, asthma is number 89, right below cancer of the larynx and above gall bladder disease. Breathing problems are only 4% of emergency room visits for both adults and children.
But let’s look at who gets asthma, and another possible reason for the increase. This is a chart of asthma prevalence and poverty level. (Source here.)

Figure 1 is a part of a chart found here that describes who gets asthma. The top bar represents the prevalence of asthma in those poor at or below the poverty level, about 11%. The middle bar is the prevalence of asthma in those at or twice the poverty level, about 8.6%, and the bottom bar is the well-to-do that are above twice the poverty level, a bit over 7%.

So, asthma seems to be an affliction of the poor. Why is it increasing? Is it temperature change? Here are charts of U. S. temperature anomaly versus asthma prevalence.

Figure 2a, Asthma prevalence and U. S. temperature anomaly in °F, and 2b, the corresponding scatter diagram with the R-squared value.
There doesn’t seem to be any relationship with climate. Perhaps the problem is in simply being poor. Here are the charts of food-stamp participation (SNAP) and asthma.

Figure 3a, Asthma prevalence and SNAP participation, and 3b, the corresponding scatter diagram with the R-squared value.
It appears to this author that asthma is an economic problem, not a climate problem, and I thank the current government for drawing this to our attention. Poor people can’t afford to properly maintain their homes, so dust, mold, animal dander and other indoor pollutants build up and cause allergies, increasing asthma. Raising the cost of energy is not going to improve the situation, it can only make it worse.
This is just one more example of over-hyped rhetoric used in the climate change debate and how wrong-headed it can be. It is another attempt to invoke a monster under the bed. This time it turned out to be the wrong monster. I wonder what it will be next week.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA major Swedish online daily has an article about what one of Sweden’s leading climate scientists, Lennart Bengtsson, has to say about the global warming hysteria.
Blogsite Dave’s Musings here has excerpts in English. Here are a few:
We Are Creating Great Anxiety Without It Being Justified…there are no indications that the warming is so severe that we need to panic.
‘The warming we have had the last a 100 years is so small that if we didn’t have had meteorologists and climatologists to measure it we wouldn’t have noticed it at all.’
The Earth appears to have cooling properties that exceeds the previous thought ones, and that computer models are inadequate to try to foretell a chaotic object like the climate, where actual observations is the only way to go.”
More and more we are seeing the alarmists being increasingly marginalized. As the data pours in, their science is looking more and more preposterous.

This is the first time ever that a real climate scientist is interviewed in a major Swedish newspaper (or TV/radio). In the past they have only interviewed alarmist with little or no scientific climate background. This is really astonishing from a Swedish perspective!

Unfortunately I can’t attend. But if anyone else does, your report on the event may be published here at NoTricksZone.
Admission is free. Here is the announcement in English:
Relationship between greenhouse gases and global temperature!
Interpretations of climate revolve about changes of atmospheric composition, which involve an increase of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide and methane are each emitted by human activities, as well as a host of native processes. Their relationship to global temperature is central to understanding current climate and how it will evolve.
Atmospheric composition and temperature are found to obey a clear two-pronged relationship in the proxy record from ice cores, which represents ancient changes that operate on time scales longer than several thousand years. A similar relationship is found to be obeyed in the observed record of actual atmospheric measurements, which represents modern changes that operate on time scales shorter than a century. Supporting analysis shows that the two relationships are connected. It reveals a common physical mechanism behind changes of composition in the two records. The physics common to the records provides unified insight into recorded changes of greenhouse gases, those apparent in the proxy record of ancient composition as well as those actually observed during the 20th century. The governing relationship is then compared against the relationship that prevails in climate models, in their simulation of future changes.”

So says German Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, who is one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement, and agreed to an interview with NoTricksZone. He is one of the co-authors of the German skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne”, which took Germany by storm last year and is now available at bookstores worldwide in English under the title: The Neglected Sun.
In Germany Prof. Vahrenholt has had to endure a lot heat from the media, activists, and climate scientists for having expressed a different view. But as global temperatures remain stagnant and CO2 climate sensitivity is being scaled back, he feels vindicated. Here’s the interview:
=======================
IPCC Science Finds Itself In A Serious Jam, There Is Not Going To be A Climate Catastrophe
NTZ: You were once a believer in the man-made CO2 climate disaster. What changed your mind? 
FV: I was Environmental Senator of Hamburg until 1998 and had had absolutely no doubts about the AGW hypothesis because global temperatures indeed had been running parallel with CO2 emissions. My first doubts over the IPCC’s science arose after the dramatic errors of the 2007 4th Assessment Report came to light. On German public television PIK Director Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber said the Himalayan glaciers would melt away by the year 2035. Then as a CEO of Shell Repower Systems, and later RWE Innogy, where I was responsible for the development of renewable energies and discovered that natural factors were impacting our climate. We saw that the wind strength in Northwest Europe had been in decline year after year. Yet, climate scientists had told us just the opposite was supposed to occur, i.e. that wind strength would increase. So I looked at the literature in detail and was able to find there was a relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation, whose 60-year cycle had entered a weak phase. I wrote articles about this in leading German dailies, and I was immediately branded as a “climate denier” by Stefan Rahmstorf. His reaction led me to look even deeper into the literature. In the end it was Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf who turned me into a skeptic.
NTZ: Your climate science critical book Die kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun) was released early last year in Germany. It remained on the Spiegel bestseller list for 3 weeks. Has it changed the discussion in Germany? Were you surprised by the public’s reaction?
FV: The leftist, liberal media labeled me an “eco-reactionary” who represented obsolete positions. That was to be expected. What truly surprised me the most was the harsh reaction from German climate scientists who were not even willing to discuss the topics addressed in the book. And the longer our book remained on the bestseller list, and the longer the warming stop became, the more our adversaries’ tactics ran aground. First they ignored us and then they tried to isolate us through personal defamation. Die kalte Sonne became the symbol of resistance against a politically indoctrinated science which denied natural processes and spread fear in order to promote a particular energy policy – one that threatened the prosperity and growth of the German industrial base. So to me it was a sort of an accolade when former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt invited me to a personal audience to find out more about Die kalte Sonne. Now I’m permitted to quote him: “Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s assertions are plausible“. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson invited me to London and encouraged me to publish the book in English. Now it is appearing this week as “The Neglected Sun“. It’s the Die kalte Sonne in English, and it’s been updated. 

NTZ: CO2 is supposed to be trapping heat in the atmosphere, yet global atmospheric temperatures haven’t risen in 200 months (over 16 years). Where has all the “trapped heat” gone? Some leading scientists are frustrated that they cannot find it. What do you think is happening?
FV: It’s now obvious that the IPCC models are not correctly reflecting the development of atmospheric temperatures. What‘s false? Reality or the models? The hackneyed explanation of a deep sea warming below 700 meters hasn’t been substantiated up to now. How does atmospheric warming from a climate gas jump 700 meters deep into the ocean? If you consider the uncertainties in the Earth’s radiation budget measurements at the top of the atmosphere, and those of the temperature changes at water depths below 700 meters, where we are talking about changes of a few hundredths of a degree Celsius over many years, such a “missing heat” cannot be ascertained today. The likelihood is that there is no “missing heat”. Slight changes in cloud cover could easily account for a similar effect. That would mean the end of the alarmist CO2 theory. Perhaps this is why we’ve been hearing speculation about the deep ocean.  On the other hand, perhaps this discussion tells us that the alarmist faction needs to deal more with oceanic cycles. It is possible that this is a step in recognizing the central impacts of the PDO and AMO on our climate.
NTZ: Hans von Storch confirms that 98% of the climate models have been wrong so far. Do you think the directors of world’s leading climate research institutes risk damaging the once sterling reputations of their institutes if they do not soon admit there’s a problem with climate science?
FV: They certainly find themselves in a serious jam. That‘s why they are now trying to gain time by claiming that the models first become falsified if there has been no warming over a period of 30 years – never mind that the warming of 1977 to 1998 was only 22 years and deemed to be long enough to “prove“ the CO2 theory. A few years ago climate scientist Ben Santer said only 17 years were necessary before we could talk about a real climate trend. Now that reality is pulling the rug from under models, some scientists are having misgivings. Some are praying for an El Nino year, which would allow them to beat the drums of fear again. They’ll hype up every single weather effect to get attention.
NTZ: Some prominent climate experts have been expressing second thoughts about the seriousness of man-made climate change, e.g. Hans von Storch, Lennart Bengtsson. Do you expect more scientists to follow as more data come in?

FV: Certainly. That’s what’s so fascinating about science. It proposes theories. And when they don’t fit reality, they get changed. The chaff gets separated from the wheat.
NTZ: Spiegel for example has been publishing some articles critical of alarmist climate science. Do you expect the rest of Germany’s media to soon follow and to start taking a more critical look?
FV: This process is fully under way. But it’s going to take a long time because an entire generation has been convinced that CO2 is a climate killer. But the shrill tones have been quieting down.
NTZ: What danger does Germany face should it continue down its current path of climate alarmism and rush into renewable energies? 
FV: Twenty billion euros are being paid out by consumers for renewable energies in Germany each and every year. Currently that amounts to 250 euros per household each year and it will increase to 300 euros next year.
Worse, it’s a gigantic redistribution from the bottom to top, from the poor who cannot afford a solar system to rich property owners who own buildings with large roof areas. The German Minister of Environment fears a burden of 1000 billion euros by 2040.
It is truly outrageous that 1) 40% of the world’s photovoltaic capacity is installed in Germany, a country that sees as much sunshine as Alaska, 2) we are converting wheat into biofuel instead of feeding it to the hungry, and 3) we are covering 20% of our agricultural land with corn for biogas plants and thus adversely impacting wildlife. We are even destroying forests and nature in order to make way for industrial wind parks.
On windy days we have so much power that wind parks are asked to shut down, yet they get paid for the power they don’t even deliver. And when the wind really blows, we “sell” surplus power to neighboring countries at negative prices. And when the wind stops blowing and when there is no sun, we have to get our power from foreign countries. In the end we pay with the loss of high-paying industrial jobs because the high price of power is making us uncompetitive.
The agitators in climate science here in Germany have done us no favors. Renewable energies do have a big future, but not like this. It’s been a run-away train and it’s too expensive. We are putting Germany’s industry in jeopardy. In reality there really isn’t any urgency because the solar cycles and nature are giving us time to make the transition over to renewable energies in a sensible way.
NTZ: Has the weather become more extreme? Why are we getting bombarded by scary reports from the media – even after a normal thunderstorm with hail?
FV: Extreme weather is the only card they have left to play. We see that Arctic sea ice extent is the highest since 2007. At the South Pole sea ice is at the highest extent in a very long time, hurricanes have not become more frequent, the same is true with tornadoes, sea level is rising at 2-3 mm per year and there’s been no change in the rate, and global temperature has been stagnant for 15 years. Indeed we are exposed to bad weather. And when one is presented with a simplistic explanation, i.e. it’s man’s fault, it gladly gets accepted. CO2 does have a warming effect on the planet. However, this effect has been greatly exaggerated. The climate impact of CO2 is less than the half of what the climate alarmists claim. That’s why in our book, The Neglected Sun, we are saying there is not going to be any climate catastrophe.
NTZ: What do you expect from the soon-to-be-released IPCC 5th Assessment Report?
FV: It is truly remarkable that some countries are urging IPCC 5AR authors to address the reasons for the temperature hiatus in the summary for policymakers. Dissatisfaction with the IPCC’s tunnel vision is growing. But let’s not kid ourselves: In the coming days and weeks the media are not going to be able to refrain from the IPCC catastrophe-hype. However, what will be different from the previous four reports is that the hype will die off much more quickly. Those who ignore nature and its fluctuations will end up on the sidelines soon enough. I think this is going to be the last report of this kind.

Having seen the film in its entirety for the first time, I was truly horrified by the scale of the environmental destruction and mayhem brought on by the recent climate protection movement. It is truly madness at a whole new level and dimension. If you have the chance to see the documentary, then do so. You’ll be shaking your head throughout the film.
Indeed the level of destruction with respect to loss of eco-systems, biodiversity, erosion, etc. brought on by the “green economy” is far beyond anything man-made climate change was ever fantasized of causing by the year 2100. The current damage caused by the “green economy” is real, and it’s happening here and right now. Worse, it’s all taking place with the official green stamp of approval.
In the film, environmental economist Nico Paech says:
Climate protection as it is practiced now is throwing the baby out with the bath water.”
The green economy, intended to rescue the climate from a man-made climate catastrophe in a computer, is in reality systematically accelerating the wide-scale destruction of the environment today by at least a factor of ten.
Many greens are having their eyes opened for the first time, and are now grudgingly admitting that something has gone terribly awry. Wiping out the Earth’s eco-system to rescue the climate is not what they had in mind.
Yet they still refuse to acknowledge that they’ve erred with the climate science, and that all the destruction was unnecessary. They still insist the computerized catastrophe is real, approaching fast, and that we need to act rapidly. The only thing they’re admitting is that the “green energy” sources of hydro-power and biofuel are no longer options. In their view the human race is now in a dilemma because so many sources of energy must never be used. There’s no painless way out.
After showing the Climate Crimes documentary, ORF held a discussion round discussion round. The theme of the discussion round was what needs to be done to get out of the (imagined) energy dilemma?
Four experts joined moderator Michael Hofer were Kurt Remele (ethics and theology expert), Angela Köppl (economics expert in the field of environmental economics, energy and climate protection and Angela Kallhoff (philosophy). The other was co-author of Die kalte Sonne, geologist Sebastian Lüning. Clearly the discussion was not to focus on climate science. For moderator Hofer and the 3 other guests, the science is settled in their view, and there was no need to discuss it. Thus the discussion focused on environmental ethics and man’s responsibilities.

Most of the discussion round was filled with the usual “the end is near” crap. The three greenie guests kept reminding the audience of our generational, environmental and social responsibilities. They told us of the “massive impacts” humans were having, and about all the “dramatic destruction” humans were causing.
We were reminded it would be necessary to get along with much less, to save energy, and to scale back productivity and consumption. Kallhoff, for example, said the human species was “crowding out nature” and that we were “too individualistic and selfish”.
Moreover, the three green guests reminded the audience that climate change is real. Köppl insisted that climate change is settled science and that there was “a tendency to more extreme weather”. She added that “humans would have to scale back” and “that it would not be possible to rely solely on technology”.
Remele poked fun at Arnold Schwarzenegger, who a week earlier had flown in to Austria on his private jet and pontificated about the importance of living green.
Hofer even asked the guests if perhaps our Judeo-Christian religion was perhaps responsible for the earth’s environmental and climatic ills today, citing that the Book of Genesis, which tells us: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
Near the end of the discussion round, moderator Hofer asked each guest to tell us what has to be done to get out of the environmental dilemma. The three greenies were more or less unanimous, telling the audience that we will have to change our behaviour, get away from the model of growth, expand public transportation, consume less, and to even eat less meat.
Lüning, the only guest with a different opinion, said that it was necessary to get back to science and real environmental protection. In Lüning’s view, the discussion had been taken over by extreme elements on both sides, and that it had to get back to the center. He also encouraged more critical thinking, and that we not immediately believe someone just because they have a doctor title.
Earlier in the discussion round, Lüning commented that there was too much fear-mongering by a number of opportunistic parties, for example re-insurers. Lüning said that the huge environmental backfire we’ve seen in the green movement so far should say something about the science.
Lüning also reminded the other guests and Hofer that climate science is not settled, and cited a recent study showing soot was a far greater factor in climate than previously thought.
He also pointed out that much more could be done locally and regionally with far less money, and with a far greater impact, than to try to solve the globe’s problems by tweaking a single trace gas.
Lüning said: “There are lots of high impact things that can be done for relatively little money.”

Now we have another study by Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt showing yet again how the sun drives climate [Quoted passage translated from the German]:
==============================================
China’s Summer Rains Fluctuated During The 20th Century In Sync With The Solar 11-Year Cycles
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
Numerous studies in the past have shown that solar fluctuations on decadal, century, and millennial scales have had a significant impact on climate development. In December 2012 another impressive study appeared on the subject in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Jing-Song Wang and Liang Zhao from the National Satellite Meteorological Center and the National Climate Center in Peking respectively studied the impact of the 11-year solar activity cycle on June precipitation of various regions in China during the 20th century. Here they checked the relationships using six statistical methods. In the summary of their paper both scientists wrote:
The Huaihe River basin (HRB) of central China is located at the marginal region of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). For this region we were able to show there is a reliable positive-correlation relationship between the 11 year sunspot cycle and June precipitation. In the south of the middle–lower Yangtze River region we found a possible negative correlation, and a very weak positive correlation in the HeTao Basin (HTB). The latter region is located in the central region of the monsoons in the westwind zone. We investigated the reasons for these regional differences and are able to show that the marginal region of EASM is more sensitive to solar forcing than its central interior. This explains the strong correlation in the region of the Huaihe River Basin. In years with many sunspots, the impact of the East Asian Monsoon expands and extends further north than in years with fewer sunspots. During years with few sunspots, westerlies dominate.”
The study clearly shows, yet again, that fluctuations in solar activity do not have the same impact in all regions. In some regions the solar impact on climate is stronger, and weaker in others – depending on local conditions. Also in different regions counter-acting developments arise. This becomes clear when for example a line of rain shifts, causing one region to be drier and another wetter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately we’ve been seeing and hearing lots media reports of cooling and cold weather extremes. Global temperature data, such as HadCrut 4, show warming has disappeared altogether.

Global temperatures have fallen over the last 8 years. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/.
Looking at the data for the last decade or so, one thing stands clear: Global temperatures have been showing many more signs of cooling than warming. Already we are sensing that global temperature has lost the battle to stay up. The HadCrut data series above shows that cooling has gained the upper hand. Indeed warming is now in the history books, having died some 15 years ago.
Forget the missing heat – the real story is the present cooling.
And a number of media outlets have kept up with this inconvenient development. Numerous reports have appeared lately, and they ought to serve as a wake-up call to policymakers who have long been heavily intoxicated with the fantasy of a run-away warming planet.
There is a growing number of undeniable signs showing the planet is cooling:
– The Arctic has seen a 60% gain in sea ice, the highest late summertime level since 2006. In fact, there hasn’t been any warming in the Arctic in 8 years. The North Pole region has long been touted as the canary in the coal mine. Nowhere were temperatures supposed to rise faster than in the Artic. The fact that the Arctic is now cooling should be telling us something.
– At the other end of the earth, Antarctic sea ice has been above normal for more than 700 consecutive days and this year it has been setting dozens of record highs for sea ice extent. With about another week left before the season peaks, the South Pole is poised to set an all time record high since satellite measurements began.

– Central Europe has seen 5 consecutive colder-than-normal winters – a record. Worse, early forecasts for the 2013/14 winter show we may be looking at a spectacular 6 colder-than-normal winters in a row.
– The online UK Express reports here that the globe is cooling, and so does the UK flagship newspaper Daily Mail in a detailed piece well worth reading.
– The UK Telegraph also recently reported on a cooling planet, quoting climate scientist Professor Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin: “We are already in a cooling trend, which I think will continue for the next 15 years at least. There is no doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped.”
– Finally, reader Ed Hoskins has been charting CET temperature data from the UK Met Office: “The overall annual temperature shows a diminution of pretty much a full degree Celsius over the last 13 years.” Here’s the chart:

CET temperatures have been plummeting over the last 13 years (fall 2013 data not included). Chart by Ed Hoskins, data source: UK Met Office.
It turns out the alarmists are correct: Global warming can no longer be denied. That’s because there is none left to deny!

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s now halftime for the 2013 hurricane season (June 1 – November 30) and German meteorological site wetternet.de writes that “Hurricanes are less than expected“.

Hurricane Irene, 2011. Photo by NASA
Using the mean of the 1981 – 2010 period, normally three or four tropical storms form in the Atlantic in August, with one or two growing into hurricanes.
But this year there have been only 2 tropical storms, and none of them made it to hurricane level. Meteorologist Christa Stipp at wetternet.de (meteorologist Dominik Jung’s site) sums it up: “Indeed there has not been a single hurricane so far this season and only six tropical storms.”
Stipp adds that the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for the Atlantic this August was “70 percent below the mean“.
The recent low cyclone activity contradicts climate models that had projected global warming would increase cyclone activity. This year this is not only the case in the Atlantic, but is also happening globally. In August there have been only 4 tropical storms in the Eastern Pacific, and only one managed to become a hurricane (Category 2). Overall ACE in The Eastern Pacific is 40% below the mean.
But wetternet.de warns that there is no guarantee that a weak first half of a hurricane season means the whole season will stay that way. “There’s no indication that fewer hurricanes will occur during the 2nd half of the season, and thus less damage.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Frankfurter Rundschau features an interview with climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann, Director of the Research Group for Climatology at the University of Bern in Switzerland.

Sounding more unsure about CO2 than ever…climate scientist Stefan Brönnimann
If Brönnimann represents what is going on among warmist scientists, it is that global warming scientists are no longer so cocksure about their beloved global warming theory and “settled science”. Increasingly they are admitting that there are still lots of unknown factors and that they are lacking explanations.
On the lack of warming over the last 15 years, Brönnimann admits that they were “unusual”, blaming it on the unexpected lack of “strong El Nino events in the tropical Pacific“. Yet he claims that this and the unusually cold European winters over the last few years “do not refute the CO2 greenhouse gas effect“. However Brönnimann is forced to concede:
Yet, extreme warming scenarios that could not be excluded with certainty are now looking highly improbable.”
Brönnimann is then asked if the climate models are in trouble, as Hans von Storch has been suggesting lately.
We don’t expect the climate models to exactly reflect the precise course of the climate, rather only the long-term changes – that is up to 2050 or 2100. […] A few models show only a slight warming for the last 15 years, which in reality has been the case. At the moment observations and models are still in agreement, but just barely.”
This is what we call clinging to your climate guns and Bible. Brönnimann’s claim reminds of the saying used for the doomed: “Hope is the last to die.” One or two percent of the models being almost right hardly justifies claiming that the models as a whole are still hanging in there.

The gig is just about over. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.

Concerning Brönnimann’s comment that the models cannot predict the climate curve exactly, this is an admission that scientists still do not understand the powerful natural factors of sun, clouds, aerosols, and oceans, to name a few. But failure to predict over time is just part of the story
Models that don’t have short-term accuracy also cannot possibly have any regional accuracy
If Brönnimann admits that models are pretty much temporally useless over years and decades, then they also cannot be of any use on regional geographical scales. Yet, hundreds, if not thousands, of models have purported to have the skill to predict regional climate. As a result, many policymakers in lots of countries have even based their national policy on such useless regional models – all with the approval and blessings of the climate scientists. Talk about a con-job.
Brönnimann is asked further about what he thinks may be the uncertainties in the models. Here he says that the uncertainties surround “cloud cover and aerosols” and admits that “also the oceans play a big role because they store lots of thermal energy.” Suddenly climate science is full of uncertainties and unknown variables after all. Then he goes on to say:
That we do not know much about the sun, despite the having researched it for a long time, has two reasons: Firstly there is great uncertainty about fluctuations in solar activity. Just how much the does the sun fluctuate as a whole and how strong are the fluctuations in the UV and the visible light spectrum? Secondly there is uncertainty in on the mechanisms.”
Finally climate scientists are leaving the door open to indirect solar impacts and amplification mechanisms. A little later in the interview Brönnimann is asked about why European winters have been so brutal over the last few years and if it’s possible that the sun may be playing a role. Brönnimann responds:
We’ve determined in a published study: A reduced solar activity leads to weakened westerly air currents over Europe, which normally would bring in air masses from the Atlantic. The result is colder temperatures for Central and Eastern Europe. Some of the recent cooler winters depicted such patterns, and solar activity was low. Therefore there could be a relationship. But it is still just one factor from many.”
Brönnimann now concedes the potential for a multitude of factors. Such is the long journey from activism to science. Climate science is progressing. The door is being left open to the sun and other natural factors. Brönnimann is also asked about the cosmic ray theory (viewed as kryptonite by many climate scientists) proposed by Danish scientist Hendrik Svensmark. His comment:
Experiments are being conducted on that at the Swiss CERN. On one hand it’s about the fundamental processes which are also scientifically interesting for aerosol researchers. And on the other hand its about the actual relevance these processes have on climate. Here results are still missing. We are waiting with excitement.”
At the end of the interview, Brönnimann tries to play down the sun’s impact on climate, and pumps up CO2 as a driver, reminding us that it is expected to lead to a warming of 1.5 to 4.5°C by the year 2100 (based on the models). But as the interview shows, scientists like Brönnimnn are now beingg forced to leave the door open to nature’s powerful climate forces. They are not going anywhere.
Expect that door to open up further with each passing year.

I’ve always wondered about all the huge mining operations that would be necessary to get the materials to manufacture hundreds of millions of huge batteries. Never mind the storage systems needed for storing electricity for the home. Caterpillar is probably drooling over the potential.
Of course we need to develop this technology, but God forbid we force a technology that is nowhere near ready and end up doing real damage to the planet.
It’s bad enough having our natural landscape mutilated and blighted by industrial wind turbines.

by P. Gosselin, and NTZ reader Jimbo
“The Earth has a fever,” we were told. “The science is settled and the debate is over. Scientists are unanimous – 97% of them agree: climate change is real, and is happening now, and we’ve got to act quickly.”
Over more than two decades we were told again and again that everywhere was warming faster than everywhere else – especially winters were warming up quickly. Snow was becoming a thing of the past and children soon weren’t going to know what it is.  “The warm winters that we are seeing are just a harbinger of what’s to come,” the media declared just a couple of years ago. The scientists were cock-sure.
Today we are finding that precisely the exact opposite is happening. Winters in Europe have turned colder and more severe. Central Europe has seen its 5th consecutive colder than normal winter in a row – a record since measurements began in the 19th century.
Climate scientists first reacted by claiming, “One winter does not make a trend“. Then they said that the cold winters were a local phenomenon. Finally they were forced to recently claim, “Cold winters now fit the picture of global warming!”
List of failed predictions
What follows are dozens of predictions for warmer winters made not long ago during the 2000s, many by leading scientists. What started as a simple Google search, turned into a list of false winter predictions for Central Europe, particularly Germany. By sheer coincidence reader Jimbo sent over his own list of false wintertime predictions made by “experts” in the US and Great Britain. I’ve combined the two lists and present one long list to you. Of course we still have to wait (90 years in some cases) to see how some of the predictions inevitably turn out, but current trends do not bode well for them.
Unfortunately, many of these predictions were passed on as reliable predictions to various sectors of industry, so that they could prepare for the new future that awaited. Many of these industries, like tourism, skiing, agriculture, highway maintenance, etc. based their investment decisions in part on these forecasts. As we now know, they turned out to be false – completely false – and the costs will be billions. Readers are welcome to suggest other false wintertime predictions, which we will gladly add to the list.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi tweeted an interesting graphic (Figure 2), indicating this year’s spring melt up in the Arctic could be off to a slow start – if one looks only at the temperature factor. There are of course lots of factors impacting sea ice melt: winds, weather, ocean currents, soot, to name a few. Here’s the sea ice extent at the moment:

Figure 1: Source:www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/htm.
Figure 1 above shows that we are pretty much at average Arctic sea ice extent for this time of the year, despite “the all-time record low” set last autumn. Figure 2 is the chart Joe Bastardi tweeted yesterday – a global temperature forecast for the next 6 weeks.

Figure 2: NCEP forecast for period 6 April to 21 May 2013. Source: NCEP.
Figure 2 shows lots of blue and green up in the Arctic and so the break-up of Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort sea ice could be delayed weeks. Using the popular warmist global warming albedo theory, that would mean lots of sunlight getting reflected back out into space, thus the dark ocean beneath would absorb less heat, and so lead to even less ice melt. Eventually, at the end of the long complicated chain, all the extra ice may lead to a warm winter at the middle latitudes next year, which then would be a clear sign of global warming. Just believe it!

Over the long-term, the Arctic is a sort of climate barometer, but one that lags the overall northern hemisphere mean temperature trend. What we saw last fall in the Arctic is in part only a consequence of the warm 2000s decade. By the end of the current decade, chances are good that we will see the Arctic recovering strongly, in response to an overall cooling of the northern hemisphere.
Spring minimum reaches a 10-year high!
Also, this year’s global spring minimum reached a 10-year high: just under 16 million sq km (Figure 3), and was thus about 1.5 million sq. km. more than 2 years ago.

Figure 3: Global sea ice bottomed out at just under 16 million sq. km. This is the highest in 10 years and is the same as 1981! See chart: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu.area.jpg
Right now overall global sea ice anomaly is almost plus one million sq. km., the highest it’s been in 4 years. That’s bad news for the albedo theorists. The upper curve of Figure 3 shows that the minimum global sea ice (reached every spring) was at the highest level in 10 years. This flies in the face of the claims that global sea ice is melting rapidly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIs CO2 the main driver behind climate?
Warmist scientists would have us believe it is. One recent European study claims that CO2 and temperature rose simultaneously at the end of the last ice age, implying CO2 is a real driver. However, one prominent German meteorologist dismissed it and bluntly called the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Géophysique de l’Environnement study by Parrenin et al “the latest gag“.
Now yet another new study published at Quaternary Science Reviews shows in no uncertain terms that the sun, the source of almost all of the Earth’s thermal energy, drives the climate and that the climate naturally swings in cycles.
The paper looks at the relationship between climatic variations, vegetation dynamics and early human activity between c. 4150–2860 BC reconstructed from a high-resolution pollen and geochemical record obtained from a small lake located in County Sligo, Ireland.
The study shows that human activity responded to changing climate conditions over the period. No surprise there. For example the abstract writes: “A nearly century-long climatic amelioration between c. 3460–3370 BC facilitated a revival of human activity on a small scale around the lake. Abandonment of the area and full woodland recovery occurred after a period of particularly wet and cool conditions ranging from c. 3360–3290 BC.”
Over the period that was studied, the climate in the region fluctuated between cool/wet periods and warmer/drier periods, each having an impact on human activity. Scientists found greater activity during warm periods.
3990 BC episode of increased rainfall
3970 – 3820 BC: period of warming and drying.
3830 – 3800 BC: episode of high precipitation
3740 – 3630 BC: dry, Templevanny Lough lowest level during Neolithic.
3670 – 3460 BC: wetter, cooler conditions, substantial rainfall
3460 – 3370 BC: warmer, drier
3360 – 3290 BC: particularly wet and cool
3110 – 3050 BC:  warmer, drier
3060 – 3030 BC: high rainfall
2940 – 2900 BC: high rainfall
The study reveals that the periods of climatic fluctuation were not isolated to just Ireland, but indeed are “in agreement with those of moisture/precipitation and temperature reconstructions from northern and western Europe and the Alps, suggesting that the studied period was characterised by a high-frequency climate variability“.
More importantly, what exactly was behind these climatic fluctuations? Human activity? Not at all. The scientists write:
These climatic shifts correspond to variations in solar activity, suggesting a solar forcing on climate.
Oh my, who would have ever thought it? After all, there are only hundreds of other similar studies from all over the world showing precisely the same thing.
CO2 is driving nothing

CO2 is hardly more a thermostat for global temperature than a thermometer is in your home. The following graphic is snipped from Petit et al 1999 here and shows the real (im)potency of CO2 in driving global temperature.

The blue curve above is the mean temperature and the red curve is CO2 concentration. From 130,000 to about 112,000 years CO2 was more or less steady at about 260 ppm. But look what happens to the temperature during this time. It dropped 9°C! You mean mighty “heat-trapping” Co2 wasn’t able to keep the planet warm?
Also note the lag. The same is clear for the other interglacials. Clearly the scientists of the Parrenin et al Paper made some gross scientific errors, or the study is just a sham.
Let’s take a look at temperature vs CO2 from 1943 to 1970. During this time we know that atmospheric CO2 was rising. Yet look at what happened to temperature during that period:

Before-tampering temperature data. Source: National Center For Atmospheric Research, published in 1975 in Newsweek.
The temperature dropped more than 0.6°F. The same is happening today: even though atmospheric CO2 concentration is on the rise, temperatures globally haven’t risen in 15 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeorg Ehring of German Public Radio conducted an interview with climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch, Director of the German Coastal Research Center.
The introductory text before the interview reads as follows:
The Earth has warmed considerably less than expected over the past 15 years days, says Hans von Storch. That may be due to an unforeseeable climate variability, or that CO2’s effect as a greenhouse gas was over-estimated, so says the meteorologist of the Coastal Research Institute. 

If anything, this interview shows that German climate science is beginning a slow shift and that warmist scientists starting to come to terms with the real possibility that they have been wrong all these years – possibly very wrong. It also shows that they are admitting that climate is poorly understood. The science in nowhere near understood, let alone settled.
On whether global warming has stopped, Hans von Storch says: “No. We don’t expect that. But it is indeed true that we have seen a considerably reduced warming trend compared to what our climate model scenarios showed over the last 15 years. […] We definitely have seen less warming than we expected.”
On what the cause could be, von Storch says many candidates are possible, and it points to climate variability, which would be natural fluctuations, which is what skeptics have been saying from Day 1. He also says that perhaps the climate sensitivity of CO2 was perhaps “a bit over-estimated“. Hans von Storch even mentions the S-word, claiming that it could have something to do with the sun.
On whether or not it could be the oceans eating up the heat, von Storch says that it’s possible, and that “what is obvious here is that our climate models didn’t anticipate this“.

On if models can still be trusted? von Storch obstinately insists:
Yes, completely. […]. It could be that the climate models are completely okay and that nothing bad can be said about them. But we haven’t put all the ingredients which we believe are important for the future into them.”
A most peculiar statement. Bread without flour is not bread. A climate model that does not take a number of factors into account, or that does not weight them correctly, is not a model you can trust – period. Hans von Storch elaborates further, saying that aerosols and solar activity must be better taken into account (along with the ocean cycles he mentions above). What von Storch is trying to say here is that he and the climate scientists are completely stumped as to what’s wrong with the models.
Ehring then asks von Storch what is the most likely explanation for the warming stop? Hans von Storch answers that he can only rely on his instincts, and nothing more. He adds:
There are several hypotheses that have to be looked at in detail. Personally I wouldn’t be surprised if it indeed turns out to be natural climate variations being under-estimated. That is the climate fluctuates more than we assumed.”
He then adds that this would have “serious consequences” for the understanding of climate and that as a scientist, “one must always keep possibilities open and be ready, in the case of doubt, to accept that the data in the end do not exactly fit the earlier explanation. … Us climate scientists do have some reasons to summon the courage to critically have another look to see if we really did everything okay.”

Scientists and experts at EIKE criticize Germany’s Ministry of Environment (UBA) for targeting dissenting views, calls notion of consensus absurd. Source: EIKE.
In the last of the three-part series rebutting the scientific claims and the assertions of the made by the UBA, EIKE sums up as follows:
The claim made by the UBA over the supposed scientific consensus of dangerous climate damage caused by CO2 is ABSURD, BASELESS AND FALSE!
Our Assessment of the UBA Pamphlet
Das UBA is amiss at every level in its climate pamphlet. In view of the politically motivated propagation of anthropogenically caused climate change, the UBA has denied every factual explanation. It has one-sidedly affiliated itself with the prophets of climate catastrophe, who derive their prognoses using fictional models results, and done so without any stringent argumentation.

The UBA violates the Ockham Law Principle where the hypothesis of fewest assumptions should be selected, the paradigm of modern natural science. The AGW hypothesis is namely not necessary for explaining the climate development after the start of industrialization. All climate changes of the last 150 years are within the range of natural fluctuations of at least the last 2000 years. Thus applying the Ockham law principle, the AGW hypothesis cannot be alone at the center. Only more future research can tell us what can be behind climate change.
With the publication of such dubious quality and its forcing of opinion upon others, the UBA will not succeed in ending the skepticism on ‘climate change’. Unintended by the UBA, its pamphlet has indeed lead a part of the media to inform the public of the danger to our democracy arising from the suppression of politically undesired dissenting views and from the denigration of scientists who have a different opinion, and have made it clear they will no longer stand for it.
We hope that our rebuttal to the UBA will bring more seriousness and scientific honesty to the climate debate. Not only the UBA is available for factual discussion and for questions, but EIKE as well.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the last few days, parts of Germany have been hit by some of the worst flooding seen in 100 years after heavy rains hit southern and eastern regions over a period of 4 days. Since then armies of climate charlatans have appeared in the media claiming it’s all because of man’s fossil sins.
Today the German Weather Service (DWD) issued a press release. I’ll remind readers that the DWD is now under the control of warmist activists, who have far more faith in crystal ball fortune-telling models than they do in real observations. Here are some excerpts of the DWD press release:
After the extreme precipitation of the last days, especially in southern and eastern Germany, and the subsequent devastating flooding situation, citizens are asking two questions: How often can something like this happen, and do we have to expect such extreme events more often in the future because of climate change? What follows are some explanations by the German Weather Service (DWD).”
The DWD then explains that flooding in general is nothing really unusual, but that this time the extreme flooding was due to a large weather system and the 4 days of heavy precipitation it brought with it. Some 22.75 billion metric tonnes of water fell onto Germany. That’s 22.75 cubic kilometers! Moreover, the ground had been already saturated from of a wet month of May and, to make things worse, snowmelt in the Alps added to the water mass. In summary a number of factors happened to converge.
The question of course is: Did this happen because of climate change? The DWD writes (my emphasis):
Analyses by the DWD over the period of 1951 to 2000 show no distinct trend of more extreme precipitation events can be derived. However there is a trend to more precipitation days with 30 liters and more per square meter – especially in the winter. Global warming shows an increase, which means more water vapor in the atmosphere. The latest climate analyses and projections show a tendency to more wet low pressure systems over Central Europe. The median annual number increases 20% accordingly from 1951 until the end of the century.”

As they added the word “projections” we can assume here they mean the end of the 21st century. Note how sloppy (tricky) they are with the communication by blurring the past and the future. If you read carefully, they seem to be saying no trend from 1951 to 2000, yet their projections show 20% increase by 2100, leading a reader tio believe that there is an overall upward trend. If a reader doesn’t read carefully, then he may easily get the idea that there is a “20% trend” The reality however is: their real observations show no trend, but their crystal balls foretell a 20% increase by 2100.
Should we believe the DWD crystal balls? Like Richard Feynman said: “If the observations don’t match your guess, then your guess is wrong. That’s all there is to it.” It doesn’t matter how many awards you got, how renowned the newspapers say you are, or if you think you won a Nobel Prize, or if your are the director of the Weather Service – it’s wrong.
As a final note, Dr. Roy Spencer shows us just how well 73 climate climate models are doing so far:

During the ice ages, when CO2 concentration was just 180 ppm, much life on the planet stood on the brink of extinction. When the planet was a hot-house and CO2 was over 1000 ppm, the Earth was a literal garden of Eden teeming with life. Hat-tip: reader Manfred.

So it’s no surprise that the British Antarctic Survey tells us in a fascinating report that the emperor penguin faces starvation should Antarctic sea ice grow, as it is doing right now.
The British Antarctic Survey writes at the very end of its report:
They have a high survival rate compared to other penguins, with an average of 95% surviving the year. However, if it is a harsh sea-ice year, many chicks will die of starvation. Emperors are the least common Antarctic penguin, with only about 200,000 breeding pairs.”

Of course the extra sea ice we’ve been seeing at the South Pole doesn’t mean these dignified birds will become extinct any time soon. Like polar bears, they’ve survived far worse conditions. But it does mean the weaker ones aren’t going to fare as well and some will have to make an agonizing, early departure from Earth.
Already I’m seeing emperor penguins falling from the sky to their death! Must be those damn man-made aerosols cooling the southern hemisphere.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFolks, if you care about the environment and precious habitats for endangered species, like the American bald eagle, then you are going to find the following video rolled in Haldimand, Ontario last Saturday profoundly disturbing:

Video courtesy of: www.ontario-wind-resistance.org.
The raw emotion of the protesters doing the camera work is clear and understandable. But imagine how the media would have handled this had it been for an oil drilling rig or pipeline. Because this eviction is to make way for “clean” planet-saving wind-turbines, which are going to spend 80% of their lifetimes idle, the media couldn’t be bothered to report on this.
The workman at the 1-minute mark in the video of course is correct. The workers there are only doing their jobs. The permit to destroy the nest was issued by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (Friday evening!). And why would they issue such a permit? Because charlatans like Al Gore and a massive multi-billion dollar network of green organisations (Greenpeace, Sierra Club, WWF, etc.) managed to convince the world with corrupt science that CO2 is poisoning the climate. Blame them.

A summary of the bird nest destruction is here: http://thebiggreenlie.bald-eagles-nest-to-be-removed-for-wind-farm/
My advice to the angry activists with the camera: I understand your anger and frustration. But it is people like you who are responsible for this. You and millions of others allowed yourselves to have the wool pulled over your eyes by the climate charlatans and renewable energy industry.  They told you fossil fuels were destroying the planet and that you they would save it with their “clean” energy systems, and you believed them. In fact, you slurped it right up. The rest of us who expressed doubt were just flat-earthers, deniers.
The climate rescuers are only getting started. This is only the very beginning.
For example, look at the deforestation of natural rainforests taking place in places like Borneo, also to make way for “clean” energy palm oil plantations (though, the BBC blames it all on hungry consumers). The truth is that these palm oil plantations exist in large part so that Europe can meet its biofuel targets and pat itself on the back for being a leader in “rescuing the climate”.

In this week’s Saturday Summary, meteorologist Joe Bastardi takes a look at the Arctic situation, among other interesting stuff.

WeatherBELL’s Saturday Summary calls 2013 North Pole “the coldest ever recorded”.
Unlike last year, this year we’ll be hearing next to nothing about Arctic sea ice in the media. In fact the most recent NOAA report about the Arctic was about 2012! That’s how desperate they are.
In the Saturday Summary, Joe says at the 3:05 mark (my emphasis):
Speaking of cool, North Pole temperatures have fallen below freezing way in advance of where they normally do this year. This is the coldest summer ever recorded by the Danish Meteorological Institute; they started looking back at this in the 1950s. At the North Pole there’s only one or two days that actually reached normal and some of this propaganda that’s going on now – look I’m going to have to show you and debunk that whole situation.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s catastrophe-obsessed weekly Die Zeit is now claiming that climate models have in fact predicted long temperature stagnation after all. Suddenly, periods of temperature stagnation are showing up in models, climate scientists are discovering.
Last week, I wrote about how a Swiss climate modeller had suddenly discovered temperature stagnations in the models, and tried to claim this showed the model warming scenarios were right on track after all.
Now the catastrophe junkies at Die Zeit news magazine here have joined in. Until just a few months ago, Die Zeit had been telling us just the opposite: things were warming faster than ever!
In its latest article, Die Zeit writes that “climate skeptics are jubilant that the IPCC models are faulty”and that on the other hand Prof. Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and IPCC author, vehemently scorns the skeptics for being so, insisting the climate catastrophe is coming:
“We are completely sure that at the end of the 21st century it’ll be warmer than today. However, the path to that point is simply not a straight line that follows CO2 concentration.”
Die Zeit writes (my emphasis):
Indeed such temperature plateaus have occurred also in the climate models; only the exact time of their occurrence is difficult to predict.”
Die Zeit goes on and explains that the temperature stagnation is caused by “external factors like volcano eruptions” and also”chaotic fluctuations in the atmosphere and oceans”, citing La-Niña and El-Niño-events, ocean currents, etc.
For 15 years in a row?
Next Die Zeit quotes Marotzke, who actually contradicts Die Zeit, saying the current stagnation is in fact a mystery:
Also the question of how long the plateau will persist and what happens afterwards cannot be answered at this time.”
Well, why not? The models are supposed to do that. Now you say they can’t. You can’t see what lies ahead for the next few decades? Unbelievable.
If the models had included all the factors, like the WELL-KNOWN solar cycles and the WELL-KNOWN ocean cycles, as Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning did in their book Die kalte Sonne, the models would have at least come up with the current stagnation. Moreover, the IPCC models would have seen that the stagnation would last until 2040. Now they are left standing there desperate for an explanation.
The solar and ocean cycles were known to the modellers years ago, but they were ignored, covered up, and swept out of sight. A reasonable model showing no warming until 2040 was the last thing they wanted the public to see. It would have taken all the alarm out of issue. If there ever was a case for organized scientific fraud and deception, then this is it. THEY KNEW OF THE NATURAL CYCLES YEARS AGO!
Jochem Marotzke and Die Zeit still hope to keep the charade going, insisting that we believe the heat is there – somewhere! Die Zeit writes:
That the surface temperature is currently stagnating does not mean in any case that global warming has taken a break, says Marotzke. To the contrary: The warming is just taking place somewhere else – in the oceans.”

Marotzke and Die Zeit now sound worse than slippery used-car salesmen.
Unfortunately there’s no data to support this – anywhere. Even Die Zeit admits it:
In any case, climate scientists cannot say for sure where the warming really is. ‘The measurement system for this is just not sufficient enough,’ says Marotzke. 3000 buoys have been in use only a few years now, within the scope of the global ocean observation systems (GOOS) – they sink only to a depth of about 2000 meters. Thus it cannot be proven whether the deep ocean is warming strongly or not.”
Die Zeit later in the article winds up admitting that the scientists really don’t have a clue at all as to what’s going on, writing that some scientists blame the current stagnation on aerosols, or “reduced water vapor concentration in the stratosphere”. Consensus is non-existent more than ever.
Marotzke also answers questions on why the IPCC 5AR models failed to foresee the 15-year plateau:
With these long-term climate models, you can’t expect such short-term plateaus to be predicted at the right times.”
Well, not using your kind of science. Die Zeit adds:
You simply don’t throw a climate model into the dustbin just because it fails to preceisely predict the weather in one year.”
That’s true. One only does that when it fails 15 years in a row!
“Many of us are now amazed climate is not linear”
Die Zeit finally tells its readers that the climate system is far from being understood and brings in Prof. Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany to answer some questions. Latif, also an IPCC lead-author, has spent 90% of his time over the last years calculating natural climate fluctuations (see, he knew). Die Zeit writes:
In any case, Latif admits that we have underestimated ‘how important it is to communicate the importance of natural climate fluctuations’.”
That’s an understatement. You guys never bothered to put these “important natural fluctuations” in the models. You were too damn obsessed with keeping the level of alarm elevated. This all reeks of intentional deceit.
Die Zeit adds:
The science often simplified things too much and reduced graphics to mean values. That’s why many of us got the impression that climate is always linear – and now are amazed that this does not correspond to reality.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI was looking at the Climate4you.com/ chart Joe Bastardi used in a recent post. It shows the CO2 and the temperature curves. In it we already see the first signs of why the warmists are getting seriously nervous. The divergence is beginning:

Figure 1: TODAY: CO2 concentration and global temperature. The divergence began in 2005. 
I asked myself what is it going to look like in 10 or 15 years with the negative AMO and PDO (let’s leave out the solar activity slumber for now) continuing. So I took the Climate4You chart, cut and extended it out to the year 2030. We know CO2 is going to keep rising. Next I simply extended the negative phase of the AMO and PDO global temp out to 2030 so that it’s behaves similarly to the last negative phase for the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Doing that you get the following development:

Figure 2: 2030…oh my, what a wonderful correlation. 
Now you know why the warmists are crapping bricks big time right now. They see the writing on the wall – they know the Great Climate Scam has got but only a few more years to live, and then it is over! RIP! It’s going to get worse with every passing year. In fact, let’s hope CO2 skyrockets to 500 ppm soon…it’ll make their error look even more profound.
Many will argue that you just can’t assume the AMO and the PDO will have a similar impact as it did from 1950s through the 1970s. Well, we’ll see. So far it’s right on track!
And let’s recall that next years will see low solar activity, and so the temperatures could drop even more. It gets even worse if a major volcano erupts. The warmists are not going to have a place to hide.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo, NTZ has not been taken over by Joe Bastardi and WeatherBELL (But I’m open for offers :)).
Seriously, it’s just that Joe has had some interesting news lately, and here’s another that’s happening in our time of “global warming” and “record” 400 ppm CO2.

Mid-May frost forecast to wipe out fruit. Source: www.weatherbell.com/saturday-summary-may-11-2013
The latest comes from his Saturday Summary 5/11. At the 5:50 mark:
But what the GFS has been insisting on, is the major historic 3-day cold outbreak.”
Are things ever going to warm up?
Over the long-term Joe says it’ll probably cool “worse than we thought”. Read my last post from yesterday.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi of weatherbell.com/ kindly took the time to write a comment, and so I think it deserves being upgraded to a post. It’s one whole semester of meteorology summed up (edited by PG)!

Here’s the problem globally: We continue to dwell on temperatures in the Arctic and ignore the fact that it’s a natural cyclical distortion because the planet wobbles on its axis and has much more water in the southern hemisphere, and more land in the north. So there is an eternal search for a balance that can never be attained. It can only go back and forth. Think about it. While CO2 warmists are yelling and screaming about the Arctic melting, the southern hemisphere ice is expanding. We are now told the deep water is warming (what bullocks, it does this every time the PDO has been warm.  What will happen over the next 20 years is the southern hemisphere sea ice will retreat and the northern hemisphere will advance once the AMO turns cold. We just can actually observe it now from above with satellites.
There is so much lunacy in their argument, they don’t even realize global ACE drop is because of the distortion; instead they scream about warming causing increased activity, when in reality globally it has gone the other way. Until such time someone can show me that there is less OUTGOING RADIATION than incoming, there is no “warming” going on.  There is no trapping of heat. Physically all CO2 can do is add its 0.4 to 0.7°C to the 33°C of the blanket gases that were wonderfully placed there and made the Earth’s temps reasonably livable, in spite of the variations that have to happen because of the system’s design.
Oceans are partly driving the climate
The whole CO2 argument is tiresome and absurd. The unmoved mover is the sun. The system below responds to the variations in the sun with a lag.  The “warming” was because when the oceans went into their warm cycle (remember there is far greater “energy” in warm water than in cold dry air), the natural response had to be a warming in the north – where there is more land-  because equatorial ocean warming increases the transport of warm humid air northward. That air has to then warm areas where there is dry air. If you dry out warm humid air, then you warm the air temperature if the wet bulb is constant. So there is warming over the continents, BUT IT ONLY CONTINUES UNTIL THE OCEANS HAVE ADDED THEIR INPUT. The leveling off of temps is completely consistent with an atmosphere that has absorbed the heat from the warming cycles of the oceans that occurred in tandem from 1995-2007 (warm PDO was 1978-2007,  warm AMO 1995 till present, but it will shift).
The other way around – low ACE indicates warming
The increase in the southern hemisphere’s ice cap is more impressive than Arctic melt because the cold source is the continent of Antarctica, and for the ice to expand it had to have been colder in the areas where it expanded, which is over water. This is much harder to do than warming up dry, cold Arctic air. Now we see the response. This is entirely natural. I argued at the Heartland Conference that the global ACE drop and the southern hemisphere ice show that this is merely a distortion that will turn around and go the other way. The cooling tropical Pacific means naturally the ACE lowers since most of our tropical activity comes from the Pacific. But the Atlantic, still in the warm AMO, takes up the slack. Tropical cyclones are major energy transporters and balancing mechanisms for the atmosphere. If there is no need to balance out (cooling Pacific, warmer in the north), then the ACE drops. Amazingly the OPPOSITE of what people are yelling about is the sign of the so-called warming. In fact as the Arctic areas start to cool and the AMO backs away from the warm cycle, we are likely to see the ACE come back up again, as the “need” for more Pacific cyclones will reappear.
CO2 is too trivial of a factor

The major problem is the people driving this train refuse to humble themselves to the majesty of the atmosphere. The sheer weight of numbers against CO2 causing this is staggering. The oceans have 1000 times the heat capacity of the atmosphere, CO2 1/2500th of the gas blanket that makes our Earth livable, man – according to the US Dept of Energy – is only responsible for 1/20th of that, meaning 1/50,000th of the air is “man-made”. Actually it’s merely man-recycled, for there has been no introduction of new CO2 to the system that I know of. What we’ve put into the air has always been a part of the system, it’s just recycled.
Does anyone know of some magic spaceship that came and increased the amount of CO2 inherent to the global system (fossil fuels for instance, come from sources that have always been on the planet)? So we are asked to believe that we are changing all this. Though a gross over-simplification, if the 1/2500th of the blanket gases is contributing 0.4 to 0.7°C to the wonderful 33°C which elevate the average temperature to 288°K instead of a frigid 255°K, and man is responsible for only 1/20th of that, then perhaps our contribution to the global temp is…0.035°C.
Since some consider me a neanderthal, let’s do what neanderthals love to do…compete for survival. Let’s simply measure the temperature by objective satellite over the next 20-30 years as the PDO remains cold and the AMO flips. Let’s measure the temperature and see if by 2030, the 5-year running mean is not back to where we were.
Quiet sun is a wild card – poses a threat
The explanation to all this is no different than you sitting in a sauna. Turn up the thermostat (natural ocean cycles) and it will heat until it reaches what the thermostat dictates. Arguing that turning on the light (the CO2 influence) is what heated the sauna is absurd. The wild card in this is the sun, which I am concerned is going to be a much bigger problem (believe me with the lunacy of the energy policies globally, a return to my temps is already a huge problem in itself, but the sun falling asleep would be worse). My ideas, which are not new, are basic climate cycle theory and were accepted before people decided they had to save the planet. They explain perfectly this chart:
http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2012/08.jpg
To those who want to argue “natural variability” is hiding the warming, a) you didn’t tell us that before your models went busting badly, and b) are you saying without CO2 we would already be back in the Victorian era of temps? To those who say there is hidden heat and that a gas (which is only 1/2500th of an atmosphere in which the most prominent GHG is water vapor, and with oceans that have 1000 times the heat capacity of the atmosphere) is somehow controlling all this (recall that we once had an ice age at 7000 ppm co2) you live in a fantasy world.
Then again, men who have the fantasy of saving the planet by controlling others are indeed in their own world. It’s up to those grappling with the real facts to make sure that the world we live in is one that promotes freedom and the betterment of mankind, and not one controlled by those who believe they are superior to everyone else. This is where the real battle is, and not with a trace gas that has little if anything to do with the climate of a planet created and designed the way it was. – J.B.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA Look At Global Mean Temperatures in 2013: Cooling Ahead!
By Fritz Vahrenholt, Frank Bosse
(Translated with permission by P Gosselin)
“Global Warming Is Taking A Break“ – that was the title of an article at the online Hamburger Abendblatt on 4 January 2013. And that’s hard to miss when you look at the latest global temperature chart:

Red and green: temperature; blue: CO2.
This of course demands an explanation, which is provided by Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg: It’s because of ocean currents, and this is indeed included in IPCC models. But something is wrong, and also Marotzke can’t get around it when he tried to explain the temperature stagnation in the interview with the Abendblatt:
“In such periods, the heat is taken in more strongly by the deep oceans. We still cannot explain why this is so.” Scientists have reason to suspect that heat is taken from the surface to the bottom in the southern oceans.“
The circulation in the world’s oceans is rather well known and how its function is not a mystery:

Source: Bildungsserver
We see a transport conveyor, and one region is especially distinct: the North Atlantic at 20-60°N and 10-60°W. Here we find the greatest heat release into the atmosphere. Wouldn’t this be the place to look in the search for the missing heat instead of suspecting mysterious, clandestine warm waters in the southern oceans? Let’s begin our search.
For an analysis we need data that accounts for the heat quantity at the lower depths of the sea. The IPCC models are often content with the upper 50 meters. But data have been collected down to 700 m already since 1955, and in recent times very precisely using automated bouys. What has been measured in the oceans 700 m can be found in the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) dataset. Here’s the development for the North Atlantic region:
 

 
The diagram above shows the anomaly from the mean in Gigajoule per square meter. Does the shape of the curve look familiar? It certainly does! Its similarity to global temperatures is mind-boggling:

Just how similar are the curves? And does the similarity mean that the heat comes from the depths or vice versa: i.e. the atmosphere warms the water in rhythm?  Here we carry out a correlation analysis to find out which is the hen and which is the egg. We want to know what comes first. Is it the heat content of the water mass, or the global temperature?

Just as we already suspected: correlation reaches a maximum with a lag of 12 months, with Ocean Heat Content (OHC) leading. This becomes even more distinct when the temperatures of the northern hemisphere (NH) are considered in place of global temperatures (global). Have we found a possible method of predicting global temperature 12 months out? For this a regression is carried out to determine the temperatures for the coming 12 months according to our model, which uses the current ocean heat values for the temperature prediction. And then we compare these temperatures with the real, measured temperature values.

That doesn’t look bad at all, does it? We were able to project the course of the quarterly temperature series one year in advance with an accuracy of 57%. How does it do with the deviations? We do see some rather large ones, 1998 for example! We therefore depict the time series of the difference between the projected and real values, and at the same time change between El Nino and La Nina – the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the form of the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) series:

Here we see that many of the deviations can be well-explained by the ENSO (MEI). The heat amounts deep in the Atlantic also cannot be aware of surface volcanic eruptions. The negative deviations of 1992-1995 can be traced back to the eruptions. Thus we can make a prediction for 2013:

The red curve above depicts the quarterly global mean temperature. A higher resolution is not possible because the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) data is only available on a quarterly basis.  We should not wonder that the first quarter of 2013 will be approx. one tenth of a degree C cooler than the previous months because the push by the last mini El Nino, which ended in fall 2012, is over. After a slight warming of a few hundredths of a degree in the second quarter of 2013, a tenth of a degree of cooling can be expected for the fall of 2013. This of course is only if no huge ENSO event occurs during the 2nd half of 2013. These impact the global temperature with a lag of about 4 months, which is why foresee the impact of the last ENSO until February 2013. How high is the probability for an El Nino in 2013? No one can say for sure, and so we will just have to wait and see for the second half of the year.
And then?
When the Ocean Heat Content of the North Atlantic has a period of approx. 65 years, then we can extend the curve above into the future, which would lead to values we saw in the 1990s!
The water of the lower depths is not sufficiently taken into account by the IPCC models. Should it indeed have an impact, as is indicated here, then it means that CO2 has a significantly lesser impact on the climate than we previously thought. It is likely that CO2 is only 50% of what the IPCC estimates when all natural factors and the impact of the sun are accounted for.
It’ll certainly be interesting to see how the months ahead shape up. We will see if our temperature prediction turns out to be right, and that without using any “mysterious”, heat transport somewhere down near Antarctica! So stop by at our Die kalte Sonne website as we will be keeping you up to date.
Our figures by the way are without any guarantee because there are weather variations and volcanic eruptions that cannot be foreseen…

Share this...FacebookTwitterA year ago guest writer Ed Caryl wrote a report here telling us that Greenland was getting more snow cover, and not less. A year later we take another look to see if the trend is continuing:

Chart source: www.climate4you.com/SnowCover.htm
Greenland is melting? Where? The chart shows there is about 80,000 square km more snow cover today than in 1974. That’s the same as almost 1000 Manhattans.
When a piece of glacier the size of Manhattan breaks off and floats into the ocean, the media freak out about it? But when Greenland snow cover jumps a whopping 80,000 sq. km, we don’t here a peep.
Northern Hemisphere snow cover now 4th highest in 35 years

“Well, Greenland is a regional phenomenon,” the alarmists may claim. “We have to look at the entire Northern hemisphere”.
A few days ago we looked at December snow cover. So let’s look at the weekly snow cover for the northern hemisphere every year since 1966. Well, that too shows NO TREND!

Chart source: www.climate4you.com/SnowCover.htm
Where’s the melting?
Snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere currently (31 December 2012) is the 4th highest in 35 years!
