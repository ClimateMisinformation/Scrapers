"The UK government is putting the health of millions of its citizens at risk by failing to tackle the country’s air pollution crisis, according the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights and the environment. David Boyd said people’s right to breathe clean air was being violated in the UK and warned the crisis was responsible for up to 50,000 deaths – and devastating the lives of “many millions” more in towns and cities across the country.  Speaking to the Guardian, he said air pollution and climate change were inextricably linked and called on the UK government to take a global lead by introducing new clean air legislation to raise standards, protect its citizens and meet its climate obligations. “The interesting thing about the UK is that the London smog of 1952 was the galvanising event that led to the world’s first Clean Air Act,” said Boyd. “I really feel like we have reached the point again where it is time for the UK to step up and show some leadership.” The intervention follows a slew of new scientific studies over recent months that have highlighted the long-term damage air pollution is doing to people’s health, from asthma to dementia, damage to unborn babies and heart disease. Last month the world’s biggest children’s charity, Unicef, told the Guardian it had refocused its UK operation to tackle air pollution because of the scale of the “health crisis” facing young people in the country. It also follows a landmark UN climate report that warned we only had 12 years to avert disastrous climate breakdown. Boyd said: “Air pollution and climate change are inextricably linked – fossil fuels are by far the biggest contributor to air pollution. But if you flip that around, by dealing with air pollution we are also starting to deal with climate change, and that is a great opportunity as well as a great challenge.” The UK government has been widely criticised by clean air campaigners and environmental groups over what they say has been its failure to tackle the air pollution crisis. It has been defeated three times in court over its plans on the issue and is now one of six countries taken to the European court of justice over their toxic air. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs defended the government’s record, claiming the UK was “acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy, with an ambitious £3.5bn plan to reduce harmful emissions, an upcoming environment bill which will include provisions to improve air quality, and a commitment to end the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040.” It also called on individuals to take action, from burning only the “cleanest fuels” to “leaving the car at home on the school run”. However, Boyd said ministers were “simply not doing enough”. “The fact that they still have these weak standards and the fact that there are somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 premature deaths in the UK?” he said. “That should simply not be acceptable in a wealthy, advanced society.” And he warned that the official death toll was “just the tip of the iceberg”. “If you are having tens of thousands of premature deaths,” he said, “you are also talking about millions of illnesses from asthma to lung cancer that don’t necessarily kill you but make lives utterly miserable.” Boyd, who took up his post in August, said the crisis in the UK was part of a global public health emergency that kills between 6 and 7 million people a year. He argued that the “vast majority” of these deaths are preventable “if we put stronger laws, policies and standards in place … we just need the political will.” Children are among the most susceptible to toxic air. Last month the Guardian reported how youngsters in the UK were getting a disproportionate amount of air pollution during the school day. One primary school was found to have levels several times over the World Health Organization limit for the most damaging particulates inside its classrooms. However, Boyd said he remained optimistic that the global air pollution crisis could be overcome, pointing out that repeated studies into the cost of tackling air pollution have shown “absolutely clearly that the net benefits are in the trillions of dollars”. “There is no economic argument against cleaner air – in fact, this is one of those rare instances where our environmental objectives, our economic objectives and our social objectives line up very neatly,” he said."
"How did government respond to the recent scientific conclusion that only “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” can deliver the globally agreed target for stopping climate breakdown? In the UK, fracking for fossil fuels was given the green light, plans were announced for a huge new road in the south-east, incentives for electric vehicles withered, the expansion of Heathrow airport is still going ahead and Gatwick airport is trying to expand too by bringing a back-up runway into use. It’s like seeing a sign that says “Danger: vertical cliff drop” and pulling on your best running shoes to take a flying leap. Something isn’t working. The head of the oil company Shell responded to the new climate science warming by clarifying that “Shell’s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas.” BP announced new North Sea oil projects. Immediate choices are being made with blank disregard to avoiding climate breakdown.  A new line in the sand is needed to underpin the existing climate agreement, to exert influence over the immediate choices of policymakers. At the very least, the science should mandate a moratorium in rich countries on any further expansion of the fossil fuel industry, or any infrastructure dependent on it. Currently, global demand for coal, oil and gas are all growing, with fossil fuels accounting for 81% of energy use. Worryingly, the International Energy Agency projects total fossil fuel use rising for decades still to come, smashing all climate targets. A moratorium could take the form of a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. The threat of nuclear catastrophe provides a precedent for how, quickly, to stop a bad situation getting worse. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), agreed 50 years ago between 1965-68, was a triumph of rapid diplomacy, at the height of cold war mistrust, and against an immense security threat (this is a different, far more comprehensive and important treaty than the one with Russia rejected by Donald Trump last week). We could even adapt the classic “three pillar” structure of the NPT. The first is “non proliferation” itself. Climate negotiations and national commitments are not moving fast enough to meet the older 2C climate target let alone 1.5C. The first step in the nuclear treaty process was a stock take of who had what weapons. Why not cut to the chase and agree to assess those fossil fuel reserves which, if burned, would carry us across the 1.5C warming line, and monitor their non-use and any measures likely to lead to the proliferation of fossil fuels? “The fossil fuel industry knows with some certainty future production often decades in advance,” says Carbon Tracker’s Mark Campanale, “What we need is a global, public register setting out who controls the reserves from where the CO2 is coming.” The second pillar of the NPT is disarmament. This means rapid substitution of clean energy for fossil fuels. We know this can be done in ways which would also save tens of millions of lives by improving air quality. But “disarmament” would also be delivered by following the climate scientists’ three point plan for action carrying the “highest benefits”: lowering energy demand, lowering material consumption, and switching to food choices that are low carbon (in other words more plant-based food). The final pillar concerns the promotion of the “peaceful” use of technology. In a climate context, that would mean massively expanding existing initiatives to compensate poorer countries for leaving fossil fuels in the ground, while ensuring access to clean energy and the technology needed for development. Funds could be also redirected from the staggering $10m per minute that governments give in fossil fuel subsidies, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some governments have already proposed moratoriums on coal at national level and there are initiatives such as Powering Past Coal Alliance. As far back as 1988 at the Toronto conference on the changing atmosphere, climatic upheaval was described as a threat “second only to nuclear war”, a sentiment endorsed from the CIA to MI5 and the United Nations. National efforts are crucial, but a new fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty supported by movements calling to leave fossil fuels in the ground, would provide a transparent and fair means to stop climate breakdown. The best way to mark the 50th anniversary of the NPT, would be to begin negotiation of its fossil fuel equivalent. • Andrew Simms is an author, political economist and campaigner.

"The amount of vegetation burnt by fires caused by lightning strikes in Tasmania’s world heritage area has increased dramatically this century, according to new research led by the University of Tasmania. The study, published this month in the academic journal Fire, warns the state’s heritage forests face rising threats because of the tendency toward drier summers and that the probability of “catastrophic” fires could increase as a result of more fuel igniting from lightning strikes.  In 2016, parts of the world heritage area were devastated by fires, many ignited by lightning strikes. Researchers at the University of Tasmania looked at historic fire data collected by the Tasmanian parks and wildlife service from 1980 to 2016. The records detail the number of fires each year, the area burnt and what caused the fire. From the year 2000, they found an increase in the number of lightning-caused fires and an increase in the average size of the fires, “resulting in a marked increase in the area burnt”. Their data shows only a few fires caused by lightning were recorded in the 1980s and 1990s, compared with almost 20 that were recorded in 2015-16. There were major fires caused by lightning in 2000-01, 2006-07, 2012-13 and 2015-16. “Lightning is now responsible for the majority of the area burned in the TWWHA [Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area],” they state. Fire ecologist Jenny Styger, the paper’s lead author, said: “Something changed about 2000. “It was the tipping point at which lightning started to become the predominant cause of fire ignition.” The researchers were unable to determine if the reason for this was because there had been an increase in lightning strikes, or if drier fuel in the world heritage area was making it more likely a fire would start because of a lightning strike. They said this was because western Tasmania does not have reliable historic data on the detection of lightning strikes. But Styger said it was a significant issue because many of the fires in the world heritage area occurred in remote forest with no road access, making them difficult to detect and extinguish. “This is going to impact how we think about fire management for the world heritage area and it’s going to become a much greater threat with climate change,” she said. “It’s going to be a really significant issue going forward because the world heritage area has lots of areas that we don’t want to burn.” In 2016, an Australian Senate inquiry examined the fires in remote Tasmanian wilderness in January and February of that year. The Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the new research showed “climate change’s impacts are here now and this is another reminder of the need to urgently reduce emissions”. He said the inquiry had considered whether an increase in fires caused by lightning may have contributed to the destruction in 2016. “To have this confirmed by this study should send shockwaves through the conservation community,” he said."
"Thousands of Central American migrants trudging through Mexico towards the US have regularly been described as either fleeing gang violence or extreme poverty. But another crucial driving factor behind the migrant caravan has been harder to grasp: climate change.  Most members of the migrant caravans come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – three countries devastated by violence, organised crime and systemic corruption, the roots of which can be traced back to the region’s cold war conflicts. Experts say that alongside those factors, climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty. And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US. “The focus on violence is eclipsing the big picture – which is that people are saying they are moving because of some version of food insecurity,” said Robert Albro, a researcher at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. “The main reason people are moving is because they don’t have anything to eat. This has a strong link to climate change – we are seeing tremendous climate instability that is radically changing food security in the region.” Migrants don’t often specifically mention “climate change” as a motivating factor for leaving because the concept is so abstract and long-term, Albro said. But people in the region who depend on small farms are painfully aware of changes to weather patterns that can ruin crops and decimate incomes. Pausing for a rest as the first of the three recent migrant caravans passed through the Mexican town of Huixtla last week, Jesús Canan described how he used to sow maize and beans on a hectare of land near the ancient Copán ruins in western Honduras. An indigenous Ch’orti’ Maya, Canan abandoned his lands this year after repeated crop failures – which he attributed to drought and changing weather patterns.“It didn’t rain this year. Last year it didn’t rain,” he said softly. “My maize field didn’t produce a thing. With my expenses, everything we invested, we didn’t have any earnings. There was no harvest.” Desperate and dreaming of the United States, Canan hit the road in early October and joined the migrant caravan. He left behind a wife and three children – ages 16, 14 and 11 – who were forced to abandon school because Canan couldn’t afford to pay for their supplies. “It wasn’t the same before. This is forcing us to emigrate,” he said. “In past years, it rained on time. My plants produced, but there’s no longer any pattern [to the weather].” US Customs and Border Patrol data shows a surge in outward migration fromwestern Honduras, a prime coffee-producing area, said Stephanie Leutert, an expert in Central American migration and security at the University of Texas. Many of those are farmers or agricultural workers who take to the road when coffee-growing is no longer profitable – such as Antonio Lara, 25, from the Honduran city of Ocotepeque, who joined the caravan with his wife and children, aged six and 18 months.“Coffee used to be worth something, but it’s been seven years since there was a decent price,” he said.Lara said he thought that changing weather patterns had a lot to do with the problem, though he also blamed his plight on greedy bosses and coffee dealers. “I didn’t leave my country because I wanted to. I left because I had to,” he said. A third of all employment in Central America is linked to agriculture, so any disruption to farming practices can have devastating consequences. Since around 2012, coffee plants across Central America have been ravaged by an epidemic called leaf rust, which according to some estimates has affected 70% of farms. Normally, the fungus dies when temperatures drop in the evening but warmer nights are allowing it to thrive, said Sam Dupre, a researcher at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. The impact of climate change on the fungus remains in debate, but Dupre said the situation in Guatemala “shows even without a direct climate change link what happens when these global commodities fail”. “One of the things I found was that people, largely because they weren’t able to pay their debts, to get money for food, they started to migrate,” Dupre said. “People were telling me before the coffee leaf rust hit, we didn’t migrate. Now we do. It’s normal.” A study of Central American migrants by the World Food Program last year found that nearly half described themselves as food insecure. The research found an increasing trend of young people moving as a result of knock-on poverty and lack of work. Climate change is bringing more extreme and unpredictable weather to the region: summer rainfall is starting later and has become more irregular. Drought fuelled by El Niño has gripped much of Central America over the past four years, but the period has been occasionally punctuated by disastrous flooding rains.  As a result, more than 3 million people have struggled to feed themselves. “Coffee and maize are sensitive to temperature and rainfall changes,” said Albro. “If a coffee crop fails you can’t just turn on a dime and do something else, it takes a long time to recover. There have been several lost crops in a row and it’s caused tremendous hardship for small-scale farming.” Farmers first migrate to urban areas, where they confront a new set of problems, which in turn prompt them to consider an international odyssey. “There’s an internal movement where someone will go to, say, Guatemala City and then perhaps get extorted by a gang and then move to the US,” said Leutert. “When they get here they will say they’ve moved because of violence – but climate change was the exacerbating factor.” More than 50,000 Guatemalan families were apprehended trying to cross the US border in the year to October, double the number of the previous year, according to US Customs and Border Protection. People move for a tangle of different reasons, and climate change’s influence is often far-reaching and yet hard to measure, but the World Bank estimates that warming temperatures and extreme weather will force an estimated 3.9 million climate migrants to flee Central America over the next 30 years. This mass movement of people risks destabilising their home countries and presents a challenge for destinations such as the US. The 1951 UN refugee convention sets out clear criteria for the granting of asylum, such as persecution and war, but climate change is not on the list. With an estimated 150 million to 300 million climate refugees set to be displaced worldwide by 2050, a new international framework will be needed to accommodate them. “If your farm has been dried to a crisp or your home has been inundated with water and you’re fleeing for your life, you’re not much different from any other refugee,” said Michael Doyle, an international relations scholar at Columbia University. “The problem is that other refugees fleeing war qualify for that status, while you don’t.” Doyle is part of a group of academics and advocates pushing for a new treaty that would focus on the needs of displaced people, rather than their exact reason for leaving, in order to cover the expected wave of climate migrants. Any reform of the landmark refugee agreement is “quite unlikely at present”, Doyle said, due to the complexity of such a new arrangement, as well as the rise of nationalist governments in places such as the US. “The president of the US is using migrant caravans as a political wedge issue as a way to get elected,” Doyle said. “If we reopen the 1951 convention, it’s more likely to be weakened than strengthened. We aren’t in a state where reforms, however sensible, can be made. There just isn’t the global statesmanship at the moment, nowhere near it.”"
"As Mexico City wakes up on any given weekday, most of its citizens participate in a familiar, survival-of-the-fittest routine: commuting in the car-dependent megapolis. It is one of honking, tire-screeching, yelling chilango curses out of sedan windows and, more recently, glimpsing occasional plants among the sea of grey concrete. The Via Verde project has focused on “turning Mexico City’s grey to green” through the construction of vertical gardens on columns along the Periférico highway, which rings the central city. The photogenic plants climbing up the freeway barriers have featured in countless videos in the local and international media, and often referenced as a sign of the polluted city’s changing priorities.  However, a small but vocal group of activists argues that the government’s support for Via Verde indicates its willingness to double-down on car culture in a city that is already choked with traffic and smog. The “greening” of the highway is simply making car ownership marginally more pleasant, they say. “In Mexico City, almost all of our local pollution and mobility problems can be attributed to the excessive use of private cars,” says Sergio Andrade-Ochoa, public health coordinator for the NGO Liga Peatonal. “We could just plant trees, but there’s a political fear of limiting the space in the city that is currently devoted to cars.” The idea for Via Verde emerged in 2016, when architect Fernando Ortiz Monasterio of the firm Verde Vertical started a Change.org petition to gauge public support. The petition outlines specific goals: promising to “produce enough oxygen for more than 25,000 residents, filter more than 27,000 tonnes of harmful gas yearly, capture more than 5,000kg of dust, and process more than 10,000kg of heavy metals”. The petition also assured supporters of the project’s minimal impact: the vertical garden technology does not jeopardise a wall’s structural integrity, while drip irrigation uses rainwater and other non-potable sources. Monasterio’s friend, the actor Luis Gerardo Méndez, helped publicise the petition and it quickly amassed the 80,000 signatures needed to attract government attention. Verde Vertical was approved. “All these groups were involved in revising this citizen proposal because it sounded like something that would do Mexico City good,” said the former head of Mexico City’s government, Miguel Ángel Mancera Espinosa, in 2016. “Via Verde could simultaneously change the look of the city and help us meet today’s biggest commitment: the fight against climate change.” When it came to funding, Verde Vertical also looked to public opinion. Organisers conducted a survey with various options for funding: government funding via taxes, citizen funding via donations to a public trust, or private funding via corporations (with the qualification that 10% of the columns would be used for corporate advertisement). Private funding won, with almost 47% of the 2,440 votes. Subsequently, a group of eligible corporations invested the 300 million pesos (£12m) needed. Construction on greening the 1,000 concrete columns began later in 2016 and, so far the plants are thriving. Monasterio, sitting at the window of his office overlooking the Via Verde, is pleased with the way things have worked out: “I’m a capitalist-environmentalist,” he says with a laugh. Others, however, are less pleased. The Liga Peatonal says the project has failed to live up to its environmental promises. In a pointed comment piece on the online news site Animal Politico, Juan Manuel Berdeja and Sergio Andrade Ochoa reminded residents that improving air quality and combatting climate change are not the same thing. While plants are crucial for combating climate change, using plants to mitigate air pollution through the process of phytoremediation – changing carbon into oxygen – is more complex. Only a few species have the capacity to purify the air in the way that the Via Verde petition indicated, and the succulents and other plants Verde Vertical favours for their low maintenance needs are not among them. The current Via Verde website has no mention of local anti-pollution benefits, and Monasterio acknowledges that the carbon reduction impact of the project is negligible. Roberto Remes of the city’s Autoridad del Espacio Público says that meeting greenhouse gas and local emissions goals was “never the intention”. One graphic illustrates that building a single Via Verde column costs the same as planting 300 trees. In a city with a deficit of green space, it is a powerful image. While Via Verde is privately funded, it is an effort that the government has eagerly co-signed. The Liga Peatonal is among several activists groups who believe the project is a facelift that distracts from other, less-sustainable actions that the city has recently taken. “There has been a lot of hypocrisy within the government,” says Ochoa. “They celebrate this Via Verde as the project that’s going to create a garden within the city, then they chop down more than 3,000 trees to construct the Mixcoac interchange [recently completed in the south of the city]. “The idea of turning a grey city green feels good to its inhabitants. But in reality it’s just aesthetics. At the end of the day, it’s not going to change the city.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
"A piece of the United States has been dramatically wiped off the map after an island in Hawaii was washed away by a powerful hurricane. East Island, a remote spit of gravel and sand that sat atop a coral reef, has vanished after having this misfortune to come into contact with Hurricane Walaka, an intense storm that surged past Hawaii earlier this month. Scientists have confirmed the disappearance of the 11-acre island after comparing satellite images of the surrounding French Frigate Shoals, part of an enormous protected marine area in the north-western Hawaiian Islands. “I uttered a swear word. I had a ‘holy cow!’ moment, somewhat in disbelief that it had disappeared,” said Chip Fletcher, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Hawaii. Fletcher and his colleagues were in the process of researching East Island through drone videos and taking samples of sand and corals to ascertain the age of the island and gauge its future prospects in the face of climate change. “The island was probably one to two thousand years old and we were only there in July, so for it to be lost right now is pretty bad luck,” Fletcher said. “We wanted to monitor the island so we are disappointed it has gone, but on the other hand we have learned these islands are far more at risk than we thought. I thought the island would be around for a decade or two longer, but it’s far more fragile than I appreciated. The top, middle and bottom of it has gone.” East Island was, at about half a mile long and 400ft wide, the second largest island in the the French Frigate Shoals, an atoll in the far western reaches of the Hawaiian archipelago. Until 1952, it hosted a US Coast Guard radar station. Despite its size, the island played an important role for wildlife, including the critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal, a species that numbers just 1,400 individuals, with many of the seals raising their young on East Island. Green sea turtles, which are also threatened, and seabirds such as albatrosses, which often had their young preyed upon by circling tiger sharks, also depended on the island. “The loss is a huge blow,” Fletcher said. “Little did we know it could disappear so quickly.” If conditions align, an atoll would always be at a small risk of being erased by a powerful hurricane. But climate change is causing the ocean and atmosphere to warm, making storms fiercer, while there’s evidence that hurricanes are moving further north into the latitudes where East Island once lay. Rising sea levels are also eroding away low-lying islands, with several fragments of land in the Pacific vanishing in recent years. “The take-home message is climate change is real and it’s happening now,” Randy Kosaki, a senior official for the Hawaii monument at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told Honolulu Civil Beat, which first reported the disappearance of East Island. “It’s not a hoax propagated in China as some folks have said.” The French Frigate Shoals sits in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, which became the largest marine reserve in the world when expanded by the Obama administration in 2016. The 1,350-mile string of coral islands, seamounts and shoals feature a riot of life, including coral, fish, birds and mammals, many unique to Hawaii.A statement by the federal managers of the monument said that East Island “appears to be under water”, while the neighboring Tern island had its shape altered by the hurricane. “Monument co-managers are working to better understand the implications for cultural resources and wildlife, protected species and their habitat within the Monument,” the statement added. “We will continue to monitor the species and islands to better assess the impacts from the hurricane. Based on the data, managers will determine next steps and management actions.”"
"Unless every poll is wildly wrong, Brazil will probably elect a racist, sexist, homophobic advocate of torture at the end of this month. The former army captain Jair Bolsonaro nearly won outright in the first round, securing the votes of almost 50 million people – despite his extreme views being well known. What is less well understood, however, is the catastrophic environment implications of his rise to the brink of power. And in this, Bolsonaro is not unique: around the world, diminishing resources are fuelling a global rise of authoritarian leaders dedicated to doing the bidding of some of the world’s most environmentally damaging interests.  The Brazilian election results were announced on 8 October – just as climate scientists were issuing their most dramatic warning yet that humanity has just 12 years to slash emissions or suffer the consequences of dangerous global warming. If countries do not start planting trees and cutting fossil fuels now, they said, then it will be impossible to prevent a rise of more than 0.5C, which would completely eradicate all of the world’s corals and irreversibly disrupt weather systems, bringing droughts, floods and extreme heat that will push hundreds of millions into poverty. History tells us that when environments deteriorate, societies turn to supposed strongmen and religious zealots rather than smart, pragmatic leaders. That is happening now. In addition to the dictatorships of China, Russia and Saudi Arabia, a growing number of young democracies have relapsed into authoritarianism: the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Egypt under Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and next, it would seem, Brazil under Bolsonaro. And underlying this is environmental stress, which has been building for over two centuries. Starting in Britain, the carbon-capitalist industrial model has long been extracting minerals and organic resources, and discharging the waste into the air, sea and land. As more nations developed, they exported their environmental stress to the next country rising up the economic ladder. Now that this paradigm is being replicated by the world’s most populous country, China, there are very few places left to absorb the impact. Competition for what is left is growing. So is violence and extremism. Centre-ground politicians who once talked chummily about “win-win solutions” have been pushed to the sidelines. No one believes this any more. Voters may not see this in environmental terms, but consciously or subconsciously they know something is broken, that tinkering is no longer enough. In the US, with massive support from the fossil-fuel industry, Donald Trump has undermined the Environmental Protection Agency, opened up swaths of national parks to industry, cut pollution controls and promised to pull out of the Paris accord. In Australia, Malcolm Turnbull was ejected from power by his colleagues because he tried to fulfil promises to cut carbon emissions. And now in Brazil, voters are backing a politician who has vowed to pull his country out of the Paris deal, abolish the main government agency tackling deforestation and end the demarcation of indigenous land. Bolsonaro has the backing of agribusiness and mining leaders, who are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of an Amazon denuded of its greatest protections. The markets – which are heavily driven by extractive industries – also love him. The main stock index and exchange rate of the Brazilian real spiked after his first round win. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal endorsed him as a “conservative populist”. Such neo-fascist politicians should not be blithely dismissed. They are the hired guns of the industries working against the Paris accord and other international agreements that aim to prevent further environmental catastrophes, which hit the poorest hardest. Their “anti-globalism” is first and foremost anti-nature and anti-future. An extraction-first approach may bring economic benefits in the short term, as cronies and campaign donors clear more forests, open up plantations and dig more mines – but the profits are concentrated while the environmental stress is shared. The great fear climate scientists have is that a warming planet could create feedback loops that will make everything much worse. But there has not been enough study of economic and political feedback loops. How drought in China puts pressure on the Amazon to produce more food and clear more forest. Or how powerful business interests will choose a dictator over a democrat if it means easing environmental controls that threaten their ability to meet quarterly growth targets. We are already seeing a widening gap between politicians and scientists. While the latter urge more ambitious climate action, the former know they will receive more campaign funds if they oppose emissions cuts, support extractive industries and weaken pollution regulations. It is not just dictatorships. Britain is pushing ahead with fracking, Germany with coal and Norway with oil exploration. At some point, voters will realise that ecological stress is at the core of the world’s current woes. The aha! moment may be when water grows prohibitively expensive, or crops fail owing to successive heatwaves, or the refugee crisis sparks war, but at some point the weakness of the strongmen will be apparent, and people will seek change. The danger is, by then it may be too late. Climate and politics alike will have passed a tipping point, leading to social chaos and the morphing of populists into full-blown dictators-for-life. That is not yet inevitable, but the risks are growing. What has become clearer than ever is that the best way to avoid climate and ecological collapse is by voting for leaders who make this a priority. It will be impossible to fix the economy unless you first fix the environment. The global instinct for radical change is right, but unless that is geared towards ecological rebuilding the world’s democracies may go extinct before the corals do. • Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor"

"The Australian government has appointed marine scientist Ian Poiner as the new chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, days after a dire new forecast for coral bleaching was issued. The appointment to the authority, which manages the reef and advises the government on its care, also comes months after the government granted $443m in reef funding to the private Great Barrier Reef Foundation instead of key agencies including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.  Another round of mass coral bleaching caused by heat stress has been forecast for the reef this summer by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Poiner is a former chief executive of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the current chairman of the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre (RRRC). He will take over from the outgoing chair and chief executive, Russell Reichelt. The RRRC has been the subject of controversy recently over its management of crown-of-thorns starfish projects on the Great Barrier Reef. “Dr Poiner is a highly respected marine scientist with international science credentials and board leadership experience,” the environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Monday. “He has a long history of involvement in Great Barrier Reef science and conservation, and is a former CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. I have no doubt he will make a significant contribution to the continued health and resilience of the reef.” Price said Poiner had resigned from his position as the chair of the RRRC. The announcement also follows recent calls for improved governance at Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority after the board member Margie McKenzie agreed to resign over potential conflicts of interest in relation to $20m in tenders managed by the body. Poiner said on Monday the authority played an important role in ensuring the reef was protected “by managing the delicate balance between conservation and sustainable use”. “As a scientist, and through my involvement in other science organisations, I have a strong interest in reef health and management and look forward to working with fellow board members,” he said. “I’m particularly interested in how threats are impacting the Great Barrier Reef and what actions can be taken to improve its resilience, which is a key focus of the Marine Park Authority’s work.” The Australian Marine Conservation Society welcomed the appointment but called on Poiner to take an “aggressive conservation stance” on behalf of the reef. “His most urgent and important task is to call on the federal government to undertake rapid and far-reaching action to tackle climate change to protect the future of the Great Barrier Reef,” Imogen Zethoven, the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Great Barrier Reef campaign director said. “We urge Dr Poiner to tell the minister for environment, Melissa Price, that we stand to lose the reef unless the federal government rules out any new thermal coalmines including Adani’s Carmichael mine and switches rapidly to renewable energy in the next decade.” Poiner has been appointed under new governance arrangements for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which were recommended after an independent review of the authority last year and took effect on Monday. Among the recommendations were that the position of chair and chief executive of the authority be separated and that the authority’s board should comprise seven members. The review said this should include a CEO and a part-time chair “of integrity, national credibility and standing who would not be perceived as representing a reef interest group”. The government accepted all of the review’s 24 recommendations. Reichelt has led the authority for 11 years. “Dr Reichelt is an outstanding scientist and marine park manager,” Price said. “He has successfully managed the world renowned Great Barrier Reef marine park over a time of significant environmental challenges and has implemented many substantial measures to improve the management of this world famous icon.”"
"Climate change is already exacerbating domestic and international conflicts, and governments must take steps to ensure it does not get worse, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has said. Peter Maurer told Guardian Australia it was already making an impact and humanitarian organisations were having to factor it into their work far earlier than they were expecting.  “In many parts of the world where we work it’s not a distant engagement,” he said. “When I think about our engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, in Somalia, in other places of the world, I see that climate change has already had a massive impact on population movement, on fertility of land. It’s moving the border between pastoralist and agriculturalist.” Maurer, who was in Australia to speak about the changing nature of modern conflict, said concern about the impact of climate change in the Pacific was “enormous”. He said changing rainfall patterns change the fertility of land and push populations, who may have settled and subsisted in one area for centuries, to migrate. “It’s very obvious that some of the violence that we are observing … is directly linked to the impact of climate change and changing rainfall patterns.” Earlier this month the United Nation’s climate panel, the IPCC, gave the world just 12 years to make the drastic but necessary changes. Its report said emissions had to be cut by 45% before 2030 if warming was to be restricted to 1.5C. At 1.5C, 10 million fewer people would be affected by rising sea levels, and the proportion of the world’s population exposed to water stress could be 50% lower. A 2016 study, which examined three decades of data, determined that a 1C rise in temperatures in a country reliant on agriculture correlated with a 5% increase in migration to other countries. “When [populations] start to migrate in big numbers it leads to tensions between the migrating communities and the local communities. This is very visible in contexts like the Central African Republic, like Mali and other places,” said Maurer. He said it was up to governments, not humanitarians, to develop the policies needed to deal with the “root causes” of climate change. “As a humanitarian I am used to political decisions … never [being] as fast as we hope for them, or as generous or as big, but it’s encouraging an increasing number are recognising the importance of the issue and are taking steps to reduce the impact of climate change on our habitat – the Paris Agreement is an important step forward,” he said. “For us we hope the international community will soon enough take necessary steps, so at the end of the day they won’t have to pay by increasing humanitarian impacts which, again, we already see in other conflicts.” Donald Trump said little about the IPCC report, having already pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement. This made things difficult for everyone else, Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s environment minister, said last month, but still called for countries to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation. The Australian government largely dismissed the IPCC report and its recommendations – which included the rapid phase out of coal – as well as the pleas of Pacific Island nations. Australia has no formal energy or climate change policy, and the Coalition government at one point flagged pulling out of the Paris Agreement. MPs and ministers maintain that Australia is on track to meet emissions reductions targets, despite official government figures on emissions suggesting Australia will not, according to current projections. On Sunday Australia’s treasurer and former energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, rejected the suggestion it should get his government rethink its policies. He said the government did not intend to “reduce emissions at the expense of people’s power bills”. Anote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, was in Australia this week advocating for action. “It’s not about the marginal rise in price or reduction in price of energy, it’s about lives, it’s about the future,” he told Guardian Australia. Maurer said there were now more people displaced than ever before, approaching 70m across the globe. Two thirds are displaced internally, and most of those who fled would go to a neighbouring country. “At the end of the day there is no single policy that allows in any satisfactory way a response to these issues, but there are multiple things which can be done,” he said."
"When I saw the government’s latest energy policy proposal, I was disappointed but not surprised. Just a few weeks ago I was speaking with a few utilities analysts and players, wargaming the absolute worst thing a party with just a few months to live could do to Australia’s energy policy and how far they could roll back some commendable progress to date.  What we came up with revolved around the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommendations. They were very sensible but we figured they had substantial scope for selective and perverse implementation. At one point, we joked about the possibility that this good advice could be turned into a policy to subsidise companies that own coal plants and coal. Turns out that is exactly what has happened. It’s worth starting with the original ACCC recommendations and how and why the regulator was trying to achieve greater competition in wholesale electricity markets. The ACCC had opposed the sale of New South Wales’s generation assets to AGL in 2014 over concerns about what it would do to competition. With the benefit of hindsight most would now agree they were absolutely correct in doing so. Their suggestions about limiting further concentration in the market were sound and had precedents elsewhere. The proposed changes to the market operation rules were positive and so was the suggestion that some kind of settled policy to reduce greenhouse emissions would be helpful. And then there was recommendation four, which in essence said the government should offer to underwrite new generation projects by promising to guarantee contracts in their later years at a fixed rate – an idea designed to make it easier for new players to enter a heavily concentrated market. The problem with power markets in general, much like any portfolio, is that diversification reduces risk and to be diversified you have to be very large. As with other capital-intensive businesses it is a hard sector to enter without the capacity to borrow. After a decade or more of climate chaos, a carbon tax and a renewable energy target that has had a few near death experiences in the Senate, Australian banks quite rightly look at lending to this sector with some trepidation compared to other markets. Not losing money does not just depend on the laws of supply and demand but the utterly chaotic behaviour of our politicians. It has gotten so awful that it has earned rebuke from that hotbed of socialism, the Australian Industry Group. On that basis having the government break the deadlock to get more capacity built and ensure some peaking assets are held by someone other than the usual gentailer suspects makes a great deal of sense. So what has the Morrison government’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, done with those largely sensible suggestions to come up with this perverse policy? First, he set a comically low emissions hurdle, apparently suggesting that a project is fine so long as, on its own, it won’t lead to an increase over the emissions target by 2030. This is disingenuous. No single project is likely to do this unless someone is building a very large brown coal power plant. Essentially, it means there is no emissions component to this plan, in direct conflict with ACCC suggestions. Second, it allows redevelopment of existing projects, to extend their life. Which could these be? It is unlikely to be AGL, Origin, Alinta or Energy Australia, who all have commitments to decarbonisation and plans to gradually replace coal with renewables, gas and hydro. It could, however, be Sunset Power owned by Brian Flannery and former National party candidate and LNP donor Trevor St Baker. Third, the divestment proposal would appear to be designed to compel AGL to sell Liddell. St Baker has previously expressed a strong interest in this asset, and he could now also be eligible for a generous loan and off-take agreement from the government. This is a far cry from the ACCC suggestion that getting simple gas turbines in a box and more wind and solar to more players would be a better approach to increasing competition. And the most disturbing thing about current policy is that it is market intervention to the direct benefit of only some apparently favoured players. The sooner this ends – or the government ends – the sooner Australians can look forward to a cessation of this wholesale assault on free markets with integrity, which I vaguely recall were once what the Liberal party stood for."
"One of the classic moments in the Simpsons comes when the venal TV anchorman Kent Brockman sees on his screen an ant crawling across a lens and assumes at once that this is not a negligible terrestrial arthropod but a giant alien descending from space that will become one of “our new insect overlords”, a species to which he instantly and publicly pledges allegiance. The joke hinges on the idea that in real life ants are inconsequential compared with human beings. The world, we feel, could get on perfectly well without them, and still better without mosquitoes or any number of other creepy crawlies. This confidence is quite as mistaken as Kent Brockman’s grovellings. Insects form the greatest part of animal life on Earth, and almost every other kind of animal depends on them – directly or indirectly. They pollinate plants and nourish animals, especially birds. In turn, everything that relies on these plants or animals depends on the insects. And the whole intricate web of interdependent exploitation is collapsing, and has been for decades. We ourselves are part of this web, in the long run quite as much dependent as exploitative.  On the island of Puerto Rico, a rainforest preserved for centuries from human intervention shows a terrifying drop in the abundance and variety of insects. Forty years ago, there were 60 times as many insects on the forest floor as can be trapped today. The bird and lizard species that feed on insects have also been hit, if not to the same extent, falling by between a third and a half over the same period. The same trend is apparent in German nature reserves, where the number of insects appears to have dropped by about 75%; and these are results from places deliberately preserved, so far as possible, from human intervention. The collapse of insect life is obvious to anyone who looks in Britain – butterflies, bees and even the millions of chironomid midges that used to form plumes like smoke around the trees along the shores of reservoirs are all now mostly a memory. Car windscreens and headlights are no longer thickly speckled after any long journey. The causes of this global decline seem to vary with latitude. But they are all, in one way or another, the product of human activity. In the temperate regions insect populations are more adaptable to fluctuations in temperature, but insects must contend with the mass use of pesticides across the bleak monocultures of industrial agriculture, as well as the generalised pollution of the air and water. In the rainforest, where the pattern of losses across species and over time shows that there must be some single vast factor acting on the whole ecosystem, it appears that the main driver is simply the climate catastrophe. The consequences of this collapse lend still more urgency to political efforts to slow and eventually halt climate change; but even as individuals we can follow Candide’s advice and cultivate our gardens so insects can thrive there."

"Uber will charge its customers in London an extra 15p per mile on every trip to help its drivers buy electric cars. The ride-hailing app hopes to create a £200m fund from the levy to encourage almost half of its 45,000 drivers to use fully electric vehicles by 2021. The firm hopes its London fleet will be fully electric by 2025.  Uber said the clean air fee would mean an extra 45p on the average three-mile trip in the capital, on top of normal fares, but every penny would go towards helping drivers upgrade their vehicles or other green initiatives should that money not be used. The fund was announced as part of a clean air plan, as Uber continues its efforts to prove itself to Transport for London after it initially  decided not to renew its licence to operate   last year. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said the initiative, a world first for the company, showed it was committed to being a strong partner in the capital. “It represents our wanting our partnership in London not only to be a strong partnership but trailblazing in solving air pollution, which every great city in the world is struggling with, and our mayor here in London is looking to improve,” he said. However, Khosrowshahi said Uber would continue to resist proposals to make its drivers liable for London’s congestion charge, unless black cabs were also forced to pay. Under Uber’s new scheme, each driver will in effect have their own savings account towards the purchase of an electrical vehicle, based on the number of miles driven. A driver using Uber’s app for an average of 40 hours per week could expect to save about £3,000 towards a new electric vehicle in two years. Uber said it was in talks with manufacturers to negotiate prices and ensure supply, as well as to home vehicle charging suppliers. Khosrowshahi said: “You’re going to see many initiatives but what it adds up to is us moving from being a simple ride-sharing service to transforming to an on-demand mobility service. We ultimately want to be that go-to mobility platform – whether you’re going to move with the car or a bike or ultimately a bus or the tube service. All this is aimed at eventually replacing car ownership itself. “Cars are unused 95% of the time and take up enormous amounts of space, in parking etc – we want to give that space back to the city.” Uber is also offering a diesel scrappage bonus of £1,500 in credit for its app to the first 1,000 people in London to scrap a pre-Euro 4 diesel vehicle. Khosrowshahi said: “It’s our goal to help people replace their car with their phone by offering a range of mobility options – whether cars, bikes, scooters or public transport – all in the Uber app.” The chief executive said he was confident most drivers would take up the chance to spend their clean air fee savings on a new electric vehicle, but the fund would otherwise be used for other green schemes. “We won’t bank it.” The IWGB union, which represents private hire drivers, said: “We are very concerned that this latest PR move from Uber will lure drivers deeper into debt, as they struggle to finance expensive vehicles on below minimum wage income. The answer to London’s growing congestion and pollution problem is for the government and the mayor to resolutely commit to capping minicab numbers in London. “Drivers have long ago given up on Uber to do the right thing and that is why so many will be joining our march next week with other precarious workers, as we get ready to face down yet another appeal from Uber on the worker rights case we already won on two occasions.” The UK government has just slashed its grants for electric vehicles from £4,500 to £3,500 and abolished support for new hybrids, which many Uber drivers use."
"Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, Canada will implement a revenue-neutral carbon tax starting in 2019, fulfilling a campaign pledge he made in 2015. Starting next spring, it’ll no longer be free to pollute in Canada. We’re putting a price on pollution in provinces that don’t yet have a plan to fight climate change. More on our plan to cut pollution, grow the economy & create jobs: https://t.co/VjCNOOKLVB #EnvironmentEconomy pic.twitter.com/b4wFc17Qte  The federal carbon pollution price will start low at $20 per ton in 2019, rising at $10 per ton per year until reaching $50 per ton in 2022. The carbon tax will stay at that level unless the legislation is revisited and revised. This is a somewhat modest carbon tax – after all, the social cost of carbon is many times higher – but it’s a higher carbon price than has been implemented in most countries. Moreover, a carbon tax doesn’t necessarily have to reflect the social cost of carbon. The question is whether it will be sufficiently high to meet the country’s climate targets. The Preamble in the Act is worth reading. It begins by noting “there is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change” (this is somewhat understated – carbon pollution is the dominant factor). It also notes that Canada is already feeling the impacts of climate change through factors like “coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security.” The Preamble also notes that in 1992, Canada signed the UNFCCC whose objectives include “the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,” and that Canada ratified the Paris Agreement, whose aims include limiting global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. Canada’s Paris commitment requires cutting its carbon pollution by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Prior to the implementation of the carbon tax, its policies were rated Highly Insufficient to meet that goal. Instead Canada’s emissions were on track to fall only about 4% below 2005 levels by 2030. So, the carbon tax is an important policy to close that gap. Several Canadian provinces have already implemented or plan to implement carbon pricing systems. British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec already have such systems in place; the Canadian government noted that these provinces were “among the top performers in GDP growth across Canada in 2017.” Provinces whose carbon prices meet the federal standards are already in compliance, so the new law won’t apply to them. Several other provinces (Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) have planned or proposed carbon pricing systems that will meet the federal requirements. The federal carbon tax will be applied to the remaining provinces. A $20/ton carbon tax translates into a 16.6 cent per gallon surcharge on gasoline. So, in 2022, the $50/ton carbon tax will increase Canadian gasoline prices by about 42 cents per gallon (11 cents per liter). For comparison, the average price of gasoline in Canada is $1.43 per liter, so that would be about an 8% gasoline price increase in 2022. The price of coal would more than double, with a carbon tax surcharge of about $100 per ton in 2022. Natural gas prices will rise by about 10 cents per cubic meter in 2022 compared to current prices of around 13 cents per cubic meter – about a 75% increase. This will increase demand for cheaper carbon-free electricity. However, Canada already supplies about 60% of its electricity through hydroelectric generation and 16% from nuclear – only about 20–25% comes from fossil fuels. For that reason, only 11% of Canada’s carbon pollution comes from generating electricity. The industrial sector is responsible for the biggest chunk of Canadian carbon pollution (40%). It will not be subjected to the carbon tax, but rather to an Output-Based Allocations system (similar to cap and trade). One key component of the federal carbon tax is that it’s revenue-neutral, similar to the policy proposal from Citizens’ Climate Lobby. All the taxed money will be distributed back to the provinces from which they were generated. The provinces will in turn rebate about 90% the revenues back to individual taxpayers. The rebates are anticipated to exceed the increased energy costs for about 70% of Canadian households. For example, a Manitoba family will receive a $336 rebate in 2019 compared to its increased costs of $232. A similar family in Saskatchewan will receive $598 compared to its higher costs of $403. In Ontario, families will receive $300 to offset its $244 in carbon taxes. And in New Brunswick a $248 rebate more than offsets the average household cost of $202. The rebates will more than double by 2022 as the carbon tax rises, and the net financial benefit to households will grow over time. 6. And more most households, rebates will larger than their carbon pricing costs. Households will see net gains. pic.twitter.com/ThfWoiXY85 The remaining 10% of the tax revenue will provide support to particularly affected sectors like schools, hospitals, small businesses, colleges, and indigenous communities. Diesel-fired electricity generation in remote communities and aviation fuel in the territories will receive full exemption from the carbon tax. The Canadian government recognizes that climate change impacts are expensive: Climate change has already had financial impacts on Canada, and these costs will only continue to grow. In 2016, it was estimated that larger and more intense weather events will cost the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements program around $902 million each year. The health costs of extreme weather are estimated to be over $1.6 billion a year. The cost of property damages from climate change averaged $405 million per year between 1983 and 2008, but have risen dramatically to $1.8 billion a year since 2009. That number is expected to grow as high as $43 billion by 2050. It would be cheaper to reduce those costs by slowing global warming than to pay for increasingly extreme weather damages. With this carbon tax, Canada is recognizing that reality, and in fact is offsetting the financial impact on its taxpayers by returning the revenue to households. This is an approach that studies have shown can boost the economy because disposable income rises due to the rebate exceeding increased energy costs for 70% of Canadians. Justin Trudeau has shown great climate leadership in following through with this carbon tax. Hopefully Canadians will reward him in next year’s elections. Note: this will be our final entry on Climate Consensus - the 97%. The Guardian has decided to discontinue its Science and Environment blogging networks. We would like to thank this great paper for hosting us over the past five years, and to our readers for making it a worthwhile and rewarding endeavor."
"From the red soil of his hometown in the Western Australian outback town of Wiluna, Michael Jeffery very nearly became a farmer. He opted for being a soldier instead, serving in Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam, where he was awarded the Military Cross and the South Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. After a distinguished military career, he served as governor of his home state of Western Australia and governor general of Australia – who represents the Queen, Australia’s head of state.  So he doesn’t enter public debate lightly. But he is highly exercised by his latest topic: restoring Australia’s ancient soils. It was a world first when he was appointed by Julia Gillard’s Labor government as the first national soil advocate in 2012 and his term was extended under the former National party leader and agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. Since then he has consulted with thousands of farmers, Indigenous land managers, policy makers, students and interest groups across the country. It has taken six years but now he has a very simple message for politicians in his report, Restore the Soil: Prosper the Nation. Australia’s soil, water and vegetation should be declared national strategic assets. “The emerging concept of ‘soil security’ also underpins the world’s six existential challenges: food, water and energy security, climate change abatement, biodiversity protection and human health,” he wrote to the prime minister’s office. “I believe that soil and water security will increasingly underpin global social stability and security.” Some of the recommendations could be controversial for many of Australia’s conventional farmers. For example, Jeffery has urged governments to support farmers to embrace regenerative farming and cut back on agricultural chemical and non-organic fertiliser usage. He believes improving soil health could help draw down carbon to neutralise Australia’s emissions. He wants to see properly funded agricultural education for Australia’s farmers and agronomists as well as soil and water scientists – independent from companies with vested interests. He also wants farmers to be paid a fair price for food. “It’s a no-brainer, there should be no political dissension at all,” Jeffery tells Guardian Australia. “Who is going to knock restoring agricultural landscapes? It’s about what comes out of the soil, like clean water, all our food, timber and fibre at a time when the planet, due to over population and bad agricultural methods is destroying it hand over fist.” Jeffery says improving soil health has the potential to neutralise Australia’s annual emissions of 600m tonnes of CO2 and would allow a more orderly transition to renewable energy sources. “The real fact is undeniable, our country [has] continued to lose carbon due to poor soil and water management,” Jeffery says. “If we don’t go to regenerative agriculture, we will continue to mine soils, particularly of carbon. This is the great loss and it is not being admitted. If you continue to mine carbon, you are shot. “It’s not the total measurement of soil health but it’s a good indicator and it facilitates the retention of water in soil – 50% of our rain is not getting into the soil and that is causing so much of the problem.” “If we get agriculture right, we could pull down as much carbon as we are emitting.” Jeffery’s intervention comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that half a degree of extra warming will affect hundreds of millions of people and called for a transition out of coal power by 2050. The Australian federal government has rejected that call. The deputy prime minister and leader of the National party, Michael McCormack, has said Australia should continue to exploit its coal reserves as his farmer-based constituency suffers through a drought which in some parts of the country has continued for seven years. Jeffery’s policy calls for “reducing or ceasing synthetic chemical inputs” as debate rages in Australia around the use of the common weed killer glyphosate following a US ruling which found it caused the cancer of a terminally ill man. The president of the National Farmers Federation, Fiona Simson, says glyphosate had allowed farmers to embrace minimum tillage cropping systems, which she described as “one of the greatest advancements in agricultural sustainability in recent decades”. Simson says more than 800 scientific studies and reviews, including numerous independent regulatory safety assessments, have affirmed glyphosate is safe and does not cause cancer. She said the product had also been approved for use by every regulator across the world including the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority since 1974. “By managing weeds above the ground, farmers can plough their fields less often – reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining soil health and soil moisture,” Simson said. But Jeffery says the debate over glyphosate, sold under brand names such as Round Up, reflect the need for independent government-funded research and education. “We need independent research separate to that conducted by chemical companies. That’s why you need government-run research stations, in my opinion, with properly trained agricultural scientists,” he says. “We ought to know if it is good, bad, indifferent, OK in little bits.” “If it is causing problems and people are being dishonest then there should be all hell to pay. It is a little like the banks doing things improperly while knowing it. I suspect, in part, if there are companies who do this, they may have to be held accountable for what they have done.” Jeffery also urges consumers and major supermarket chains such as Coles and Woolworths to accept that farmers need to be paid a fair price for food. He described $1 a litre milk as “patently stupid”. “A builder or a plumber or a doctor doesn’t get paid like farmers,” he says. “When Coles says we are driving prices down, in some cases what it does mean is they are helping drive farmers to bankruptcy.” As the drought bites harder in the eastern Australian states, Jeffery says the combined effects of climate change, water mismanagement and land degradation means that looking after Australia’s agricultural soils is essential for the nation’s security. Jeffery has made 10 recommendations, which the government confirmed were under “active consideration”, with the “fundamental aim of restoring and maintaining the health of the Australian agricultural landscape”. They include a national soils policy with a permanent soil advocate, better education for farmers and agricultural scientists, a mandated school garden program and syllabus, funding for case studies in regenerative agriculture, funding for regenerative farm works via Landcare and an annual report on the global state of soil, water and food from an Australian perspective. The policy defines regenerative agriculture as “the application of techniques which seek to restore landscape function and deliver outcomes that include sustainable production”. This could include using more organic composts and fertilisers, slowing the flow of water, fencing off waterways from stock, cell grazing, feral animal control and direct-drilling crops into pasture. Jeffery said support could come in the form of tax deductions for regenerative farmers or the government part-funding regenerative work. “The object is to convince the average conventional farmer to change without being frightened, to show how you can go through a regenerative process and still be economically viable,” Jeffery says. “Farmers can’t do this by themselves, they need the support of government and the public to be the cleanest and greenest they can be.” He said current education programs available were “generally not satisfactory”. The policy states “there is a dearth of information in many areas, and product placement information only in others. Often the advice given is contradictory to best practice or considered by many farmers to be out of date.” Jeffery said government funded research stations were “stressed and stretched” when there needed to be more fully staffed stations where farmers could access the best advice from agronomists, water scientists and soil scientists “who are properly trained”. “That’s part of the problem, for example, the agronomists are often owned by a chemical company, so of course they are going to say you need more of our product.” While elements of regenerative farming have been practised in Australia for decades, it has recently gained more mainstream attention, partly due to the work of Australian scientist and farmer Charlie Massy, who has been critical of “industrial agriculture”. Jeffery said while farming practices have changed over the years, he would like to see a stocktake of farming methods. “I do not criticise industrial agriculture per se because it helped to make Australia a wealthy country,” he said. “[Farmers] did what they had to do at the time with the education they had.” With better agricultural education, Jeffery believes Australia should play a leading role in showing the rest of the world how to manage inherently infertile soils in a difficult climate while building land management knowledge to export along with food. “If we doubled our exports tomorrow, we could feed 60 to 80 million people, but if we exported knowledge, we might help to build feed a billion people,” he says. At 80, his passion for the project is clear. “I was always interested in farming and nearly became a farmer, but I think about our 10 grandchildren, whose lives I’m concerned about in that sense, and their parents and all our children.”"

"Most of the recent worries over the spread of propaganda have concentrated on the use of social media: WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all been rightly criticised for their use in spreading misinformation. Less attention, perhaps, has been given to the content of the messages and the strategy behind their use. The template for many modern campaigns of disinformation was invented by the tobacco industry as it fought against the mounting evidence that it was selling a product that killed its users. The “tobacco strategy” as researchers christened it, relied less on outright lies than on confusion and irrelevant truths. For example, the tobacco industry funded first-class research into the harmful effects of asbestos to produce the impression that all kinds of things gave you cancer – so why worry about the ones that give pleasure as well?  Now this strategy has itself been scientifically examined, with disturbing results. Three philosophers of science, James Owen Weatherall, Cailin O’Connor and Justin Bruner, have modelled the ways in which scientific results can influence policymakers. They show that it is perfectly possible over time for almost all the policymakers to end up convinced of something that almost all the relevant experts believe is untrue. This is especially likely if there are propagandists operating for the wrong view and the science is difficult or disputed. This model fits the tobacco controversies very well, but it has obvious further applications – to climate change and perhaps to some political questions too. The fact that the science is difficult and the results disputed does not mean there isn’t a right and a wrong answer. Just because experts disagree in good faith does not mean that they are all equally likely to be right. Tobacco is in fact a lethal drug. The world is in fact warming very dangerously as a result of human actions. But the process by which scientists reach consensus on these matters is slow, and prone to misinterpretation from the outside. The paper shows that when neither the scientists nor the policymakers have access to all available research – which is true of all important questions – they rely on their social networks to sample the knowledge for them. This sample can be biased either at random or as the result of deliberate action. Propagandists for one side or another can present decision-makers with a flawed picture of the state of knowledge. This is much more effectively done – their models show – by omitting unhelpful results than by inventing helpful ones. The tobacco companies sponsored lots of research but only published the findings that helped their cause. Unscrupulous journalists may make this worse by withholding from their readers stories that spoil the picture they want to present. But even some non-partisan reporters may run into another danger. Attempts to present “both sides” of a question when there is no real dispute among experts can be just as deceptive as outright propaganda. Either way, the public is misled and the wrong decisions are made. This isn’t an easy problem. We need experts to make judgments about which problems are contested and which stories are significant, but what happens when these judgments are rejected? Reaching the truth demands a community of trust, and to build this is a project for everyone involved, not just for experts. Experts deserve to be believed because they are unlike the rest of us – they are in the relevant fields better at finding the truth. But in reality they will be believed only to the extent that they are seen to share our moral values and concerns."
"Progressive thinktanks and investor groups want the Australian government to model the economic effects climate change will have on Australia under 1.5C and 2C warming scenarios. This week the new Treasury secretary, Phil Gaetjens, told a Senate estimates hearing the department had done no modelling that compared the difference in economic impacts of 1.5C of warming and 2C. “We do not do modelling on that,” Gaetjens said. “There wouldn’t be any information in a quantitative sense that I could provide at the moment.” At the same time, in an open letter in the health journal the Lancet, 22 prominent scientists and health professionals have criticised the Australian government for dismissing the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent 1.5C report. “The Australian government’s contemptuous dismissal of the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including the panel’s recommendation to dramatically reduce coal power by 2050, is unacceptable,” the letter, published Thursday, states. Australian scientists and health professionals were dismayed at the government’s “ongoing stance to disregard the consensus of the world’s leading climate scientists” as well as “any idea of duty of care regarding the future wellbeing of Australians and our immediate neighbours”, the letter said. The authors include Prof Fiona Stanley and Nobel laureates Peter Doherty and Tilman Ruff. They say Australia is more exposed to the impacts of climate change than other OECD countries and the government “must commit immediately to embrace strategies of energy generation that do not put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere”. One of the letter’s authors, Prof Peter Sainsbury, said: “We were just horrified by the Australian government’s response to the report and that’s why we chose to write the letter. “Everyone who has been paying attention over the last 25 years knows climate change is an environmental issue but it is also a health issue. “The health implications, which are not well recognised, will be catastrophic.” Environment Minister Melissa Price said it was “absolutely false” to say the government had dismissed the findings of the IPCC report. “We have consistently stated that the IPCC is a trusted source of scientific advice that we will continue to take into account on climate policy,” she said. “The content of the report has been misrepresented. It is also imperative to understand this report makes no recommendations and is not policy prescriptive.” Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, who was one of the voices calling for economic modelling comparing 1.5C warming impacts to 2C impacts, said similar work was already being done in other jurisdictions, including by the Bank of England, and by China, New Zealand and many European jurisdictions. “Increasingly we’re seeing financial regulators in many jurisdictions are very active in looking at the economic implications of climate change,” she said. Herd said while the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission were actively looking at the potential impacts on entities they regulated, this work was not on an economy-wide scale. “Given the release of the 1.5-degree report, we would think this would be an area where Treasury would have a role to play,” she said. Richie Merzian, the director of the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program, said Treasury had modelled the impacts of different emissions reductions targets on Australia’s economy, but modelling of what the country would look like under different scenarios was lacking. “The Treasury has played a useful role in modelling the impact to the Australian economy of different climate action scenarios,” he said. “It has the capability of modelling the economic impacts of Australia under a 1.5, 2 or 3-degree world. All it’s missing is the political instruction from the government to do so.” In comments to Fairfax Media the environment minister, Melissa Price, said it was “absolutely false” to suggest the government had dismissed the IPCC’s findings. “We have consistently stated that the IPCC is a trusted source of scientific advice that we will continue to take into account on climate policy,” Price said. Guardian Australia approached Price and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, for comment."
"Farmers around here are itching to go after that amber wave of soya beans, but there was that 5in rain a couple of weeks ago and then a 7in rain, and it drives even the retired guys batty. Those beans aren’t worth much at the elevator thanks to a Trump trade war with China, but they’re worth even less getting wet feet in a pond that was a field which the glacier made a prairie bog some 14,000 years ago – until we came along and drained it.  This year, crops in north-west Iowa are looking spotty. Up into Minnesota they were battered by spring storms and late planting, and then inundated again in late summer. Where they aren’t washed out, they’re weedy or punky. If you go south in Buena Vista county, where I live in Storm Lake, the corn stands tall and firm. Welcome to climate change, Iowa-style. It’s the least debated issue of the midterm political season. The weather is the top topic of conversation at any cooperative elevator’s coffee table, along with the markets. Everyone knows that things have been changing in sweeping ways out here on the richest corn ground in the world. It’s drought in the spring and floods in the fall – what were considered 500-year floods in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines 30 years ago are now considered 100-year floods. Iowa has been getting soggier in spring and fall, with scary dry spells interspersed, and more humid at night by as much as a third since 1980. Everyone knows it has been getting wetter and weirder, especially Dr Gene Takle, a climate scientist at Iowa State University who contributed to reports for the Nobel peace prize-winning IPCC. Takle predicted 20 years ago the floods we see today, already linking it to climate change back then. Farmers just saw ponding and called the tiling company to install more. We’re on our way to doubling the size of the northern Iowa drainage system in the past 30 years as the upper midwest has grown more humid and extreme. This drainage system is delivering runoff rich in farm fertilizer to the Mississippi river complex and the Gulf of Mexico, where the nitrate from Iowa and Illinois corn fields is growing a dead zone the size of New Jersey. The shrimping industry is being deprived of oxygen so Iowa farmers can chase 200 bushels of corn per acre – and hope against hope that corn will somehow increase in price as we plow up every last acre. That flow also is creating a toxic source for Des Moines Water Works, which is facing up to $100m in improvements to remove agricultural chemicals from the Raccoon river that supplies 500,000 thirsty denizens. The waterworks sued our county over it, along with two others, but a federal judge threw out the case because you simply can’t sue an Iowa drainage district. And that means that there is no way to regulate agriculture as it responds to extreme weather and market consolidation that seeks immediate return. Meanwhile, those huge rainfalls on exposed black dirt wash it to the vales even from the flat ground of our neighborhood. We are losing soil at two to three tons an acre a year. Nature can regenerate the soil at only a half-ton a year. So we are washing our black gold down the river four to six times faster than we can regrow it. Because we have less soil, the corn and soya beans are starting to show it in lower protein in the kernel or pod. Corn is yielding higher starch content, notes agronomist Dr Rick Cruse of Iowa State. He adds that wheat production in China is falling because of degraded soil wrought by extreme weather and poor stewardship. It follows that overall corn yields, or at least relative value for the most-used crop in the world, will decline. Here, this year, we see it in variable crop yields from township to township. It is starting to factor into land prices, which is the foundational wealth of the upper midwest and especially in Iowa. The University of Minnesota forecasts, based on research at Nasa, that Iowa corn yields could drop in half within the next half-century because of extreme weather and soil depletion. Yet nobody is talking about it. We expect that the chemists and geneticists will handle it and keep those yields ramping up come hell or high water. Down in Kansas, they are resigned to the fact that the water will be gone sooner rather than later. The high plains are locked in drought. You used to run a calf on 40 acres of prairie grass; now it takes 100. Depending on the source, you will hear that the Ogallala Aquifer slaking the huge cattle feedlots from Amarillo to Dodge City will be drunk dry in as few as 20 years. It’s down 150 feet at Dodge City since 1950. The Ogallala can’t take much of a recharge there. And the demand on the rivers is just as great. “Everybody acknowledges that those cattle will just move to another area,” said Don Blankenau, an attorney for the state of Nebraska, in its compact with Kansas that regulates the Republican river from which cattle and corn irrigators draw from ever-lower flows. But it’s not a part of the political conversation per se. Nobody is talking about climate change in their campaigns, or the implications for food production near-term, or how water will be handled in fast-changing conditions. It is one of those electric rails, because so much money is wrapped up in the corn-ethanol-meat-soya bean complex as it stands. Farmers are taking action on their own, after losing money six straight years in Iowa and wondering where the corn ethanol bubble of 2008 went. They are starting to look into cover crops like rye to protect the soil and hold nutrients in place during these increasingly harsh flushes. They also can help store moisture by building soil tilth to ward off dry spells, which could span decades. “You have flavors of the Dust Bowl,” Takle said, sprinkled by torrents in the future. Another soil scientist, Jerry Hatfield of the National Lab for Agriculture and the Environment in Ames, told my reporter son Tom that we can make agriculture resilient to a changing climate. But it will take a transformation in thinking that is not yet reflected in the political conversation. Few politicians in the five states around here are talking about regulating agriculture in an era of warmer and wetter nights and long droughts. Yet farmers are paying attention. Hatfield says that conventional producers in the Raccoon river watershed are starting to focus on profitability reports from sustainable agriculture groups like the Practical Farmers of Iowa. They advocate a rotating crop-livestock land use with more diverse plantings that can restore soil and make farmers more resilient – and get them off that expensive chemical jones. Because, the government doesn’t appear equipped to deal with it. The state of Iowa and the state of Ohio each spend about a dollar per acre per year on water and soil quality – on land that costs up to $10,000 per acre. Politicians are still talking bioswales and mini-marshes when we all need to be thinking, at least, about retiring a third of the land in the upper midwest from corn and soy rotations. That isn’t something that the ag supply chain – controlled by the Koch brothers, Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-Dupont – can readily accept, because to give up acres is to give up revenue. And they happen to control the political infrastructure in the Corn Belt. But at some point the construct fails. In western Kansas, they’re having a tough time growing corn even with irrigation and chemicals. It is getting so warm that the plant simply cannot service itself. Without more urgency, the problems will continue to grow worse than soya beans standing in six inches of water waiting on a combine to sweep them up. The fellows around the coffee maker know it. And so do the people down in Des Moines trying to make a safe cup of coffee, along with Amarillo ranchers. The politicians just haven’t caught up. • This article was amended on 24 October 2018. Dr Takle has not won a Nobel prize, as suggested in an earlier version; he contributed to reports for the IPCC, which won the Nobel peace prize in 2007. Art Cullen, editor of the Storm Lake Times, won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for editorials on surface water pollution in Iowa. His new book, Storm Lake: A Chronicle of Change, Resilience and Hope from a Heartland Newspaper, was published by Viking (Penguin Random House) on 2 October"
"Activist shareholders in Australia’s largest independent coalminer are expected to vote in record numbers on Thursday to demand Whitehaven Coal aligns its long-term company strategy with the Paris climate agreement. Guardian Australia understands the group Market Forces has secured support from some superannuation funds and large overseas investors in Whitehaven for three resolutions that will be put to the company’s annual general meeting in Sydney.  Will van der Pol, a legal researcher and campaigner at Market Forces, said investors had been “receptive” in recent discussions. One non-binding advisory resolution calls on the company to disclose climate change-related risks to shareholders, in line with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures. Another proposal says that shareholders call on the board to make strategy and capital expenditure decisions “consistent with the climate goals of the Paris agreement” in order to safeguard the longer-term success of the company and respond to risks and opportunities posed by climate change. “We move this resolution in order to ensure our company is protected from stranded asset risks, and poised to take advantage of regulatory and market changes as international action is taken to satisfy the goals established by the Paris climate change agreement,” a supporting statement says. “Given the higher stranding risk of coal assets over oil and gas, coal producers should be acting more urgently than other fossil fuel producers. “Presently, Whitehaven Coal does not appear to have its strategy aligned with a scenario consistent with holding global warming below 2C. We consider this dangerous, given it amounts to second-guessing the ambition of 197 nations that signed the Paris agreement.” Any substantial level of support would be significant, considering Whitehaven is a pure-play coalminer. The company released a statement to the ASX on 5 October that indicated it would consider climate risk reporting in 2019, a move interpreted as a concession to activist shareholders. It followed an Australian Securities and Investments Commission report last month critical of the level of climate risk disclosures by companies. “Whitehaven is committed to playing a role in reducing carbon emissions ... by promoting increased use of Whitehaven’s high-quality, low-emissions coal,” the company said in its statement to the ASX.Whitehaven’s future planning is based on the “New Policies Scenario” of the International Energy Agency, under which coal demand to Asia would double by 2040. Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Under a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040.Van de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday’s Whitehaven AGM were “an opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing”. “These sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,” he said. Climate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace. At last week’s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company’s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin. The Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company’s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about “stranded asset risk”. “At some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,” Poole said."
"The shallow seas around Britain absorb tens of million of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, scientists have discovered. This plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s ecology and in lessening the impact of carbon emissions. But researchers warn that shelf seas are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and the impact is likely to worsen. In particular, rising temperatures and increased numbers of intense storms threaten to disrupt the coastal regions’ ability to absorb carbon dioxide. This could accelerate climate change, they state in Shelf Seas: The Engine of Productivity, published this week.  “The seas round Britain are some of the best-studied in the world,” said one author, Phil Williamson of the University of East Anglia. “Yet we are only just finding out how its many complex processes fit together.” UK shelf seas have an average depth of 80 metres and cover 1.6m sq km, an area nearly six times Britain’s land area, and are worth £47bn to the economy. By comparison, the entire north-west European shelf sea covers 3.2m sq km, adds the report on the UK Shelf Sea programme. Although shelf seas comprise only around 7% of the world’s oceans, they support more than 90% of global fish catches. However, they are coming under increasing stress from overfishing, pollution and trawling of the seabed as well as increased shipping, the erection of offshore wind farms and the construction of oil rigs. All these activities have impacts on the battle to limit global warming. According to the report, the north-west European shelf sea – half of which is made up by UK coastal waters – absorb 15-40m tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide a year, “the equivalent of between 10 to 25% of all UK carbon emissions”. Some of this carbon is held in the water above the seabed but most – 70% to 88% – has been found in the top 10cm of sediments that make up the UK shelf seas floor. If this carbon is released the consequences could be severe. According to the report, the potential release – from direct human action and indirectly from global warming – of the carbon dioxide in the north-west European shelf sea could result in around £9bn of damage over the next 25 years, much of it in the UK. The report also highlights the dangers posed by trawling, the most widespread human activity in Britain’s shelf seas. Weighted nets dragged across the sea floor kill many more forms of marine life than the fish they are designed to catch. Crucially, the researchers found that a single, initial trawl of a new seabed zone causes most damage while subsequent trawls do less. That means that full exclusion zones – in which no trawling is allowed – will have a greater benefit than allowing different levels of trawling in different zones. This “suggests there should be an all or nothing approach to marine protection zones”, said Williamson. We would like to hear from you if you are taking part in any of the

"Anote Tong has had quite a week. The former president of Kiribati has been in Australia to advocate for more robust action on climate change, which threatens to wipe out his Pacific home within a matter of decades as sea levels rise. But on Wednesday he got caught up in controversy when reports emerged that Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, allegedly told him it was “always about the cash” when Pacific Islands leaders came to Australia.  As a result, Tong has become hot property. When we meet in the late afternoon the next day he has been on the go since 4am with interviews and meetings. While Price’s alleged comments have given him prominence, they have also threatened to derail his message about the impact of climate change on Kiribati and what countries such as Australia should be doing to help. Tong says he did not hear the comments Price is alleged to have made at a restaurant. “I do have a hearing problem. I’m a free diver and I lost my hearing [in one ear],” he says. “If it was true that those were the comments then I would not be happy.” Mostly, Tong just wants to move on. “We’ve gone beyond that, I don’t want to go back. I’ve had a call from the minister, which I thought was very gracious of her to do that, just saying if I have offended you in any way I assure you it was not my intention.” Tong has other criticism for the environment minister and her colleagues. He was angered by their reactions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last week, which said the world had just 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5C. Price said it would be “irresponsible” for Australia to commit to phase out coal by 2050, while the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said Australia would not change policy based on the recommendations of “some sort of report”. “I was not happy. I was very disappointed when the credibility of the report was being questioned, because there is no alternative science being put forward and what’s at stake is not minor,” said Tong. “It’s not about the marginal rise in price or reduction in price of energy, it’s about lives, it’s about the future.” If Australia, which has been criticised by its Pacific neighbours for failing to take more concerted action to reduce emissions, does not change its tone, Tong says it is in danger not only of losing its position as a regional leader but of being welcome in regional organisations at all. “When countries in the region do things that are not proper, like have a coup, we expel them from the regional body … When you believe somebody is destroying your future and your home, what should you do?” For Kiribati, the impacts of climate change are being felt acutely, with increased storms and flooding. Rising sea levels mean it is inevitable the island will disappear, says Tong. “If it doesn’t happen in 20 years’ time, it’ll happen in 50 years’ time or in 100 years’ time.” When people have to leave Kiribati, Tong does not want them to leave in an emergency situation or as climate change refugees – a term he dislikes. Instead, he says, governments should be training people in countries such as Kiribati that are feeling the brunt of climate change so they can get jobs elsewhere, which Tong calls “migration with dignity”. “We have more than enough time to make our people qualified,” he said. “It has already worked. We had a Kiribati-Australia nursing initiative, where our young people were trained in Queensland and they found jobs in Australia.” By one estimate from an Oxfam report last year, the sea-level rise resulting from 2C of warming could submerge land that is currently home to 280 million people. Each year from 2008 and 2016 an average of 21.8 million people were reported as newly internally displaced by extreme weather disasters such as cyclones. Tong says Kiribati and other countries like it are “owed” the resources to train their people so they can relocate. “If I drop a tree on your home and I come to you and say ‘where are you going to live?’ [you’re] going to say: ‘I’m going to live with you until my home is fixed.’ That’s the normal thing, isn’t it? Otherwise I think I take you to court. Now we don’t have that remedy, but I think the principles are essentially the same.” "

"I have to take issue with Jo Steranka (How you can do your bit in the war against climate change, Letters, 18 October). Dishwashers are typically much more efficient than hand washing in terms of energy and water consumption. Research carried out by Christian Paul Richter (Usage of dishwashers: observation of consumer habits in the domestic environment, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 2011) on 200 households in Germany, Italy, Sweden and Britain, found that households with a dishwasher used on average 50% less water and 28% less energy per cleaned item than households that didn’t own a dishwasher. Even so, a higher degree of sustainability was identified because 20% of dishwasher cycles were not fully utilised and 52% operated at a temperature that was higher than necessary. Furthermore, Jo Steranka states that “opinion pieces don’t help if they don’t offer practical solutions”; er, has she tried digging up a paved garden? Getting around a city (that isn’t London) without a car? Not buying new clothes until the old ones wear out? Get real, Jo! (Although I do agree about buying local produce and turning off the lights at bedtime – are there people who don’t?)  Finally, let’s put the blame where it really belongs: the fossil fuel industry, big energy companies, the City and their mates in parliament who give us warm words and sympathy whilst blocking any real progress on climate change.Eric BanksHuntsham, Devon • Colin Ferguson’s defence of the dishwasher (Letters, 19 October) is misguided. Washing by hand uses less water if you use a washing-up bowl. A dishwasher only does better if one washes under a running tap. But he makes the common mistake of treating flow, not stock. A dishwasher embodies significant energy and raw materials, and needs to be disposed of and replaced. Life cycle analysis figures have been used to justify dishwashers, but these usually assume that hand washing is done under a hot tap run at full blast for a prolonged period, and completely ignore the environmental impact of the electronic and plastic components.Clare HayCambridge • Once built and installed, a dishwasher may well use much less energy and water than washing by hand, but how does it compare when the extraction of raw materials, the making and assembling of its component parts, and delivery into the home are taken into account?Michael RobinsonBerkhamsted, Hertforshire • Please can someone explain to me how washing up by hand (one bowl of hot water, dishes washed in order of cleanliness, obviously, possibly another bowl for extra dirty saucepans, after soaking) can ever use more water and energy than a dishwasher, which swishes around for an hour or so, at temperatures that make contents too hot to handle when finished? I cannot understand the comparison. But then I am a devoted hand washer-up.

"Countries that may not be thought of as climate leaders are emerging at the front-lines on responding to climate change. One great example is Iran. I have the fortune of performing water-use research with a number of scientists in Iran. And I can assure you they are thinking about, planning, and taking action to reduce the impacts of climate change and ecological destruction. One example of an Iranian leader is Dr. Mohammad Taghi Sattari who is an Associate Professor of water engineering at the University of Tabriz. He recently wrote a report about an effort in Iran to handle their water availability crises. It probably doesn’t surprise people that Iranians think about water availability; it is a country with limited rainfall. And the concurrence of three issues (water management, growing population, and climate change) make this is particularly challenging problem. In 2017, the Iranian government released a report from the Strategic Studies Center that showed water availability is viewed as the second-most important national issue. Statistical data from the Iranian government’s Power Ministry and from the World Bank predict that Iran is soon to enter a broad and extensive water crisis. If the crisis is not properly managed, there will be both direct and indirect economic costs, social upheaval, and security consequences. According to the published data, in 2014, the annual rainfall in Iran averaged 228 mm (less than a foot). This is 1/5th the world-average rainfall. As a country, Iranian’s rainfall put them in the 163rd position. Dr. Sattari believes that even though the amount of rainfall in Iran is very low, proper management could enable it to match the needs of the country. In the past few decades, Iran has moved to more substantial agricultural development. Some of the newer cultured crops are water intensive, for instance watermelon. An astonishing 92% of the country’s water is devoted to agriculture (compared with approximately 70% for other developing countries and only 40% for developed countries). In an effort to more efficiently use water in Iran, many large dams have been built. These dams have led to an explosion in agricultural production but have also caused unintended consequences for downstream water rights and water availability. The result is that agricultural water has been made so cheap that it is being used in very water-intensive crops. The exported crops are being sold for less money than the water they hold. Simply put, Iran is exporting water via its watermelons. But there is hope. The president of Iran, Dr. Hassan Rouhani has identified water as the nation’s second-most severe threat. This means that Iran’s government is taking the problem very seriously. The country is developing a people-centered water management system that brings together administrators, economic experts, and politicians to make informed decisions. Part of the effort is through water education – teaching people how to use water most efficiently. Also, latitude is being given to people to design, adjust, and implement water resource policies. Iran is exploring different water-management technologies that will better handle the intermittent rainfall. I have seen these technologies and have worked with researchers to publish performance results. It is exciting work. Make no mistake, Iran’s water problem is a real and crises are coming. But the country is devoting the entirety of its national energy to solve the problem. The area I am particularly interested is Lake Urmia. It is a critically important lake near the Turkish border. Approximately 70% of the surface area of the lake has disappeared; the shores are replaced by beds of salt. I spoke to my colleague, Dr. Sattari about his work and he said, I am an associate professor at the Department of Water Science and Engineering in University of Tabriz. At my university, research on water resources management, especially in the Urmia Lake drought crisis, is one of the most important research topics. Several research teams are working hard in this area. The topics of the thesis of Msc and PHD students will be rooted in this direction and the results of this research will be published in the most reputable and specialized journals of the world. The Urmia lake basin and its salvation are the main goals of our independent research. I and my colleagues believe that we can overcome these crises and once again return the Urmia Lake to its previous state. How nice to have an optimistic view in these trying times. Working together, scientists and decision makers around the world can make this planet a better place. For the people living around places like Lake Urmia, their fate is in the hands of people like Dr. Sattari."
"The Australian Conservation Foundation will target three marginal seats in Victoria and Queensland in a bid to push “middle Australia” to demand more action on climate change, its chief executive has said. Kelly O’Shanassy made the comments at the National Press Club on Tuesday, unveiling the environmental group’s election action plan to break the political deadlock over climate change.  The ACF will target the Victorian seats of Chisholm, currently held by Liberal MP Julia Banks, and McNamara, held by retiring Labor MP Michael Danby, along with Bonner in Queensland where the incumbent is Liberal MP Ross Vasta. Banks has announced she will not recontest her seat as a Liberal, leading to speculation she could run as an independent; while McNamara will likely be a repeat of the three-cornered contest between Labor, Liberal and the Greens at the 2016 election. O’Shanassy said the group chose the “middle Australian marginal seats” because it wanted to “move the country forward on climate change”. One third of voters in the seats had climate change as their top concern,a dynamic the ACF hoped would create a “race to the top” on climate policy. Climate policy is set to be a key issue in the 2019 election, with Labor promising the national energy guarantee or something similar to achieve a 45% reduction in carbon emissions from electricity by 2030, and the Greens promising to push Labor to be “as ambitious as it possibly can be”. On Tuesday, the University of New South Wales released a report, commissioned by the mining union, calling for a new federal government authority to manage the closure of coal power plants rather than leave the timing and conditions to power companies. Australia has 23 coal-fired power stations forecast by their operators to be closed by 2050. The report argues the government should manage the transition by creating an energy transition authority, investing in public sector infrastructure to generate employment and promoting new hubs for hi-tech industries and services. The Morrison government has stared down calls from Coalition conservatives to withdraw Australia from the Paris climate agreement and abolish small-scale renewables subsidies, but has shelved the emissions reduction component of the Neg and refused to rule out measures to support new coal-fired power stations. O’Shanassy took aim at Scott Morrison for claiming Australia will meet its 2030 climate targets “in a canter – despite the evidence showing otherwise”, the environment minister Melissa Price for saying that getting rid of coal to save the Great Barrier Reef was a “long bow” and Bill Shorten “ says coal will be part of our future”. O’Shanassy said Morrison was “harming his constituents and all Australians and doing so with his eyes wide open” by “dismissing climate change [and] being a spruiker for the coal industry”. “Right now, it doesn’t look good. Australia is in a climate policy deadlock. We are nowhere after two decades.” O’Shanassy said the blame should lie “at the feet of the pollies” but the environment movement is also “a little culpable” for “missteps”. In response to a later question, O’Shanassy said she was referring to opposition to Kevin Rudd’s proposed carbon pollution reduction scheme, which was blocked by the Greens and Liberals, and not opposition to the Turnbull government’s Neg. She said the Neg “would’ve reduced the amount of clean energy in Australia” which made it a “bad, bad policy”, so the ACF resolved to not oppose the Neg architecture and instead encourage states and the next federal government to raise the emissions reduction target. O’Shanassy said the ACF will make the 2019 election “the climate election” so the major party with “the strongest climate policy” would win. Its policy aims are to “repower Australia with clean electricity by 2030”, move towards zero net pollution before 2050 and prevent new coal mines. The ACF aims to have one million conversations with voters about climate change, including 15,000 in its three target seats. It will distribute scorecards rating parties’ policies but will not tell people how to vote. O’Shanassy said that “asking nicely with policy in hand and evidence that stacks up” had failed to guarantee climate action, so the ACF was now focused on developing community campaigns to “move stubborn governments” and inflict “electoral pain” on parties without a proper climate policy."
"Interview with the energy minister Angus Taylor and Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy. The discussion follows government announcements on measures to reduce power prices, including a “last resort” divestiture power to break up power companies, and mechanisms to boost investment in new electricity generation. I’ll get on to today’s announcements [about measures to lower power prices and increase investment in generation] in a second, but first, what are you doing with small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES)? Labor has now said it stays until 2030.  AT: There’s no plan to change the SRES. The SRES and the large-scale renewable energy target are around until 2030. They fade between now and 2030, there’s decline as technology continues to improve. That’s our position. You are not going to scale SRES back, you are not going to change it? AT: The deeming rates fall every year between now and 2030. We are not proposing to change that. That’s designed to ensure the subsidy comes off as technology continues to improve. Now to divestiture, it’s often quoted, but never sighted. We haven’t seen this, the legislation … AT: We are very clear there will be a legislative package coming forward this year. I’m not being unnecessarily combative, there’s a sharp end to the question. You are absolutely confident you have the power to do this? AT: Look there’s a series of powers we’ll be putting in a legislative package this year. Divestiture is one of them. It’s a last resort. A lot of this is about saying to the industry we want to see the right behavior, the right outcomes. Then we won’t need to wield the big stick. But we want to see the outcomes. Look, when industries behave badly, one of two things discipline them: competition is always the best, the alternative is regulation. As a utility sector, there is a responsibility to customers which is above and beyond and we want to see that over the coming months. You are confident you have the power to do it? AT: We will put in place a legislative package. Do you expect to be challenged legally in the event you ever use this power? AT: I can’t predict what people are going to do. We want to see the ACCC and the courts with the appropriate set of powers to use if necessary. My strong hope is it will not be necessary, but we’ve got to see the outcomes. If you impose a divestiture power for the power sector, why not other sectors? AT: This sector has seen some extraordinarily poor economic outcomes. We’ve seen people hit with very significant penalties for late payments well above the cost of the payments. We’ve seen market practices which the ACCC outlined in detail in their report, which are completely unacceptable. We’ve seen rapid escalation in standing offers, doubling in Victoria in four years, for people just because they are loyal. This stuff has got to stop. It is a utility sector and an essential service that Australians rely on and there hasn’t been enough competition to get the discipline that’s required. So one of the things we want to do is enhance the level of competition and we will use regulation if we have to. What’s the trigger for forcing divestiture? AT: It’s a last resort. Yes, but what’s the trigger? AT: The issue is have we got enough capacity and supply in the market to meet customers’ needs, and are companies in the sector thwarting that, are they deliberately taking anti-competitive action to withdraw supply from the market to drive up prices. So the trigger is competition? AT: It’s competition and supply. The two are related. But [the behaviour has] got to be extreme. It’s a last resort, but we will use it if we have to. Competition is the trigger, and withdrawal of supply .. AT: Obviously price is the outcome of that. Competition and supply, leading to higher prices, is the ill we are focused on here: lack of competition and lack of supply leading to higher prices and a loss of reliability – that’s what we are concerned about here. This can play out as extreme penalties for customers, it can result in wholesale prices that are too high, it can result in retail prices that are too high, it can result in a failure to participate in the market, and we’ve seen that in South Australia. There’s been very little trading in the wholesale market which makes new entry extremely difficult and that contributes to higher prices. Indemnity? Will the commonwealth indemnify some projects [it supports with the new investment mechanisms] against future carbon risk? AT: What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment. So yes, is the answer? AT: It depends on the circumstances. I am not going to anticipate how to bank these projects. What I am going to say is projects need to happen. We’ll leave it to the experts and the bankers to work out how best to get that happening with the least impact on the public purse. You are open to indemnifying these projects? AT: I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment. We need reliable baseload power, but our focus is on getting prices down and ensuring we get a reliability outcome. There are some risks that investors can absorb, there are others they may not be able to absorb. We will look at those risks as we do the work, but the key here is not to anticipate. My experience is when you anticipate the banking, you get it wrong. So maybe, is the answer. AT: I’m saying I’m not going to anticipate the banking. You want me to tell you what the banking is going to be and no one who knows anything about it will anticipate the banking. We’ll look at the projects … And maybe you’ll indemnify future risk … AT: We’ll look at the risks and we’ll seek to minimise the risks to the commonwealth. What investors are most concerned about is political risks. There’s many types of investments, public private partnerships, where government plays a role. This is not new. It’s a very old mechanism for the public to work with the private to make sure investment happens. We will go down that path and we’ll put experts in, an appropriate team, to assess the projects. You do acknowledge that creates a risk for taxpayers. AT: We are going to do everything we can to minimise the risks. The government is well-positioned to manage some risks and the commercial sector is well-positioned to manage others. The new government discussion paper makes it clear the underwriting mechanism could apply to retrofitting existing projects. How is that new generation? AT: It’s new generation if it would otherwise be gone, that’s the point. What we want is additional investment, new investment, that will mean we get capacity we wouldn’t otherwise have. So the real world scenario here is sweating the assets? AT: If it’s an existing site and a new facility that may or may not be interesting. If you want a really good pipeline of projects, you don’t close down your options, you look at the broadest range of options available. We do want competition. We do want new entrants. That’s an important criteria. Obviously a new entrant does have an advantage coming into this market. New entrants are more aggressive in their pricing behaviour in many cases. Creating new competition is going to be a good thing. But retrofitting does apply in some circumstances? AT: We are not ruling it out. In the discussion paper one of the criteria is the project should be unlikely to result in an increase in emissions to a level not more than minus-26%, right? You can drive a truck through that wording but let’s assume that wording is there in good faith, why not keep the national energy guarantee target? AT: We are very confident we are going to get to 26% well ahead of time. The numbers are clear. There will be a 250% increase in renewables in the next three years. We are going from 17.5 terrawatt hours to 44.4 on the Energy Security Board numbers, and since that work was done there has been almost 1,000 megawatts of new renewable capacity has been added to the pipeline. We are very confident we will get to 26% in the early 2020s. Then why not keep the target if you are going to get there anyway? AT: Labor want a higher target. We are not going to facilitate that in any shape or form. Labor want a higher target. We’ve committed to 26%. We think that’s a fair share for Australia. Australia has a very good track record on meeting our targets. Twenty-six per cent is achievable and we are not interested in upping that, because all Australians will pay a lot, particularly in sectors like agriculture and transport. We are not going to load the gun for Labor to have a much higher target. Friday’s energy ministers’ meeting: The Victorian government is four days before caretaker. They won’t agree to anything. AT: We need a final decision in December on the reliability obligation of the national energy guarantee for 1 July implementation. We will be making sure the remaining work that needs to be done is being done between now and December. We are confident states will support this in December. We are going into summer. Victoria is almost 400 megawatts short of capacity to be avoiding blackouts this summer. We want to see Victoria doing the right thing and we’re sure they will as we go into summer. What about the ACCC stuff. Don’t you need their cooperation? AT: There are two ways of doing it, one is through the states and the other is by the commonwealth. We’ve said that we are very open to doing this through the states but it needs to be done properly. Proper benchmark price. Proper reference price. Standing offers coming into line with the reference price. If that is done right we are very happy for that to be done through the states, but we are prepared to override them. Do they need to agree on Friday? AT: We would like to gauge whether the states want to do this cooperatively. We’d like them to, but we are determined to get this done, and we’ll do it ourselves."

"The relentlessly corrosive nature of political debate about climate change can sometimes mask that this is a golden moment for the clean energy industry in Australia. A near-constant stream of investment announcements suggests a barrier has been knocked down such that leading renewable technologies, so long dependent on public subsidies, have assumed market supremacy.  In the Pilbara, Macquarie Bank has joined a proposed $22bn project that plans to use solar and wind to run local mines, create “green” hydrogen energy for north Asia and possibly export electricity to Indonesia. In regional South Australia, the British billionaire industrialist, Sanjeev Gupta, has said he considered building a coal plant to run the Whyalla steelworks he bought last year, but decided it was cheaper to throw roughly $1.5bn at solar, pumped hydro storage, battery storage and co-generation (creating energy from waste gas) as he adopts his “green steel” model. Outside Townsville, zinc refiner Sun Metals recently opened Australia’s first large-scale solar farm built by a major energy user to service part of its own needs and feed the grid. The Clean Energy Council lists 69 large-scale projects across the country that have recently reached “financial close” and are either under construction or presumably about to be. They should mean $15.6bn investment and add 10,978 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to the system. These projects – just those the council knows of – are in addition to the 30 new clean energy plants that started operating in the first nine months of the year. Contracts are being signed at historically cheap prices – a reported $52 per megawatt-hour for the giant Stockyard Hill wind farm in central Victoria, for example. Meanwhile, rooftop solar panels are being installed at an astonishing rate. In May, the head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman, said six panels were going up across the continent every minute, adding the capacity of a large coal power station each year. The consumer watchdog recently recommended incentive schemes for small-scale systems be wound back. Some in the energy industry have suggested there will soon be more solar power coming into the grid than Australia can use but a new study by consultants Green Energy Markets, which examined the amount of solar power expected every 30 minutes out to 2021, rejects this idea. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, says the federal incentive scheme will stay. The investment avalanche is driving an unprecedented transformation of the electricity grid. At the time of writing, clean energy had met 21.8% of national electricity market demand over the past week, suggesting the country is on the cusp of meeting the 2020 renewable energy target of about 23% ahead of schedule. The Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, says the momentum is massive; Green Energy Markets suggest it could mean renewable generation hits 33.3% by 2020. Analyst and advocate Simon Holmes à Court says it is likely as much clean energy capacity will be built over the next two years as over the previous 40. In July, the market operator found a business-as-usual path, without policies ramping up, was likely to lead to about 46% clean energy by 2030. It underlined the hollowness of the government’s now-dumped pledge to introduce a national energy guarantee to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by 26% below 2005 levels over that timeframe, and implied Labor’s 50% renewable energy target would take little effort. (Both targets are less than the change in coal use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests is necessary for Australia to play its part in limiting global warming.) But while the direction is clear, the picture is murkier than this moment suggests. There are signs investment may soon slow markedly. Most of the investment is being driven by the renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020 and stays at that level for the following decade. The spending to meet the target has come in a rush lately, mainly because then-prime minister Tony Abbott commissioned a review by businessman and climate sceptic Dick Warbuton, who wanted to end it. The uncertainty triggered an investment strike that lasted the better part of two years before the target was ultimately reduced. But the target has done its job. With no policy to replace it, the incentive to build clean energy plants is expected to fall off significantly. This is already being seen in wholesale energy futures markets, where it is playing a role in prices trending upwards again. There is consistent evidence, from the market operator down, that it is cheaper to build variable clean energy with “firming” support than alternatives. New performance standards requiring investors in areas flooded with renewable energy to install expensive grid-stabilising technology needed to smooth the transition are not expected to change this. But demand for electricity is barely growing. Without a policy that gives the industry a map for when new clean generation will be needed, new plants are unlikely to come online until coal plant owners announce more closures. There are exceptions. Tristan Edis, a Green Energy Markets analyst, points to companies signing contracts with state governments: Victoria recently announced six wind and solar farms had won contracts under its first renewable energy tender after a similar round for battery storage, and Queensland has promised to soon follow with the result of its auction. Also, some large energy users with deep pockets may build or fund their own generation needs to hedge against market costs, as Sun Metals did in Queensland. But these are investment spikes, not maps. “Beyond that there is no appetite for the major energy retailers to do deals, so I expect we’re not going to see the large-scale investments,” Edis says. “Instead of seeing thousands of megawatts of new capacity a year we may see a few hundred.” Other energy system experts agree. Holmes à Court, from the Energy Transition Hub at the University of Melbourne, says it is little understood that consumers are no longer subsidising new developments under the renewable energy target through their bills. Long-term pricing contracts being signed between wind and solar farm owners and energy retailers are now setting such low prices that large-scale generation certificates – documents that retailers must buy and hand in to the government as proof they are meeting their renewable obligation – are effectively being thrown in for free. The target’s role recently has been to provide investment confidence to ensure that long-term contracts are signed. Holmes à Court says without it or a new policy to replace it uncertainty associated with selling electricity on the spot market could increase the risk margin on finance or make a project “unbankable” until the next coal plant closes and pushes up the wholesale electricity price. AGL has announced it will shut and replace its Liddell black coal plant in NSW in 2022 (and copped no shortage of opprobrium from the Coalition for doing so). Yallourn, a brown coal station in Victoria, could be squeezed out by the large-scale solar rush already announced in that state. But in terms of closures that will spark new investment the timeframe is unclear, especially given the government hopes to extend the life of existing coal plants and possibly underwrite new ones. This is why interested parties from across the spectrum – the energy industry, business, consumer and welfare groups and climate activists – have been united in calling for a bipartisan policy. While Taylor has dismissed claims the government should try to eliminate uncertainty as naïve, and the gap between the major parties has widened to a gulf since Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull, those invested in the debate want the best chance for the transition to happen as smoothly and cheaply as possible for everyone. “Basically, as Audrey Zibelman says, we can have a managed transition or a chaotic disruption,” Holmes à Court says. “In a chaotic disruption people get hurt, whether they are consumers, employers or prime ministers.”"
"Let’s start with a letter. Not, on this occasion, from Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but from Helpful of Clacton-on-Sea. Jo Steranka wrote in to suggest seven specific ways that people can help in the struggle against climate change, environmental degradation and global warming. Of course, individual actions are hugely important. But so is the work being done by scientists, social entrepreneurs, innovators and activists. And this week we had a little something from each. In the Amazon, as deforestation continues apace and the frontrunner in Brazil’s presidential race eyes another swathe of destruction, we found scientists embarking on the long job of putting trees in the ground rather than taking them out. It’s too early to say whether this is the start of something. But reforestation is catching on around the world: from New Zealand to China, from Europe to west Africa, people are planting hundreds of millions of trees. They’re planting trees in India, too (remarkably, to celebrate the birth of girls) – but not nearly enough to make a difference to smog season, which is about to start in earnest. The reason air quality gets so bad at this time of year is partly down to the burning of farmland, to get rid of crop residue once the harvest is in. A number of enterprises have spotted a business opportunity in buying up the biomatter and turning it into useful stuff, as Rishika Pardikar found out. On the subject of making good use of the things that everyday folks leave behind, the Dyson awards published their shortlist of quixotic, sustainable inventions this week. Read all about them here. The best: a fork made out of potato peelings. Solar-powered cooking pots seem like a good idea, particularly when they can charge your phone. Thanks to BBC World Hacks for this one.

"Sea water encroaching on the Everglades will hamper decades of work by a government program to reverse manmade damage to the vast, fragile ecosystem at the tip of Florida, according to a new report published on Wednesday. The federal, multibillion-dollar Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, authorized by Congress in 2000, was designed to redirect fresh water, reducing sea water incursion in a long-term effort to bring the tropical wetland ecosystem back to the way it looked in the early 20th century, before influxes of people to southern Florida drained much of it for development. The region, known as the “river of grass”, is less than an hour’s drive from Miami but is home to mangrove forests and cypress swamps housing alligators, orchids, storks and ibises, as well as threatened species such as the Florida panther. But it has long struggled to recover from water diversions for agriculture, swelling communities and other forms of environmental degradation, such as fertilizer runoff.  Now a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine warns that rising global temperatures are also changing the Everglades in ways the state and federal government must consider, including changing rainfall patterns and accelerating sea-level rise. “It is clear that the Greater Everglades of 2050 and beyond will be much different from what was envisioned at the time of the [plan],” the biennial report says. The committee of independent scientists charged with advising the government says it’s time to re-evaluate the program, to consider what climate change will mean for the “interrelated challenges of restoring the natural system, providing flood protection, and meeting the water demands of a growing population”. The committee chair, Bill Boggess, said current project plans did not adequately consider a range of possible sea levels. Sea levels were 3in above the 1993 average last year and will continue to go up, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Analyzing that what’s being built and being designed is robust to those conditions is really what we’re encouraging,” Boggess said.  Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist focused on climate change adaptation at Florida International University, said the recommendations were likely to change how experts in south Florida are thinking about and proposing restoration projects. The assessment will go to the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department and the South Florida Water Management District. “Somehow, someone has to decide how much water will it take to get them back to being able to keep pace with sea-level and how do we monitor that to know how to change that over time, as may be necessary,” Parkinson said. “It would have been a huge challenge just to restore [the Everglades] if the climate and everything was in a steady state, but it’s not: it’s a moving target and it’s moving in the direction that increases the challenge.”"
"As many as 28,000 jobs will be lost in the north of England in the next 12 years under the government’s drive towards a low-carbon economy, a thinktank has warned. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said in its report that the region could be at the heart of a “clean energy revolution” – with a potential for 46,000 new green jobs – but instead faced economic decline under current plans.  Luke Murphy, an associate director at IPPR and co-author of the report, said: “With nearly half of the UK’s renewable energy being produced in the north, it is clear that the region is ideally placed to deliver a green jobs revolution of 46,000 new jobs by 2030.” Murphy described the move towards a low-carbon economy as an “urgent necessity” to limit the impact of global warning. He urged ministers to commit to a more ambitious decarbonisation policy “where communities are protected from decline” which he said must be at the heart of its industrial strategy. The north of England produced 48% of the UK’s renewable electricity between 2005 and 2014, the report said, yet the region is also home to the largest number of coal and gas power stations in England. The report, published on Monday, calls on the government to “learn from the mistakes of the past” and avoid a repeat of the catastrophic economic decline that followed the closure of coal, steel and shipbuilding industries across the north since the early 1980s. Yet, the thinktank said, proposals to limit the damaging effect on communities and help workers retrain were not mentioned in the government’s industrial or clean growth strategies. The report concluded: “If the government continues to ignore these workers, there is a real risk that the transition to a low-carbon economy will result in jobs losses or the forced acceptance of low-quality jobs, an increase in people on welfare benefits and an increase in local deprivation.” Josh Emden, a research fellow at IPPR and co-author of the report, said: “The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that this time there is a just transition into the low-carbon energy sector and beyond, for workers in the north of England who have powered the UK for decades. “The good news is that the opportunity is there for the north of England to become a powerhouse for the UK once again, provided the government takes the critical policy action needed.” The government is reviewing its target to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050 in the wake of a landmark report by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) earlier this month. Leading climate change experts warned there was only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. A government spokesperson said: “The move to a cleaner, greener economy is one of the greatest opportunities for our country.  With the potential to create 2 million new jobs by 2030, clean growth is a key focus of our modern industrial strategy. “Last week, we celebrated our first Green GB Week, showcasing the benefits clean growth will bring to all parts of society – from new businesses and jobs to leaving our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”"
"We, the undersigned, support the call for the UK and other OECD governments to negotiate a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to complement the Paris agreement on climate change, as proposed in your article “We need a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty – and we need it now” (theguardian.com, 23 October). The latest report from the IPCC shows we cannot afford to burn the vast majority of remaining reserves of fossil fuels if we are to keep warming below 1.5 or even 2 degrees. A new line in the sand is needed. We support an agreement with a moratorium on any further expansion of the fossil fuel industry in rich countries, together with a fund to support renewable energy development in poorer countries to reduce the need for fossil fuels, paid for by redirecting the staggering $10m per minute that governments currently spend on fossil fuel subsidies.

An example measure would involve a great deal of rationing akin to that in wartime. For instance; petrol and diesel cars could be restricted to use only every other day, natural gas for central heating could be rationed to that required to heat an average house to 20 degrees, or even less. Even electric cars could be affected, it may be impossible to recharge batteries when there is a windless night.

"New York is suing the oil giant ExxonMobil in a lawsuit that claims the company engaged in a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” to downplay the risks posed to its business by climate change regulations. The legal action, launched by New York state attorney general Barbara Underwood, alleges that ExxonMobil deceived its investors by hiding the true extent of its financial exposure to laws aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.  Exxon provided “false and misleading assurances” to shareholders that it had factored in climate regulations and that its vast reserves of oil and gas weren’t at major risk of being left as stranded assets, New York’s lawsuit claims. Senior executives, including former chief executive Rex Tillerson, who was briefly US secretary of state in the Trump administration before being abruptly fired earlier this year, took part in this facade, the lawsuit states. The suit, lodged in the New York supreme court, comes after three years of investigation into Exxon by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. Exxon has previously attempted to block an investigation into its practices, claiming its first amendment rights were being violated. Underwood said: “Investors put their money and their trust in Exxon – which assured them of the long-term value of their shares, as the company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions. Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing. “Instead, Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations.” New York’s lawsuit paints a picture of corporate malfeasance whereby Exxon told investors it was applying a “proxy cost” to its extraction of fossil fuels to account for the risk of governmental action to address climate change. In practice, the lawsuit alleges, Exxon applied much lower proxy costs than it initially stated, essentially assuming that existing climate regulations would remain in place, unchanged. This led to inaccurate information about investments in major projects, such as Exxon’s oil sands operations in Alberta, Canada, the lawsuit states. Canada has recently outlined a national plan to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution in a bid to reduce emissions. Exxon’s role in covering up the impact of climate change has come to light in the recent years, with the company aware for decades about the consequences of burning fossil fuels only to downplay this in public. The company now says it accepts climate change is real and a threat, even pledging $1m toward a campaign to put a price on carbon. This support comes with the caveat that mounting lawsuits aimed at making Exxon pay for damage wrought by climate change are dismissed. In July, a federal judge kicked out a lawsuit lodged by New York City that took aim at the five major oil producers, including Exxon. The New York state lawsuit does not concern the impact of climate change, but rather Exxon’s role in communicating the risk of climate regulation to investors. “Big oil may finally face some consequences for its role in wrecking the climate,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate campaign group 350.org. “The New York attorney general is standing up for investors who may have been swindled, and indirectly for the seven billion of us who will suffer from Exxon’s lies.” Exxon was contacted for comment. Attorneys general in California and Illinois, asked if they would join the New York suit, said they planned to take a “close look” at the securities fraud law the state is suing under. The case, “has been a topic of mutual conversation among various state AGs, and we are all going to take a close look at the filing,” California attorney general Xavier Becerra said. California would need to consider how its own laws apply, Becerra said. In Illinois, the power to join this type of case lies with the secretary of state, attorney general Lisa Madigan explained. She said: “The overall message here is that Exxon and others that were really at the forefront of causing climate change conditions in our country and around the world long knew that this was taking place and withheld that information to the detriment of not just their investors but ultimately all of us around the country.”"
"The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has signalled the Australian government could indemnify new power generation projects against the future risk of a carbon price, and says it could also support the retrofitting of existing coal plants. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the man dubbed the “minister for getting power prices down” by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also committed to keeping current subsidies for households and businesses to install renewable energy technology like solar panels until 2030, and insists Australia’s electricity sector will reduce emissions by 26% on 2005 levels in “the early 2020s”.  Taylor on Tuesday outlined a range of measures the government wants to implement to help lower power prices, including cajoling retailers into offering customers out-of-cycle price cuts so consumers could experience hip-pocket relief by January, ahead of the next election. He also foreshadowed policy interventions to boost investment in new “reliable” power generation, including providing a floor price, contracts for difference, cap and floor contracts and government loans. Morrison held out the prospect of government support for new coal-fired power stations “where they meet all the requirements” of the yet-to-be finalised mechanisms to boost investment in new electricity generation. One of the key problems preventing private investment in new coal-fired power generation is proponents have struggled to get finance because they are unable to predict future carbon risk, particularly given Australia’s decade-long partisan standoff over emissions reduction policies. Taylor told Guardian Australia the government would look to remove the risks stopping investment in new power generation. “I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment. “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment.” Asked whether he acknowledged that would expose taxpayers to risk, Taylor said: “We’ll look at the risks and we’ll seek to minimise the risks to the commonwealth.” The concept of the government underwriting new investments in power generation in order to boost competition in the market was originally recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission but with tightly defined criteria. The government is pursuing the ACCC’s general principle, but writing its own rules. The ACCC was focused on encouraging new market participants, but the energy minister said the government could back the retrofitting of existing power plants to extend their operating life. Asked how retrofitting an existing plant was bringing new generation into the market, he said: “It’s new generation if it would otherwise be gone, that’s the point. “What we want is additional investment, new investment, that would mean we get capacity we wouldn’t otherwise have.” Business is extremely wary of the government’s plans to impose price regulation in the energy sector, and about oft-repeated public threats by the government to wield a “big stick” – introducing divestiture powers to break up power companies engaging in price-gouging. The chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, warned on Tuesday that “ad hoc intervention in the energy market, such as underwriting generation investment or forced divestment, is sending a signal to the world that investing in Australia comes with considerable risks”. “In the long term this will only result in less investment in energy generation, less reliable energy and ultimately higher prices,” the BCA chief said. Taylor told Guardian Australia he was confident the government had the power to legislate to force divestiture, and a toughening of regulatory options was required because of poor market conduct. Asked whether he expected legal challenges from power companies in the event the government ever used the divestiture power, he said: “I can’t predict what people are going to do.” Asked what trigger the government planned to use to break up badly behaving power companies, Taylor said it was a lack of competition and deliberate withdrawal of supply. “The issue is, have we got enough capacity and supply in the market to meet customers’ needs and are companies in the sector thwarting that, are they deliberately taking anti-competitive action to withdraw supply from the market to drive up prices?” Stakeholders in the energy market are also enormously frustrated with the Coalition’s chopping and changing on energy policy, which culminated in the ditching of the national energy guarantee’s 26% emissions reduction target. Taylor insists the electricity sector will hit 26% well before 2030. Asked why the government ditched a target it was going to easily exceed, the minister said: “Labor want a higher target. We are not going to facilitate that in any shape or form. “We are not going to load the gun for Labor to have a much higher target.” Energy ministers will meet this Friday for the first time since the Morrison government grounded part of the Neg. Taylor wants to sound out his counterparts on whether they will agree to roll out new price regulations in the electricity market, or whether Canberra will force the change by overriding them. The Victorian energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, has warned she has no intention of agreeing to anything on Friday, given the state is days away from entering caretaker mode ahead of the state election. COAG energy council is becoming Groundhog Day - here we are three federal energy ministers later, and the Liberals still don’t have a national policy to reduce emissions. (1/2) Taylor also wants them to agree to preserving the reliability obligation of the Neg – a requirement on energy retailers to supply sufficient quantities of dispatchable power to the market, with a final decision on that required by December."
"Bahrain – one of the world’s most oil-rich nations – has applied to the international Green Climate Fund for $9.8m for its National Oil and Gas Authority, raising questions over whether taxpayer-funded assistance for poor countries is reaching its intended targets. The kingdom has requested funding for water conservation work to be carried out by its national oil and gas company, which it says is necessary to protect against water scarcity in future – a problem that is likely to grow worse around the world as a consequence of climate change.  The UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF) channels taxpayer funds from rich countries, including the US, the UK, further EU member states and others, to developing countries that would otherwise struggle to invest in low-emissions technology and infrastructure to adapt to a warming world. About $10bn has so far been pledged, including $1bn from the UK. However, Bahrain’s proposal has come in for heavy criticism, and experts are concerned that it will encourage other oil-rich nations to come forward with proposals that will benefit their fossil fuel industries under the guise of adapting to the impacts of climate change. They are worried that there are too few safeguards to GCF funding. Lutz Weischer, team leader for international climate policy at Germanwatch, an environmental NGO, said: “The GCF was given the mandate to promote a paradigm shift to low-carbon and climate resilient development pathways [which mean] transitioning away from coal, oil and gas. A project that would make a country’s water supply dependent on continued oil and gas production is clearly not in line with the mandate.” Channelling money from the GCF to a fossil fuel company would be “perverse”, added Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at the charity Christian Aid. “Surely the oil companies should be cleaning up their own polluted water?” An independent technical assessment found several flaws, and even suggested that fixing leaking pipes could be a more efficient way of making Bahrain’s water supply more resilient. The GCF board, which is to consider a raft of proposals from various countries, will be asked to approve the application as soon as Thursday morning. Whether it does so will be a key test of the fitness of the fund and its governance, according to observers. Adow said: “This funding would not only undermine trust in the GCF, it would also set a bad precedent for other proposals involving fossil fuel companies looking to leech off the fund’s resources.” Wael Hamidan, executive director of Climate Action Network International, said: “The notion of leveraging public money targeted at climate action to support fossil fuel companies is absurd and misguided at best. The only justifiable reason for assisting fossil fuel companies should be to transition fully into 100% renewables as a matter of urgency – and even that could be funded through these companies’ enormous profits.” A GCF spokesman told the Guardian: “This is one of 20 project proposals to be considered by the GCF board this week. The project will not finance any fossil fuel operations, but targets water shortage resulting from climate change. No project funds will be used for profit generating activities, and only lower income households and public buildings (mosques, schools) will be provided with water saving devices and greywater recycling systems. The proposal is brought to us by UN Environment, one of our project partners (Accredited Entities). It has been recommended for approval by our Technical Advisory Panel, subject to certain conditions.” The GCF said its mandate was to support developing countries in their transition to low emission and climate resilient pathways in support of the Paris agreement. “Project proposals have to be approved by the GCF board, which makes decisions by consensus between its 24 members, equally representing developed and developing countries. All project proposals coming to the board are subject to assessment from our independent technical advisory panel,” said the spokesman. A spokesman for Bahrain’s environment council said: “Bahrain’s application to the Green Climate Fund is about addressing the severe threat posed by global climate change to the kingdom’s freshwater supply. The impact of rising temperatures and increasing saline intrusion is expected to reduce Bahrain’s freshwater resources by between 50 to 100 million cubic metres of water per year in the short-term, well above the global average and posing a unique risk to the kingdom’s water security. “As a committed signatory to the Paris agreement, the kingdom has already taken significant steps to counteract the impact of climate change, including the development of a new national water strategy. We now seek assistance from the GCF to help support these critical interventions.” The criticism is a fresh headache for the embattled GCF, which has struggled with management dramas, including the resignation of its executive director and the collapse of a crucial board meeting over the summer. Rich and poor countries on the board are divided over framing new processes to raise funds, and donors have expressed private frustration at the slowness of its processes. Previous funding rounds have also attracted criticism, including a controversy over the proposed funding of megadams. The GCF was set up under the UN climate negotiations to provide a channel through which rich country governments can fulfil their obligations, agreed in Copenhagen in 2009 and subsequently under the Paris agreement of 2015, to provide finance to developing nations. The taxpayer funds, including nearly $5bn from EU member states, are supposed to help poor countries cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change. The US pledged $3bn to the GCF and delivered $1bn under Barack Obama’s presidency, but Donald Trump is seen as unlikely to fulfil the remainder of the commitment. He has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement. The Bahrain case throws light on the murky world of climate finance, by which private investors and governments mobilise funds for projects and technologies to cut greenhouse gas emissions and develop the resilient infrastructure needed to cope with a warming climate. According to pledges made at Copenhagen in 2009 and renewed in Paris, at least $100bn is supposed to flow from rich to poor nations a year by 2020, in order to help the poor to cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change. Most of this is likely to come from the private sector rather than taxpayer funds, but the sources and recipients of all such funding in the private sector are difficult to account for. The GCF was supposed to help the governments of developed countries by providing a set of rules and bureaucracy which could administer funding efficiently to recipients in line with the donor country aims. However, its problems leave major questions over the future of publicly funded climate finance hanging. • This article was updated on 18 October 2018 to clarify the nature of Bahrain’s funding request"
"When queried about the most recent IPCC report, Republican lawmakers delivered a consistent, false message – that climate scientists are still debating whether humans are responsible. The previous IPCC report was quite clear on this, attributing 100% of the global warming since 1950 to human activities. As Nasa atmospheric scientist Kate Marvel recently put it, “We are more sure that greenhouse gas is causing climate change than we are that smoking causes cancer.” Donald Trump articulated the incorrect Republican position in an interview on 60 Minutes:  We have scientists that disagree with [human-caused global warming] … You’d have to show me the [mainstream] scientists because they have a very big political agenda To paraphrase, ‘I know scientists. I have the best scientists.’ And of course Trump thinks he has “a natural instinct for science” which, as astrophysicist Katie Mack noted, is not a thing: There is no ""natural instinct for science."" This is not a thing. There is curiosity, there is exploration, and there is the desire to learn & grow & test one's naive notions against cold hard data. Believing in a ""natural instinct for science"" is anathema to everything science is Numerous papers have shown that over 90% of climate science experts agree that humans are the main cause of global warming since 1950, and when considering peer-reviewed papers, the consensus exceeds 97%. And yet as surveys by Yale and George Mason universities have found, only about 15% of Americans are aware that the expert climate consensus exceeds 90%. More recently, the Yale and George Mason team broke down American’s perceived expert consensus by their ‘Six Americas’ categorizations: The Alarmed are fully convinced of the reality and seriousness of climate change and are already taking individual, consumer, and political action to address it. The Concerned are also convinced that global warming is happening and a serious problem, but have not yet engaged the issue personally. Three other Americas – the Cautious, the Disengaged, and the Doubtful – represent different stages of understanding and acceptance of the problem, and none are actively involved. The final America – the Dismissive are very sure it is not happening and are actively involved as opponents of a national effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As would be expected, the Alarmed and Concerned have the highest perception of the expert consensus, with the Dismissive having the lowest, and the Disengaged not having much of a clue about the level of agreement. However, the important finding in the Yale and George Mason survey is that even Americans who are Alarmed and Concerned about climate change badly underestimate the level of expert agreement on its human cause. Some have argued that efforts to communicate the consensus won’t work – that Americans’ opinions on climate change simply break down by political ideology (realism on the left, denial on the right) and in our age of ‘alternative facts,’ new information doesn’t change peoples’ beliefs. However, numerous social science papers have found that the perceived consensus acts as a “gateway belief,” meaning that when people are aware of the high level of expert agreement on human-caused global warming, they’re more likely to accept that reality and support policies to address the problem. The Yale and George Mason data also support the notion that political polarization isn’t the only problem here. If it were, the Alarmed and Concerned would realize there’s a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Instead, they think it’s only 84% and 73%, respectively. That tells us the 97% consensus figure just hasn’t been effectively communicated to the public, and therefore consensus communication will make a difference. In fact, a 2017 study showed that communicating the 97% not only increases perceived consensus across the political spectrum, it makes a bigger difference in conservative perceptions and thus shrinks the partisan gap. And in a follow-up study, the scientists showed that consensus messaging also increased acceptance of human-caused global warming, even among conservatives. Expertise matters, and people rightly trust experts. But of course, that’s exactly why Donald Trump wants to confuse the public about the 97% expert climate consensus."
"In his recently published posthumous collection of articles and essays, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking forecast that genetic editing techniques will give rise to a breed of “superhumans” – “a race of self-designing beings who are improving at an ever-increasing rate”.  In 2017, the professor told Wired magazine that the AI “genie is out of the bottle”. He was fearful that developments in artificial intelligence will give rise to “a new form of life that will outperform humans”. To ensure humanity’s survival, the theoretical physicist thought we would have to colonise other planets and solar systems. “Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth,” he told an audience at a Norwegian science and arts festival in 2017. Hawking also had concerns about climate change, which were amplified by the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016. “Trump’s action [pulling out of the Paris agreement] could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250C and raining sulphuric acid,” Hawking told BBC News. He also thought that should we make contact with extraterrestrials the outcome might not be positive. In 2010, he told the Discovery Channel: “If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans.”"
"The connections between County Clare, Ireland and La Guajira, Colombia may not be entirely obvious at first glance. Yet the regions are linked through a shared commodity: coal. Extracted in one region and burned in the other. Coal extraction in La Guajira has a dirty secret, which I’ve witnessed first-hand: it is connected to a system of production entrenched in violence, bloodshed and environmental destruction.   Since 2001, almost 90% of coal burned at Moneypoint power station in County Clare in the west of Ireland has come from Colombia. Two-thirds of it was purchased from Cerrejón mine in Colombia’s northern department of La Guajira.  Spanning 69,000 hectares – around three quarters the size of county Dublin – Cerrejón is one of the world’s largest open-pit coalmines. It is also linked to well-documented environmental and human rights abuses for over two decades.  Ireland’s largest electricity-generation station, Moneypoint, is owned and run by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) utility company. Because the ESB is majority (95%) state-owned, the Irish government has a duty and responsibility to challenge and try to prevent adverse human rights impacts connected to the company’s fuel purchases.  As the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights put it, Businesses have a responsibility for human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business rela­tionships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts. I’ve seen the impacts. On two separate Witness For Peace delegations to La Guajira, human rights campaigners and academic researchers, myself included, documented human rights violations and the socio-environmental devastation inflicted on communities in Cerrejón’s mining zone. Our newly published study reveals that inhabitants of La Guajira have become victims of coal mining, instead of beneficiaries. It also reports parallel injustices among communities affected by fracking in Pennsylvania.  ""Embodied energy injustices: Unveiling and politicizing the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and fossil fuel supply chains"". New paper with @jenniecstephens & @stephmalin_soc Thread (1)https://t.co/Sl0lf6nLqy pic.twitter.com/XDfoECqjSv Cerrejón mine has displaced thousands of historically marginalised indigenous Wayúu, Afro-Colombian and campesino communities by physical force, intimidation, coercion, and through the contamination of drinking water and farmland. Cerrejón mine uses over 17 million litres of water a day, but the average person has access to just 0.7 litres. Official displacement follows a Colombian legal procedure called “expropriation,” where the state approves or participates in the removal of populations in zones designated for natural-resource extraction or megaprojects. But the involvement of the Colombian government does not necessarily make the displacements just or nonviolent.  In 2001, for example, the Afro-Colombian town of Tabaco was bulldozed and its residents forcibly removed by state security forces to allow the Cerrejón mine to expand. A Colombian Supreme Court order called for the community to be resettled. Following an independent inquiry in 2008, Cerrejón mine signed an agreement for the reconstruction of Tabaco. Ten years later, Tabaco residents have yet to be resettled.  In the neighbouring department of El Cesar, three Drummond mine union leaders were murdered in 2001. More recently in La Guajira, activists who resist Cerrejón’s expansion plans have received renewed death threats.  Despite the 2016 Colombian Peace Agreement, there has been a spike in assassinations of social leaders nationwide. At least 123 were murdered in the first six months of 2018. The chronic lack of transparency in energy supply chains shields coal-importing countries, shareholders and consumers from the horrors of outsourced fossil-fuel extraction impacts. Last week, transnational human-rights group London Mining Network brought threatened community leaders to testify at the AGM of Cerrejón’s co-owners, BHP. Impacted communities seek corporate accountability, and they want the international community’s help.  Calling for the ESB to stop buying coal from Cerrejón mine may initially wash the Irish government’s hands of its blood coal. But this would neutralise the government’s current purchasing power and influence to advocate for peaceful and just negotiations that guarantee basic human rights for displaced communities. Instead, the Irish government should first bring the concerns of Colombian and international human rights organisations to the Colombian government, Cerrejón mine, and its owners BHP, Glencore Xstrata, and Anglo American. It should call for Cerrejón to acknowledge its responsibility for the destruction of Tabaco, and to carry out a just resettlement per the independent inquiry that the mine itself called for. That Ireland is still burning coal – the same week climate scientists warned that the world has just 12 years to get control of climate change – is nothing short of reckless. But then, this is a government whose annual budget on 09 October failed to introduce even a modest carbon tax as a step to reducing Ireland’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The government’s plan of replacing Moneypoint power station with a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, supplied via fracked gas from the US, would replicate Ireland’s complicity in human rights violations. Methane and other GHGs leaked by natural gas pipelines and facilities warm the climate as much as coal in the short term. New fossil fuel infrastructure with 30-40 year lifespans is not the answer to Ireland’s coal problem.  Even if the Irish government stops buying Cerrejón coal, it still has a responsibility for what has happened in the past. It must repair the damages done to those harmed by climate change, by coal, and by the impacts of the transition, such as the loss of jobs for fossil fuel industry workers. Only the government can make a just transition a reality.  The International Energy Association says that “Ireland’s location at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean ensures one of the best wind and ocean resources in Europe.” A clean-energy economy can happen. An Irish energy revolution can happen. But not without government help.  Annual €200m–€600m fines for not meeting EU green-energy targets may change the government’s tune. If they don’t, maybe the Climate Case Ireland legal action will.  Noel Healy (@DrNoelHealy) is an Associate Professor of Geography at Salem State University.

"Melissa Price has said she can’t “recall the complete conversation” in which three witnesses say she disparaged Pacific nations to the former president of Kiribati but maintains the version provided by Labor’s Pat Dodson is incorrect. Under fire from Labor for misleading the House, the environment minister qualified her remarks that she “100% disagreed” with Dodson by adding in question time on Thursday that she did not recall the entire “very pleasant and light-hearted conversation”.  On Wednesday the senator  wrote to the minister declaring he was “appalled” by her remarks to the visiting Pacific official Anote Tong on Tuesday night during a chance encounter at a Canberra restaurant. Dodson says he introduced Price to Tong at the restaurant and she then said: “I know why you are here, it’s for the cash. For the Pacific, it’s always about the cash. I have my chequebook here, how much do you want?” Dodson’s account was backed by another witness, Phil Glendenning, the director of the Edmund Rice Centre and the president of the Refugee Council of Australia. He told Guardian Australia the Labor’s senator’s account of the incident was “150% correct”. On Thursday Tong told ABC Radio National that he was a little further from Price than his dinner companions but their accounts were accurate from what he had heard. “I do have a bit of a hearing problem but certainly the account they shared with me was not different,” he said. Tong said he wanted to put the issue behind him and move on, so as not to take the focus away from his work lobbying Australia on the issue of climate change. In question time, Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, asked Price: “Given it’s been 24 hours since the minister misled this House, will the minister now comply with the ministerial standards and correct the record?” In response, Price gave her account of the encounter that she had “stumbled across Senator Dodson” – whom she said she considers a friend - and went over to say hi. “He said to ‘come and meet my guests’ which I did do and I was introduced to the former president of the republic of Kiribati, President Tong, to whom we had a very pleasant light-hearted conversation. “I don’t recall the complete conversation but what I do know is when I looked at the letter from Senator Dodson which describes the conversation, I know that is not the conversation.” Price said she had called Tong after question time on Wednesday. “What I said to him is I don’t agree with the words that were reflected in the letter,” she said. “But if – if – I have caused any concern then I’m very sorry about that. And he accepted my apology.” Price noted that Tong had subsequently said they should put the matter behind them. “We agree with that because this government greatly values our relationship with our Pacific nation neighbours,” she concluded. Labor also targeted Price over an earlier answer to parliament that administration costs for the $440m grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation are capped at 5%, 0r $22.5m. On Thursday Price said the figure of 5% was correct, but added that a capped amount of interest earned on the grant principal can also be spent on administration. “The maximum amount that the foundation may use for administration including the interest component is a total of $44.3m,” she said."

"A new group of “concerned citizens” is planning a campaign of mass civil disobedience starting next month and promises it has hundreds of people – from teenagers to pensioners – ready to get arrested in an effort to draw attention to the unfolding climate emergency. The group, called Extinction Rebellion, is today backed by almost 100 senior academics from across the UK, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. In a letter published in the Guardian they say the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means “the ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.” Those behind Extinction Rebellion say almost 500 people have signed up to be arrested and that they plan to bring large sections of London to a standstill next month in a campaign of peaceful mass civil disobedience – culminating with a sit-in protest in Parliament Square on 17 November. Roger Hallam, one of the founders of the campaign, said it was calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. On top of the specific demands, Hallam said he hoped the campaign of “respectful disruption” would change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster. “The planet is in ecological crisis – we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction event this planet has experienced,” he said. “Children alive today in the UK will face the terrible consequences of inaction, from floods to wildfires, extreme weather to crop failures and the inevitable breakdown of society. We have a duty to act.” Extinction Rebellion is part of the Rising Up activist group, and organisers have spent the past few months holding public meetings in towns and cities across the country. Hundreds of people have gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the unfolding climate emergency – and what they can do about it. “It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing,” said Hallam, an academic at King’s College who specialises in social change and protest. He said the group was now getting 20 requests a week from people across the UK wanting to be given the talk. “To put it simply,” he said, “we’re fucked. From the melting ice in the Arctic to the release of methane from the permafrost, the evidence is overwhelming and people are starting to realise that. What we need now is to start working out what we are going to do about it.” The attempt to organise wide-scale civil disobedience around the looming climate breakdown comes just weeks after three people were jailed – and then released – for anti-fracking campaigns in the UK. And it follows dire warnings from the UN that there are only 12 years left to prevent global ecological disaster. Almost 100 academics – half of them professors – on Friday backed the call for rebellion. In a letter to the Guardian they state: “While our academic perspectives and expertise may differ, we are united on this one point: we will not tolerate the failure of this or any other government to take robust and emergency action in respect of the worsening ecological crisis. The science is clear, the facts are incontrovertible, and it is unconscionable to us that our children and grandchildren should have to bear the terrifying brunt of an unprecedented disaster of our own making.” Last week the US politician Bernie Sanders posted a link to an article supporting Extinction Rebellion, civil disobedience and the wider anti-fracking campaign to his 7.5 million followers. Hallam said the group was in talks with campaigners in the US about organising similar Extinction Rebellion events in Washington DC next month. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, is also supporting the plan and will be among the speakers at the launch in parliament next week. As part of their attempt to mobilise the wider environmental movement, activists from Extinction Rebellion, armed with flowers and letters, occupied Greenpeace headquarters last week. Describing the move as a “tap on the shoulder of a friend”, they wanted the environmental organisation to email its members highlighting the rebellion plan – and ideally calling on them to take part. After two hours of “friendly discussions” the group left. Greenpeace subsequently said that although it supports any attempt to raise awareness of the climate emergency it does not know enough about those behind Extinction Rebellion to ask its members to take part. But Hallam remains undeterred. The planned rebellion will begin with a declaration of demands being pinned to parliament next week and reach its peak with a peaceful sit-down protest in Parliament Square on 17 November. “After that, who knows,” he added. At the end of another organising meeting in a cafe on a west London estate this week, Hallam acknowledged it is impossible to say exactly what will happen. How many of those who have signed up will actually turn up on the day? Will those who say they are prepared to get arrested and go to prison buckle when faced with police telling them to move? Will hundreds more supporters turn up unannounced? Looking around the bustling cafe, where about half of the 30 people in attendance are signing up to take part, Hallam said: “In the end we have to realise that we will all be alone on our deathbed and asking ourselves whether we lived a worthwhile life – and for this generation the climate crisis is the overriding existential challenge. There are no guarantees but doing nothing, not trying, is not an option.” Gail Bradbrook, scientist and veteran of tax justice campaigns and the Occupy movement “For years I have engaged with this ecological crisis on an intellectual level, the mounting evidence, the science … but now I have engaged with the potential destruction of this world on an emotional level and there is a fundamental difference. There is huge feeling of grief, of loss. I found myself bursting into tears, of feeling distant with longstanding friends … but as with other forms of grief, as the poets say, you start to come through that initial shock and feeling of loss and there is a renewed appreciation of the beauty of the world, a renewed realisation that we are connected. Once you face and feel the shock of what we are facing, if you are willing to face the grief and can process those feelings, there is tremendous energy and a will to do what it takes. So that is what we have been asking people, to be willing to look at the truth of our predicament and grieve. And something is starting to change. There is a still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen. But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, both breaking from their institutions and breaking from their individual lives. For me it goes beyond the idea of protecting my life as a privileged individual, or even the idea of protecting my children’s future to a deeper need to have been a good ancestor to future generations, to know that I did my best when the big challenge came.” Alison Green, pro vice-chancellor of Arden University and UK director of the Scientists Warning public engagement campaign (speaking in a personal capacity) “I have no formal background in environmental issues and am fairly senior in my organisation. But unlike some academics I have taken the time to look properly at the evidence and have come to the clear conclusion that we are facing an imminent and potentially catastrophic climate emergency. It has led me to re-evaluate what I am doing and why I am doing it. I am a career academic but in the face of what is likely about to happen to us I have to reconsider my priorities. I have children and I feel incredibly conflicted continuing in a ‘business as usual’ national setting, getting up and going to work when just around the corner there is a future for my children that is not the kind of future they believe they are working towards. If I am honest, it really breaks my heart. I have to ask myself, can I continue to do with integrity what I am doing when I know what is about to happen? I am therefore asking myself, am I prepared to protest? Am I prepared to go to jail? And these are questions I am hoping many more people start to engage with. There will not be an opportunity for a ‘lessons learned’ scenario if we don’t act or if we get this wrong – there will not be an opportunity to repent at leisure. If you understand the science, and I would put myself in that category, then I think there is an obligation to act – we are entitled to rebel because our interests are not being met. My levels of optimism are not high and this may not work but we must have the courage to try.” Jessica Townsend, writer “I’m writing a novel set in 2030 and as I started the research on climate change, I became more and more alarmed at the disconnect between what I was reading in popular science books and what is in the mainstream media. Much of it made me feel traumatised and upset. I don’t understand how we have allowed living animals to be part of a factory process or to treat the Earth as if it was just raw materials for our industries. Technology has made the world so complicated that regular people don’t have time to keep abreast of everything that’s happening. But the ecological disaster quietly unfolding around us is just too important to ignore: we have to wake up. The last campaign I was involved in was Stop the War and I was so gutted when Tony Blair invaded Iraq that I swore I’d never do this again. But I’m a grandmother. If we do nothing we are heading for 3-4C of global warming. That will mean a superheated world, with perhaps a billion migrants, and societal breakdown. My grandson, everyone’s grandchildren, deserve a better future than that.” Rupert Read, academic at the University of East Anglia and Green party politician “I’ve taken part in civil disobedience before but not for the last 15 years. I’ve been prompted to again by the dire stakes of the climate breakdown we are now in the early throes of, and by the dire failure of our government (or any government, for that matter) to take these stakes seriously. The way that climate chaos has manifested in the last three years, with our weather systems perhaps beginning to spiral out of control, and especially the overheating of the Arctic, has been a big factor for me. The situation in the Arctic is now genuinely terrifying, because of the risk of huge-scale methane release. This is an emergency, an unprecedented emergency. It dwarfs any other emergency we’ve known, including even World War II. And we will be judged by our children by how we respond in this emergency. Not by what are, in comparison, just distractions: such as Brexit. To future generations I would say that we are trying. Those of us who are joining this rebellion, and the many who support us, are really trying. If we fail you, it wasn’t for lack of effort.”"
"The Wentworth byelection result demonstrates Liberal voter support at the next election should not be taken for granted. Many Liberal voters don’t share the government’s woefully immoral position on climate change or the way that its policies seem to be for sale.  Many Liberals want the party to change its position on climate change. Many of us can’t understand how any sensible business orientated party can ignore the obvious climate science or the very obvious climate economics. The cost of playing “climate catch up” will be greater and the loss of opportunity also greater by delaying action. Australia has a global competitive advantage in a low carbon world and it is in our self interest that we achieve this. If the party will not listen (and many of us have tried to fight from the inside) climate conscious Liberal independents will stand at the next election to ensure that Liberal voters can express their displeasure at the current position of the Liberal party. Should climate conscious Liberals stand as independents in Liberal seats and draw away just 20% of the primary Liberal vote, then many safe Liberal seats will be at risk.Many members of the Liberal party share a deep concern for the environment.Many potential members are discouraged from joining the party as they do not see membership consistent with their belief in the importance of good environmental management.We know that a healthy environment and a sound economy are both essential to our nation’s current and future prosperity. We know that we can and must preserve both our environment and our economy for current and future generations of Australians.The Liberal party has historically been a party conscious of the environment. We need to maintain and build on that tradition. This tradition is strong and includes the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Uluru National Park, Kakadu National Park, the cessation of sand mining on Fraser Island and nominations of those areas for World Heritage, and the National Heritage Trust.As Liberals we need to change the view that being environmentally conscious is inconsistent with being an active member of the party.I am deeply upset by the Liberal parties environmental position. If you mention “environment/climate change/emissions management” and “Liberal” in the same sentence at best, “don’t compute” flashes up. At worst “hypocrite” springs to mind. This is not acceptable.The prime minister’s marketing strategy for coal must end and be replaced by policies that work to secure the planet for current and future generations. A quality of life that is prosperous, healthy and environmentally sound (for the people) Clean, efficient and profitable businesses and industries (for business) Sound and enforceable environmental laws that balance the risks and opportunities of tomorrow with the profit motive of today (solid and effective law and government) Sustainable economic development for all, where the needs and desires of communities are pursued in balance with – as opposed to in competition with – the environment (achieving balance) “Real Growth” where economic targets like GNP growth are supplemented by additional measures (much as in the “balanced scorecard” approach to measuring business performance), and are calculated taking account of all social costs (including externalities and the value of finite resources consumed) Appropriate government policies, including the identification and removal of government interventions that produce perverse environmental outcomes, including subsidies (setting the right policies) After the IPCC report was released, containing scientific certainty of the complete loss of the Great Barrier Reef if action was not taken, the prime minister dismissed it like he would a blowfly. It is a disgrace. Claiming Liberal disunity is the death of the party is irrelevant. Scott Morrison is so wrapped in self interest, advertising and spin he fails to see that loss at the next election is a price many Liberals are prepared to pay if that is what it takes trigger real change to reinstate our legacy of good environmental and economic management. Remember the party can be repaired, but the planet and environment we leave our children cannot. • Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former CEO of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation"
"Young people in colourful T-shirts bearing slogans of Stop Adani, and members of Renew and other green groups, have been fanning out across Sydney’s eastern suburbs to knock on as many doors as possible – not for any particular candidate, but for a specific cause. Unlike most general elections or byelections where economic management, tax, health and education dominate voters’ thinking and candidates’ pitches, the byelection in Wentworth will be a referendum on climate change and the lurch to the right by the Liberal party.  The Liberals have done much themselves to make climate the central issue – and not in a good way. The dumping of their national energy guarantee, inextricably linked with the dumping of the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, from his job as prime minister, which ultimately triggered his resignation and Saturday’s poll, exposed the great schism within the Liberal party on this issue. It has left the Liberal candidate Dave Sharma with little to say other than that he believes climate change is real and that Australia is on track to meet its Paris commitments. But has has offered no detail on how, other than to point to Snowy Hydro 2.0, a project close to his predecessor’s heart. The Neg also laid bare the deep fissures in the Coalition between the pragmatic centre and the right wing, which Turnbull tried to bridge for three years but in vain. The well-educated voters of Wentworth, who might once have felt reassured that Turnbull would prevail, now see that the party that they have supported for 60 years is not the moderate “small l” Liberal party they voted for.  Add in a drought in Australia, record-breaking storms in the US and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warning that the world faces a catastrophe without urgent action on climate change to peg global warming to 1.5%, and it’s no wonder the issue has become, perhaps, the defining factor in the Wentworth byelection. GetUp’s climate campaigner, Miriam Lyons, says it’s not just Wentworth; climate change is now as big an issue as it was in the 2007 election campaign. That does not bode well for the Coalition at the next election. Converting that unhappiness over climate change into a vote for someone else has been the subject of an intense, co-ordinated campaign in Wentworth. A coalition of environmental groups has been working together in the electorate to ensure that voters realise they have an opportunity to send a message on climate change. The ScoMos, with lumps of coal, and the Tony Abbotts in their budgie smugglers outside candidate events are just the most visible parts of their efforts. GetUp has organised an army of phone banking volunteers who have called more than 85,000 of Wentworth’s 103,000 registered voters. “After the IPCC report came out and Scott Morrison said it didn’t apply to Australia, one man walked into our office and said: ‘what can I do?’. He’s one of our phone banking volunteers now,” Lyons says. Over the past few days, volunteers have swelled to more than 100 each night. GetUp will have literally hundreds of volunteers at polling places handing out cards that explain how to cast your vote for the environment. It gives four options: Greens, the independents Kerryn Phelps and Licia Heath, and Labor. But in a controversial move, it has changed the Greens’ recommendation on preferences, instead advocating a preference for Phelps ahead of Labor’s Tim Murray. The former Greens leader Bob Brown has also recommended putting Phelps ahead of Murray after voting 1 Greens, in a pragmatic recognition that there is a greater chance of the Liberals being defeated if she comes ahead of Murray. Lyons says GetUp’s decision on who to recommend and how to preference is based on candidate responses to surveys and a scoring process that evaluates each candidate on their promises on climate policy, and other progressive issues such as ending offshore detention. Phelps has said she opposes the giant Adani mine, while the ALP supports it, although Murray has said he will work to halt it. Several green groups also organised a candidate forum at Bondi Pavilion, which was attended by 300 people. But it received good national exposure, thanks to speakers from the conservative side of politics – John Hewson and Geoff Cousins, who were joined by coral expert Professor Terry Hughes. Hewson, a former Liberal leader, has urged voters concerned with climate change to vote against the Liberals. “The idea was to maximise turnout by getting more conservative voices to lead with the message: ‘its OK to put climate change as the top priority in deciding how to vote’,” says Gavan McFadzean, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s (ACF) climate campaigner. Hewson’s intervention seems to have been a turning point, aided by Malcolm Turnbull’s son, Alex Turnbull, who has used his Twitter account and media interviews to advocate for a protest vote against the party his father once led. He says he’s doing it because climate change is the most important issue, and while he appears to have acted off his own bat, it has certainly helped underline the climate policy void on the conservative side of politics. The ACF does not issue how-to-vote cards, but has sent its 5,000 supporters in Wentworth a scorecard rating each candidate on their environmental policies and has asked them to talk to their friends and family about the issues. The advertising has also been more conventional, and the ACF has been running advertisements about climate change and drought in local cinemas, while GetUp has crowd-sourced funds for mobile billboards that have become regular features on the streets of Wentworth. The ACF has also produced electorate-specific data on what climate change will mean for that community. It plans to replicate the work, by the Australian National University, for more electorates during the the general election. Wentworth is proving a useful test bed for strategies the environmental groups plan to use next year. “Wentworth is a trial run for tactics for the election next year,” McFadzean says. “The main challenge will be to keep climate as an issue through the UN Conference of Parties meeting in Poland and into next year.”"
"Mass bleaching and coral death could be likely along the entire Great Barrier Reef this summer, according to a long-range forecast that coral experts say is “a wake-up call” for the Australian government. The US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has forecast a 60% chance that the entire Great Barrier Reef will reach alert level one, which signals extreme heat stress and bleaching are likely.  The forecast period covers November 2018 to February 2019 and the risk extends to the southern Great Barrier Reef, which escaped the mass mortality seen in the middle and northern parts of the reef in 2016 and 2017. “This is really the first warning bells going off that we are heading for an extraordinarily warm summer and there’s a very good chance that we’ll lose parts of the reef that we didn’t lose in the past couple of years,” said marine biologist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, the director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. “These are not good predictions and this is a wake-up call.” Hoegh-Guldberg said it was particularly worrying that the long-range forecasts were already showing high chances of bleaching and mortality before March, which is the main month of the year for bleaching events. He said if the models proved accurate it would mean the entire Great Barrier Reef would be damaged by climate change and coral populations would trend towards very low levels, affecting the reef’s tourism and fishing industries and the employment they support. “To really have the full picture we’re going to have to wait for those projections that cover the main part of bleaching season,” he said. “Given sea temperatures usually increase as we get towards March, this is probably conservative.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent 1.5 degree report warned coral reefs were especially vulnerable to climate change. At even 1.5 degrees of warming it estimated the planet would lose 80% of its coral reefs. At 2 degrees they would all be wiped out. The government has backed coal power in defiance of the IPCC’s call for a phase-out by 2050. But Hoegh-Guldberg said the projection and warning from the NOAA was “very consistent with what the IPCC 1.5 degree report told us.” “It’s extremely important that politicians and our leaders stand up and make the changes we need to make so we don’t tread down an even more dangerous path,” he said. The environment minister, Melissa Price, said “like many Australians, I deeply share concerns about the health and resilience of our world heritage listed-Great Barrier Reef.” “We acknowledge that climate change has an impact on the reef,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons that Australia is working with other countries to tackle climate change through the Paris agreement, and we will deliver on the commitment to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030.” Price said that of the $443m the government had given in a grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, $100m would go towards reef restoration and coral recovery. The most recent quarterly emissions data published by the government shows Australia’s emissions are increasing."
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has issued a clear warning to Australia’s energy sector that Labor does not support the government indemnifying new coal plants against the future risk of a carbon price – noting the cost to taxpayers could run into billions. While the ALP federally has a policy of not repudiating contracts, Butler told Guardian Australia on Wednesday: “Investors need to understand very clearly that we do not support that. That would be an extraordinary waste of taxpayers’ money.”  Butler’s comments follow a signal from the energy minister, Angus Taylor, that the government could provide an indemnity for private projects as part of “absorbing” the risks currently stopping companies investing in new “reliable” power generation. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, earlier this week held out the prospect of government support for new coal-fired power stations “where they meet all the requirements” of yet-to-be finalised new mechanisms to boost investment in new electricity generation. One of the key problems preventing private investment in new coal-fired power generation is proponents have struggled to get finance because they are unable to predict future carbon risk, particularly given Australia’s decade-long partisan standoff over emissions reduction policies. Taylor told Guardian Australia in an interview on Tuesday the government would look to remove the risks currently stopping investment in new power generation. “I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment. “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment.” Butler said in response the idea that the Coalition would expose taxpayers by taking on private sector risk associated with new coal plants “which the industry itself has described as uninvestable, marks a new low, even for this government”. He warned that if the government did proceed to provide an indemnity for a new coal project to shield the investor from future carbon risk, the cost to taxpayers “would likely run to billions of dollars that could otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals”. With an election due in the first half of next year, Butler sent a clear signal to the energy sector that it would be imprudent to countenance such a proposal. “Labor has sent the clearest possible message that new coal-fired power stations have no part in Australia’s future energy mix”. “They are too expensive, and fundamentally inconsistent with our climate change obligations”. Taylor has made it clear the Morrison government wants to settle a decision about the mechanisms the government will use to underwrite investment in new generation projects quickly, and have a short list ready to go by early next year, so before the next federal election. The energy minister says government backing will be available not only for new generation projects but also for retrofitting existing plants. The idea of the government underwriting new generation power stations was proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in a recent landmark review of the electricity market. The ACCC suggested an underwriting mechanism where the government would enter low fixed-price energy offtake agreements, set at $45-$50 per MWh. While government conservatives grabbed the recommendation as a potential lifeline for coal, the ACCC made it clear that wasn’t the intention. The ACCC’s recommendation was also aimed at bringing new entrants into the market to increase competitive pressure on the incumbents, but the government has departed from those parameters. It is unclear whether any market participants would bring forward a proposal for a new coal plant before next January, and whether it would get regulatory approval. Trevor St Baker, part-owner of the Vales Point coal generator and founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power, has previously telegraphed interest if the government settles on a favourable energy policy."
