"Hillary Clinton’s pledge on Sunday to support renewable energy and boost subsidies for solar panels was set up as a great unveiling – the Democratic frontrunner’s first public remarks on how her presidency would tackle climate change.   “I personally believe climate change is a challenge of such magnitude and urgency that we need a president who will set ambitious goals,” she said in a video posted to her campaign website.  It wasn’t difficult to draw a sigh of relief from the progressive electorate that has heard only climate change denial – loud and triumphal – from Republican frontrunners. (Ted Cruz proudly announced in May that he had just come from New Hampshire, where there was “ice and snow everywhere”. Trump took up the issue with typical savoir faire on Monday, declining to call climate change by name: “I call it weather.”) But for many who study climate change, Clinton’s proposal lacked the ambition and sense of urgency appropriate to the scale of the problem. In her initial policy proposal, Clinton pledged tax incentives that would help install half a billion solar panels nationwide within four years of taking office. She also pledged that the US would generate enough renewable energy to power every home in the country by 2027. Environmentalist Bill McKibben said that while Clinton’s support for solar was necessary, it was far from a comprehensive energy policy. “Much of the impact of her climate plan was undercut the next day by her unwillingness to talk about the supply side of the equation,” he said. “Ducking questions about the Canadian tar sands or drilling in the Arctic makes everyone worry we’re going to see eight more years of an ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, which is what we do not need to hear in the hottest year ever measured on our planet.”  McKibben is not alone in criticizing Clinton’s energy policy for sounding like too little too late.  “It’s just plain silly,” said James Hansen, a climate change researcher who headed Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies for over 30 years. “No, you cannot solve the problem without a fundamental change, and that means you have to make the price of fossil fuels honest. Subsidizing solar panels is not going to solve the problem.” Last Thursday, Hansen, along with 16 prominent climate change scientists, published a discussion paper in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, where it will be publicly peer-reviewed. The paper suggests that previous models for climate change are too conservative and that a sea level rise of several meters might swallow up our coasts in this century, if governments fail to rapidly and substantially diminish fossil fuel emissions. “The economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable,” the authors wrote.  The paper was rushed to publication in an attempt to get out in front of the Paris climate talks in December, where nations are invited to bring proposals that might curtail global warming. Hansen said the problem climate experts face is that no prominent politician in the US has backed policy that has any shot at preventing an average of 2C (3.6F) of warming in this century, a widely agreed upon point of no return for climate change.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a global temperature rise of great than 2C would result in irreversible damage to society, including “increasingly dangerous forest fires, extreme weather, drought” as well as other compounding climate impacts. Despite commitments to combat climate change, under Barack Obama the US became the largest oil-producing nation in 2012, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia, by producing at full capacity. “We have two political parties, neither one of which is willing to face reality,” said Hansen, who now heads up the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions Program at Columbia University. “Conservatives pretend it’s all a hoax, and liberals propose solutions that are non-solutions.”  Clinton’s outline would put the US on track to supply 33% of the country’s electricity needs through renewables by 2027. That’s a mere 8% improvement over Obama’s plan.  It’s not enough, according to Hansen. Renewables are a part of how the US will wean itself off fossil fuels, but the market has to be allowed to determine which combination of renewable fuels – not just solar – makes the most sense in each region. “You can’t just legislate that,” said Hansen. Clinton’s plan “is going to make energy more expensive. You need to let energy efficiency and renewables and nuclear power and anything else that comes up compete.” Hansen emphasized that whatever domestic policy we adopt towards climate change has to have a global reach, a key point absent in the solar proposal. “In places like China and India, they have to move off of coal for electricity pretty rapidly or the world is screwed.” Hansen said a credible candidate on climate change would be talking about policy that would allow the price of fossil fuels to rise gradually. “You have to recognize that as long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest energy, we’ll just keep burning them,” he said. Hansen said that a president committed to halting climate change would implement a gradually rising fee for fossil fuel extraction, collected from the fossil fuel companies at the domestic mine or port of entry. In order to keep the policy revenue-neutral, the fee would be evenly distributed back to US citizens in the form of a tax dividend, completely offsetting the rise in energy costs for most consumers. Those with large carbon footprints – like the very rich, with multiple large homes, for example – would bear the brunt. In that way, market forces would be allowed to let renewables compete and lower the cost of clean energy. To incentivize other countries to do the same, Hansen said, the US would have to impose equivalent tariffs on imports from countries without a carbon fee.  “It would take a few decades,” said Hansen. “But you could rapidly phase down emissions.” Michael Oppenheimer, professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton University, who advised the Clinton campaign informally on its energy proposal, said the solar plan has to be part of a larger scheme to “crack the back of fossil fuels”. Oppenheimer took issue with Hansen’s climate change paper in the Washington Post last week for lacking specifics on how rapidly sea levels would rise, but he said there’s no doubt “humanity better get its collective foot off the accelerator”. Oppenheimer, a longtime participant in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said a combination of a strong set of incentives like solar credits have to be supported by regulation: “Just as a solar program, it is very good and it is ambitious. If you look at the bigger picture – which is, what are we going to do on the whole about fossil fuels and reducing and eliminating eventually our dependence on them? – that’s a larger question. “What we don’t have here yet is what is the regulatory scheme going beyond the Obama scheme,” said Oppenheimer. “In fact, we’re going to have to accelerate the downward track if we’re going to beat the climate problem. “That discussion needs to be engaged – and engaged quickly. I hope it’s engaged during the campaign.” Bernie Sanders is so far the only prominent political candidate to oppose the oil pipeline Keystone XL, but he has yet to present an official energy proposal to address climate change. The candidate to keep us from 2C warming? “That candidate has not yet appeared,” said Hansen."

"Britons are to be asked to pick their favourite creepy-crawly this weekend. A poll to select Britain’s best bug is to be launched today on Sunday by the Royal Society of Biology as part of its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of the nation’s insects. Candidates for the accolade include the seven-spot ladybird, the buff-tailed bumblebee, the stag beetle and the emperor dragonfly. The poll is part of a campaign that is being run by the society to publicise the plight of British invertebrates which are now suffering from the impact of a triple whammy of environmental impacts: loss of habitat, over-use of pesticides and climate change.  “There have been a number of recent reports that show that our insects are having a very bad time indeed, with numbers declining steeply and species disappearing,” said David Urry, the society’s regional coordinator. “Given the importance of insects to the welfare of our landscape, this is very worrying. The aim of this poll is to help people understand what they are at risk of losing in the British Isles.” In total there are more than 20,000 species of insects in Britain, including 3,900 different species of beetle, 2,400 moths, 60 butterflies, and 6,900 species of fly. And all, say scientists, play a critical role in maintaining the nation’s health. As Urry added: “Everything would grind to a halt if there were no more insects. For example, many crops in the UK are pollinated by insects. Without them, farmers would be in real trouble.” In addition, insects play a vital role in cleaning our environment of unpleasant waste, such as animal faeces. In the New Forest, for example, there are three dung beetle species – the dor beetle, wood dor beetle and minotaur beetle – that all play a key role in recycling dung from commoners’ stock, deer, ponies and other animals. And finally, insects lie at the bottom of the food chain and sustain all the various species of predators that feed on them. “Quite simply, insects act as the baseline for so many other lifeforms in this country,” added Urry. “They are crucial to the health of the environment.” However, that base is now being eroded in an alarming manner. The increasing use of powerful pesticides is considered to be a particularly important factor, including neonicotinoids, the world’s most widely used insecticides, which have been linked to serious harm in bee populations, and were banned by the EU in 2013. Climate change is also having an effect, while loss of habitat is also causing widespread eradication of insects. In the last case, one recent report revealed that, of the UK’s 283 leaf beetle species, three have become extinct in the last 100 years, while seven are classified as critically endangered and possibly already extinct, as they have not been seen since 1950. Overall, the loss of insect life in Britain has been alarming, a situation that is summed up by the environment writer Michael McCarthy in his newly published book, The Moth Snowstorm. As he notes, a few decades ago a car’s headlamps – when turned on during a summer night – would trigger a blizzard of moths attracted by the light. “Now, after but a short century of existence, it has gone,” says McCarthy. And that snowstorm has disappeared because the numbers of insects – in this case, moths – have been devastated by human activities. Hence the poll by the Royal Society of Biology. It has picked 10 key species of British insects to act as a guide for the public and from tomorrow people will be invited to vote for their favourites. “Our aim is simple,” added Urry. “We need to focus minds on what insects mean to this country before we are really in trouble.” ■ You can vote in the society’s poll by visiting its website, www.rsb.org.uk"
"As São Paulo, Brazil, suffers from the worst drought in its history, multinational pulp company Fibria, which is headquartered in the city, is one of many that has felt the pinch. At times, water has been shut off to 40% of the city and even now, after the rainy season, only 6-13% of the city’s reservoir’s capacity has been filled. In response, the company is working to reduce the amount of water it uses for forest irrigation. This isn’t the first time that Fibria has had to adapt to a shifting environment. Over the last several years, the rising scarcity of several essential resources – including water, fertilizer, labor and land – has pushed the company to reconsider its business model. It has diversified into renewable energy, biofuel production and sustainable real estate development. Fibria’s goal is to make these portfolio additions 20% of total free cash flow by 2025, making the company less pulp-dependent and giving it alternative options for future business growth in light of looming sustainability challenges.   It’s not hard to see why Fibria is adapting to sustainability challenges. Its business model, like those of many of the world’s largest companies, was forged at a time when climate change, urbanization, resource scarcity and rapid population growth weren’t mainstream concerns. As a result, companies were able to prioritize the financial bottom line above all else. Today, however, these external conditions have made it difficult for many companies to maintain the status quo. According to Model Behavior II: Strategies to Rewire Business, a report recently released by SustainAbility, increased urbanization is a major trend driving sustainability. Today, half of the world’s population lives in urban areas; by 2050, that figure is expected to increase to 66%. As 2.5 billion more people move into cities, they’re likely to strain food security, infrastructure, waste management services and transportation networks. Their arrival will necessitate new housing with limited environmental impacts, shared living circumstances, and the ability to quickly and safely construct housing for growing populations. Businesses are beginning to respond to these requirements. For example, the Broad Group, a Chinese construction company, is updating its business model in response to challenges associated with Asia’s swift urbanization through green building. The company has been decreasing its environmental impact by developing 90% pre-fabricated, quick-stacking modules that it can use to build safe, energy-efficient multi-story buildings. The buildings can filter 99% of particulate matter (PM2.5), an air pollutant, and are made to withstand a 9-magnitude earthquake. The impact of accelerating urbanization will extend far beyond the boundaries of cities. As rural workers, lured by the promise of better opportunities, move to cities, their migration will affect companies that are dependent upon smallholder agriculture. These companies – including Nestle, Syngenta, Mars Inc and Mondelez International – have been forced to grapple with workforce instability, which could easily lead to supply instability. Not surprisingly, a growing number of companies are adopting an inclusive sourcing or sales model, in which multinationals invest in smallholder farmers to ensure supply or a steady customer base. The SustainAbility report also identifies climate change as a major trend that is affecting all aspects of corporate value chains, from sourcing to production, distribution and sales. Some industries, the report argues, will feel these strains earlier, creating a ripple effect to others. Corporate insurance premiums, for example, are likely to increase (or disappear all together) to match growing threats from more frequent catastrophic natural disasters, such as the March cyclone that devastated Vanuatu, and sea level rise, currently threating many Small Island Developing States (SIDS) such as Kiribati and the Maldives.  According to the Ceres Insurer Risk Report, global average annual weather-related losses increased more than tenfold in the last several decades – from $10bn per year in the period 1974-1983 to $131bn in 2004-2013 – while the proportion of those damages that are insured is steadily declining. Companies are not the only ones witnessing and responding to these shifts. A cadre of institutional investors is calling for a transition to a more long term lens. For example, in April 2015, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, wrote a letter to S&P CEOs asking them to stop focusing on short term results “at the expense of long term value”. Even traditional hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones have expressed skepticism with the role of capital and capitalism in solving social inequalities and begun to look at how to address solutions through a lens of just capital. Other actors have also called for a transition to a longer term outlook. The B20, the business forum that advises G20 governments, released a report last year that highlighted the importance of policymakers when it comes to tackling the structural gap in infrastructure investment. The report explicitly cited the need to refocus investment horizons in favor of longer term returns. Some large institutional investors have also moved toward longer term thinking. Calpers, for example, the California retirement fund for public employees, in March changed its investment policies to reflect sustainability in decision making. At the same time, some foundations and major universities, such as Stanford and Georgetown University, have divested from companies with poor environmental performance. Evolving market conditions are, increasingly, rewarding companies that act quickly to adapt their outlook beyond the next quarter. For example, when Novelis, the largest producer of rolled aluminum, faced financial instability after insufficient hedging against volatile prime aluminum prices, the company turned this constraint into an opportunity. Now Novelis is in a unique position. From 2011 to 2014, it used 33%-46% scrap aluminum; in the next decade, it’s on track to use 80% scrap – the largest percentage of recycled aluminum content in the industry. As external conditions make it difficult for large companies to generate the same level of profit over the long term, business model innovation for sustainability will become increasingly essential. Business leaders who respond to and harness these external forces to drive innovation will have a distinct advantage in the future."

"An urgent attempt to study the rate at which Greenland’s mighty ice sheets are melting has been launched by Nasa. The aim of the six-year project, called Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG), is to understand how fast the world’s warming seas are now eroding the edges of the island’s vast icecaps. Warming air temperatures are already causing considerable glacier loss there, but the factors involving the sea that laps the bases of its great ice masses, and which is also heating up, are less well understood. Greenland contains vast reservoirs of ice which, if completely melted, would raise world sea levels by more than six metres. However, some influences on its current dramatic melting are poorly understood. Hence the decision to launch OMG, an acronym that the project leader, Joshua Willis, admits he “barely squeezed past the censors”.  The project will include a four-year programme involving the release of more than 200 robot probes from aircraft of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s specialist fleet. These will measure sea water temperature and depth round the island while the elevation of its coastal glaciers will also be measured in detail. At the same time, ships, including the retired trawler MV Cape Race, will be used to make careful studies of the shape and size of the fjords that channel water from the ocean to the base of Greenland’s glaciers. The information gleaned this way “should give us a better handle on understanding the [ice] mass loss that is currently going on in Greenland,” says Willis, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Greenland is the world’s largest island and is almost completely covered by ice. Scientists estimate that about 695,000 square miles of its surface is coated with glaciers, an area 14 times the size of England. (By contrast, only 135,000 square miles of Greenland is ice-free.) That coating is now disappearing at an alarming rate thanks to the impact of global warming, triggered by rising emissions of greenhouse gases. According to University of Colorado climate scientist Konrad Steffen, the amount of ice Greenland lost in 2007 was “the equivalent of two times all the ice in the Alps”. Sea ice in the Arctic ocean around Greenland has also been decreasing while permafrost in tundra in the far north has been thawing rapidly. The problem facing oceanographers and climatologists is the nature of Greenland’s intricately carved coast, which features long fjords that push, like fingers, deep into the island’s interior. The extent of this problem is revealed by the science journal Nature. According to a recent report, scientists who studied three particularly important fjords found that existing maps underestimate their depths by several hundred metres. In addition they found that glaciers flowing into these fjords were also doing so to a far greater depth than had previously been estimated and could reach the warm, salty layer of water that flows up from the Atlantic. This would make those glaciers more vulnerable to melting than had been previously anticipated. “With OMG, we are going to reveal the depth of those fjords,” project scientist Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California Irvine, told Nature. Another aim of the project is to gain a better understanding of Greenland’s glaciers on land at the island’s edge. While scientists have recently worked out reliable data sets for losses of ice mass in its interior, this task is trickier at the island’s edges, where glaciers tend to be warmer, thicker and full of crevices. Achieving a precise understanding of the mass of these glaciers will form another major part of the Oceans Melting Greenland project. “Nasa has an extensive fleet of aircraft that we can use and this project has been created to exploit these vehicles and give us an improved picture of how ice loss will be affecting the Arctic over the next 100 years,” says Willis. “By then, of course, we expect considerable changes will be affecting the planet’s polar regions.”"

"Barack Obama is setting out his vision for US climate action on Monday, and what is most striking of all is the tone. For a long time the US was considered a slow mover in taking serious steps to reduce the threat that a changing climate causes to food security, to public health and to the environment.  Obama, keenly aware that this generation of politicians will be judged by whether or not we showed the ability to plan ahead to protect the future of our planet, clearly wants to change that.  Here in the UK, the direction of travel that has been set by the government in its first few months could not be more different. In her first major speech on climate change last week, the new Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd, sympathised with “the suspicion of those who see climate action as some sort of cover for anti-growth, anti-capitalist, proto-socialism”.  She also said that the UK should travel only in step with the rest of the world, suggesting we should no longer seek to show the kind of leadership that Labour demonstrated in passing the Climate Change Act: a world first, which not only commanded an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons, with just five MPs voting against it, but also inspired action in countries around the globe.  In doing so, she forgot that it is only through leadership at home that we can have influence abroad. At the very time that China, America and much of the rest of the world has shown there is a desire for strong global action, it is unforgivable that the Tory government is showing such a lack of ambition. The areas that the US plan chooses to focus on in setting the US on the right course in the run up to the UN climate change conference in Paris this year are instructive.  Investment in low carbon energy is promoted not just because of the environmental benefits but also the economic benefits and the ability to create thousands of jobs. Energy efficiency programmes targeted at low income communities are promoted, not only because they reduce carbon emissions but because they cut energy bills. Carbon capture and storage and nuclear play a role as part of a wide portfolio of technologies that can reduce carbon, with the onus on states themselves to decide how to reach targets.  But what is most eye-catching is the political will on display. Despite an expected ‘tsunami’ of litigation, the right in America is set to be faced down by a president intent on building a consensus on tackling climate change rooted in the centre ground. In the UK, by contrast, the Tories’ creeping hostility to action on climate change, which started on the backbenches but now appears to have spread to government, is feeding through into policy changes.  Support for onshore wind and solar power has been undermined, damaging confidence in the renewables sector more widely. The green deal home improvement programme, which was supposed to be the biggest home improvement plan since the second world war, has been scrapped. Zero Carbon Homes have gone the same way despite it being far easier to reduce carbon emissions and cut bills by building homes to a higher standard than retro-fitting them. And the government are yet to commit to pushing the EU towards a tougher target heading into Paris (something we pushed for in our first Opposition Day debate of the parliament), despite our domestic targets currently being tougher.  A strong agreement in Paris at the end of the year is vital, as is a recognition that the conference should be part of an ongoing process that includes regular reviews to ensure that we remain on course not to exceed 2C warming. At the moment momentum is building internationally, a really positive sign.  Our own government needs to make sure that the gap between its rhetoric and its policy doesn’t begin to stretch our credibility to breaking point. "
"In July the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) came a step closer to reality. Formal talks have been ongoing for two years, but trying to create the world’s biggest free trade zone is no mean feat. Essentially, if passed, the EU and US will be able to trade without each other’s pesky tariffs or regulations getting in the way. David Cameron is a big advocate, arguing it could add £10bn to the UK economy. Many others, meanwhile, criticise the undemocratic nature of the closed-door talks and sinister influence of powerful lobbyists.   But what would TTIP mean for renewable energy? Currently, the only energy sources traded in significant amounts between the EU and the US are refined petroleum products and solid fuels – but TTIP could allow Europe to gain access to US crude oil and natural gas resources. The European commission has repeatedly called for the inclusion of energy and raw materials in the trade partnership, according to the European parliament’s internal policies department. Although, it adds, due to growing demand for natural gas in Asia, which is offering higher prices, fuel is most likely to flow in that direction. Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP, warns: “The import of cheap US gas from fracking could undermine renewable generation in the UK and across Europe.” TTIP also brings two significant factors into play: public procurement rules and political appetite for green policies. Protective public procurement is a major trade barrier for the renewable energy sector. Also known as “local content requirements”, this demands that companies source a certain percentage of goods and employment locally. Known as “Buy American”, this is extremely popular in the US – but prohibited in the European Union, where organisations must consider bids from across member states.  The requirements are likely to be banned for energy projects under TTIP, which Oliver Joy, political affairs spokesman for the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), welcomes. “The removal of major trade barriers such as local content requirements could potentially have a very positive impact on the renewable energy industry,” he says. Renewable energy companies would no longer be forced to “buy local” as part of energy deals, meaning they can source the best market price – while continuing to boost local economies through job creation, says Joy.  However, some fear that losing local content requirements would lose political appetite for renewable energy along with it. Concerns were raised at a roundtable held by RenewableUK, which represents the wind and marine energy sector: “If one of the reasons to have more renewable energy deployment is because it is good for [local] jobs and supply chain, how will politicians and the public react to some of the socio-economic value potentially draining to far-flung corners of the globe? This is a big dilemma.” TTIP could even undermine the democratic authority of local government. The UK’s Local Government Association representative in Brussels, Dominic Rowles, imagines a situation “whereby a public authority, whether local or national, takes a democratic decision on energy generation … that TTIP then makes easier for corporations to challenge.” The bone of contention here is the investor state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows private companies to sue governments for loss of profits connected to regulation. It is seen as a key US demand for the trade partnership. Precedents include a US tobacco firm suing the Australian government over packaging restrictions and a US fracking company suing the Québec government following a moratorium on drilling under the St Lawrence River.  “Where the US wants to engage it does so pretty forcefully”, says David Baldock, executive director of the Institute for European Environmental Policy. He questions why an ISDS provision is needed at all, given the robust nature of the courts in both jurisdictions and the “huge levels of trade already between the EU and the US”. Yet an ISDS independent tribunal which would bypass national courts (and “doesn’t sit at all comfortably with the European decision-making process”, says Baldock) appears to be strongly favoured by US negotiators.  Baldock also argues, “If you add TTIP to the language coming out of the commission about being less regulatory, lighter governance, letting states off binding targets around renewables and energy efficiency, then it is another layer that feeds … angst and lack of confidence for investors.” Chair of the UK environmental audit committee, Joan Walley, believes there is a danger of TTIP coming at “the expense of throwing away hard-won environmental and public-health protections” and that combining US and EU regulatory systems becomes a “race to the bottom” – agreeing to harmonise the lowest regulations on either side, not the highest.  Baldock believes there could also be “a chill effect”, meaning that any new, stricter regulation is less likely to pass in future. “If we’re going to have a low carbon world we’ve got to [set] more targets, more product standards, more eco design directives,” he says. “The question is how far those are going to be inhibited by TTIP and giving the Americans a seat at the table.” One significant party remains silent on the issue – renewable energy companies themselves. Many were contacted for this article, but all declined to comment on TTIP. This, one industry source said anonymously, was because “all the large companies have a vested interest in this” – in other words, free trade and reduced regulation is good for business. They just don’t want to say so on record, given the controversy surrounding TTIP and the allegations of commercial influence over democratic decision-making. The EWEA’s Joy said: “The ability to trade technology for renewables freely, without the restriction of tariffs, is a fundamental part of nurturing growth in the wind industry in Europe and beyond. Loosening restrictions on renewable technologies, which includes key components used in generators and wind turbines, can help reduce the cost of wind energy by eliminating duties. It can also unshackle those industry manufacturers and investors who are currently deterred from cross-border ventures by tariffs.” That must be balanced, as Baldock outlines, with “the US making a case for their industry and their fracking regimes, and their lighter touch to fossil fuels generally”. These issues are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. The original hoped for agreement date for TTIP was end of 2014. Now, many believe it will wait until after the US presidential elections in 2016. If agreed, it would rid the renewables industry of the regulatory barriers to trade. But whether it will accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy remains to be seen.

"In an earlier post, I wrote about some research that compared ocean temperature measurements to climate model predictions. It turns out, the models have done a great job estimating the increase in ocean heat although they have slightly under-predicted the change. What about other components of the Earth’s climate? For instance, how have the models done at predicting the changes in air temperatures? With recent data now available, we can make an assessment. I communicated with NASA GISS director Dr. Gavin Schmidt, who provided the following data.   The graph shows the latest computer model simulations (from the CMIP project), which were used as input to the IPCC, along with five different temperature datasets. The comparison to be made is of the heavy dashed line (annotated in the graph just below the solid black line) and the colored lines. The heavy dashed line is the average predicted temperature including updated influences from a decrease in solar energy, human emitted heat-reflecting particles, and volcanic effects.  The dashed line is slightly above the colored markers in recent years, but the results are quite close. Furthermore, this year’s temperature to date is running hotter than 2014. To date, 2015 is almost exactly at the predicted mean value from the models. Importantly, the measured temperatures are well within the spread of the model predictions. If we next consider earlier predictions using the prior generation of climate models, we see results below. Again, we see that in recent years, temperatures are slightly below the average of the models, but well within the uncertainty range. Furthermore, if we were to add the current 2015 temperatures, it would be very nearly at the model mean. So we see the models are doing a pretty good job. Certainly, they are good enough for us to project out into the future. I think of models as a crystal ball. We use them to see the future, albeit as a cloudy picture. While we cannot expect models to be perfect, they are good enough to help inform our decisions today.  A very good update on models is published in the US CLIVAR summer letter, available here. Gavin Schmidt’s article is pages 25-29. The lead author, Kate Marvel and colleagues investigated various reasons behind changes to the rate of surface temperature increases since 1998. They look at biases in observations, errors in model forcing, uncertainties in trends due to the short time period and they also recommend steps to move forward by focusing on seasonal or regional aspects of climate change. It is a freely available report and a short clear read.  Kate’s article doesn’t try to show that computer model predictions are necessarily compatible with observations. Their main point is to show that “compatible” is ill-defined and that differences between models and observations can arise from many different sources, none of which we can differentiate by looking at short-term global mean trends."
"Barack Obama will use all of his powers – including his veto – to defend his plan to fight climate change, the White House said, on the eve of new rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants. Obama is expected to unveil the new rules as early as Monday, according to those familiar with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plan.  The final version will give states and electricity companies an extra two years – until 2022 – before they need to start cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The delay was seen as an attempt to defuse opposition from Republicans in Congress and industry to the rules. But the White House said on Wednesday it was still gearing up to do battle over the new rules. “When it comes to the Clean Power Plan, let me say this: We will not back down. We will finalise a stronger rule. We will veto ideological riders to stop this plan and undercut our bedrock environmental laws, and we will move forward on behalf of the American people with the vision set forward by the president,” Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday. He said the time lag would not weaken the power plant rules or stop the US from meeting its global commitments to fight climate change. Power plants are the single largest source of carbon pollution in the US. The EPA rules are critical to meeting Obama’s promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 and, by extension, shoring up Obama’s efforts to reach a global agreement to fight climate change in Paris at the end of the year. “Given the president’s legacy, I can’t imagine the EPA would go through this huge stakeholder effort and not follow through,” said Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. So far, half a dozen states including Texas and Oklahoma have declared they will not go along with the EPA rules and could take the agency to court. However, Becker said many states were already preparing to put their carbon-cutting plans in place. Republicans in Congress this week attached riders to must-pass funding bills that would delay the EPA rules or block them entirely. Meanwhile, power companies, especially those that rely heavily on coal, claim the EPA rules would drive up household electricity bills. McDonough said the opposition came straight from the “well-worn playbook of scare tactics”, but he said the White House would not retreat. “There is no doubt we will be focused on all this and be forced to battle back.” The White House official also dismissed fears the EPA delay would weaken efforts to fight climate change. After receiving more than 4.3 million public comments – the most ever to any environmental rule – the EPA is now expected to give states until 2022 to start cutting emissions, according to those familiar with the final rule. Under the original draft, states were required to submit an initial carbon-cutting plan by September 2016. That deadline has now been extended into 2018. The agency is also believed to have reduced targets for some states, in the hopes of getting more support later on. The EPA is believed to have offered incentives to states that hit the original deadline – which McDonough said would ultimately strengthen the rules. “It will be stronger in many ways than the proposed rule put forward by the EPA by encouraging rapid deployment of the cleanest form of energy,” McDonough told a forum hosted by the New Republic and the Center for American Progress. However, some campaign groups were openly concerned about the time lag. Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the states did not need more time to put their plans in place. “States are already on track to cut their emissions through actions they’ve put in place,” he said. “If the EPA does decide to delay compliance timelines, I’ll be looking for assurance that the overall emission reductions achieved by the rule stay strong, early action by states is incentivized, and any delay won’t jeopardize the US’s 2025 international commitment.” The American Lung Association, which has been a solid supporter of the EPA rules, said it was reassured by reports of incentives for states to act quickly. “The final plan ... appears to be a robust approach to reduce carbon pollution from power plants,” said CEO Harold Wimmer."

"Barack Obama ran for president promising to save the planet. Hillary Clinton is promising to help people save money on their electricity bills.  In the first big reveal of her climate change policy, Clinton said she would install half a billion new solar panels by the end of her first term in the White House, and generate enough renewable energy to power every home in the country 10 years after her inauguration. “Not some homes. Not most homes. Every home in America,” she said in a speech on Monday at the main bus terminal in Des Moines. The Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 presidential nomination cast climate change as one of the most urgent threats of our time – but she was also careful to raise the prospect of freeing Americans from their monthly utility bills as part of the solution. “I personally believe climate change is a challenge of such magnitude and urgency that we need a president who will set ambitious goals,” Clinton told reporters.  The first such goal articulated by Clinton, set out in a video posted on her campaign website on Sunday night, called for installing half a billion new solar panels in her first term. Clinton set a target of generating 33% of America’s electricity from renewable sources, a more ambitious target than Obama.  But Clinton declined to stake out her position on the big decisions confronting the next president on climate change: Arctic drilling, fracking, oil and gas exports, and the hot button issue for Obama and Clinton, during her time as secretary of state: the future of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.  Clinton’s earlier position on Keystone – she said five years ago she was inclined to approve the project – has made her a target of environmental campaigners. She was heckled at an event in New Hampshire earlier this month when she refused to endorse a ban on oil and gas drilling on public lands “until we get alternatives in place”. She managed to win over some campaigners on Monday, but only somewhat, and she was rebuked by the country’s main coal lobby. Michael Brune, the Sierra Club’s executive director, said he was “thrilled” with Clinton’s renewable electricity goal, and her promise to defend Obama’s clean power plan.  But Bill McKibeen, the founder of the 350.org campaign group, said: “Hillary Clinton is half the way there.” McKibben said Clinton had made a “credible commitment” to renewable energy, but she could not dodge the difficult decisions ahead on Arctic drilling and coal extraction – let alone the Keystone pipeline . “At the end of the day, growth in renewables doesn’t mean enough if we’re simultaneously kicking the decarbonization can down the road with more pipelines and more extraction on public lands,” McKibben said. Clinton’s reticence did not spare her criticism from the main coal lobby, Americans for Clean Coal Electricity, which said it was disappointed she “would continue the dog and pony climate show of the current administration”. Other campaigners noted Clinton’s failure to spell out how she would defend Obama’s clean power plant rules – the pillar of his climate change plan – from attacks by Congress and the courts. She was unclear about how she would would pay for her ambitious climate plan – given a Republican-controlled Congress that has been hostile to funding requests for energy and research. “A lot of these changes will pay for themselves. There will be front end money needed,” she told reporters. “But there are ways of making those investments and getting a big return on those investment that will be to the benefit of the American taxpayer.” But Clinton’s first big moment on the environment showed a candidate determined to couch climate change in the populist economic rhetoric of her campaign. Obama, on the campaign trail, promised to save a “planet in peril”, and in the White House proposed climate measures that would save the equivalent in carbon pollution of shuttering multiple coal plants or taking millions of cars off the road. Clinton in contrast said her plan would result in the equivalent of rooftop solar on 25 million American homes – which was a more populist approach, said Paul Bledsoe, who headed the White House climate change taskforce under Bill Clinton.  “There is a subtle message in here that her renewable energy plan will help consumers break free of utilities while helping to deal with climate change,” said Bledsoe. “It is explicitly framed in populist language.” Rooftop solar grew by 76% last year a wave propelled by the plummeting prices of panels and government policy.  However, those pricing policies are under a sustained attack by some two dozen front groups and utility companies operating in 27 states, according to the Energy and Policy Institute. "

"On 14 August, communities of Pilsen and Little Village in Chicago, Illinois, will celebrate the third anniversary of the closure of the Fisk and Crawford Coal Power Plants. The retirement of these polluting factories were the culmination of a more than 12 year long campaign to shut down the coal power plants formerly ranked number one and third most dirtiest in the nation. As we approach the anniversary, I applaud the EPA’s push to reduce emissions and President Obama’s push for renewable energy, though I worry about how it might negatively impact my community.  The EPA’s plan will likely mean that some coal plants in my state, Illinois, will be retired. However, in Illinois, a net exporter of energy, demand for power from the coal plants that stay online could actually increase. If demand stays constant for energy or increases, and some coal plants retire due to the clean power plan compliance plan for Illinois, the coal plants left producing energy might get signals from the energy market to increase production of energy to meet that demand. So localized emissions might be even higher for the remaining plants than prior to when plants come offline. This is also possible in states with similar energy profiles. This is a big concern for the residents who live near to these polluters. While the Fisk and Crawford Coal Power Plants were running, Little Village residents – primarily Latino families – suffered extremely high rates of respiratory illnesses, including both asthma and bronchitis. A study out of Harvard linked more than 40 premature deaths, 550 emergency room visits and 2,800 asthma attacks every year to the toxic emissions from the two plants, with children being the most vulnerable to the plants’ pollution. Thousands of children and parents stayed home from school or missed work every year due to sickness. This had significant educational and economic impacts on our 100,000-strong community that continues today. In Illinois, communities throughout the state are faced with horrific environmental injustices caused by polluting industries. Long-time residents of South Chicago are fighting against the siting of pet coke, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process in the form of dust which can lead to wheezing, coughing and aggravate respiratory conditions like asthma in their neighborhood. Coal Power plants continue to operate near low income neighborhoods in Waukegan and Peoria, among others. In several areas of southern Illinois, fracking enterprises threaten to pollute the groundwater. With these local struggles in mind, it is our hope that the clean power plan will help ensure that these vulnerable communities won’t continue to be disproportionately impacted and that this process will allow for more robust engagement and access to benefits of the plan, like energy efficiency. The proximity analysis is needed so that appropriate emissions caps and limitations can be placed on power generation at the plant sites to protect the communities next door as well as targeted emission reductions at the source. This analysis becomes even more important in states looking to enroll in regional cap and trade markets that would permit plants to purchase credits as an alternative to reducing their localized emissions. The EPA is encouraging states and power plants to reduce carbon pollution by emissions trading. In these market-based trading programs companies can obtain pollution allowances from other firms who have lowered their own pollution load or by paying for environmentally friendly projects, or “offsets” – a scheme that has already caused controversy in California. These programs lead to inequities by letting companies continue to pollute as long as they can afford to by allowances.  In addition, our communities will have the ability to significantly engage with the content of the EPA plan as is being authored in each state. This means not just directing limitation of harms, but also specifying what kinds of benefits we want to see. In particular, demand-side energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs such as community solar investments must actually benefit environmental justice communities. Indeed, black and Latino communities are historically under-enrolled in energy efficiency programs despite paying for them in their energy bill. As the energy efficiency and green jobs sector expand, greater community engagement would allow for targeted job training – particularly in areas where jobs linked to the coal industry are on the decline or eliminated entirely. Environmental justice is grounded in the core principle that all people, regardless of ethnic background and class, deserve to live and work in environments free of toxic contamination. Unfortunately, many working-class and communities of color continue to be sickened and denied the right to environmental justice due to failed policies, and the inability of local, regional and national leaders to stand up for our health and the well-being of future generations. As the country moves forward on reducing coal emissions, it must ensure that it is not marginalized communities who pay the price for cleaner air elsewhere."
"Even when he wins, he also loses. Same-sex marriage would have been a difficult issue for any Coalition prime minister, but Tony Abbott played it more like a factional warrior than a leader.   After six hours of debate his preferred position won the night, but he didn’t resolve the issue because he is on the wrong side of public opinion on this (a Crosby Textor poll showed 72% support) and, looking at global trends, the wrong side of history.  Understanding the Coalition can’t go to the next election with a policy of no change at all, he now says the “disposition” of the party is to have a referendum or plebiscite in the next term, or maybe it will allow a free vote after the election. But for now frontbenchers are bound to vote against same-sex marriage, even if they are vehemently for it, if it ever comes to a vote, which it almost certainly won’t. This confusing outcome just shows the Coalition knows its position is untenable for more than another 12 months, but has been forced to stick with it to paper over internal divisions in the short term. Some victory.  And Abbott’s own tactics have inflamed rather than calmed the feelings in his party and made the defeat, for same-sex marriage supporters, even more bitter. He encouraged supporters of change to work up a cross-party bill, but told fellow opponents it would never come to a vote and that a plebiscite sometime in the future might be the answer to defeating the issue.  Then he sprang a debate in the joint party room, against regular Liberal party practice, without any discussion in cabinet, to ensure that the “anti” camp won, angering supporters who saw the obvious tactical trickiness (or as the leader of the government in the House of Representatives, Christopher Pyne, said, something tantamount to “branch stacking” given the Nationals predominantly anti-gay marriage stance).  On climate change targets, Abbott was persuaded by cabinet to adopt more ambitious targets than may have been his inclination, but not to do the most obvious things to reduce the cost of meeting them – such as allowing businesses to buy permits offshore, or setting out any clear or credible or affordable policy to reach them. His own polling said uncertainty stalled energy investment and ratcheted up economic costs. Many in the government are worried about immediately relaunching the aggressive anti-carbon tax attack, given the Coalition hasn’t yet said what it would cost to meet its own goals or convinced the public that it’s serious.  And beyond the immediate crises – including the mishandled travel expenses saga – MPs fear the “void”, the absence of strategy or policy other than dealing with the immediate problems of the day and constantly repeating the phrase “jobs and growth”. They are also complaining about the centralised control from the prime minister’s office, again. Polls are, once more, headed in the wrong direction for the Coalition. The government is veering towards chaotic process and open insurrection, with angry confusion and divisions in the cabinet and the leadership group about strategy and direction. The prime minister’s judgment and authority are, once again, under question."

"As a flotilla of kayaking environmental protesters surrounded her fleet in Seattle harbour in May, Ann Pickard, the rarely-interviewed executive in charge of Shell’s Arctic drilling programme, launched a PR counter-offensive. Shell’s executive vice president for the Arctic laid out the company’s creed of safety and assurance against the activists’ slogans. “This is not rocket science; we can do this,” she told the Financial Times. In the Seattle Times: “We’re not going to make the mistakes of the past.” The company had recalled Pickard from the brink of retirement to pull its Arctic venture off the rocks after its ice-strengthened drilling rig the Kulluk ran aground in heavy weather in 2012. Its Arctic drilling operation is now about to begin again in earnest as a key safety vessel arrived at the drilling site on Tuesday. The company will be anxious to prove that it can drill safely in the icy conditions without damaging the unspoiled Arctic environment. But despite heading up the oil giant’s most controversial project, the woman in charge has by-and-large remained away from the media spotlight. When the Seattle Times, FT and Houston Chronicle gave her a soapbox to counter the environment movement, they ignored the chequered past of one of the oil industry’s toughest political operators. Pickard has a history of doing whatever it takes in order to further Shell’s corporate interests in its most contentious theatres of operation. In 2005, just five years after she joined from Mobil she became Shell’s top executive in Africa and the head of the Anglo-Dutch giant’s significant, and stubbornly controversial, presence in Nigeria. Pickard stepped into what was later considered “the most dangerous executive post within the oil industry”. Her five years in Nigeria were dominated by a fractious security situation. The Wyoming-born executive – who often travelled around with bodyguards and a police escort – oversaw a significant escalation in Shell’s security spending and its militarised operations in the volatile Niger Delta region.  In response to an upturn in violence, Shell spent over £240m on security in Nigeria between 2007-2009, operating its own security forces complete with a network of effective informants that passed intelligence on everything from rebel movements to the health of the president to the Shell executive. Under Pickard, the Nigerian military received tens of millions of dollars worth of support from Shell, leading to awkward questions for the company when these forces were accused of brutal civilian killings in the delta in 2009. Shell have denied complicity or any control over these forces. Pickard also drew on a network of well-placed informants within the Nigerian government, according to US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks. As one cable noted, Pickard said “Shell had seconded people to all the relevant ministries and that Shell consequently had access to everything that was being done in those ministries.” Following publication of the leaked cables, Shell categorically denied that it had “infiltrated” the Nigerian government. Pickard features in numerous leaked cables from the US embassy in Abuja and is described by one US diplomat as an “experienced political operator” in the oil and gas industry.  In 2009, Pickard met with US ambassador to Nigeria, Robin Renée Sanders, to discuss a strategy to stymie flagship reforms to petroleum legislation (significant parts of which were vigorously opposed by Shell). Pickard said it would be “helpful” if the embassy could glean information from the speaker of the Nigerian parliament and asked the diplomat to “continue to deliver low-level messages of concern”. She said “she would like to keep the Embassy in reserve and use it as a “silver bullet”, in case Shell’s attempts to block the passage of the bill failed. In 2015, seven years after the reforms were first conceived, they remained stuck in parliamentary limbo. Pickard, who has played down the risks of a spill in the Arctic, had to deal with two major oil spills in the Niger Delta which led to a record £55m settlement earlier this year for thousands of residents of the Bodo community whose lives, lawyers argued, were devastated by the spills in 2008. Court documents later showed Shell were aware of major risks and hazards to the pipelines in the area, years before the spills. A Shell employee later acknowledged in an internal email that the pipelines in the area “have not been maintained properly or integrity assessed for over 15 years.”  On settling the case Mutiu Sunmonu, managing director of Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary said: “From the outset, we’ve accepted responsibility for the two deeply regrettable operational spills in Bodo. We’ve always wanted to compensate the community fairly and we are pleased to have reached agreement.” For her work in Africa, Fortune Magazine called Pickard the “bravest woman in oil”. But the WikiLeaks files suggested her true asset to Shell had been her willingness to manipulate every available political angle in order to further the company’s interests. It’s a trend Shell has continued under her leadership in the Arctic. Pickard has argued publicly against the US government’s Arctic safety standards - which are based on the rules set for Shell’s failed 2012 season. In particular she has taken aim at the requirement for a same-season relief well. That is the presence of a second rig capable of drilling down and tapping a well that has had a blowout. Pat Pourchot, who was the US Department of Interior’s (DOI) special assistant for Alaska affairs from 2009 until February this year, said Pickard’s public statements were reflected in Shell’s lobbying attempts to water down safety requirements. “They were clearly aggressive in their approach and in their desire to get permits and their desire to have terms of the permits that they felt they could meet or that served their corporate interests … They disagreed obviously with some of the permit requirements and argued, quite strangely, that they didn’t think that some things were either effective or were too expensive, or would not address certain issues,” he said. Pourchot, whose department has faced down most of Shell’s attempts to water down Arctic drilling safety standards, said Pickard came across publicly “very well” with a “good solid message of safety and concern to the contractors”. “But that would be what you would expect from a CEO for Shell who is trying to do some very new things in the Arctic and undertaking a very huge project,” he said. Shell’s decision to create a special new position for Pickard, solely focused on the Arctic, reflects its no-turning-back attitude – even in the programme’s darkest days of early 2013. The company’s $7bn (£4.5bn) investment in proving the size of its potentially vast polar reserves has been widely described as a multi-billion dollar gamble. Right across the frozen north, oil giants have been putting their Arctic projects on hold or abandoning them completely as costs have risen and oil has proved elusive, leaving Shell alone as the vanguard of Arctic exploration. But Pourchot said Shell’s bet was placed long ago: “I did think, because of their sizeable investment and the momentum they had, that they would come back again. I also think they had a steep hill to climb.” “It’s just too big a prize,” Pickard told Bloomberg in August. “We can’t afford to leave it all there.” In the wake of the disastrous 2012 drilling season, David Lawrence, Shell’s executive responsible for the Arctic, departed the company “by mutual consent” after nearly three decades of service. It was Pickard who was charged with guiding Shell’s rigs back into those highly regulated, environmentally sensitive and logistically nightmarish waters.  “To straighten things out,” said Pourchot. Pickard declined to be interviewed by the Guardian. A Shell spokeswoman said the company did not comment on appointments below the level of their executive committee.  Her public profile is so low that the most visible Ann Pickard on the internet is an English YouTube cake decorator. Since arriving back in her home country – via four years advancing Shell’s massive Australian investments – Pickard has made relatively few public appearances or statements. But in May, as activists ramped up their campaign against Shell, Pickard went on the offensive. She told the World Petroleum Congress in Tromsø, Norway: “A minority of people are using myths, misperceptions and downright misinformation to try and shore up their arguments.” Charlie Kronick, a senior advisor for Greenpeace and long term observer of Shell’s Arctic programme, said the aggressive rhetoric was aimed at neutering the environmental campaign. He said her experience in Africa, “which is definitely a pressure cooker”, had prepared Pickard well for “working in tough environments and under scrutiny from civil society”. In May, Pickard told the Seattle Times that Shell’s programme was underpinned by a moral imperative to provide energy in a world of increasing demand and tightening traditional methods of supply. “The world is going to need Arctic oil; otherwise we don’t supply energy,” she said. But the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Maria van der Hoeven said in April that under existing climate policy commitments there would be “limited production from offshore Arctic to 2040, particularly outside Russia and Norway. In that time frame, it is very difficult to make a case that Arctic developments will enhance security of supply.” Echoing her predecessor Lawrence’s fatefully naïve-sounding, pre-Kulluk assertion that drilling in the Arctic “is relatively easy”, Pickard told the Financial Times: “I don’t want to sound overconfident, because that’s not my style at all. But as I look at every little piece of what we’re planning to do ... there’s no weaknesses in our programme. [The question is] what is going to happen that’s going to surprise us?” But even as the company received its final set of US government approvals in July, one of its key safety vessels the Fennica icebreaker was limping back to Oregon with a metre-long gash in its hull sustained, reportedly, as it left Dutch Harbor, a port in the Aleutians Islands. By the end of the month, protesters hanging from a bridge managed to further delay the quickly-repaired ship from leaving dry dock in Portland. “As a hard-headed business woman, from the Shell point of view, she was the obvious pick to push through their programme this year,” said Kronick. “But it was absolutely crucial that they not have a re-run of 2012 – things at least had to look like they were going well. That has demonstrably not been the case.” But don’t expect Pickard to do anything other than continue pushing north. In Houston in May she told an audience: “I’ve made a career taking on some of the most challenging opportunities in the oil and gas sector, from Russia to Nigeria to Australia. The Arctic is no exception.”"

"The world’s glaciers are in retreat. The great tongues of ice high in the Himalayas, the Andes, the Alps and the Rockies are going back uphill at ever greater speeds, according to new research. And this loss of ice is both accelerating and “historically unprecedented”, say scientists who report in the Journal of Glaciology.  In the past year or so, researchers have identified rapid rises in meltwater and alarming cases of glacial retreat in Greenland, West Antarctica, the Canadian and Alaskan coastal mountains, in Europe and in the Himalayan massif. They have also watched glaciers pick up speed downhill. One satellite-based study, confirmed by on-the-ground measurements, of the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, confirms that the river of ice is now moving at the rate of 46 metres a day, 17 kilometres a year, which is twice the speed recorded in 2003, which in turn was twice as fast as measured in 1997. The World Glacier Monitoring Service, based at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and with partners in 30 countries, has been compiling data on changes in glaciers over the last 120 years. And it has just compared all known 21st century observations with data from site measurements, aerial photography and satellite observations and evidence from pictorial and written sources. Altogether, the service has collected 5,000 measurements of glacier volume and changes in mass since 1850, and 42,000 records of variations in glacier fronts from records dating back to the 16th century. And the evidence is clear: the glaciers are in retreat, worldwide, and the retreat is accelerating. “The observed glaciers currently lose between half a metre and one metre of ice thickness every year – this is two to three times more than the corresponding average of the 20th century,” says the study’s lead author, Michael Zemp, who directs the monitoring service. “Exact measurements of this ice loss are reported from a few hundred glaciers only. However, these results are qualitatively confirmed from field and satellite observations for tens of thousands of glaciers around the world.” The great ice sheets help maintain the climate zone differences that drive weather patterns. They provide distinct ecosystems that support precisely adapted lifeforms, from mountain wildflowers to snow leopards. They offer a source of tourist income for mountain communities and deliver spring and summer meltwater to irrigate crops in the fertile valleys downstream. And as long as ice is safely stored in mountain ranges, it isn’t contributing to sea level rise. But sea levels are creeping up inexorably every year, as a consequence of galloping glacial retreat in the polar, temperate and tropical zones. This loss of ice is not uniform: researchers recorded cases of glacier advance, sometimes of a few hundred metres, in the 1990s. But these intermittent glacial gains are nothing like the return of the ice recorded during the so-called “little Ice Age” that began in the 16th century, when the Thames froze hard enough to support annual winter fairs. The big picture is one of retreat, everywhere. Some glaciers may now be doomed. In the last century, because of fossil fuel emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, global average temperatures have crept up by almost 1C to trigger wide-scale melting. Even were the world to abandon fossil fuel use right now, some melting would continue. “Glaciers in many regions will very likely suffer further ice loss, even if climate remains stable,” the researchers conclude."
"The World Bank said coal was no cure for global poverty on Wednesday, rejecting a main industry argument for building new fossil fuel projects in developing countries. In a rebuff to coal, oil and gas companies, Rachel Kyte, the World Bank climate change envoy, said continued use of coal was exacting a heavy cost on some of the world’s poorest countries, in local health impacts as well as climate change, which is imposing even graver consequences on the developing world.   “In general globally we need to wean ourselves off coal,” Kyte told an event in Washington hosted by the New Republic and the Center for American Progress. “There is a huge social cost to coal and a huge social cost to fossil fuels … if you want to be able to breathe clean air.”  Coal, oil and gas companies have pushed back against efforts to fight climate change by arguing fossil fuels are a cure to “energy poverty”, which is holding back developing countries.  Peabody Energy, the world’s biggest privately held coal company, went so far as to claim that coal would have prevented the spread of the Ebola virus. However, Kyte said that when it came to lifting countries out of poverty, coal was part of the problem – and not part of a broader solution.  “Do I think coal is the solution to poverty? There are more than 1 billion people today who have no access to energy,” Kyte said. Hooking them up to a coal-fired grid would not on its own wreck the planet, she went on. But Kyte added: “If they all had access to coal-fired power tomorrow their respiratory illness rates would go up, etc, etc … We need to extend access to energy to the poor and we need to do it the cleanest way possible because the social costs of coal are uncounted and damaging, just as the global emissions count is damaging as well.” The World Bank sees climate change as a driver of poverty, threatening decades of development.  The international lender has strongly backed efforts to reach a deal in Paris at the end of the year that would limit warming to a rise of 2C (3.6F). However, even that deal would not do enough to avoid severe consequences for some of the world’s poorest countries, Kyte said.  “Two degrees is not benign,” she said. “It is where we put the line in the sand.” Fossil fuel companies have pushed back against the notion that climate change is a driver of poverty, arguing instead that the low global prices for coal and oil are a benefit for poor countries. Peabody launched a global public relations offensive around the notion of “energy poverty”, trying to rebrand the dirtiest of fossil fuels as a poverty cure. Spokesmen for Shell have called efforts to cut use of fossil fuels in developing countries “energy colonialism”.  The World Bank stopped funding new coal projects except in “rare circumstances” three years ago after the US, Britain and the Netherlands opposed its decision to finance a new coal-fired power plant in South Africa.  The US stopped investing in new coal-fired projects overseas in 2011, and called on lending institutions like the World Bank to do the same. Kyte in her remarks on Wednesday left some room for the World Bank to fund future coal projects – but she made it clear it would only be in the most isolated circumstances. “We have no coal in our pipeline apart from one particularly extreme circumstance,” she said."
"Scientists are still attempting to gauge what possible effects the melting of the Arctic ice sheet will have on the British weather. For example, is the Gulf Stream going to slow down sufficiently to give us colder winters and are we already getting more storms during the summer because the jet stream has moved? So, it is a surprise to see a confident prediction of one potential effect. According to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, the lack of polar ice is going to make us wealthier. This is because the opening of the sea route along the northern coast of Russia will bring us much closer to east Asia and boost trade accordingly. The only uncertainty is how soon the icecap will disappear completely in summer but the study concludes that, by 2030, the northern route will be open all year – although it could be sooner because the ice seems to disappearing faster than scientific predictions. Switching trade routes so container ships travel across the Arctic Ocean rather than through the Suez canal will burn less fossil fuel by reducing the shipping distance from northern Europe to Japan by roughly 37% and to China by about 23%. Egypt will suffer as fewer ships pay to enter the canal but trade between east Asia and the northern countries of the European Union will boom. Southern Europe will gain no advantage because distances will remain roughly the same. The researchers calculate that climate change in the Arctic will alter the pattern of global business, with 15% of China’s international trade utilising the northern sea route by 2030."
"Rich nations spend huge sums to keep the seas at bay but wealth may not save them indefinitely.  New research suggests that the probability of flooding in cities and megacities built on river deltas is on the increase and over time, the Mississippi and the Rhine may become up to eight times more at hazard from rising tides, storm surges or catastrophic downstream floods.  The study, published in the journal Science, calculates the challenges ahead for 48 major coastal deltas in the Americas, Europe and Asia, right now home to populations of more than 340 million people. Deltas are natural sites for cities: they offer direct access to the sea and upriver to the hinterland; their wetlands provided good hunting and, when drained, became fertile farmland, ever renewed by fresh deposits of silt from frequent flooding. So civilisation got a head start in the Nile delta, the Indus, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, and elsewhere.  But dams upriver to conserve water or generate electricity stopped the downstream flow of silt. The draining of the wetlands allowed the soils to compact. The abstraction of water for industry and for huge numbers of new citizens meant that soils compacted even more. The reclamation of wetlands meant that the highest tides had nowhere to go but on to the streets and into city basements. And the sea began to encroach, which meant more investment in sea defences.  In the Mississippi delta, according to another study in the same journal, the citizens of Louisiana and New Orleans have bade goodbye to up to 100 sq km of land washed away every year since 1900, and in the Netherlands, after centuries of soil drainage and subsidence, 9 million people live below sea level, behind costly sea dikes.  By 2100, according to recent research, as sea levels rise in line with global warming, coastal flooding could be costing nations $100,000bn a year. Zachary Tessler of City University in New York – a city taken calamitously by surprise by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 – and colleagues report in Science that they looked at relative risks and how these might be altered over time, not just by sea level rise and climate change and a greater frequency of extreme events, but by the things humans continue to do to lower the level of the land at the same time as sea levels continue to rise.  They found that while 340 million were directly at risk in their 48 major coastal deltas, there were also an estimated 140 million people living within a 25km radius of the vulnerable regions.  And they found that although the poorer nations were inevitably more vulnerable, relative risk continued to grow – from four to eightfold in some cases – for the wealthiest delta regions as well. These included not just the Mississippi, the Rhine, the Han, Chao Praya and Yangtze, but also the Parana, Rhône and Pearl deltas. Not surprisingly, they conclude that deltas are “highly sensitive” to the balance between sediment supply and wave energy. “Our study demonstrates that economic ability and decisions to deploy engineering solutions will be key factors in determining how sustainable deltas become in the long term,” they warn. In the Ganges Brahmaputra delta in Bangladesh and India, home to 170 million people, the surviving wetlands are up to 1.5 metres above the embanked and reclaimed land. When the wetlands are disconnected from the rivers the land no longer naturally builds up with sea level rise.  So Stijn Temmerman of the University of Antwerp and Matthew Kirwan of the College of William and Mary at Gloucester Point in Virginia, in the US, spell it out: the answer may lie in “eco-based” engineering systems to put sediment-laden water back on to the delta plains. In the Mississippi, that would prevent the loss of 500,000 hectares of wetlands and reduce annual flood damage to New Orleans and the Louisiana coast by between $5.3bn (£3.4bn) and $18bn in 50 years.  And by judiciously letting the river do the job, instead of transporting settlement by barge, or by pipeline, the costs could be reduced. "
"After tense negotiations, 193 countries have agreed the next set of development goals, which will seek to end poverty, achieve gender equality and ensure food security in every corner of the globe by 2030. “This is the people’s agenda, a plan of action for ending poverty in all its dimensions, irreversibly, everywhere, and leaving no one behind,” said Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, after the targets were agreed on Sunday.  The new targets have been debated by civil society and UN member states for more than two years. The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), which contain 169 targets, will replace the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire at the end of the year. Implementation of the sustainable development agenda will begin on 1 January 2016. The SDG targets must now be formally adopted by member states at a special UN summit from 25-27 September in New York. The UN said more than 150 world leaders are expected to attend. Included in the final text of the SDG outcome document (pdf) are plans to ensure access to water and sanitation, reduce economic inequality and take urgent action to fight climate change. “We are resolved to free the human race within this generation from the tyranny of poverty and want, and to heal and secure our planet for the present and for future generations,” the outcome document said. The MDGs, which encompassed eight goals including reducing poverty, improving gender equality and fighting HIV, are credited with galvanising global action to improve the livelihoods of the world’s poorest people. But they have been criticised for their narrow focus. The agreement has been praised by civil society leaders. Barbara Frost, WaterAid’s chief executive, said: “We welcome the agreement, the work of member state negotiators to get here and, most significantly, the overarching commitment to end extreme poverty through sustainable development by 2030.” Dominic Haslam, director of policy at Sightsavers, applauded the goals for including specific targets to improve access to employment, education and transport for people with disabilities. “We see this as a massive step forward; a wake-up call to the international community and to governments, that inclusion of people with disabilities is a principle, not an afterthought.” Helen Morton, post-2015 lead for Save the Children, said: “These global goals, if adopted and then implemented, will represent a seismic shift in how the world tackles poverty. While the MDGs were judged on what they achieved for some, the new global goals will be judged on what they achieve for all. That will drive a real focus on the poorest and most marginalised groups.” However, Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, secretary general of the civil society group Civicus, said that the true test of the goals’ success would lie in the approach to their implementation. “Without firm commitments by heads of state in September, this global roadmap may yet end up being nothing more than the MDGs plus, instead of a truly transformative plan to end poverty, inequality and environmental destruction.” Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, said the SDGs did not go far enough to reduce existing inequalities, and was critical of the outcome of a summit held last month in Addis Ababa to discuss ways to fund the SDGs. At the summit, developing countries committed to spending targets for essential services such as health and education. But the idea of creating an international tax body, which some nations saw as a means of improving tax collection, a crucial source of domestic revenue, was dismissed. “In order for the SDGs to be met, implementation and financing plans must address inequalities and human rights, especially for women and girls. The financing plan being advocated by the US and other northern countries will merely uphold the world we have and not get us to the world we want,” said Sippel. Others said improvements in the quality of data collection were vital. Diane Sheard, UK director of the ONE Campaign, said: “The monitoring of the goals needs a sharp focus on accountability, backed by investments in data collection and use so that citizens have the information they need to ensure that leaders keep their promises.” The UN has estimated that the new goals could cost as much as $172.5tn (£110.67tn) over the 15-year timeframe.

"President Barack Obama will impose even steeper cuts on greenhouse gas emissions from US power plants than previously expected, senior administration officials said on Sunday, in what the president called the most significant step the US has ever taken to fight global warming.  A year after proposing unprecedented carbon dioxide limits, Obama was poised to finalize the rule at a White House event on Monday. In a video posted to Facebook, Obama said the limits were backed up by decades of data showing that without tough action, the world will face more extreme weather and escalating health problems like asthma.  “Climate change is not a problem for another generation,” Obama said. “Not anymore.”  Opponents vowed to sue immediately, and planned to ask the courts to put the rule on hold while legal challenges play out. Many states have threatened not to comply.  In his initial proposal, Obama had mandated a 30% nationwide cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The final version will require a 32% cut instead, said the officials, who weren’t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.  The final rule also gives states an additional two years until 2022 to comply, officials said, yielding to complaints that the original deadline was too soon. States will also have until 2018 instead of 2017 to submit their plans for how they’ll meet their targets.  But the administration will attempt to incentivize states to take action earlier by offering credits to states that boost renewable sources like wind and solar in 2020 and 2021, officials said.  The focus on renewables marks a significant shift from the earlier version that sought to accelerate the ongoing transition from coal-fired power to natural gas plants, which emit far less carbon dioxide. The revised rule aims to keep the share of natural gas in the nation’s power mix at current levels. The stricter limits in the final plan were certain to incense energy industry advocates who had already balked at the more lenient limits in the proposed plan. But the Obama administration said its tweaks would cut energy costs and address concerns about power grid reliability. The Obama administration previously predicted the emissions limits will cost up to $8.8bn annually by 2030, although it said those costs would be far outweighed by health savings from fewer asthma attacks and other benefits. The actual price won’t be clear until states decide how they will reach their targets.  America’s largest source of greenhouse gases, power plants account for roughly one-third of all US emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. Obama’s rule assigns customized targets to each state, then leaves it up to the state to determine how to meet them.  In the works for years, the power plant rule forms the cornerstone of Obama’s plan to curb US emissions and keep global temperatures from climbing, and its success is pivotal to the legacy Obama hopes to leave on climate change. Never before has the US sought to restrict carbon dioxide from existing power plants.  By clamping down on power plant emissions, Obama is also working to increase his leverage and credibility with other nations whose commitments he’s seeking for a global climate treaty to be finalized later this year in Paris. As its contribution to that treaty, the US has pledged to cut overall emissions 26% to 28% by 2025, compared to 2005.  Even before the rule was finalized, more than a dozen states announced plans to fight it. At the urging of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, some Republican governors have declared they simply won’t comply, setting up a certain confrontation with the Environmental Protection Agency, which by law can force its own plan on states that fail to submit implementation plans.  Yet even in many of those states, power companies and local utility authorities have started preparing to meet the targets. New, more efficient plants that are replacing older and dirtier ones have already pushed emissions down nearly 13% since 2005, putting them about halfway to meeting Obama’s goal.  In Congress, lawmakers have sought to use legislation to stop Obama’s regulation. McConnell has also tried previously to use an obscure, rarely successful maneuver to allow Congress to vote it down.  The more serious threat to Obama’s rule will likely come in the courts. The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which represents energy companies, said 20 to 30 states were poised to join with industry in suing over the rule. The Obama administration has a mixed track record in fending off legal challenges to its climate rules. "

"Ikea will no longer sell halogen and ‘energy-saving’ compact fluorescent bulbs from September, when it switches all its lighting sold globally to super efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The move affects over 2.3m bulbs sold by the Swedish furniture chain each year in the UK and an undisclosed number in its markets elsewhere in Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Oceania.  The EU was expected to ban certain halogen bulbs from sale from September 2016 but earlier this year delayed the ban until 2018, saying LED technology would not be ready in time. Steve Howard, Ikea’s chief sustainability officer, said that three years ago, shoppers experienced ‘price tag shock’ with LEDs, but now their quality and cost had reached a tipping point, and the time was right for the switch. “If it’s right for the customer, it’ll be right for Ikea. If you can produce a product that can last 25-30 times longer and save you 85% of the energy and have fantastic light quality, then that’s the right thing for the customer.” He said the company’s scale had enabled it to reduce the cost of the plastics and other components of the bulbs. It becomes the first retailer in the UK to sell only LEDs for lighting. As well as using much less energy than halogens – around 85% – and even less than CFLs, LEDs last longer, with an average lifespan of around 25,000 hours. Ikea estimated that a household switching from 10 incandescent bulbs – which were banned from sale in Europe in 2012 – would save £300 a year on energy costs by switching to LEDs. “If you can help customers save energy and help do something towards climate change, that’s the right thing to do,” Howard said.  He said that while households and businesses had to be engaged in tackling climate change, they could only do so much and that governments had to act too. “We’ll keep going with our direction regardless. But we recognise not every business is responding [to climate change], so at a national level we need strong regulation.  Howard said it was important that government agreed a strong climate change deal at the UN climate talks in Paris later this year. “Business can do a lot, but we need good policy frameworks from governments, so Paris is important,” he said. In June, Ikea said it would spend €1bn ($1.13bn) on renewable energy and measures to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. The company has said that it will generate all of the energy used in its shops and factories from clean sources by 2020."
"Your editorial’s argument about a causal link between slowing population growth and increased economic growth (Fewer people means more carbon: the population paradox, 3 August) is dangerously out of date. In its 2014 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed how the reduction through efficiency of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels was wiped out by population increase, the real paradox being why it then offered pages of energy policy advice, but not a word on population. Could it be that the IPCC – and you – are blinded by the logic that regards economic growth as more important than carbon emissions and misery for lots of women and children?  Think what you are saying to a poor woman in India or Africa, where populations are on track to double soon. “Carry on with your multiple unwanted pregnancies, so long as you stay poor. Your capability (information and materials) to choose when to have children must wait until ‘economic reform’ brings industrialisation – with luck that won’t destroy your environment first.” And you wrongly assume a perfect market for reproductive choice in rich countries, where about four in 10 pregnancies are unplanned, four children are seen as a symbol of enviable wealth (think Beckhams), and in the UK, for example, the quality of reproductive health education and provision is not very good. The 2015 UN population statistics note that in 43 countries – including Russia, China and Germany – populations are already declining. An economic logic of fewer people consuming less stuff is beginning to emerge in practice, free of troublesome paradoxes about conserving the environment and respecting women’s desire to manage their own fertility. Moreover, it reduces the likelihood of social and economic meltdowns, which are certain if we carry on as we are.Sara ParkinPatron, Population Matters • It seems obvious that the world’s increasing population presents serious problems in three ways, as you point out in your editorial. The number of people is increasing, people are living longer, and they expect a rising standard of living. It is too strong to say, as you do, that the linkage of climate change to world population is “flawed” – inadequate certainly, but it is not an irrelevant parameter. In addition to the consequences of population on climate change, the competition for limited resources (land, minerals, energy, fresh water, fairness, etc) will surely create serious risks of conflict. Conflicts rarely solve anything, but damage resources and degrade societies. Allowing the world population to continue to rise is storing up problems. I hope such aspects will feature in the Paris meeting on climate change in December. We in the developed world hence have a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and make the technology available worldwide. We also need to modify our lifestyles to reduce impact on world resources – and find that one can still enjoy life.John ChubbCheltenham, Gloucestershire • I was surprised to read your editorial claiming that “fewer people means more carbon”. What absolute nonsense. This is a post hoc fallacy. Obviously increased pollution in a country is not a function of the reduction of the population of that country. What is true is that countries with richer populations tend to pollute more, generally as a result of their populations consuming more products, travelling more etc. Another by-product of the increased wealth of a country is that population growth in that country tends to slow down – when health improves it’s no longer necessary to assume that only a percentage of one’s children will reach old age. To claim that fewer people means more carbon is akin to claiming that the rooster crows immediately before sunrise, therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.Christopher LascellesLondon • Your editorial fails to recognise climate change’s complexity. Carbon per capita may well increase with economic prosperity, but carbon emissions are still a function of total population and are increasing fastest in underdeveloped countries. Every extra mouth has to be fed, and agriculture is one of the main producers of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore it isn’t just carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change. Methane, generated from raising livestock as well as rice fields, is the second most important greenhouse gas. It has risen from 500 parts per billion (ppb) to about 1,800 ppb and is currently increasing by 6 ppb per annum. This is not all due to agriculture, but to argue that population growth will not impact on climate change is highly misleading.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • You suggest that retaining high fertility rates in the poorest countries would help prevent climate change by slowing industrialisation. But, even if this analysis were correct, what cost would such a policy have to those living in those countries? The idea of sensible population policies is to allow the poorest to move out of poverty while minimising the effect on climate change.Martin EarlLondon • Your conclusion that “focusing on population growth could actually accelerate the global environmental problems it claims to address” could better include David Attenborough’s published view that “there is no major problem facing our planet that would not be easier to solve if there were fewer people and no problem that does not become harder – and ultimately impossible to solve – with ever more”.Timothy CrawleyWaterlooville, Hampshire"

"The White House insisted on Sunday it was on strong legal footing as it unveiled details of ambitious carbon reduction plans that are likely to be fiercely opposed by coal-burning Republican states.  Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), told reporters the Obama administration’s goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from US power plants by 32% between 2005 and 2030 kept squarely “within the four corners” of the Clean Air Act. The US supreme court determined in 2007 that this anti-pollution legislation, which was originally aimed at mercury and sulphur emissions, could be used to tackle greenhouse gases too. But the Obama administration’s decision to tackle climate change by introducing new rules through amending pollution regulation rather than an attempt to pass so-called “cap and trade” legislation or implement a carbon tax has been attacked by several states, who plan a series of legal challenges. Similar administration attempts to circumvent opposition in Congress with executive actions on immigration reform have become bogged down in the courts. The 2007 supreme court ruling on the Clean Air Act, however, gives environmentalists hopes that carbon reduction efforts may prove more resilient. Speaking to reporters on Sunday ahead of a formal announcement of the new carbon rule by Barack Obama on Monday, White House adviser Brian Deese said the new EPA rules represented the “biggest step that any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fuelling climate change”. A White House statement said: “Taken together these measures put the United States on track to achieve the president’s near-term target to reduce emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, and lay a strong foundation to deliver against our long-term target to reduce emissions 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.” Crucially, the US hopes that leading by example will put it in a stronger position to negotiate international reductions at the Paris climate conference in December and build on bilateral talks with China and Brazil. Later this month, Obama will make trips to Nevada and the Alaskan arctic – the latter the first by a sitting president – to talk up renewable energy investments and the threat from climate change ahead of a US visit by Pope Francis in September. The pope has also backed the moral imperative of carbon-reduction strategies. Details of the US rules, which began emerging over the weekend but were announced formally on Sunday afternoon, confirm slightly higher targets for carbon reduction than were envisaged in draft proposals last year, at a cost of $8.4bn. McCarthy said the higher target was mainly because renewable energy investment and efficiency gains among electricity customers were improving faster than expected. She stressed that the EPA had listened to industry concerns in its decision to allow an extra two years to phase in the new rules and to lower the target for mandatory carbon capture equipment in coal plants. The administration argues that its approach leaves it up to individual states to determine if overall carbon emissions can be best reduced on the demand side, through making existing plants more efficient or by swapping coal generation for renewable sources, nuclear and gas.  “They can cut carbon pollution in whatever way makes sense for them,” said McCarthy. Nonetheless, the administration stuck to its uncompromising position on the overall necessity of the rule change. “Over the next few days we will hear the same tired old plays from the old special interests playbook,” said McCarthy, who argued “climate change is personal”. Republican candidates to replace Obama in the White House were quick to express their opposition to the move. “President Obama’s carbon rule is irresponsible and overreaching,” said the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, in a statement. “The rule runs over state governments, will throw countless people out of work, and increases everyone’s energy prices.” The Florida senator Marco Rubio followed a similar line. “A lot of what these people are advocating for would hurt our economy badly,” he said. “If you’re a single mom in Tampa, Florida and your electric bill goes up by $30 a month, that is catastrophic.”"

"Following the post of my colleague, Dana Nuccitelli on misreporting of ice trends, this article is a timely guest post by Neven Acropolis who runs the Arctic Sea Ice blog. “After the record smashing 2012 melting season had ended, Arctic sea ice watchers awaited the following melting season with a mix of anticipation and apprehension. Anticipation, because the annual ebb and flow of Arctic sea ice is one of the most spectacular natural events on the planet, accentuated by the dramatic loss of the past 30 years. Apprehension, because further losses would bring the Arctic yet one step closer to virtually ice-free conditions, an iconic image entailing many unpredictable consequences.  But just as the previous record low reached in 2007 was followed by a short-lived rebound, the 2013 melting season proved to be sufficiently cold and cloudy to make up for the large amount of thin first year ice in the Arctic. When the following 2014 melting season was relatively cold again, with little wind to compact the ice and transport it to lower latitudes, extent and area numbers yet again ended up well above 2012 levels. Consequently, this year’s melting season started out with more volume and more multi-year ice. The ice age distribution map below shows how much more multi-year ice there was at the start of this melting season, compared to 2012: The first two months of the melting season, May and June, are thought to play a crucial role in how much ice is left in September. The idea is simple: melt ponds that first show up during May and develop further during June, precondition the ice for the rest of the melting season by lowering the pack’s albedo and thus soaking up more solar radiation.  This in turn increases so-called melting momentum, which can sustain a high rate of decrease during the second half of the melting season, even if weather conditions aren’t perfect for melting, compaction and transport. Conversely, if melting momentum is low, chances of new September records are minimal, unless weather conditions during July and August favour huge losses. Scientists are trying to quantify this influence; not an easy task given the many phases between water and ice and a lack of uniformity across the ice pack. Some researchers try to decipher satellite observations (see Rösel et al 2011), others use models to simulate melt pond cover based on atmospheric data (see Schröder et al 2014). This year the melting season started out relatively cold during May and it took quite a while for melt ponds to start forming on the ice pack surface. At the end of June, slightly more preconditioning seemed to have taken place compared to 2013 and 2014, because overall temperatures were somewhat higher than in the two prior years. But the amount of melt ponds simply didn’t come close to that of big melting years like 2007 and 2012. Any expectation of 2015 ending up close to record territory despite having more multi-year ice and volume, was effectively put on ice. However... As said, despite the importance of preconditioning for the second half of the melting season, exceptional weather conditions can still turn the tables by building up melting momentum. And that’s exactly what the Arctic has seen in the past few weeks.  Sunny weather and anomalously warm temperatures have dominated large parts of the Arctic, most importantly those areas where a lot of the thicker multi-year ice has been moved to during winter. The impact is slowly, but surely showing up on sea ice concentration maps, graphs and satellite image.  There is still virtually no chance of 2015 beating the 2012 record, but something more important for the longer term could be happening. If this weather keeps up – and according to the current forecasts, it will for at least another week – that thicker multi-year ice could receive such a beating that the slight rebound from record low levels is essentially wiped out by the time winter sets in again.  On top of that, it looks highly probable that both the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route open up again simultaneously, a previously rare, but now frequent event.  Last week a research paper was published showing how Arctic sea ice volume had rebounded after the crash of 2012. It’s too early tell, but if this rebound does get wiped out, the Arctic will remain poised for larger losses, as soon as conditions are right for large-scale melting. We’ll know more come September.” So thanks for that explanation Neven. To summarize, each year has its own flavor, preconditioning, and shorter term weather patterns that can affect the summer ice extent. Consequently, there are short-term fluctuations that are superimposed upon a long-term trend for decreasing ice.  The notion that the Arctic ice decline has somehow halted or that the ice has recovered simply ignores these facts. I looked at the Arctic Data Archive here and I see that Neven’s comments about recent weather are right on the mark. 2015 ice has decreased quickly over the past two months. We probably won’t see a new record this year, but it looks like the long-term trend of decrease is continuing."
"Your timely editorial about the need to improve our knowledge of the ocean (8 August) rightly stresses the responsibility of political leaders to create the means to find out more about the 70% of the planet covered by the ocean. But it is not only in the physical, biological and chemical sciences that we must improve our knowledge. There are large gaps in our knowledge about the economic and social aspects of human interactions with the sea. In 2002 the UN general assembly accepted the need for “a regular process for the global reporting and assessment of the marine environment, including socioeconomic aspects”, as recommended by the 2002 Johannesburg world summit on sustainable development. Implementing this immense and novel project has been a slow and, at times, difficult task.  Later this year World Ocean Assessment I will be presented to the general assembly. In 55 chapters, this reviews all aspects (environmental, social and economic) of the ways in which the ocean supports life, its role in providing food security, the other ways in which humans exploit the ocean, our current ways of studying the seas, the status of marine biodiversity in all parts of the ocean (including special studies of crucial species and habitats), the problems of assessing humans’ impacts on, and benefits from, the ocean and, most importantly, the gaps that exist both in our knowledge and in the capacities to learn about the seas and manage human impacts on them. This will provide governments and intergovernmental organisations, both global and regional, with a common basis on which to take decisions on how to deal with the critical issues concerning the ocean, including filling the knowledge gaps to which you draw attention.Alan SimcockJoint coordinator, UN group of experts of the regular process (World Ocean Assessment I) • You are absolutely right to focus on the plight of the indigenous tribes living in the Peruvian Amazon (Environment, 29 July). Unless President Humala puts the rights of these vulnerable people above industrial gain, we will see them eradicated by deforestation and illegal mining, and the biodiversity of the region greatly compromised. Making the Sierra del Divisor a protected zone will go some way towards honouring this government’s commitment to eradicate deforestation completely by 2021 and show its genuine commitment to the environment and our battle against climate change. It must act now.Nigel RosserCharlbury, Oxfordshire "
"Pope Francis has established an annual day of global prayer “for the Care of Creation” to boost support for the environment, the Vatican said on Monday. The first day of prayer next month coincides with the build-up to a global conference to roll back the peril of climate change.  “I wish to inform you that I have decided to institute in the Catholic Church the ‘World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation’ which, beginning this year, is to be celebrated on 1 September,” the pope said in a letter released by the Vatican. Francis said he had been inspired by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, who have been praying for the environment on that date since the late 1980s. “The celebration of this day, on the same date as the Orthodox Church, will be a valuable opportunity to bear witness to our growing communion with our Orthodox brothers and sisters,” the Pope said. “We live at a time when all Christians are faced with the same decisive challenges, to which we must respond together, in order to be more credible and effective.” The prayer day “will offer individual believers and communities a fitting opportunity to reaffirm their personal vocation to be stewards of creation” and reflect upon “the adoption of appropriate lifestyles,” the letter said. Francis has become a leading defender of the environment, particularly in the fight against climate change. He published an environmental encyclical earlier this year which denounced exploitation of the poor and waste of the planet’s resources. He is due to address the UN Special Summit on Sustainable Development in September. That gathering comes amid efforts to forge a worldwide deal on climate change in Paris in December, with the aim of limiting global warming to 2C over pre-industrial levels."
"Pimps, prostitutes, messages from God, border walls and a child who is “a total superstar”. The questions of the first Republican primary debate ranged far and wide on Thursday night, but for all the talk of healthcare, immigration, benefits and war, a conspicuous silence reigned over some of the issues most sensitive to conservative voters.  A day after a gunman attacked a movie theater in Tennessee, two weeks after a gunman murdered two young women in a Louisiana theater, three weeks after a gunman killed four marines in Chattanooga, and less than two months after a gunman shot nine people dead in a South Carolina church, the Republican National Committee and Fox News held the first presidential debate in a “gun-free zone”.  Although the RNC, Fox News and Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena banned guns from the stadium – a decision praised by gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety – the moderators asked no questions about gun control to the 10 leading Republican candidates.  Gun control remains anathema to the majority of Republican voters, especially those most likely to vote in primary elections that tend to draw more conservative elements. Enshrined in the constitution, gun rights have been sacrosanct to many Americans for decades, and voters have increasingly turned away from gun control.  To suggest anything other than mental health checks – and possibly background checks – is blasphemy for Republican candidates, who mostly recite pro-gun scripture that people, and not guns, kill. With the NRA always watching, lobbying and making hefty contributions to conservatives, neither Fox nor the candidates have cause to broach the issue. Although the leading candidates have mostly turned away from denying global warming, the problem – described as an imminent threat to humankind by international experts and even the pope – never came up during the two-hour main debate. Moderators of the early debate for seven low-polling candidates did mention climate change to senator Lindsey Graham, but only to criticize him. “You worked with Democrats and President Obama when it came to climate change,” Fox moderator Bill Hemmer asked. “How can they trust you based on that record?” Graham turned his answer into an attack on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but did not deny the reality of global warming. “When I get on the stage with Hillary Clinton, we won’t be debating about the science,” he said.  “In her world, cap-and-trade would dominate, that will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment. In my world, we would focus on energy independence and a clean environment.” Most of the undercard candidates said they would rescind Barack Obama’s executive actions on climate change. Chris Christie has said he believes humans cause climate change; Jeb Bush and Rand Paul have said they accept that the climate is changing, but not that humans are responsible; Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker have shied from any conclusive statements; Mike Huckabee has dismissed the dangers of “a sunburn”; and Donald Trump said last month he’s “not a huge believer in the global warming phenomenon”. Except for related issues on which the candidates are of one mind – rolling back EPA regulations, support for fracking and the Keystone XL pipeline – talk of climate change remains radioactive for candidates who want to appeal to conservatives who deny the science, the skeptics (including billionaire Charles Koch) and the voters who believe the research. No candidate wants to look like a luddite, but nor do they want to invite comparisons with Democrats like Obama and Clinton or Republican environmentalists like Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. Republicans have proven as amenable to reforming the criminal justice system as Democrats in the last year, backing plans to overhaul the prison system and drug sentencing laws that have left minor, nonviolent offenders in prison for decades. But the United States’ crowded, chaotic prison system, the largest in the world, was not mentioned in either debate, meaning candidates did not have to choose between looking tough, magnanimous or fair. Police and race issues were briefly mentioned in the main debate, in questions to Scott Walker and Ben Carson. Walker emphasized more thorough training to prevent police abuses, and said that the officers who commit abuses should face the full force of the law. Carson said he was disinterested in race issues, saying: “It’s time for us to move beyond that.” But the debate essentially ignored the Black Lives Matter movement, institutional racism and its symbols (eg the Confederate battle flag), the steady increase of unarmed people killed by police, and the militarization of police departments and their cultures. The fuel of contemporary politics – massive amounts of “dark money” driving campaigns – was never an intentional debate point, but the ugly gears of contemporary politics were exposed in one brief, surreal exchange, when Rand Paul accused Trump of “buying politicians” over the years. Trump shot back that he had donated to most of the Republicans too, and several of the candidates started shouting denials or equivocations about whether the billionaire had ever contributed to them. Trump bluntly admitted he gave to politicians on a pure quid pro quo basis – that he expected favors down the line for giving donations.  He said that Hillary Clinton, for instance, came to his wedding because she owed him for the money. In the span of a few minutes Trump both bragged about his success as a creature of money in politics and also portrayed himself as an outsider able to shake up the Washington establishment. In contrast, Vermont senator and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has tried to make campaign finance a major issue, railing against the supreme court decision that allowed special organizations unlimited cash to funnel into campaigns. Finally, neither the candidates nor the moderators showed any awareness that the former secretary of state is running against Sanders, a former governor and a former senator, and may soon face vice-president Joe Biden.  Most of the candidates even held back against Obama, denouncing his policies but reserving their ad hominem attacks for Clinton. The concerted attack against Clinton has had little apparent consequence on her campaign, although Americans have increasingly disliked Clinton since she officially announced her candidacy."

"Australia’s 20 biggest polluters will be able to significantly increase their greenhouse gas output despite being covered by the Abbott government’s so-called “safeguard mechanism” and will wipe out most of the emission reductions the government intends to buy from other sectors, according to new analysis which brands the Coalition policy “untenable”. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, says the “safeguard mechanism” – to be imposed on 150 big emitters and announced in detail later this month – will ensure that emissions reductions purchased through the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund (ERF) from things like avoided land clearing or energy efficiency are not displaced by a significant rise in emissions elsewhere in the economy.  But the RepuTex market analysis firm has found the proposed curb on electricity generation and industrial emissions is so “lenient” that only about 30 companies, such as airlines and transport firms, will be forced to reduce their emissions at all, and then only by a relatively modest 29m tonnes between 2016 and 2025. Over that same timeframe the biggest emitters, including the dirtiest brown coal-fired power stations such as Loy Yang A and B, Hazelwood and Yallourn, will be able to increase their emissions by 150m tonnes – cancelling out most of the emissions reductions achieved in other parts of the economy by the government’s policy. “In light of the ineffectiveness of the scheme, it is untenable for government policy to stay in its current form, particularly with the steepest increase in Australia’s emissions to occur in the next four years. Moreover, it is counter-intuitive to let emissions grow while at the same time implementing a more ambitious post-2020 target,” the research says. “The safeguard mechanism is expected to fail to ‘safeguard’ the ERF investment, with abatement purchased by the ERF expected to be fully displaced by a significant rise in emissions elsewhere,” it says. The government is set to announce deeper post-2020 emission reduction targets when parliament resumes, but has not said how it intends to meet them. Hunt has, on occasions, said the safeguards mechanism could be tightened to force electricity generators and industry to reduce emissions more.  But doing that would set up a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme, imposing costs on industry and generators that would be passed through to consumers – cutting across the government’s attack on Labor’s promise to re-introduce an emissions trading scheme. “Ahead of the release of Australia’s new post-2020 emissions reduction target, the report places further pressure on the government to explain how it will curb emissions growth,” said Reputex’s executive director, Hugh Grossman. “It is inevitable that tighter baselines, or a cap on emissions, will ultimately be set, particularly given the significant abatement task we are likely to face to meet our new emissions target,” said Grossman. But in internal government discussions the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and his office have been very concerned the safeguards mechanism could never turn into a de facto carbon price or a cost burden on emitting industries. When the details of the safeguards mechanism were released, the independent senator Nick Xenophon, who provided one of the six votes the government needed to get Direct Action through the Senate last July, said it had been “neutered” and accused the government of reneging on promises it made to secure his vote. “Direct Action has no point if it does not have an effective safeguards mechanism, and what the government has released seems like a try-on,” he said. “It goes against what they promised me in the discussions before the vote. I was assured this safeguards mechanism would have real teeth. “There is no point in the government spending $2.55bn if there is no requirement to cap or reduce emissions from industry.”"

"The majority of British people are worried about global warming, a poll has found, with flooding and sea level rise topping the list of fears for what rising temperatures will bring. A survey of more than 2,000 people found more than half (57%) were worried about global warming, with one in seven of those quizzed, or 14%, very worried about the issue. Almost two thirds (64%) thought global warming was already a problem, and seven out of 10 (70%) agreed it was going to be a problem in 20 years’ time, the poll by ICM Unlimited for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (Imeche) found. Flooding and sea level rise was the highest climate concern, with 63% citing it as a worry, while 60% said they feared extreme weather such as hurricanes and cyclones and more than half (53%) were concerned about droughts and water shortages. Asked what the most effective way of tackling man-made climate change would be, a quarter of respondents said switching to energy that produced less carbon was best, while 15% said all electricity should be changed to renewables and 15% backed cutting down energy consumption. But there was a split on increasing taxes on products that cause more pollution and carbon emissions, with 52% opposing the move and 48% backing it. Dr Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at Imeche, said: “Since the 2008 economic crash, climate change has drifted down the political agenda. “But these results show that it is an issue that still worries the majority of people. “As we’ve seen in recent years, the UK is particularly susceptible to flooding and sea level rises, and this is something we are likely to see more of unless urgent action is taken to prevent and adapt to climate change. “With the UN climate change talks in Paris just four months away and speculation mounting over cuts to public spending, government needs to clarify how the UK will meet its ambitious carbon reduction targets.” She said the cheapest energy options remained the high-carbon ones, and allowing the market to drive energy options could lead to the “worst case” in terms of pollution. The government should detail how it will step up efforts wind down coal power plants, she added."
"It is the development conundrum of our era. Extremely poor people cannot lift themselves out of poverty without access to reliable energy. More than a billion people live without power today, denying them opportunities as wide-ranging as running a business, providing light for their children to study, or even cooking meals with ease. Ending poverty requires confronting climate change, which affects every nation and every person. The populations least able to adapt – those that are the most poor and vulnerable – will be hardest hit, rolling back decades of development work.  How do we achieve the dual goals of expanding energy production for those without power and drastically reducing emissions from sources such as coal that produce carbon dioxide, the primary contributor to climate change? There is no single answer and we cannot ask poor communities to forego access to energy because the developed world has already put so much carbon pollution in the air.   An array of policies and programs backed with new technology and new thinking can — if combined with political will and financial support — help poor populations get the energy they need while accelerating a worldwide transition to zero net carbon emissions. The World Bank Group’s focus is on five key areas: building low-carbon, climate resilient cities; moving forward on climate-smart agriculture; speeding up energy efficiency and investment in renewable energy, including hydropower; supporting work on ending fossil fuel subsidies; and developing carbon pricing to increase the cost of emissions. Such an approach depends on decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. We have to keep economies growing to bring shared prosperity for all, but we also have to bring down greenhouse gas emissions.  We are seeing change: countries are shifting from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy with massive new investments in well-known types of renewables, like hydropower, geothermal, solar and wind. Between 2010 and 2012, the uptake of modern renewable energies grew by 4% globally. East Asia led the charge, representing 42% of new renewable energy generation.  In countries like Bangladesh and Mongolia small scale solar power is dramatically changing the lives of poor people, lighting up their homes with low-cost solar systems. As part of the government’s sustainable development strategy, more than 3.5m solar homes systems have been installed in rural Bangladesh, creating 70,000 direct jobs.  Morocco is setting an example for the African continent. It has a renewable energy target of 42% of total electrical capacity by 2020, has recently established an agency dedicated to solar energy and is working to develop a “super grid” that integrates solar power, wind power, hydropower and biomass. Renewable energy investment in Morocco grew from $297m in 2012 to $1.8bn in 2013, due in part to reduced fossil fuel energy subsidies. From an investment perspective, a global focus on low-carbon or carbon-free energy production also means that continuing to pollute will cost more. We’re running out of room for how much carbon we can emit into our atmosphere, so every ton emitted is becoming more expensive. There are now about 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces using or planning to use a price on carbon to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. Altogether, these initiatives are valued at almost $50bn.  Increasingly, we are hearing the voices of business calling for a price on carbon and investing in clean energy sources.   Green bonds are also on the rise. A new report shows the World Bank (IBRD) has issued 100 green bonds in 18 currencies, raising the equivalent of $8.4bn. The investments are targeting low carbon and climate resilient growth in countries. Two energy efficiency projects in China, supported by green bonds, are estimated to reduce 12.6m tons of carbon dioxide annually – equivalent to taking 2.7m cars off the road each year. Our private sector arm, IFC, has to date, issued a total of $3.9bn in green bonds. The Bank and IFC helped pioneer the green bond market, with the global green bond market now worth about $38bn.   And as we head towards December’s climate change conference in Paris, we’re seeing clear signs that in the halls of government, debate has shifted from the offices of ministers of the environment warning about climate change to the offices of ministers of finance assessing the likely price tag of dealing with and adapting to climate change.  We know the cost of inaction is much greater. We already face the certainty of rising oceans, shifting weather patterns and resulting human migrations, all with a toll of trillions of dollars and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.  Increasing extreme weather events – drought, storms and wildfires – are already exacting a heavy cost. Pollution takes a toll on people’s health as well as straining public purses. Developed and fast-developing governments need to make their economies and energy systems more efficient and wean themselves off the practices of the past. At the same time, we need to extend access to energy to the world’s poorer populations and do so as cleanly as possible. For the developing world, this moment represents an opportunity. The challenge is to build economies that are competitive without carbon. Let’s keep our eyes on the prize."

"The governments of the UN’s 193 member states are gearing up to select a set of development and environmental targets for the next 15 years to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs) that expire this year. These targets will influence the £1.6tn in development aid the OECD predicts will be needed by 2030 and countless trillions in national budgets – as well as set the tone for corporate green spending.  Together with targets focusing on poverty, health, hunger and education, environmental targets are on the shortlist. These range from relatively niche (“devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism”) to very ambitious (“endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation”).  After a process of haggling and horse-trading, the UN has a working list of 169 targets – a whopping 151 more than the 18 MDGs that I believe changed the world. This is a mistake. Having 169 priorities is like having no priorities at all. My thinktank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, asked 60 teams of top economists, including Nobel laureates Finn Kydland and Thomas Schelling, to evaluate the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the proposed targets. Their analysis highlights some of the best investments we could make for the planet, guiding policymakers, philanthropists and socially-minded businesses. Economic analysis shouldn’t be the only tool that we use, but it is a vital input to help decision-makers – whether politicians or business leaders – to make informed decisions. Among the environmental goals, the economists’ analyses show that reducing indoor air pollution, cutting coral reef loss and increasing energy research and development are among the most cost-effective targets.  Indoor air pollution is the world’s deadliest environmental problem but one that is often overlooked. It killed 4.3 million people in 2012, according to recent World Health Organisation calculations, mainly because 2.7 billion people still use firewood, dung and coal for cooking and keeping warm, breathing polluted air inside their homes every day.  An effective investment would be to provide 30% of the current unserved population with improved cooking stoves – those that dispel smoke outside through chimneys and vents, and operate with LNG or LPG instead of burning wood and dung. These would lead to less indoor air pollution, while reducing fuel costs and time spent collecting wood. This would not be cheap – the cost is estimated at around £7bn a year. But calculating the benefits, both from avoided deaths and time and money spent, works out at £103bn a year. In other words, every pound spent on smart improvements to indoor air pollution would do almost £15 worth of good. By raising consumer awareness about household air pollution and stimulating the demand for affordable cookstoves, businesses could help develop a thriving market for cleaner and more efficient stoves and fuels. Among the many proposed goals to improve biodiversity, the economists highlight stemming the loss of coral reefs as very effective. Coral reefs are vital both for fishing – they’re a home for marine life – and tourism. Halving global coral loss by 2030 would cost about £1.9bn a year but the total benefits are likely to run to at least £46bn, or about £24 back for every pound invested. Business has a significant role to play. The fishing industry, for example, needs to be informed that abstaining from destructive practices such as dynamite fishing will eventually be profitable for them, since coral reefs act as vital fish hatcheries.  To tackle the overarching topic of climate change, a key proposed development target is to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. While this will bring significant environmental, economic and social benefits – £265bn annually in energy and climate change effects – it comes at an annual cost of £329bn, largely in subsidies. This solution will return less than a pound for every pound spent because the technologies are still immature and intermittent. Both the private sector and governments need to invest more in research. The development of better energy technology – in areas including storage, transmission and distribution – is an effective goal. A focus on R&D in energy technologies can help create green energy solutions that would be effective enough to take on fossil fuels in the market. This could be funded with a slowly rising carbon tax (giving businesses an incentive to cut emissions but not telling them how to do it). In total, this solution could avoid £11 of climate damages for every pound spent.  Another effective goal would be to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Globally, £351bn is wasted on such subsidies, almost exclusively in developing countries. This drains already-stretched budgets of resources that could be used to provide health and education services, while encouraging more pollution and greater carbon-dioxide emissions.  Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies has benefits 15 times the cost, with benefits to national budgets as well as to climate change and air pollution. When selecting environmental targets for the world, both businesses and politicians should pick them, not for how lofty and ambitious they sound, but rather for how much benefit they would deliver for the environment. Getting us all to focus on these smart targets could be the single best thing we do in the next 15 years.  All figures are taken from the Copenhagen Consensus Center’s Post-2015 project and have been converted from dollars to pounds. "

"Wisconsin governor Scott Walker encountered what looked like a group of young supporters during a campaign stop on Monday at a local pizza shop, only to be presented with a fake check from the billionaire Koch brothers by a group of climate activists.  Walker, one of the top-tier candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, was in the midst of a meet-and-greet with prospective voters in the early primary state of New Hampshire. The governor held the event ahead of a forum on Monday evening during which 14 Republican contenders are set to participate in what has evolved into a pre-debate before the first official GOP debate on Fox News later this week.  For the most part, the dozens of New Hampshire residents gathered at the eatery – Theo’s Pizza & Restaurant – were enthusiastic about Walker’s visit and eagerly waited their turn for a handshake and quick chat with the candidate. Among them was Tyler McFarland, who approached Walker for a picture while holding a sign that read “Walker 4 president”.  But as the photo was snapped, McFarland flipped the sign to reveal a supposed $900m check made out to Walker from the Kochs, the industrialist family and Republican mega-donors, for the “presidency”. “I’d like to present you with this check from the Koch brothers for climate denial,” McFarland, 23, told Walker. The governor did not engage with this, choosing instead to brush the incident off and continue mingling with actual supporters. McFarland, an organizer for the climate change group 350 Action, said later he wanted to draw a contrast between Walker and the clean power plan unveiled by Barack Obama on Monday and regarded as the president’s most significant action on climate change to date. “We presented Scott Walker with a 900m novelty check from the Koch brothers today, because Scott Walker is the most dangerous candidate on climate change,” McFarland told the Guardian. “As Obama reveals his clean power plant today, we just wanted to highlight the fact that Scott Walker is poised to receive $900m from the Kochs, particularly to continue climate denial and implement disastrous environmental policies.” The Obama administration’s new rules are designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030. The plan also aims to move away from coal power plants and boost wind and solar power generation instead.  Republican presidential candidates have strongly rejected the proposal, arguing that it would drive up electricity costs and place undue burden on businesses. “President Obama’s plan should be called the ‘costly power plan’ because it will cost hard-working Americans jobs and raise their energy rates,” Walker said in a statement Monday in response to the announcement. “It will be like a buzz saw on the nation’s economy. I will stand up for American workers and stop the ‘costly power plan’.” Walker also wrote a letter to Obama in May, in which the Wisconsin governor said the administration’s proposed rules were “riddled with inaccuracies, questionable assumptions and deficiencies that make the development of a responsible state plan unworkable”. Climate activists such as McFarland have long criticized Walker and other Republicans over environmental policy – namely the refusal of many candidates to state that human activity has contributed to global warming.Walker has taken an especially hard line against the Obama administration on the issue of climate change.  The governor announced earlier this year that he would sue the Environmental Protection Agency over its new carbon rules. The Wisconsin chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative non-profit backed by the Koch brothers, praised Walker for the move. Walker also signed the group’s “No Climate Tax” pledge to oppose any legislative effort related to climate change “that includes a net increase in government revenue”. The Koch-based network is poised to spend almost $1bn on the 2016 election, and the two brothers reportedly prefer Walker over his Republican primary opponents. Their political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity has spent millions of dollars on television ads, direct mail and other expenses in support of Walker’s agenda in Wisconsin and to help him survive a failed recall effort in 2012. Walker is not the only candidate who has been targeted by McFarland and the 350 Action group in New Hampshire over environmental policy. The same group interrupted Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, during a town hall in nearby Dover, New Hampshire, last month. In that instance, two young women asked Clinton if she would commit to banning fossil fuel extraction on public lands. Clinton acknowledged that climate change was “an existential threat”, but did not go as far as the women had hoped – leading to a protest in which 350 Action organizers began chanting: “Act on climate.”"

"The Middle East is used to extreme heat but its latest heatwave has been of extraordinary proportions. Temperatures last Friday reached a scorching 51C (124F) in Baghdad and 46C (115F) in the Iranian city of Bandar Mahshahr. The air temperature across the latter, when combined with the dew point temperature of 32C – a measure of the amount of moisture within the air – would have made it feel more like an incredible 72C.  Meanwhile across southern Australia, which is in the icy grips of winter, the island state of Tasmania has had its greatest depths of low-altitude snow for nearly 20 years. In a winter that has brought frequent cold snaps and snowfall across the higher elevations of Queensland and Tasmania, this latest wintry outbreak produced snow that settled in the coastal town of Hobart – the first since July 1986, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It may come as a surprise that the south-eastern parts of Australia do experience snowfall during the winter months. However, it is quite rare for snow to extend down to sea level; it is usually restricted to the mountainous regions of south-east Australia. Finally, the Indian monsoon season is in full swing and the recent torrential rain brought by Cyclone Komen has caused widespread, severe, floods in the region of West Bengal and is thought to have claimed the lives of 100 people and displaced up to four million residents. The monsoon season, running from June until late September, gives India up to 80% of its annual rainfall."

"A new study has just been prepared for an upcoming climate meeting of the US Climate Variability and Predictability Program. This group has an annual summit and this year will have a special science session with papers and presentations devoted to the so-called “hiatus”. The “hiatus” has taken many meanings. In the popular press, it is often used to falsely claim that global warming stopped. As I’ve written many times, global warming has not stopped; the Earth has been continuing to gain energy because of human emissions of greenhouse gases. In other cases, the “hiatus” refers to a reported slowdown in temperature increases. This too is not seen in the ocean data or in sea level rise. It is only seen in surface temperatures (temperatures of the surface of land and ocean regions).   What my colleague and I wanted to know was, is this slowdown real or not? Specifically, we wanted to know whether it passed mathematical tests for statistical significance. My colleague, who is an expert is statistics, and operates a climate website, downloaded the surface temperature data from NASA and detrended it (removed the long term increase in temperatures). The difference between the red trendline and the black dots is called the residual. We wanted to increase the odds that we would find a “hiatus” by stopping our analysis in 2013 (omitted the hottest year on record, 2014).  If you plot the residual over this time period, it looks like the image below. We wanted to know whether there is any trend in these residuals. If the global warming trend had slowed recently, you would expect residuals to become more negative. We found that there was no statistically significant change to the residuals since 1970. Next, we grouped years together into groups that ranged from 3 years long to 20 years long and searched for changes to the residuals in those groups. Again, we found no significant change. Our findings are best summarized by our concluding paragraphs. A barrage of statistical tests was applied to global surface temperature time series to search for evidence of any significant departure from linear increase at constant rate since 1970. In every case the evidence not only failed to establish a trend change with statistical significance, it failed by a wide margin. Our results show that the widespread acceptance of the idea of a recent slowdown in the increase of global average surface temperature is not supported by analytical evidence. We suggest two possible contributors to this. First, the natural curiosity of honest scientists strongly motivates them to investigate issues which appear to be meaningful even before such evidence arrives (which is a very good thing). Second, those who deny that man-made global warming is a danger have actively engaged in a public campaign to proclaim not just a slowdown in temperature increase, but a complete halt to global warming. Their efforts have been pervasive, so that in spite of lack of evidence to back up such claims, they have effectively sown the seeds of doubt in the public, the community of journalists, and even elected politicians. An unfortunate habit in public discourse has been to graph only the data since the supposed “pause” began and state only the trend estimate since that moment, in order to avoid having to show that such a practice implicitly models temperature with a “broken” trend like that of Figure 3. Claims based on failing to reveal what happened before a purported trend change, are inevitably misleading. It is certainly possible that some change in the trend has occurred since 1970, and it is very beneficial to look for causes, whether it is present or not. But we suggest that scientists should stop speaking of a slowdown in temperature increase as though it were a known fact, when it simply isn’t.  Our paper is freely available here."

"Politicians cherry-picking information to suit their own agenda is one of the great tragedies of modern civilisation, the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said on Monday night’s Q&A. In a panel devoid of politicians, Tyson joined the oncologist and Guardian Australia columnist Ranjana Srivastava, the mathematician and CSIRO marine scientist Beth Fulton and the mathematics ambassador Adam Spencer to discuss climate change, extraterrestrial life and artificial intelligence. In response to a question about how scientists prevent scientific ideas becoming politically partisan, Tyson said he did not have a problem with people believing in anything they wanted to. “But if that belief is not based on objective truths, you should not be creating legislation based on it,” he said. “One of the great tragedies of modern society is that we have politicians cherry-picking science in the interests of their own social, cultural, political and religious belief systems, and that’s the beginning of the end of an informed democracy.” If politicians and society had strong scientific literacy, Tyson said, there should be no debate within politics as to whether climate change existed. “If you’re trained to understand how and why science works, then the two opposite factions can have a genuine political discussion about how to react to human-induced climate change,” he said. “That’s where the debate should happen.” Srivastava said the scepticism of some members of politics about climate science and the repercussions of climate change reminded her of the now discontinued pain relief drug Vioxx, which doctors continued to prescribe in the face of mounting evidence that it was causing strokes, heart attacks and death. Researchers who tried to highlight these adverse reactions were badmouthed and labelled troublemakers, she said. “If someone had listened to the weight of evidence at the time instead of just saying, ‘These people are just trouble,’ I think we would have had a different outcome, especially for those families who have lost loved ones.” Unlike Q&As of recent weeks, there was no controversy or fierce disagreement; except when it came to the topic of artificial intelligence. While Spencer worried that advances in technology meant people would be replaced by robots and rendered jobless, Tyson retorted: “That’s your weakest argument tonight.” Jobs in new and exciting fields would be created as some professions became automated, Tyson said, creating opportunities and expanding the economy. Spencer replied: “Suggesting people will just go and retrain, with the greatest respect, I don’t think is the strongest argument you’ve presented tonight either.” To ensure viewers knew there was no animosity between the pair, Spencer tweeted a photo of himself hugging Tyson after the show, with the caption: “All is forgiven.” Addressing one of several questions about the existence of alien life, Tyson, who is director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, said it was a mistake to think intelligent life would look like or interact in a similar way as humans. “We have not successfully shared meaningful thoughts with any other species of life on earth, life with whom we have DNA in common,” he said.  “So to presume that some other species of life, which we will have no genetic identity with at all, that somehow we can have a conversation with them and have witty repartee, I think it may be our own hubris to presume that.” He and Spencer agreed it was unlikely such life would be found within our lifetimes, but said it was possible single-cell organisms would be found on other planets. Panellists were also asked how to get more women into science, technology, engineering and mathematics – Stem subjects – to which Fulton replied that she was lucky to work in a field, ecosystem modelling, that women had helped to shape. “We just need to encourage more people full stop to get into science and keep it going,” she said, while Spencer and Srivastava called for more inspiring female role models in Stem subjects to be promoted to children at school. The conversation was not restricted to science. The show began with a question about the Adam Goodes saga which has dominated news headlines for the past couple of weeks. Srivastava said she and her colleagues had faced numerous racist putdowns during their careers, with some patients linking competency to race.  Some refused to be treated by anyone who was not white, she said, while her senior surgeon colleague wore a suit so he would not be mistaken for a security guard or cleaner. Fulton said no matter the motivation behind it, booing and bullying was inappropriate, and multiculturalism was a strength in any society. “Diversity makes us stronger, so let’s just get past it,” she said."

"  Quentin Letts, the Daily Mail diarist, sporadically regales BBC Radio 4 listeners with programmes that ask ‘What’s the point ...’ of various national institutions. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the MCC and even the pub have come under his “witty but thought-provoking” gaze.  This week’s offering purports to ask what is the point of the Met Office. But it actually poses a different question: What’s the point of the BBC editorial guidelines? After more than a decade reporting on climate change as a BBC science and environment correspondent, I became rather familiar with the guidelines. They are basically common sense: people should be treated fairly, programmes should be factually accurate, children should be protected, while allowing room for journalism and creativity to flourish. The makers of this week’s What’s the Point of… do not appear to have visited the relevant pages, which is odd given the surfeit of banana skins obviously strewn before them, notably an institution (the Met Office) that has been used for years as a political football and a presenter who describes solar panels as “hideous” and is far more a man of wit than watts per metre squared (and to be fair, some of the wit was pretty good). Extraordinary, too, that Radio 4 bosses did not lend a closer ear before broadcast to a programme which, as it turned out, has not so much ignored the editorial guidelines as burned them to cinders in a joyous coal-fired conflagration. In his introduction, Quentin Letts tells us that the Met Office takes a “not uncontroversial” stance on climate change. In reality its stance is so uncontroversial as to be shared by every major national science academy and well over 90% of climate scientists. Two of the three MPs interviewed are long-time climate contrarians Graham Stringer and Peter Lilley. Mr Stringer is allowed to claim without challenge that there is “no scientific evidence” linking the 2013/4 winter floods, to climate change, which is untrue; it’s not a simple link, but it does exist. He also accuses the Met Office of having forecast a dry winter, which the producers do not appear to have checked. Both MPs recently joined the Board of Trustees of Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation, the leading light of Britain’s “brown movement”; either the producers were unaware of this or deemed it of no interest. The one person Quentin Letts does challenge is the sole woman on the programme, Met Office head of news Helen Chivers. The Met Office is guilty of “political alarmism”, he says, with spokespeople telling us to “leap for our arks”. He concludes the programme with an unsubstantiated jibe about the Met Office’s “political lobbying”. This programme ends up in territory unrecognisable in the editorial guidelines. Material was not “well sourced and based on sound evidence”, as the guidelines prescribe. The responsibility to “check and cross check facts” appears to have been neglected, along with the commitment to “corroborate claims and allegations made by contributors wherever possible”. Radio 4 may argue that these programmes are “personal views” – but even these programmes are required to “retain a respect for factual accuracy” when they cover controversial issues. Climate change has always been a difficult subject for the BBC. The science is complex, with messy uncertainties, and the political stakes are high. As I saw at first hand during my time there, the corporation comes under sustained pressure from various quarters, particularly well-connected contrarians for whom undercutting scientific institutions such as the Met Office is a time-honoured tactic. Nevertheless, the BBC generally does a excellent job, with news correspondents, current affairs presenters and science documentary makers who excel – many of whom would doubtless have helped the makers of What’s the Point, had they been asked. The political rhetoric always escalates at critical times, such as now when the government is overhauling low-carbon energy policies and a major UN climate summit looms – and BBC bosses have to be aware of this context, both in terms of the increased pressures programme-makers will come under and the increased responsibility to get it right. The editorial guidelines are there to help, especially in difficult subject areas. But, if producers are not going to read them and bosses not going to enforce them – what’s the point in having them?"
"More than four months after Cyclone Pam, one of the most powerful ever recorded in the south Pacific, emergency aid is winding down in the Vanuatu archipelago, leaving inhabitants of rural islands facing an uncertain future. Tanna, an island 200km south of the capital Port-Vila, took a direct hit on 13 March. The wreckage is still visible: the tops of banyan trees have been lopped off, roofs ripped away and churches flattened. Trees on island were stripped by winds gusting at over 320km/h, but now fresh greenery is bursting out and people are rebuilding their homes and replanting their fields. “We’ve sawn up timber from banyan and avocado trees to make beams, cut bamboo for the walls and dried coconut leaves for the roof. Once we’ve gathered up all the materials in the forest, it takes a fortnight to actually build a house; everyone here knows how to do that,” says David, from Port Resolution on the east coast. The flexible structure of the traditional huts explains why the death toll was relatively low – only 16 storm-related fatalities – despite the severity of the cyclone. In rural areas the traditional housing model also makes reconstruction quicker and cheaper. “Actually the worst part is not the house, but the garden,” David adds. On Tanna almost all households depend on the crops they grow for their own use. Most of them were seriously damaged. Only a few sweet yams were saved, Pam having arrived just after the harvest. These meagre reserves are now being supplemented by the first vegetables grown from seed distributed as part of emergency aid. But it will be some time before Vanuatu staples are again available. “It takes three months for sweet potatoes to grow, nine months for taro roots and leaves, a year for bananas ... In the meantime, we’ll scrape by,” David says with a shrug. With Tanna still largely dependent on food aid, the end of the handouts is a source of concern. The inhabitants received their last rations of rice, pasta and tuna at the end of June. “People are hungry. But the famine everyone feared hasn’t happened. Ni-Vanuatu are very tough and have used traditional learning disregarded under normal circumstances, like picking wild fruit and roots,” says Christopher Bartlett, head of the Vanuatu Food Security and Agriculture Cluster. This organisation brings together the cabinet, natural disaster response agency, ministry of agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries, private sector and various NGOs. It centralised food aid after the cyclone, and organised three mass handouts, reaching 211,000 people on 80 of Vanuatu’s 91 islands. In addition to fulfilling basic needs, boats sailed back and forth ferrying seed and planting gear. Livestock too. “As a trial measure we gave people live protein,” Bartlett explains. Some 10,000 chicks were handed out with the food to raise them. Farmers on islands spared by Pam hosted pigs from devastated areas, feeding them through the shortages then returning them to their owners. The cyclone will have a lasting effect on staples, but also on cash crops. It will take 10 years for the coconut palms (a source of copra fibre and oil) to recover, five years for kava (a traditional drink) and cocoa, and three years for coffee. According to Bartlett it will take that long to return to normal output. “The government is setting up a three-year recovery plan, costing an estimated $70m for agriculture alone,” he says. The IMF estimated that overall growth would fall by 2% this year, from 3.5% in 2014, then pick up again with reconstruction and a return to normal in the tourist trade and subsequently in farming. In the meantime, more specific aid is coming on tap. It will be organised on the basis of the findings of a large-scale survey currently under way. The SMS quiz asks which crop varieties are in short supply and how long specific crops will take to come through. “It’s a ground-breaking venture, brought on by Pam. We’ve placed high demands on our two telecom operators to deliver the messages. It’s allowing us to reach more people than with radio or TV, including sending safety guidelines before the cyclone, then managing the aftermath,” says Shedrack Welegtabit, head of the National Disaster Management office. Not long ago the people of Tanna received another text message. It was not about Pam, but El Niño and the resulting drought, slated to last till the end of the year. It advises farmers to plant emergency-aid seed as a priority. “The accumulation of natural hazards, wholly inconsistent with normal climate patterns, is beginning to seriously jeopardise food security,” Bartlett warns. According to the UN’s World Risk Index, Vanuatu is the world’s most at-risk country for natural hazards, due to climate change, in particular more severe cyclones and greater variation between periods of drought and flood. The country has launched pioneering policies to adapt, coordinated by its recently established climate change ministry. It was thus able to take effective measures to prepare for Pam. Hopefully it will also be able to cope with the coming drought. This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"

"A few weeks ago, on a pleasantly cool day, this reporter and his dog, an Alaskan malamute named Bear, headed for a small set of trails in an area of woods not far from the New York-New Jersey border. With bicyclists plying their way on the shoulder of a nearby highway and the Hudson River rushing along beyond the wooded landscape, man and dog walked along the well-maintained trails, yielding to other visitors and trying to stay away from the tall grass. Memories of the day were somewhat dampened after returning home. Bear, whose deep malamute hair is a jungle of fluffiness, brought home an intrepid hitchhiker. Crawling in that furry maze, and thankfully not attached to his skin, was a tick, no doubt on the hunt for some dog blood — or human blood, for that matter. Another one was found crawling nearby. This episode plays out across the US and the rest of the world on a regular basis.  According to experts in the field, ticks have gone through some changes over the past few years. “I think one of the biggest concerns that you see within the published literature for ticks is that ticks’ geographical regions are expanding,” said Dr. Janet Foley, a professor and researcher at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis. Foley, who studies the ecology and epidemiology of infectious diseases, also serves as co-director of the Center for Vector-Borne Diseases, an institution on the frontlines of tick and mite research. “Clearly ticks are expanding farther north,” she said. “[W]e’re finding a lot of tick species moving into new areas. And a lot of that has to do potentially with climate change [and] animal husbandry practices if we’re cutting forests or recreating grasslands... So as a whole ticks themselves are really becoming an emerging problem, not that they always weren’t anyway, but they are getting worse.” Foley said the expansion of their range has brought them into Canada, and she called some of them “very, very aggressive human biters” that can potentially transmit disease. The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) lists on its website the tick species in North America, including the American dog tick, blacklegged tick, brown dog tick, Gulf Coast tick, lone star tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick and western blacklegged tick. To the untrained eye, these insects may seem invisible (in the case of poppy-seed-sized nymphal ticks) or indistinguishable (small insect with eight legs — must be a tick). Encounters with a particular species depend on where one lives, and these geographical ranges may be in the process of changing. For example, the CDC reports that the American dog tick — perhaps the species found on Bear — is found on the East Coast, Midwest, and parts of the West Coast. This particular tick can transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Another candidate for Bear’s tick would be the blacklegged variety, also known as a deer tick. This is the species that can spread Lyme disease, which the CDC states can cause fever, headache, fatigue and a skin rash. Antibiotics can be used to treat the disease. Foley and her colleagues are actively involved in tick-related research, both in the laboratory and out in the field. Her particular interest lies in ecology and how tick-born disease and mange, which is caused by mites, take advantage of complex, natural communities. “What we are doing is diagnostic testing, so surveillance, collecting ticks to see if they are currently infected with a pathogen,” she said. “We dissect them. We remove the DNA, [and] do diagnostic testing that way... Ticks are notoriously difficult to work with in the lab because they have such a slow life cycle. The western blacklegged tick can take three years to go through its whole life cycle, and that’s a long time to keep them.” According to Foley, there used to be a commonly held belief that ticks couldn’t survive below a certain minimum temperature, preventing their spread to northern climates. The line seemed to be drawn along the southern border of Canada, although exceptional populations abounded. Researchers, including Foley, are now rethinking the relationship between tick populations and temperature. “[W]e are seeing them north of [the US], so the question is, it’s not so much that it gets too cold once, but maybe the average cold is less cold than it used to be,” she said. “Or another thing might be, and I think this is more likely … what if it warms earlier in the spring? What if it actually gets just as cold as it used to but starts giving them a little more time in the spring to come out? Then they don’t have to stay in hibernation as long.” Foley said many tropical areas around the world have “terrible problems” with ticks. In the US, she identified Oklahoma, Kansas and north Texas as especially susceptible. Dogs in these areas struggle. “It’s very difficult to find drugs that will protect a dog from ticks,” she said. “Sometimes you’ll see dogs coming into clinics with just thousands of ticks on them.” Dr Thomas N Mather, also known as the TickGuy, serves as director of the University of Rhode Island’s TickEncounter Resource Center. He has focused his research on ecology, tick control strategies, tick-bite protection and disease prevention. The Resource Center is a web-based project that delivers information for everyday use, including research, FAQs and prevention techniques. This year is the second year of the center’s tick survey, known as Tick Spotters. Even with just two years of data, some trends are emerging. Mather said that most people thought the recent “winter apocalypse” would have killed ticks on the East Coast. “Instead it seems to have left ticks pretty active this springtime, especially compared to last year,” he said. “One trend that we’ve been noticing is that the American dog ticks in many places are far more abundant,” Mather added. “We’ve gotten I don’t know how many reports of people saying, ‘Well, I’ve lived in my spot for 15 years, and this is the first year I’ve ever seen ticks. And I’m seeing hundreds of them.’ So that, to me, is something to take note of, and just the sheer number of reports that we’ve been getting, especially of American dog ticks, suggests that that tick has had a little bit of an explosion this year.” Besides the abundance of American dog ticks, another concern is the blacklegged tick, or deer tick. Mather described the species as “loaded with pathogens”. The CDC reports that the blacklegged tick transmits not only Lyme disease, but also anaplasmosis and babesiosis. “We’ve already identified at least five fairly common pathogens in these ticks,” Mather said. “And an individual tick can be infected [with] probably all five of those pathogens at the same time, so that’s a problem really. The infection rate for the different pathogens differs, but most of those pathogens that are transmitted by blacklegged ticks are not transmitted by any other tick. So what we try to stress [is] it’s kind of important to not just brush a tick off until you know what it is because you have no idea what disease risk you might be at without knowing the type of tick.” Mather called pathogenic issues in ticks a “smorgasbord of risk”. Caution is probably better than fretful pandemonium. For example, having a tick crawling on one’s skin doesn’t mean the pathogen has spread. The tick would have to be “binding” in order to transmit, Mather said. The longer a tick is attached the more likely it has transmitted an infectious dose. The human immune system can diminish a small number of pathogens, the URI researcher added, but once the dose gets higher, transmission may occur. “[For] Lyme disease, in general the tick has to be attached for over a day,” he said. “I’m sure it’s starting to transmit bacteria sooner, but it’s not an infectious dose typically… There’s been an awful lot of experiments done to show that most of the time there is at least a one-day window before an infectious dose of Lyme disease has been transmitted from a blacklegged tick. The Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rickettsia, can be transmitted much more rapidly, probably within the first 12 hours of tick attachment.” The mystery of how the tick found its way on to Bear and another one ended up in the house isn’t a mystery at all. He was walking close enough to an area where ticks were present, and the insects caught a ride on a host, full of fluffy fur and the promise of blood. It was an opportunistic jump from the natural world to a 100-pound canine. One could call it the circle of life, highlighting the amazing adventure of these spunky followers from the brush to the carpet of a suburban home, but the thought of those eight tiny legs and the possibility of pathogenic transmission are simply too creepy. It’s tough not to think of these ticks as ticking time bombs, with more and more potential to explode in a warming climate."

"People living in the world’s wealthiest nations generally understand what climate change is but in many countries just half perceive it to be a threat, new research has found. The analysis of perceptions in 119 countries found living standards and relative wealth are “poor predictors” of whether someone considers climate change to be a severe risk.  While more than 75% of people in Australia, the US, UK and most of the rest of Europe were aware of climate change, far fewer considered it to be detrimental to themselves or their families. In Australia – recently cited as being a world leader in climate science denialism – as well as the US, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, climate change was perceived to be a threat by just over half of those polled. In Russia, despite widespread understanding of climate change, less than 50% of people thought it was a risk to them.  The risks of climate change are more widely believed by people in France and Spain, but the greatest concern about its impacts are held elsewhere. In every South American country, concern over climate change is above the 90% mark, with this level of worry shared by Mexico, India, Tanzania and Morocco. Japan is one of the few highly advanced economies in the world to have a population as concerned about the risks of climate change. The paper, published in Nature Climate Change, found different factors drove awareness and risk perceptions of climate change. Education levels and understanding the human influence upon the climate was the greatest factor in Europe, while perception of changing temperatures is the key influence in many African and Asian countries. Authors of the paper, who come from a selection of US universities, say the results show “the need to develop tailored climate communication strategies for individual nations. The results suggest that improving basic education, climate literacy, and public understanding of the local dimensions of climate change are vital to public engagement and support for climate action.” The paper analysed the results of Gallup polls taken in 119 countries, where respondents were asked how much they know about climate change and whether they consider it a threat to them. Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert at the social understandings of climate change at the University of Otago, said many people still see climate change as a remote issue. “People can be aware of it but they see it as a distant risk and don’t engage with it much,” she said. “This disjunction can negate the feeling that we need to act on climate change. “In many developed countries we have confidence in our adaptive capacity. We think we can adapt and cope, and in many ways we can do so more than developing economies.  “We also talk about global averages and that’s a difficult term for many people because two degrees doesn’t seem like a lot. That risk seems diminished whereas if you’re living somewhere with extreme variability and extreme weather events, two degrees can seem like a lot.” Hopkins said accurate media reporting of climate change and more engaged conversations with people on the issue at a local level would help illustrate the threat posed by changes such as rising sea levels and increased heat waves. Climate change is already having its biggest impact upon the world’s most vulnerable, according to the UN, which voiced concern last year that rising temperatures will fuel conflict, war and migration. The number of natural disasters between 2000 and 2009 was around three times higher than in the 1980s, the UN said."
"More than 60% of voters think the former Labor government’s carbon price had no effect, or only a small effect, on electricity bills – as the Abbott government tries to rerun its cost of living argument against Labor’s pledge to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme. Only 21% of voters (30% of Liberal/National voters and 15% of Labor and Green voters) believe the carbon price had a big impact on electricity prices, according to the latest poll by Essential Media.  The poll comes as prime minister Tony Abbott ramps up his attack on Bill Shorten’s pledge to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme, calling it an “electricity tax scam” that would massively increase household costs. The poll found that 51% of voters thought their electricity bill had gone up over the past 12 months and only 9% thought it had gone down, despite evidence the carbon price repeal had pushed electricity and gas prices down. The final report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on its monitoring of the carbon price repeal, released Tuesday, confirmed the carbon tax repeal had flowed on to reductions in household electricity and gas bills. The ACCC said the carbon-related reductions ranged between $153 a year and $269 a year, or $2.90 and $5.10 a week. It “confirmed” the government’s claim, based on Treasury modelling, that overall household savings would have been about $550 a year, because of flow-on cost reductions in rates and council charges, transport and food. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, told Guardian Australia consumers may not have felt the price reductions because “in some states prices did still go up, but by less than they otherwise would have, because extra network costs were still flowing through”. Sims said it had been his decision to include confirmation of an overall $550 benefit to households. “Everything we saw told us the original Treasury modelling was about right,” he said. Consistent with other recent polls, the Essential poll put Labor ahead on two-party-preferred terms by 53% to 47%. The small business minister, Bruce Billson, said the ACCC report “confirms that a tax on carbon is harmful for businesses and households. Combined with a proposed increase in the renewable energy target, Bill Shorten’s plan to bring back the carbon tax would massively increase power bills for households and business, destroy jobs and damage industries.” Coalition frontbencher and communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, pointed out this week that every policy to push low-emissions generation came at a cost – which might in generic terms be called a tax – even the renewable energy target which the government itself supports. “There has been a distinction drawn in the debate ... between a fixed-price cost on carbon which people particularly called a carbon tax and one that is floating because it is related to the purchase of permits and that, of course, the price of the permits depends on supply and demand and that’s an ETS. And so in a lot of the literature and discussion you’ve talked about the virtues of a tax versus the virtues of an ETS,” he said. “But either way they are both a cost. So, yes, you can call them both generically a tax but equally the renewable energy target is a cost. So all of these measures, there is no such thing as a cost-free way of reducing carbon emissions. That is to say, as long as emissions-intensive forms of generating energy are cheaper than the low-emission forms and, of course, that is starting to change, the technological developments with solar in particular."
"There’s sobering news for campaigners trying to persuade investors to withdraw their funds from the fossil fuel industry: UK experts say their efforts are unlikely to achieve enough quickly enough. One expert, using the term often applied to the global energy industry, told a meeting in London: “The incumbency is winning the cold war.”  Senior members of asset management firms and carbon risk specialists were invited this week by a prominent British charitable foundation, Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts, to discuss the prospects for divestment and the attitudes in the City of London to attempts to match investment policies with avoidance of climate change risks. They say the continued confidence of the industry in the long-term viability of coal, oil and gas − despite the plunging cost of many renewable fuels − means that the UN climate change summit in Paris at the end of the year will fall short of its aims. One participant, Mark Campanale, a former fund manager who founded the UK-based Carbon Tracker Initiative, told Climate News Network: “The key question is face time. The fossil fuel CEOs get far more face time with investors than they do with climate scientists, for example. “There are some signs of hope, but we’re not seeing the City, as a group, changing its attitudes. “Do the companies have the right people on their boards? Their approach is to say: ‘There’s doubt about the science. We’re ready to grow.’ And so, by default, they go back to business-as-usual, and Paris will not hit a home run.” There was praise from many speakers at the meeting for the dvestment campaigners’ commitment and imagination − and especially for Bill McKibben, co-founder of the 350.org campaign, for “brilliantly unleashing the naive energy of a generation of students”. Others questioned the language of the disinvestment campaign. One said: “The word ‘divest’ is campaigner talk, not a form of language that will advance the argument very far.” Instead, he suggested, it could be better to speak, in unthreatening language, of the need for “portfolio decarbonisation”. But for many participants it was the basic facts and the simple arithmetic that the campaigners needed to assert. One said: “The industry argues that the problem is cyclical, and that we’re now at the bottom of the cycle. But we need to know why, with crude oil now at US$55-60 a barrel, Shell is investing in projects that won’t break even until the price has gone back up to about $90 a barrel.” Another pointed to the rapid decline in the cost of cleaner fuels: “The economics of renewables are already much better than we’re often led to believe. You’re better off investing $100bn in solar photovoltaics than in Canadian tar sands.” The foundation that hosted the meeting supports Europeans for DivestInvest, part of a global movement that seeks to encourage charitable foundations and high net worth individuals to divest from fossil fuels and invest 5% or more of their portfolio in climate solutions − including renewable energy, clean technology, and energy efficiency. In September 2014, more than 360 investors managing over $24tn in assets urged world leaders to agree to a strong global climate deal."

"Republican presidential candidates have banked millions of dollars in donations from a small number of mega-rich individuals and corporations with close ties to the fossil fuel industries that stand to lose the most from the fight against climate change. Eight out of the 17 GOP figures currently jostling for their party’s presidential nomination have between them attracted a bonanza of at least $62m so far this year from sources either directly involved in polluting industries or with close financial ties to them. Three Republican contenders stand out as recipients of this fossil fuel largesse: the Republican climate change denier-in-chief, Ted Cruz; the party establishment favorite Jeb Bush; and the former governor of Texas, Rick Perry.  The funds have come from just 17 billionaires or businesses that have pumped enormous sums – in one case $15m for a single candidate – into the support groups or Super Pacs that work alongside the official campaigns yet are free to attract unlimited contributions. The $62m forms a substantial chunk of almost $400m that has been given to presidential contenders from both main parties in 2015, raising questions about the leverage that fossil fuel interests might seek to exert over the next occupant of the White House at a critical time for the battle against climate change. The super-wealthy donors all have connections with oil and gas operations, fracking companies, drilling firms and other activities associated with emissions of industrial carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. Their money has gone entirely to Republican candidates, signalling a strong preference among fossil fuel billionaires for the GOP. According to a study of donations based on filings to the Federal Election Commission carried out by Greenpeace and the Center for Media and Democracy in collaboration with the Guardian, by far the greatest beneficiary of what might be labelled fossil fuel donations has been Ted Cruz. The sitting US senator from Texas, who is among the most prominent and blatant climate change deniers in the US, has been showered with a staggering $36.5m from just four wealthy sources with links to fossil fuels interests.  Those donors include members of the Wilks family from Texas who have collectively given $15m to Cruz-supporting Super Pacs. The Wilks fortune was amassed primarily from making equipment used in fracking, a controversial technique for extracting natural gas, via a company called Frac Tech, which the family sold in 2011. Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund manager based in Long Island, has given a whopping $11m to Cruz Super Pacs. Mercer’s fund, Renaissance Technologies, has major financial interests in big oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Callon Petroleum and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. Another huge wad of cash has been pushed in Cruz’s direction by Toby Neugebauer, a private equity financier. He holds partnerships in several fossil fuel concerns including Quantum Energy Partners, an active investor in the Barnett Shale onshore natural gas field in Texas. Cruz has made several outspoken comments disputing the overwhelming scientific consensus that man-made climate change is a serious and growing threat. In February 2014, he told CNN that data did not exist to support the “so-called scientific theory” of global warming. In March he told the Texas Tribune that “satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years”. Last week, at a forum organized by the energy tycoons the Koch brothers in California, Cruz made a statement described by some as “full out denial” in which he repeated his claim that “the data and facts don’t support” the phenomenon of climate change. The Guardian invited the Cruz presidential campaign to comment on the large sums of money flowing into his coffers from fossil fuel interests, but there was no immediate response. Such large-scale investments in the presidential race by those with links to polluting industries come at a time of mounting tension between them and US federal regulators. Last week Barack Obama announced an ambitious plan to slash carbon emissions by 2030 that could have serious ramifications for coal-powered power plants, oil extractors and natural gas producers. The Democratic frontrunner for 2016, Hillary Clinton, recently put forward her plan for a huge boost to solar power. Connor Gibson, the Greenpeace researcher who oversaw the Greenpeace/Center for Media and Democracy study, said that fossil fuel industries were pouring money into the 2016 election cycle in unprecedented quantities. “To see so much money flowing into the war chests of viable Republican candidates so early in the race from people linked to climate change pollution is very concerning.” Gibson said it was reasonable to ask what favors might be expected down the line as quid pro quo. “Will these candidates be expected to roll back federal oversight and regulation of fracking and methane leaks? Will they be more likely to allow drilling in the Arctic at a time when scientists are warning that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground?” But David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, which calls for all restrictions on political donations to be lifted, said that “way too much was read into numbers like these. Most people at this stage of the election cycle are giving because they believe in what the candidate stands for and their policies, rather than because they are trying to influence those policies.” The American Petroleum Institute, a national trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, said it was only to be expected that money was being donated to presidential candidates by people in all walks of life, not just the energy sector. “Candidates running for president receive campaign contributions from all industries, including the wealthy environmental community, as part of our constitutional right. For API, our candidate is energy and its importance to jobs, revenue to the government and our national security,” said Sabrina Fang, an institute spokeswoman. The second-largest recipient of major donations from sources linked to polluting industries is Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who has positioned himself as the leading moderate in the GOP field. Super Pacs supporting his bid for the White House have banked a total of $13.3m from nine separate donors. Those donors include Rooney Holdings, which gave $2m to Bush. The company’s chief executive, Francis Rooney, a former United States ambassador to the Vatican, serves on the board of the independent oil and gas exploration firm Laredo Petroleum as well as on the board of Helmerich & Payne Inc, one of the world’s main offshore platform drilling contractors. Other Bush backers are Richard Kinder, co-founder of Kinder Morgan, an energy infrastructure company that owns 84,000 miles of pipeline; the oil magnate Trevor Rees-Jones; and Dallas oil billionaire Ray Hunt. Bush has been more measured in his comments on global warming than Cruz, and has publicly stated that the climate is changing. But he has injected a note of doubt into the debate around the science of global warming and what should be done about it. On his very first day of official campaigning in June, he criticised Pope Francis for his outspoken call for drastic change to avert the “unprecedented destruction of the ecosystem”, telling the pope to keep out of global affairs. In May, Bush called the science on climate change “convoluted”, lambasting the vast majority of scientists who say it is now beyond doubt as “really arrogant”. He added: “I don’t think the science is clear what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural.” The third big recipient of cash from donors linked to polluting industries is the former governor of Texas, Rick Perry. His Super Pac, Opportunity and Freedom, has been given $6m by Kelcy Warren, owner of the Texas oil and natural gas pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners. In addition to vast sums, Warren is also donating his time – he is working for the Perry campaign as its finance chairman.  Perry has frequently denied that climate change is a scientific given. Last June, for instance, he said: “I don’t believe that we have the settled science by any sense of the imagination.”  He added: “Calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice the country, and, I believe, a disservice to the world.” Five other Republican presidential candidates have received smaller amounts from those linked to fossil fuels: Carly Fiorina ($.2m), Lindsey Graham ($1m), Bobby Jindal ($1.2m), Donald Trump ($1.8m) and Scott Walker ($1.8m). True to form, Trump stands in a class all his own. He is not only one of the GOP recipients of largesse from a donor with links to polluting industries – he also happens to be that donor. He contributed $1.8m to support his own campaign. As the Greenpeace/Center for Media and Democracy study pointed out, Trump has substantial shareholdings in several non-renewable energy companies including ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum. According to financial disclosure records, he also has $250,000 worth of stock in TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. In 2011, he was reported as saying that it is “an outrage our president isn’t approving the Keystone pipeline”, the oil pipeline that runs from Canada to the US that has become a focal point of environmental agitation over combating climate change."
"Continuing climate change caused by carbon emissions from power stations and vehicles is set to have catastrophic consequences for British butterflies including currently widespread species such as the large white, small white and large skipper. Researchers have found that the increase in extreme droughts as global warming takes hold will cause six species of UK butterflies to be lost from several areas of the country as soon as mid-century. Previous studies have looked at what a gradual increase in temperatures means for British wildlife, but a new paper published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change examined the impact of more extreme heat events. It found that butterflies which were predicted to do well under gradual warming would in fact be badly hit by an increase in severe droughts.  Looking at how butterflies fared in the 1995 drought, the most arid summer since records began in 1776, the researchers identified six species that were particularly sensitive to drought – and then examined how often they would be struck by similar droughts in the future because of climate change.  “On average across the whole country it is quite bleak. I was surprised looking at climate data by the rapid increase in frequency of droughts we are in for,” said Tom Oliver, the paper’s lead author and an ecological modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. “Historically that 1995 drought was once in 200 years. And yet even on the low emissions scenario, by 2050 that’s happening every seven years. Under the high emissions scenario [what we are currently on track for] it’s every year.”  However, he said that there would be cooler, wetter refuges in the UK, such as the north-west of England and Scotland where some of the six species – large white (Pieris brassicae), small white (Pieris rapae), ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus),  green-veined white (Pieris napi), speckled wood (Pararge aegeria), and large skipper (Ochlodes sylvanus) – would survive.  Oliver said the way the species were identified as sensitive to drought was conservative, and that it was unlikely that it would just be butterflies that were hit. “It’s likely other species besides butterflies will be affected by drought. Because butterflies are a well-studied group they can be used as an indicator for other groups, a canary in the coal mine, if you will,” he said. If such losses also applied to other wildlife – such as bees and beetles – that would have a substantial impact on our wildlife and an alarming impact on the services they provide for ecosystems and agriculture, such as pollination, he said. The study also highlighted the importance of a good, unfragmented landscape for butterflies hit by increasingly frequent droughts. “If a local population does go extinct it can potentially be recolonised from elsewhere, but they have to be able to move through the landscape. If there is hostile landscape in the way, they might not be able to,” said Oliver.  That finding made a strong case for making the woodlands, grasslands and heathlands where Britain’s 50-plus species of butterflies feed and breed more joined-up. “We are still waiting for action at sufficient scale [on habitats],” he said. But under a business-as-usual scenario for warming – which assumes little or no international action is taken on climate change – even massively improving the landscape would not stop widespread local extinctions by the end of the century.  The only way to guarantee the butterflies’ survival by 2100 would be dramatic carbon cuts far beyond what governments have proposed so far, and “significant reductions in habitat fragmentation”. It was unlikely that the butterflies would evolve quickly enough to adapt to the droughts, the study concluded. Oliver said he hoped the paper would give another reason for international negotiators meeting in Paris later this year to reach a strong deal on climate change.  “I think every little helps. We’re highlighting the plight of these sensitive species under the marked increase in drought. Hopefully these results add to the pressure for international agreement for action on emissions.” • This article was amended on 13 August 2015.

"Hundreds of businesses including eBay, Nestlé and General Mills have issued their support for Barack Obama’s clean power plan, billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a US president. The rules, announced on Monday, are designed to cut emissions from power plants and have been strengthened in terms of the long-term ambition as originally proposed by the president last year, but slightly weakened in the short-term in a concession to states reliant on highly-polluting coal.   White House adviser Brian Deese said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules represented the “biggest step that any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fuelling climate change”. The US is the world’s second biggest carbon emitter after China. The rules are expected to trigger a “tsunami” of legal opposition from states and utilities who oppose the plans, which will significantly boost wind and solar power generation and force a switch away from coal power. Republican presidential hopefuls moved quickly to voice their opposition, saying they would be economically damaging. But 365 businesses and investors wrote to 29 state governors to strongly support the rules, which they said would benefit the economy and create jobs. Mindy Lubber, who is attending the launch ceremony of the rules on Monday and is the president of Ceres, a network of investors that organised the letter, said: “The clean power plan is the right measure at the right time. It’s a flexible, practical and economically sound blueprint to transition America toward a low-carbon future.” Other signatories included Unilever, L’Oréal, Levi Strauss, Staples, renewable energy company SunEdison and Trillium Asset Management, which manages $2.2bn in assets. It is the largest group of businesses to support the rules so far. The final rules propose a 32% cut in carbon emissions from power plants by 2030 on 2005 levels, up from the initial proposal of 30%. However states will only have to comply by 2022 rather than 2020 as originally proposed, and will be able submit their plans on meeting the targets by 2018 instead of 2017. CO2 emissions from power plants fell 15% between 2005 and 2013, meaning the country is halfway to the target. Monday’s version of the rules also gives an explicit boost to wind and solar power, angering the natural gas industry which will still be a large beneficiary of the switch from coal to gas-fired power plants, which produce much lower emissions. America’s Natural Gas Alliance, a trade body, said it was “disappointed and discouraged” by the rules. The World Coal Association claimed the plan “will significantly increase the cost of electricity to American consumers.” The Solar Energy Industries Association, on the other hand, said the rules were “historic” and “critically needed”.  The new rules will give a “give a head start to wind and solar deployment”, according to a White House fact sheet. “Drive more aggressive investment in clean energy technologies than the proposed rule, resulting in 30% more renewable energy generation in 2030 and continuing to lower the costs of renewable energy,” it said. Barack Obama, in a video address, emphasised the health benefits of reduced air pollution from coal plants, and a duty to future generations as reasons for the clean power rules. “Power plants are the single biggest source of the harmful carbon pollution that contributes to climate change. But until now there have been no federal limits on the amount of that pollution those plants can dump into the air. Think about that,” he said. Obama’s plan to bring in the rules to cut emissions from power plants – which account for a third of the US’s greenhouse gas emissions – date back to 2009 when the EPA declared carbon emissions a public danger, the first step towards regulating them. The final rules are likely to be welcomed by the United Nations, which is hosting a climate summit in Paris at the end of the year to agree on a deal on post-2020 curbs on emissions, as well as financing to help poorer countries manage global warming. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, issued a statement welcoming the regulations. Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based thinktank the World Resources Institute, said: “The clean power plan should reassure international partners that the US administration is determined to deliver the 26-28% emissions reductions promised for 2025.  “Our analysis suggests that this rule can be implemented without technical or financial impediment, and in a manner that is likely to promote more, not less, economic prosperity.” Describing the rules as very important, Lord Stern, the author of an influential review of the economics of climate change, said: “It shows the determination of the world’s richest country to maintain better economic growth while also cutting greenhouse gas pollution. President Obama has recognised in particular the enormous damage caused by pollution from the burning of coal in power stations.” Gina McCarthy, the EPA’s administrator, said she believed the agency was on strong legal grounds for defending the rules from the legal challenges they are almost certain to face. “Over the next few days we will hear the same tired old plays from the old special interests playbook,” said McCarthy."

"France’s top climate ambassador has said she is very concerned at the slow rate of progress on a negotiating text that will form the basis of a new international deal on global warming in Paris later this year. But Laurence Tubiana also said that negotiators from nearly 200 countries were making headway on the document, and made clear that the French government wanted to see serious progress on the text by October.  The comments, in an interview with the Guardian, came as climate ministers met last week to advance international climate talks before a crunch UN summit in Paris this November and December.  The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said in June that the negotiations were proceeding at “a snail’s pace” after a fortnight of talks in Bonn cut the 90-page text by just four pages. Last Friday a new streamlined version was published, with the two officials overseeing it warning the “pace was slow” and there was an “urgent need, owing to serious time constraints, to accelerate the work”.  The final document that governments hope to agree in Paris will have to be far shorter - with points of disagreement ironed out and swathes of potential text currently in brackets removed. “We are all very concerned, but it’s progressing,” Tubiana said, hours before the latest version was published. “What we do as a normal presidency [of the talks] anxious to have a result in Paris not at the last minute, is to say we need something [a better, shorter text] to be cleared in October.”  She said that making the deal legally-binding was less challenging, as only certain elements of any accord would need to be binding. But she said the most difficult element of an agreement would be the issue of the rich countries most responsible for global warming financially helping poorer countries adapt to climate change, echoing previous comments by the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius. He said in May that financing would be “decisive” in reaching a deal in Paris. “I would say the most difficult [part of an agreement] is finance,” she said. “It has to be clear that money is flowing from developed to developing countries, that’s for sure. It should be a significant share of public money as well.”  What form such finance took after 2020, when $100bn of private and public money is meant to be delivered to poorer countries each year, was “less clear” and “conceptually difficult”, she said. However, Tubiana was upbeat about the big picture on renewable energy and prospects for a deal in Paris, saying that “powerful interests” in the business world were pushing for a cleaner economy.  Comparing Paris to the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, which ended in scenes of chaos and confusion, she said: “the business sector [then] were looking for a signal to deliver it [the low carbon economy]. Now they are pushing for the signal.” In June, the heads of Europe’s oil and gas majors wrote a letter to the FT urging governments to take “decisive action” at the Paris summit, and introduce carbon pricing.  Negotiations ahead of Paris were already on a better track than Copenhagen, Tubiana claimed. “Before Copenhagen, there was a disconnect between the political process and technical process at the negotiator level. Here we have a very good connection between the two.” Tubiana said that while president François Hollande would be inviting heads of state for the first day of the Paris summit to create political momentum, they would not be part of the talks as they were in Copenhagen, when Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and other leaders debated the fine detail of an accord. “We do not want to recreate the Copenhagen scenario where everybody hopes they will solve the problem. What we do not want is them enmeshed with the process, which would be terribly difficult to manage.” • This article was amended on 28 July 2015 to make clear that France wanted to see progress on the Paris text by October, not that France would step in by October to take action on the text itself."

"Academics at Flinders University have delivered a withering rejection of the university’s plan to host a Bjørn Lomborg-run research centre with $4m of federal government money, labelling the Dane “infamous” for his views on climate change. The government is trying to find a university to run Lomborg’s centre, which would focus on international development. The University of Western Australia was set to host the centre, only to return the $4m following a revolt by its academics, who claimed the process was politically motivated and attacked Lomborg’s lack of scholarly standing.  Guardian Australia understands the Flinders University leadership has canvassed the opinion of staff at three schools – social and policy studies, international studies and environmental studies – and found a clear majority are opposed to hosting Lomborg’s “consensus” centre. A letter sent by the school of social and policy studies to Flinders’ deputy vice-chancellor Andrew Parkin, who attempted to sell the benefits of the centre to staff, rejected Lomborg’s involvement. Debra King, dean of the school, told Parkin the overall view of 32 staff was they “do not support any alliance with Lomborg” due to his “academic legitimacy and the politicisation of the process of establishing a partnership”. “The partnership is being heavily promoted by [federal education minister] Christopher Pyne and the LNP,” King wrote. “This reflects Lomborg’s constituency and supporters, and there is concern that the partnership will be constrained by the requirement to promote particular political messages.” King added that Lomborg’s “academic integrity is undoubtedly questionable” and his views on climate change were problematic. Lomborg has said he accepts climate change is real but there are greater priorities and technology will allow humans to adapt to most changes. “Whether Flinders wants it or not, Lomborg is infamous for his views on climate change and his problematic framing of the issues,” King wrote. “The public, including students and other partners, will quickly make the association.” Academic staff viewed Flinders as “risking being a ‘pawn’ or ‘minor player’ in the larger Lomborg roadshow”, King wrote. Lomborg has become a high-profile figure in debates surrounding climate science, although he tends to frame himself as an expert in international development. In May, UWA opted to take the funding for an Australian version of his Copenhagen centre, only to reverse course after a backlash from its academics.  Pyne said the university had shouted down Lomborg, with the Danish academic complaining the issue had become a political football. It is understood several leading universities have rejected overtures from the government to host the centre. Flinders University, meanwhile, has asked the government for information about the centre and said it will consult its staff. A Flinders University academic, who did not want to be named, said only four of around 100 staff across the three schools voiced unequivocal support for Lomborg’s centre. “Leading a research centre is reserved for people with a very serious scholarly record, people who are at the top of their game,” the academic said. “[Lomborg] is someone who isn’t even in the game. “Flinders said we should be brave and have these conversations, but we don’t need Lomborg next to us at the lunch table to have those conversations. You also have to be concerned with the government’s agenda in trying to shop around a centre with someone with so little credibility.” A separate Flinders University academic said the centre was being pitched as being separate from climate change discussion, but this had failed to assuage staff. “It’s clear the money is on offer because the federal government has a particular political agenda,” the academic said. “The university is not being candid in investing in what’s clearly a political project. “There are people who support it, however the reason that people support is that universities are desperate for money. This is the invidious position academics are in.  “When you have someone holding a bucket of $4m, it’s tempting to think you can play with that without burning yourself too badly. That seems to be the position of the university.” James Vigus, president of Flinders University student association, said students have been told they will be consulted on the centre within the next two weeks.  “I’ve had extensive correspondence from a whole range of students who are really concerned that they are going to be associated with a university that is going to have a whole research school set up that massively downplays climate change,” he said. “I believe the vast majority of Flinders students believe money should not be granted based on being a government favourite. Flinders has always been a progressive university. I fear they are trying to have a cultural shift.” The South Australian government has also called on Flinders University to reject the centre, blaming the federal government for its “ideological” support for the initiative. “This funding tactic is similar to those used by the tobacco lobby when they were trying to obfuscate the science around the health impacts of smoking,” said Ian Hunter, minister for climate change and the environment. Hunter said the federal Coalition wanted to “buy willing researchers to support their agenda” and Lomborg’s presence at Flinders would damage the state’s reputation.  The university has been contacted for comment."

"President Obama on Monday set out a plan to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions. His proposals are neither new nor radical, but deserve to be strongly supported, both in America and across the globe. Explicitly, the statement was a challenge to state governors, to Republican senators and congressmen, to fossil-fuel barons, to entrepreneurs who want to invest in renewable sources of energy, and to citizens who want to hang on to their homes and their jobs. Implicitly, it was assurance to the rest of the world that there could be real agreement at the next United Nations climate conference in Paris in December. And if there is real agreement, based on binding promises and targets that can be measured, then it might after all be possible to contain global warming to a maximum of 2C and to limit catastrophic climate change. To cut greenhouse gas emissions by 32% from levels surpassed 10 years ago and to do it all by 2030 sounds pretty radical: hundreds of coal-fired power stations could close, mines could shut down. There will be legal and administrative challenges, from at least a dozen states, maybe two dozen. Americans who do not believe that climate change is a real hazard, and those who accept the science but not the solutions, are hardly likely to change their minds because of yet another fiat from the White House.  But that may not be the point. The logic of free-market capitalism has always meant that whatever lawfully makes the most money in the shortest time is a good thing, which is why oilmen pump crude from the ground and the gas companies invest in hydraulic fracture techniques: it makes money for the shareholders. Government legislation that arbitrarily limits fossil-fuel use is likely to send the investors looking for something else that will deliver value, and if that turns out to be energy-saving technologies, or renewable energy, or just better batteries, that’s fine too, in the long run. In the short run, however, Obama’s announcement was a promise to the rest of the world. Americans per head are the greatest generators of the greenhouse gases that are slowly but inexorably turning up the planetary thermostat. President Obama last year signed a pact with President Xi Jinping of China, the country that now leads the world in overall carbon dioxide emissions. If the world’s two leading polluters are determined to reduce fossil-fuel use, and to do so within a realistic timetable, then other rich and fast-developing nations are more likely to sign up. And they are not likely to meet much opposition from the world’s poorest nations, because these have most to fear from climate change. Small island states are at palpable risk from sea-level rise, impoverished nations in arid zones are in no position to withstand ever higher temperatures and more devastating droughts, and coastal nations that are already sporadically laid waste by tropical cyclones have no wish to see more frequent or more intense windstorms. But the Obama initiative does not mean that action is guaranteed: political leaders, ever looking to the next hustings, tend to take decisions that offer short-term solutions, and it is always possible to argue that there are more urgent issues to be dealt with: terrorism, or illegal immigration, or famine, or civil war. And here is where the disconnect between politics and climate science has become most obvious. In the years of inaction, or insufficient action, or outright denial, scientists have repeatedly underlined the reality of climate change, and its potentially catastrophic consequences. A recent communique from 24 of Britain’s learned societies, all innately conservative and business-friendly, spelled it out again: “Climate change poses risks to people and ecosystems by exacerbating existing economic, environmental, geopolitical, health and societal threats, and generating new ones. These risks increase disproportionately as the temperature increases.” Neither the murderous conflict in Iraq and Syria, nor the desperate behaviour of migrants in Calais, are entirely separable from the spectre of climate change. President Obama’s initiative may seem extreme to some Americans, but not to the Royal Meteorological Society, nor the Geological Society of London, nor the Royal Society of Chemistry. These all want to see an end to all emissions by 2050, a world in which carbon dioxide levels stabilise, and perhaps begin to fall. President Obama’s step is therefore very welcome. But it is just a step. There is still a long way to go, and not much time left."

"On Sunday, Hillary Clinton took a first swing at the many-headed carbon hydra. By the end of her first term, she said, the US would have seven times more solar energy capacity than it does today. And by 2027, renewable energy would supply a third of the nation’s electricity. Clinton’s announcement, which the campaign said would be the first of many on climate change from the presidential hopeful, extends the carbon-saving ambition in a significant sector of the economy. Burning fossil fuels for electricity accounts for 31% of US greenhouse gas emissions. One estimate found Clinton’s 33% renewable target could slice another 4% off the US’s existing pledge to cut emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Americas chief, Ethan Zindler, said the ambition was high, but within reach. “It appears to be on the upper end but it’s entirely doable given the rapidly improving economics of renewables generally and solar particularly.” The momentum is already swinging towards low carbon electricity. Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, due for activation in August, is predicted to push the renewable sector from its current 13% share of the electricity market to 25% by 2027.  In 2015, solar photovoltaic installations are forecast to rise by 27%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). This rise has been aided by the soon-to-expire solar investment tax credit (ITC), which the industry said Clinton will have to revive. “Clinton’s ambitious goal for solar is only possible if solar continues its impressive trajectory. SEIA is working to extend the solar ITC and remove statewide barriers that inhibit the growth of solar,” said SEIA president and CEO, Rhone Resch. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Clinton noted that further federal investment would be needed to incentivise the sector’s push to 33%. In a fact sheet, the campaign flagged the resuscitation of tax credits and some innovation and regulatory incentives. “That [the return of tax credits] is hardly a sure thing, given that at least one chamber of Congress will inevitably be Republican controlled during at least the first two years of any new president’s term,” said Zindler. People in the US may care less about climate change than they do about cost Jürgen Weiss, head of climate change at the Brattle Group consultancy, said incentives were important as the industry remained relatively tiny, with low public awareness. A large percentage of costs for installers of residential solar are wrapped up in selling the technology to a sceptical public who have relatively low electricity costs and little concern for climate change.  “The big part is convincing people to sign up in the first place. People in the US may care less about climate change than they do about cost,” he said.  Although the technology, regulatory and labour costs are roughly similar, the price of installing residential solar in Germany (where high electricity costs, strong public acceptance and large government incentives have driven a huge push to solar) is around $1.50 (£1) per watt cheaper than in the US. Even if half of Clinton’s target of 140GW of solar by 2021 were to come from residential (as opposed to utility) solar panels, that equates to a cost difference of more than $100bn, mostly spent on advertising and sales. John Reilly, an energy economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the targets would be a challenge “in terms of providing incentives to build that much”. Weiss said: “I do think those costs will come down as the market matures and people get more informed.” The danger, he said, was providing too much tax-payer funded incentive early on. In Germany and the UK, the solar industry has come under political pressure for being too successful when subsidies were high and now suffers from accusations of being a ‘subsidy junky’. It’s important to clear up some ambiguity in the Clinton rhetoric. From her renewables campaign video, “a 10-year goal of generating enough renewable energy to power every single home in America” does not mean every home is going to have its own clean energy supply. The residential sector uses roughly a third of the total electricity generated. So a 33% renewable goal means the country will be generating this much clean energy, but not all of it will end up in homes.  But factories and office buildings don’t vote and the promise, as my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg points out, allows Clinton to sound like she’s liberating bill payers from utilities. It is also clear that Clinton’s focus on solar (as opposed to wind) is aimed at the voting bill payer. Solar even garners support among some Republicans because of the freedom it offers from regulation and bills. In 2014, wind generated 4.4% of the country’s electricity compared with 0.4% from the sun But the other side of the clean power revolution might be justified in feeling a little left out by Clinton’s policy announcement. Wind energy is by far the big brother to solar. In 2014, wind generated 4.4% of the country’s electricity compared with 0.4% from the sun. In Iowa, where Clinton made her announcement, wind’s share is more than a quarter. It’s cheaper than solar, although the gap is narrowing, and the nation’s first offshore wind farm began construction on Monday. “Recent cost declines have made wind energy the lowest-cost zero carbon solution, and one of the lowest cost generation options overall. As a result ... wind will account for the majority of all generation additions going forward,” said the American Wind Energy Association’s Rob Gramlich. The Department of Energy has found that wind energy can affordably reach 20% of electricity generation by 2030. And, under Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts it will be the biggest contributor of new renewable capacity throughout the 2020s. As part of her announcement, Clinton pledged to uphold the Obama administration’s heavily-opposed restrictions on the carbon emissions of power stations, which are expected to accelerate the already rapid shut-down of coal plants across the country. This capacity will mostly be taken up by cheap gas, but there will be space for renewables if they can compete. Alex Trembath, a senior analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, said: “Action on carbon emissions will largely come by making clean energy cheap, as opposed to making dirty energy more expensive, for a variety of reasons.” The boost to renewables raises important questions about the ability of the grid, which is built to carry power from continuously-burning large power stations rather than millions of diffuse and variable solar panels, to handle such high levels of variable electricity supply.  Reilly said the 33% target was achievable. “If we did build that much, then in terms of the grid we would likely have a lot of spare capacity sitting around, so it would be possible to balance it out. The challenge as time goes by and that capacity retires is whether the back-up capacity is actually built,” he said. But Weiss said the likely reality of a renewables explosion would not be uniform: “Average 33% across the country is a different story from having a 70% renewable share in some places and a 10% renewable share someplace else.” Going beyond 33% is when things get really tough for the grid. A study Reilly authored in 2012 estimated that reaching 80% renewable generation would add around 40% to the cost of electricity. Jesse Jenkins and Trembath recently suggested that reaching levels of variable renewables above their ‘capacity factor’ becomes increasingly expensive. Capacity factor is the amount of time your source actually spends generating electricity - for wind 25-35% and solar 10-20%. So going above a third of the market is where the heavy lifting really begins. This would ramp up the costs of preparing the grid for new types of generation, which the Clinton campaign flagged as a spending priority. Weiss estimated this could cost in the range of $100bn over the next 10-15 years, roughly a 5-10% increase on current electricity spending. “My main issue with her target is that it is narrowly constrained to solar,” said Trembath. “The biggest omission I continue to see from Democrats is support for nuclear power, which needs federal support in different ways than most renewable energy technologies do.” In total, Clinton’s pledge will push the zero carbon electricity sector (including nuclear) from 32% today, to about 50% in 2027. Any credible economy-wide climate scheme will need to encompass a great swathe of measures to reduce carbon, said Zindler. “There are other means for lowering CO2 emissions in the US. Our comparatively profligate use of gasoline has been one area of focus and average consumer vehicle fuel efficiency has actually been rising in the US in recent years. More improvements in transport are definitely possible, particularly in the area of trucks. More efficient use of electricity in homes and businesses is also an area that clearly offers opportunities that do not even necessarily need to be policy driven as they offer consumers the opportunity to save money,” he said. Environmentalists were also quick to point out that Clinton was still skirting the big federal policy questions on support for the fossil fuel industry - the Arctic and Keystone XL pipeline. Can Clinton be a climate Heracles “taking on the global threat of climate change”? It’s a start and the rhetoric is certainly bold. But this amounts to a partial decapitation of one head. It will take many more swings to kill the beast."
