June 25th will mark the deadline for public comments on EPA’s dreadful proposal meant to fulfill President Obama’s campaign promise to “necessarily bankrupt” anyone foolish enough to build a new coal‐​fired power plant. EPA is properly braced for a very large volume of comments.



Sure, the economics favor gas today, as fracked natural gas floods the market, and it is in fact cheaper to build and run a gas‐​fired plant rather than one lit by coal. But that very abundance has now depressed the price of gas to the point that the major frackers, like Aubrey McClendon’s troubled Chesapeake Energy, are cutting way back. There’s no certainty about what the future price of gas will be, but it’s surely possible that it will again rise above coal on a per‐​unit‐​electricity basis. In that eventuality, you still could not operate a new plant.



That’s because EPA has proposed that no coal plant can be built unless it emits (per unit energy output) as little or less carbon dioxide than a comparable natural gas plant. Because producing a requisite amount of electricity from gas results in—estimate—about 50% of the carbon dioxide for the same coal‐​based electricity, the only way to meet the proposed standard is to capture the outgoing carbon dioxide, pipe it somewhere, and bury it. This raises the cost of power and also requires considerably more coal to be burned because it takes energy to capture and transport carbon dioxide. Hence, you go “necessarily bankrupt”.



I’ll be submitting my comments next Monday, and I’m going to go straight to the heart of the matter: EPA’s “endangerment finding” from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Concerning U.S. climate, it is largely based upon a single document, produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), called “Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States”.



My comments will include the first release of a late draft of an _Addendum_ to that report, produced by the new Center for the Study of Public Science and Public Policy (PSPP) here at the Cato Institute. The Center is particularly interested in the policy consequences of making the government the sole funding provider for policy‐​related scientific research.



And so, on June 25th (or shortly thereafter), you will be able to access our _Addendum_ , which pretty much matches—page for page, and subject for subject—the USGCRP document. The Government has 569 science citations, Cato has 932. Which is more complete?



Both are summarized in a set of ten “Key Findings” near the beginning of the documents. Here they are, side by side, USGCRP and Cato’s CSPP. (Also included are two examples of the subsequent text explaining the findings).



USGCRP:



1\. Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human‐​induced.



2\. Climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow.



3\. Widespread climate‐​related impacts are occurring now and are expected to increase.



(Text: Climate changes are already affecting water, energy, transportation, agriculture, ecosystems, and health. These impacts are different from region to region and will grow under projected climate change. (p.41–106, 105–152))



4\. Climate change will stress water resources.



5\. Crop and livestock production will be increasingly challenged.



6\. Coastal areas are at increasing risk from sea‐​level rise and storm surge.



7\. Risks to human health will increase.



(Text: Harmful health impacts of climate change are related to increasing heat stress, waterborne diseases, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents. Reduced cold stress provides some benefits. Robust public health infrastructure can reduce the potential for negative impacts. (p. 89))



8\. Climate change will interact with many social and environmental stresses.



9\. Thresholds will be caused, leading to large changes in climate and ecosystems.



10\. Future climate change and its impacts depend on choices made today.



PSPP:



1.Climate change is unequivocal and human activity plays some part in it.



2.Climate change has occurred and will occur in the United States.



3\. Impacts of observed climate change have little national significance.



(Text: There is no significant long‐​term change in U.S. economic output that can be attributed to climate change. The slow nature of climate progression results in _de facto_ adaptation, as can be seen with sea level changes on the east coast. (pp.45–144))



4\. Climate change will affect water resources.



5\. Crop and livestock production are adapting to and will adapt to climate change.



6\. Sea level rises caused by global warming will be easily adapted to in the U.S.



7\. Life expectancy and wealth are likely to continue to increase.



(Text: There is little relationship between life expectancy, wealth and climate. Even under the most dire scenarios, people will be much wealthier and healthier than they are today in the year 2100. (pp. 99–111))



8\. Climate change is a minor overlay on U.S. society.



9\. Species and ecosystems will change with or without climate change.



10\. Policies enacted by the developed world, including the U.S., will have little impact on global temperature.



We expect our _Addendum_ is going to cause a little heartburn at the EPA, and it should, with hundreds of more citations and endnotes than are in the documents that serve as the scientific cover to “necessarily bankrupt” people.

Tim Flannery is a Professorial Fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, University of Melbourne, and a climate change true believer. According to him “climate changer deniers” are a [threat to our children](https://theconversation.com/the-gloves-are-off-predatory-climate-deniers-are-a-threat-to-our-children-123594).



In this age of rapidly melting glaciers, terrifying megafires and ever more puissant hurricanes, of acidifying and rising oceans, it is hard to believe that any further prod to climate action is needed.



Hurricane activity, as just one example, is currently at an historic low. But don’t let me highlighting some fact less scaremongering stop you. Please continue..



[…] Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to sing the praises of coal, while members of the government call for subsidies for coal-fired power plants. A few days ago, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor urged that the nation’s old and polluting coal-fired power plants be allowed to run “at full tilt”.



Morrison sounds to me like a good Aussie bloke who wants to see kids warm, well-fed and at school.



In the past, many of us have tolerated such pronouncements as the utterings of idiots – in the true, original Greek meaning of the word as one interested only in their own business. But the climate crisis has now grown so severe that the actions of the denialists have turned predatory: they are now an immediate threat to our children.



Uh, oh. Shit just got real. We “climate deniers” are, drum roll please, a “threat to our children”.



Each year the situation becomes more critical. In 2018, global emissions of greenhouse gases rose by 1.7% while the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped by 3.5 parts per million – the largest ever observed increase.



Carbon dioxide is a beneficial trace gas and not a pollutant. Further, there is no evidence that anthropogenic CO2 is significantly warming the planet.



How should Australia’s parents deal with those who labour so joyously to create a world in which a large portion of humanity will perish? As I have become ever more furious at the polluters and denialists, I have come to understand they are threatening my children’s well-being as much as anyone who might seek to harm a child.



Hear that you climate change denialists? You’re as bad as kiddy fiddlers.



On September 20 in Australia and elsewhere, school principals must decide whether they will allow their students to march in the global climate strike in an effort to save themselves from the climate predators in our midst, or force them to stay and study for a future that will not, on current trends, eventuate.



No. School principals must decide whether they are going to teach their students to think critically or allow them to be brainwashed. 



It’s obvious the real threat to our children are climate alarmists. As the brilliant [James Delingpole says](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/18/delingpole-fact-checking-alarmist-kids-false-claims-at-climate-crisis-hearing/), if governments did what climate activists are calling for it would cost upwards of $1.5 trillion per year. Yes, that’s per year. In comparison, the War on Drugs costs a paltry $51 billion per year. In other words, climate alarmists are willing to bankrupt our kids’ future to get their way.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost of us already suspect that environmentalists are dictatorial wolves dressed in the democracy sheepskin. Despite all the lip service they pay to justice and liberty, they are really all about state power and regulation.
So it is with Germany’s authoritarian statists and greens, who not long ago called for the enactment of a nationwide “Veggie Day” once a week in order to start weaning people off climate-killing diets containing meat. Fortunately the citizens roundly rejected the nonsense, sending the wackos off – to return another day.

German city of Bremen attempts to form a green police to enforce proposed ban of electric heaters.
Well, that “another day” has already arrived. The latest suggested intrusion into and control over our private lives is reported by the Liberal website of Friedrich Naumann Foundation For Liberty.
In the northern port city of Bremen, just a single hour away from the home of NoTricksZone, officials are now busily playing let’s-save-the-planet and zealously committing the city to cutting its carbon footprint by 40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.

How is this to be done? The Liberal writes (my emphasis):
One of the planned measures: The ‘ban of electric heaters’. What sounds like one of the usual injection of fuel into the green bonfire of bans in fact takes on a whole new quality. The proposed law by Environment Senator Joachim Lohse foresees a system of monitoring that allows for detection of violations and punishment. According to the Weser-Kurier daily, officials would ‘in carrying out the duties of their office, tread upon private property and enter private buildings‘. The provision of the German Constitution for the inviolability of the home would in this respect be curtailed.”
The Liberal adds:
Here Lohse is creating nothing less than an environment police.”
As mentioned, the proposed law for the city of Bremen of course would clash with Article 13 of the German Constitution which guarantees private individuals the “inviolability of the home”. But in the City of Bremen, which is run by a coalition of climate protection-obsessed socialists and greens, little things like Constitutional Rights are not about to stop their hunt for electric radiators as part of their mission to rescue the planet. After all it’s far more vital to improve the city’s carbon footprint and to promote sustainability then it is to uphold the Federal Constitution.
In their distorted minds, not having an electric heater is more important than having fundamental Constitutional rights.

"Is any item more symbolic of our modern, disposable culture than the single-use coffee cup? In March 2016, they were vilified in celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s “War on Waste” campaign, when he drove a bus through London covered in 10,000 coffee cups: the number the UK allegedly uses every two minutes.  Thanks to a thin plastic lining that makes them waterproof, most paper recycling mills can’t efficiently process these coffee cups, and the majority are incinerated or sent to landfill. Even worse, they are typically made using virgin tree fibre rather than recycled paper, due to hygiene and food-contact requirements. Although Fearnley-Whittingstall’s campaign got many people outraged, our drinking habits haven’t slowed since: the number of coffee shops in the UK is projected to grow from 20,000 to 30,000 by 2025. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since the industry provides jobs, helps to preserve high streets, and sustains coffee growers in developing countries. But if coffee shops are here to stay, what is the best way to deal with the mountain of waste they generate? According to the waste hierarchy, preventing waste should be the first priority. Reusable cups have surged in popularity and most major coffee shops offer a discount for customers that bring their own (often worth far more than the disposable cup itself). Nevertheless, reusable cups typically make less than 5% of sales. The unavoidable truth is that it simply isn’t convenient for people on the run to remember their cup, carry it around and wash it out between uses. What’s more, it can take between 20 and 100 uses for a reusable cup to offset its higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to a disposable, due to the greater amount of energy and material required to make a durable product and the hot water needed to wash them. Compostable coffee cups can seem an attractive alternative since in theory they can leave no harmful residues or litter. But they only break down in industrial composting facilities along with collected food waste, and need dedicated collection streams free from non-compostable materials. With a bit of planning they can work, as demonstrated in the London 2012 Olympic Games, but at the moment the UK is not set up to deal with compostable packaging. For now, they are best suited to closed environments such as canteens or tourist attractions where they are the only type of packaging used. It seems the disposable paper cup is here to stay for the foreseeable future. But things may not be as bad as they seem – even before Fearnley-Whittingstall raised the issue, major stakeholders across the coffee cup value chain, from paper cup manufacturers to coffee chains to waste processors, had come together to form the Paper Cup Recovery and Recycling Group (PCRRG). They realised that the virgin paper fibres used in each cup could be a valuable resource, if only the plastic lining could be removed.  The technology already exists, originally developed to recycle Tetra Pak-style liquid cartons. Essentially the cartons (or cups) are mixed with water and pulped for 20 minutes in a giant washing machine, which allows the plastic lining to be separated. The paper fibres are used again, while the plastic is recycled in garden furniture or building materials. Currently, three such plants in the UK accept coffee cups: combined, these have the capacity to recycle more than 4.5 billion cups each year – well above the estimated 2.5 billion the UK consumes each year (and that’s without displacing juice cartons and other uses).  But even if the capacity is there, the collection infrastructure and economics also have to work. In a show of corporate social responsibility, most major chains will now accept any used cup for recycling, even if it was bought elsewhere. What’s more, Costa Coffee even pays a £70 supplement to waste collectors for each tonne of coffee cups recycled, increasing its value by 150%and providing an economic incentive to divert them from landfill.  New end markets are also increasing the demand for recycled coffee cups: Selfridges, for instance, is now “upcycling” coffee cups to make its distinct yellow bags. Already this approach has made great progress, with the number of coffee cups being recycled jumping from one in 400 in 2016 to one in 25 in 2018.  But even recycling isn’t perfect – it consumes a lot of energy, generates greenhouse gas emissions through transporting the cups to the correct facility and can be inefficient due to contamination from incorrect disposal. Once you take into account all the environmental costs incurred throughout a coffee cup’s production, use and disposal, it may be a better option in some areas to take used cups to a local energy-for-waste plant rather than transporting them long distances to be recycled.  The search is on for an even more sustainable solution. For instance a company called Cupffee has launched a coffee cup made of an edible wafer biscuit.  But it is worth remembering that coffee cups still only make up around 0.7% of UK packaging waste. And it’s estimated that packaging makes up less than 5% of the total carbon footprint of a takeaway latte in a disposable cup (consider: the oil used in fertiliser on the plantation, the jet fuel used to transport the coffee beans, the energy used to heat the coffee, and so on). There is a danger that their prominence could take the focus off bigger problems. In the meantime, why not resolve to rediscover the delight of dining in, with a proper china cup? And should you come across an abandoned coffee cup, you can do your good deed for the day and take it to the nearest collection point."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online Novo Argumente  here features an interview with Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore. Today he is one of the environmental organization’s harshest critics.
Photo right: Partick Moore, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
Moore tells readers how things have run amok at the activist organization, claiming it has changed from one that “not only cared about the environment, but also about people” to one that has since transformed to today’s radical organization “that characterizes people fundamentally as enemies of the earth.” He continues:
I believe that its refusal to make demands that are scientifically based combined with a leftist, anti-American and anti-market-economy attitude has led the environmental movement into an ideological dead-end in which it finds itself today.”
Later in the interview Moore says that today’s biggest environmental challenge facing the earth today is poverty.
Poor people today cannot afford to treat wastewater, to clean the air, to reforest, etc. Poverty is a problem for man and for the environment. Fighting poverty helps both. There’s no contradiction.”
Moore says he left Greenpeace because the organization opted to follow a course based on confrontation and anti-development. He also believes that the organization’s popularity is because the environmental movement has indeed become a religion.

Radical environmentalists he says are hypocritical and confused in that they don’t understand that the gadgets that they themselves love using, like mobile phones, bicycles and rapid transport, buildings and wind turbines, come from the very things they protest. “It’s an absolute dream world.”
He illustrates further:
To demonstrate against fossil energies, Greenpeace attacked a Russian offshore drilling rig with a large boat equipped with diesel engines. […] When we sailed to Alaska to protest nuclear testing, we had no atomic weapons on board. They act like their new 32 million dollar boat is powered by sails when in reality it has a 5000 horsepower diesel engine. […] I just want to underscore what a dream world these people live in.”
Moore thinks that that fear and guilt play a big role in the religion. “This works the best with the global warming issue.”
At the end, Moore blasts Greenpeace’s opposition to approving golden rice.
Two million children die annually from diseases related to Vitamin A-deficiencies. If I take the precautionary principle seriously, then I can only demand that golden rice be immediately approved. If Vitamin A deficiency were a disease like malaria and someone discovered a medicine to heal the disease, it would not be long before people would use it.”
The whole interview is well worth reading and it hopefully it will appear soon in English.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSea Level As We Experience It
By Ed Caryl
Nils-Axel Môrner is a Swedish sea level specialist. He claims that sea level is not rising more than about 1.1 mm/year, that the satellite data has been wrongly calibrated, and uplift and subsidence errors have contaminated the tide gauge records. In my research on sea level, some articles and papers show facts that indicate he might not be wrong.
The majority of tide gauges are at population centers that are also in areas where uplift and subsidence occur. For example, most of the east coast of the U. S. is subsiding, and most of Scandinavia is rebounding. The Pacific rim is very tectonically active with a mixture of up and down. So the real question is:
What is the sea level trend that most people are experiencing?
It is the sea level average trend for all tide gauges without any correction for uplift or subsidence. Here is that figure, their Figure 10, from here,

Figure 1 is a simple mean trend of all raw data from all tide gauges, with no corrections, simply normalized relative to their 1961 to 1990 values. The lower plot is the number of extant stations in each year. The trend in the upper plot from 1900 to 2000 is about 0.5 mm/year or less.
Figure 1 would seem to indicate that sea level might have been higher in 1900 than at present. This is not true. The problem is that in 1900 there were only 40 or 50 stations, and they were skewed toward stations with subsidence problems showing rapidly rising sea level. As the station numbers increased, more stations were added with uplift or stability, rather than added stations with subsidence, skewing the data in the opposite direction. But, the upper plot in Figure 1 is the sea level experience of most of the population.

I fight to preserve tax competition, fiscal sovereignty, and financial privacy for the simple reason that politicians are less likely to impose destructive tax policy if they know that labor and capital can escape to jurisdictions with more responsible fiscal climates.   
  
My opponents in this battle are high-tax governments, statist international bureaucracies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and left-wing pressure groups, all of which want to impose some sort of global tax cartel---sort of an ""OPEC for politicians.""   
  
In my years of fighting this battle, I've has some strange experiences, most notably in 2008 when the OECD threatened to have me thrown in a Mexican jail for the supposed crime of standing in a public area of a hotel and advising representatives of low-tax jurisdictions on how best to resist fiscal imperialism.   
  
A few other bizarre episodes occurred in Barbados, back when I was first getting involved in the issue. Here's a summary of that adventure. 



As part of its ""harmful tax competition"" project, the OECD had called a meeting in 2001 and invited officials from the so-called tax havens to attend in hopes of getting them to surrender their fiscal sovereignty and agree to become deputy tax collectors for uncompetitive welfare states.



Realizing that the small, relatively powerless low-tax nations and territories would be out-gunned and out-manned in such a setting, I organized a delegation of liberty-minded Americans to travel to Barbados and help fight back (as regular readers know, I'm willing to make big sacrifices and go to the Caribbean when it's winter in Washington).



One of the low-tax nations asked me to provide technical assistance, so they made me part of their delegation. But when I got to the OECD conference, the bureaucrats refused to let me participate. That initial obstacle was overcome, though, when representatives from the low-tax country arrived and they created a stink.



So I got my credentials and went into the conference. But this obviously caused some consternation. Bureaucrats from the OECD and representatives from the Clinton Treasury Department (this was before Bush's inauguration) began whispering to each other, followed by some OECD flunky coming over to demand my credentials. I showed my badge, which temporarily stymied the bad guys.



But then a break was called and the OECD announced that the conference couldn't continue if I was in the room. The fact that the OECD and some of the high-tax nations had technical consultants of their own was immaterial. The conference was supposed to be rigged to generate a certain outcome, and my presence was viewed as a threat.



Given the way things were going, with the OECD on the defensive and low-tax jurisdictions unwilling to capitulate, we decided to let the bureaucrats have a symbolic victory---especially since all that really happened is that I sat outside the conference room and representatives from the low-tax jurisdictions would come out every few minutes and brief me on what was happening. And everything ended well, with the high-tax nations failing in their goal of getting low-tax jurisdictions to surrender by signing ""commitment letters"" drafted by the OECD.



While the controversy over my participation in the meeting was indicative of the OECD's unethical and biased behavior, the weirdest part of the Barbados trip occurred at the post-conference reception at the prime minister's residence.



I was feeling rather happy about the OECD's failure, so I was enjoying the evening. But not everybody was pleased with the outcome. One of the Clinton Treasury Department officials came up and basically accused me of being disloyal to the United States because I opposed the administration's policy while on foreign soil.



As you can probably imagine, that was not an effective argument. As this t-shirt indicates, my patriotism is to the ideals of the Founding Fathers, not to the statist actions of the U.S. government. And I also thought it was rather silly for the Treasury Department bureaucrat to make that argument when there was only a week or so left before Clinton was leaving office.



I'm reminded of this bit of personal history because of some recent developments in the area of international taxation.   
  
The federal government recently declared that a Swiss bank is a ""fugitive"" because it refuses to acquiesce to American tax law and instead is obeying Switzerland's admirable human rights policy of protecting financial privacy. Here are some details from a report by Reuters. 



Wegelin & Co, the oldest Swiss private bank, was declared a fugitive after failing to show up in a U.S. court to answer a criminal charge that it conspired to help wealthy Americans evade taxes. ...The indictment of Wegelin, which was founded in 1741, was the first in which the United States accused a foreign bank, rather than individuals, of helping Americans commit tax fraud. ...Wegelin issued a statement from Switzerland saying it has not been served with a criminal summons and therefore was not required to appear in court. ""The circumstances create a clear dilemma for Wegelin & Co,"" it said. ""If it were to adhere to current U.S. legal practice aimed at Swiss banks, it would have to breach Swiss law."" ...Wegelin has no branches outside Switzerland.



It's time for me to again be unpatriotic because I'm on the side of the ""fugitive."" To be blunt, a Swiss bank operating on Swiss soil has no obligation to enforce bad U.S. tax law.   
  
To understand the principles at stake, let's turn the tables. What if the Iranian government demanded that the American government extradite Iranian exiles who write articles critical of that country's leadership? Would the Justice Department agree that the Iranian government had the right to persecute and prosecute people who didn't break U.S. law? Of course not (at least I hope not!).   
  
Or what if the Chinese government requested the extradition of Tiananmen Square protesters who fled to the United States? Again, I would hope the federal government would say to go jump in a lake because it's not a crime in America to believe in free speech.   
  
I could provide dozens of additional examples, but I assume you get the point. Nations only cooperate with each other when they share the same laws (and the same values, including due process legal protections).   
  
This is why Wegelin is not cooperating with the United States government, and this is why genuine patriots who believe in the rule of law should be on the side of the ""fugitive.""   
  
For further information, here's a video I narrated on tax competition.   




The moral of the story is that ""tough on crime"" is the right approach, but only when laws are just. At the risk of stating the obvious, the Internal Revenue Code does not meet that test\---especially when the IRS is trying to enforce it in a grossly improper extraterritorial fashion.

Donald Trump expressed interest in New Zealand’s gun buyback scheme during his meeting with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern […] a conversation around our buyback […]the work that we had done to remove military style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles […] Ardern told reporters. […] during their ‘pull-aside’ discussion […], which Ardern described as “ **perfectly productive”.**



If you cut through all the jibber-jabber and useless waffle about President Trump politely showing an interest in PTPM Ardern’s gun “buyback” scheme, we need to ask what exactly Jacinda achieved for New Zealand? The answer, of course, is NOTHING!



We didn’t send her over there to womble on about her useless pet project the Christchurch Call, or to do a Greta Thunberg lecturing the President about the Fake Climate Emergency, or even to talk to him about how she is doing her best to disarm New Zealand’s law-abiding population. Her job was to secure a steel deal for New Zealand by getting the tariffs removed and to secure a Free Trade Agreement.



Her “Pull-aside” meeting was much like the contraceptive “Pull-out” method. Completely unsatisfactory and rarely successful.



[…]The meeting has been highly anticipated, not only because the New Zealand Prime Minister has been painted as an [**anti-Trump** figure](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11994876), but also because the Herald understands that it was **Trump who** **sought the** **meeting** and was particularly interested in meeting Ardern in person.



Well, how do you like them apples? The meeting didn’t happen because Jacinda Ardern had asked for it in order to try to advance New Zealand’s interests. The meeting only happened because Trump was curious about the PM who was handed her job by a minor party and who has shown no diplomacy whatsoever, calling him orange and a professional arsehole as well as joining in a march against him being democratically elected by the American people. If I were he, I would want to have a closer look at a **political clown** too.



I bet he was fascinated to hear her rabbit on about how she has made New Zealand safe from terror attacks by forcibly confiscating evil looking guns from law abiding citizens. I bet he stared with morbid curiosity while she told him how her Christchurch call would stop video of terror attacks being shared online. I wonder what he was thinking while listening to her? I would have been thinking, “My god, this woman is nuts! She is focused on stopping people watching a terror attack instead of being focused on stopping it happening in the first place.”



As for Jacinda herself the spin she put on her **perfectly pathetic** pull-aside meeting with Trump was that he is supportive of the Christchurch call but will not be signing up to it. That is like saying that I am supportive of the Labour party but will not be voting for them!



Seriously, who does she think she is kidding? I have some new shoes for her because she has earned them.

"This summer, the UK’s Norfolk coast is undergoing a transformation that has only been seen once in the world before. A giant sandscaping scheme will see 1.8m cubic metres of sand added to the area’s beaches to reshape them as a way of reducing coastal erosion. This is an amazing engineering defence, designed to increase the resilience of the adjacent cliffs to erosion. But it may have a sting in its tail in a generation’s time. Bacton cliff was created from a mixture of debris left by large ice sheets thousands of years ago. Unprotected, the cliffs erode at a rate of a metre a year. The area’s current sea defences including groynes – barriers that stretch out from the shore to limit the movement of sediment – slow down the erosion, but don’t stop it. This means that during extreme storm events, such as in 2013-2014, some five metres to ten metres of cliff can be lost overnight.  Perilously close to the cliff edge is a nationally important Bacton gas terminal, supplying up to one third of the UK’s natural gas after it is brought ashore from the North Sea gas fields. Years of erosion have left just 15 metres between the terminal and the cliff edge. Coastal oil and gas facilities threatened by erosion often have hard rock armouring or groynes placed immediately in front of the cliffs they sit on. However, history tell us this can actually increase erosion on the adjacent coast. Sand gets trapped between groynes and cannot move to offer protection elsewhere. This means engineers cannot simply build more or bigger groynes in front of the Bacton terminal.  A common alternative solution is to nourish beaches with extra sand or shingle. This helps build a bigger beach to stop the waves reaching the cliff and so reduces erosion. But this only lasts a short period of time before the new sand is washed away. In 2011, the Netherlands piloted mega-sand nourishment or “sandscaping”, known as the Zand Motor (or Sand Engine), creating a new 1km by 2km beach near The Hague. The 21.5m cubic metres of sand was designed to protect the coast for 20 years, but is now expected to last longer. The Zand Motor also brought some unexpected benefits. Instead of just being seem as a giant coastal protection scheme, it also has become a place for recreation such jogging or kite surfing. Bacton is now attempting a similar sandscaping. If all the sand being used were piled a metre high, it would cover an area the size of 200 football pitches. In practice, the sand dune will be built up to seven metres high in places.  The benefits of the scheme are immense. Although principally protecting the gas terminal, the dune will extend up and down the coastline around it, protecting 100 homes and the coastal road to the south. Tourism may also increase, with benefits and business opportunities for those nearby. Yet while resilience to erosion and flooding will increase for now, the sand will slowly be moved by the waves, and in a few decades the sandscape will be gone. Local residents and businesses may expect that a second sandscaping project will follow. But, presently, no such security exists. The long-term issues of a retreating coastline will manifest itself once again in a generation’s time. The council’s Shoreline Management Plan includes options to try to take further measures to hold the current coastline, do nothing, or realign the coastline landwards of its present position by removing defences as they reach the end of their life. The long-term plan for Bacton and nearby villages in 40 to 90 years is for coastal retreat. This means defunct defences will be removed and the coast will be allowed to erode naturally. Part of the coastal road and nearby homes will be lost to the sea.  This will be preceded by a transition period, which will be vital to allow local residents to adjust to the idea of coastal change. But the sandscaping project could do exactly the opposite as it raises expectations of long-term protection and could discourage people from coming to terms with the problem. The local authority is all too aware of the issues of retreating from the coast. Time and money is needed to assess the options and invest in coastal communities, so they can better cope with the transition. At nearby Trimmingham, a new village hall and community hub opened in 2018 to replace one near the cliff edge. Elsewhere, government support to relocate or “roll back” dwellings is helping householders or small businesses with the practicalities of adapting to the eroding coast. The sandscaping project may raise the hopes of other coastal communities outside Norfolk that similar schemes could help them too. But the huge costs mean sandscaping is only likely where there is significant non-government investment – £12m of the £22m cost of the Bacton sandscaping scheme was funded by the gas terminal operators. This means we may only see sandscaping next to large, nationally important infrastructure. Managing the coastline will only get harder as sea levels rise and budgets are squeezed. Engineers can’t keep protecting the whole coast indefinitely, and difficult decisions will have to be made over what to protect, how and for how long. The Bacton sandscaping can buy time to prepare people for a slow, dignified retreat. But while the community may have won the battle against erosion, it will ultimately lose the war."
"When people hear we are geologists, we are often asked if we have found any oil lately. Sadly – and wrongly – the most common view of geology as a profession is that its primary role is in the discovery and extraction of fossil fuels.  But if we are to radically reduce emissions and move towards a low carbon economy, we’ll need geologists. Technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels or electric cars all require a wide range of natural materials that themselves are finite and often buried deep underground. By focusing on these materials, and the challenges of setting up all this new infrastructure, the discipline of geology can transition from being part of the climate problem to being part of the solution. Geology is commonly misunderstood. It’s not all oil exploration nor even fossilised trilobytes – geologists are interested in a vast range of topics, from the birth of our planet through to the development of life and the moderation of the global climate through the past 4.6 billion years of history.  The Anthropocene is the most recent geological epoch. It represents the period in history when humans have had such a massive impact on the planet that our presence will be detected in the rock millions of years from now. It began sometime in the past few centuries – though the exact start date is still being debated – so in geological terms, the Anthropocene is still very young. Nonetheless, its origins are responsible for our current predicament.  The Industrial Revolution, which ultimately caused the transition to the Anthropocene, was fuelled by burning geological repositories of coal. Modern humans had effectively learned how to exploit reserves of the sun’s energy which had been locked below the surface for many millions of years in geological time. Coal-driven growth then inexorably led to a growing reliance on other fossil fuel sources such as oil and gas. Alarmingly, 82% of the total cumulative use of fossil fuels has occurred since 1962.  The Earth’s geology is thus partly responsible, and the discipline of geology is generally viewed as part of the problem. This negative link may have contributed to a Europe-wide downturn in undergraduate admissions at universities. In England and Wales, for instance, the 1,180 students completing a degree in geology this year is down a third since just 2014 (1,830 students), while A-Level (high school) student numbers are also falling at a similar rate.  The recent surge in popular environmentalism through young activists such as the inspirational Greta Thunburg and the more radical Extinction Rebellion movement has, in our opinion, changed the way young people think about the environment and the possible careers they want to pursue. This is part of the problem facing the geology profession: its “dirty polluter” image is not attractive to the many young people who care deeply about the planet and want to pursue a career that does not harm it. However, in reality, both geology and geologists are an integral part of the solution. For instance, geology is responsible for all manner of natural resources that we use in our everyday lives. Copper is used to make electricity work and lithium is used to store energy in batteries. To transition to a carbon-neutral economy (if that’s ever quite achievable), we need dramatically to increase the available resources of a variety of so-called critical raw materials. Wind and other green sources of energy require significant geological expertise to ensure structural stability together with the raw earth materials needed for construction and power.  In short, geology is part of the solution. This is why we urgently need to change the perception of the profession so that we can train more geologists to drive down our reliance on fossil fuels. This cannot be achieved through a single action or a single body. There needs to be a “call to arms” to unite geologists along with a coordinated effort from industry, professional bodies, learned societies, and the education sector to change the way geology is perceived, away from the “dirty polluter” to “environmental guardian”. Given the declining student numbers and growing concern over the environment, geology’s association with fossil fuels and pollution represents an existential problem for the discipline.

Is global warming real? Have any such predictions been established scientifically? Would massive “carbon” taxes and other controls put America and the world—especially the poor—at great risk? At this special event, geoscientist and astrophysicist Willie Soon separates fact from fiction in the global warming debate. He explains why the forecasts from CO2 climate models have been so wrong—and why solar influences on clouds, oceans, and wind drive climate change, not CO2 emissions. Stanford University physicist Elliott Bloom then comments. “The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.” —Freeman J. Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics, Institute for Advanced Study; Templeton Prize Laureate “I am writing to express my deep admiration and respect for Dr. Willie Soon, a fine astrophysicist and human being…. As Willie has shown in many ways, observational facts do not fit the CO2 dogma, and an enormous amount of evidence points to the Sun as a much more important driver of climate…. Willie was right—whatever the cause of changing temperature, the main driver cannot be the concentration of atmospheric CO2.” —William Happer, Chairman, Presidential Committee on Climate Security; Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics Emeritus, Princeton University; Member, National Academy of Sciences Willie Soon is a geophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He received his Ph.D. (with distinction) in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California, and he has been Astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory; Senior Scientist at the George C. Marshall Institute; Senior Visiting Fellow at the State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science at Xiamen University; and Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Putra Malaysia. The author of 90 scientific papers, he has IEEE received the Nuclear & Plasma Sciences Society Award, Rockwell Dennis Hunt Award, Smithsonian Institution Award, Courage in Defense of Science Award, Petr Beckmann Award for Courage and Achievement in Defense of Scientific Truth and Freedom, and Frederick Seitz Memorial Award.

Fifty years ago today, the actor Ronald Reagan gave a nationally televised speech on behalf of the Republican presidential nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater. It came to be known to Reagan fans as “The Speech” and launched his own, more successful political career.   
  
  
And a very libertarian speech it was:   




This idea that government was beholden to the people, that it had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique idea in all the long history of man’s relation to man. This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self‐​government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far‐​distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.   
  
  
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man’s age‐​old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this downward path. Plutarch warned, “The real destroyer of the liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties, donations and benefits.”   
  
  
The Founding Fathers knew a government can’t control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose.



Video versions of the speech here.   
  
  
For libertarians, Reagan had his faults. But he was an eloquent spokesman for a traditional American philosophy of individualism, self‐​reliance, and free enterprise at home and abroad, and words matter. They change the climate of opinion, and they inspire people trapped in illiberal societies. And these days, when people claiming the Reagan mantle push for wars or military involvement in Iraq, Iran, Syria, and other danger spots, we remember that Reagan challenged the Soviet Union mostly in the realm of ideas; he used military force only sparingly. George W. Bush, whom some call “Reagan’s true political heir,” increased federal spending by more than a trillion dollars even before the financial crisis. We watch the antigay crusading of today’s conservative Republicans and remember that Reagan publicly opposed the early antigay Briggs Initiative of 1978 (featured in the movie _Milk_ ).   
  
  
And in those moments libertarians are tempted to paraphrase the theme song of _All in the Family_ and say, “Mister, we could use a man like Ronald Reagan again.”   
  
  
Would that the current assault on economic freedom would turn up another presidential candidate with Reagan’s values and talents. More on Reagan here and here.

Cryosphere Today – Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois – Click the pic to view at sourceAt the blog “sunshine hours” it seems the Antarctic has set a new record. He writes:
As you may know, I have been using Cryosphere’s Antarctic Sea Ice Area data to show the record levels of Antarctic Sea Ice.
But I just found another data set, NOAA’s Sea Ice Extent here. (thanks to commenter HaroldW at the Blackboard)
And it turns out day 265 set an all time record, and then day 266 (Sept 22nd) broke that record. Days 265 through 270 are now the 6 highest Antarctic Sea Ice Extent’s of all time (in the satellite record)!

11 of the top 15 extents are now in 2012.
Anyone wonder why NOAA isn’t making a fuss about this?

"The amount of pristine tropical rainforest lost across the globe increased last year, as the equivalent of a football pitch disappeared every six seconds, a satellite-based analysis has found. Nearly 12m hectares of tree cover was lost across the tropics, including nearly 4m hectares of dense, old rainforest that held significant stores of carbon and had been home to a vast array of wildlife, according to data from the University of Maryland.  Beyond the tropics, Australia’s devastating bushfires led to a sixfold increase in tree cover loss across the continent in 2019 compared with the previous year. Rod Taylor, from the World Resources Institute, part of the Global Forest Watch network that released the analysis, said as the unprecedented fires continued into 2020, this was only a partial picture of the area affected in the southern fire season. While Australia’s eucalyptus trees are generally well adapted to respond to fire, Taylor said this year’s blazes burned more intensely, having followed a severe drought, and spread rapidly due to high winds. The fires killed 33 people directly, an estimated 445 more through smoke inhalation, and hundreds of millions of animals. “Whereas a normal fire might char the bark of a tree, this year’s fires turned many trees into charcoal sticks,” Taylor said. “Australia can expect more extreme fire seasons as fire risk increases due to climate change.” The loss of trees in the tropics was the third worst recorded since data was first collected in 2002, trailing behind only 2016 and 2017. The heaviest reduction continues to be in Brazil, which accounted for more than a third of all humid tropical forest loss. Government data shows that deforestation for agriculture and other new land uses increased rapidly in the Brazilian Amazon over the past year. The biggest surge in forest loss was in Bolivia, where fires led to an 80% greater reduction in tree cover than in any previous year on record. The institute said many of the fires were probably deliberately lit to clear farming land for planting and spread into forests due to strong winds and drought exacerbated by the climate crisis. It follows the Bolivian government making regulatory changes to encourage the expansion of agriculture. There was a slight decrease in forest loss in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but it was still the third highest year on record, largely due to cyclical agricultural operations, though the institute said there was emerging evidence that commercial logging, mining and clearing for plantations was having an impact. Primary forest loss was down about 50% in both Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, and reduced for a third straight year in Indonesia, where it fell back to a level not seen for more than 15 years. This follows Jakarta introducing a permanent moratorium on clearing for oil palm plantations and increased efforts to ensure that laws were enforced. Frances Seymour, a senior fellow with the institute, said the level of global forest loss was unacceptable and that it was clear what was needed to reverse the trend. “If governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down,” she said. “But if governments relax restrictions on burning, or signal an intent to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploitation, forest loss goes up.” Seymour said the international community could help address the problem by introducing economic or market incentives for protecting forests. She called for governments to embrace four steps: preventing forest burning; increasing monitoring and enforcement to stop breaches; providing the poor and hungry with alternatives to forest exploitation; and not reducing protections to aid the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic."
"Some are disarmingly named, like the cutesy Chinese mitten crab. Others have names more indicative of their undesirable nature, like rock snot, an algae that slimes up cool forest streams. They are some of more than 100 invasive species that conservationists must battle in New York State, which teems with a growing number of plants, birds, fish, insects, mosses, molds and fungi that actually belong somewhere else. With some of the busiest airports and ports in the United States, New York has far more invasive species of certain types than any other state, federal officials say. Carried inside airplane wheels or in the ballast water of large boats, many creatures and spores show up in New York first, making it a laboratory of sorts where scientists and others strive to devise methods to banish the outsiders or risk losing native flora and fauna to invading hordes. Underscoring the increasing menace posed by persistent pest species, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, recently announced a $2 million grant challenging groups and institutions to come up with fresh strategies to fight living things like   zebra mussels and a catastrophic fungus that causes even the most ancient oaks to wilt away. Last year, the state budget for invasive species control was nearly doubled from 2015, to $12 million. “New York State is a real epicenter for everything invasive, whether it’s aquatic, forest or terrestrial, because of where we sit in terms of international and interstate commerce,” said Robert Davies, director of the division lands and forests for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. “The world is getting smaller and one of the downsides of the world getting smaller is this. ” Invasive species have long been a threat unwanted visitors, once they arrive, sometimes stay forever. The Asian   beetle was first discovered in New York in 1996 and has been devouring hardwood trees nationwide ever since. In the last century, chestnut blight, a fungus, wiped out nearly all of New York’s American chestnuts, once the most populous tree in the state. And gypsy moths, introduced from France in the 1860s, are still here, decimating leafy trees. Despite strict rules about what can be brought into the United States and the screening of goods and packages by federal authorities at entry points, the sheer volume of traffic makes it virtually impossible to erect a foolproof barrier. “As a global hub for international trade and travel, New York is on the front lines of protecting our nation,’’ Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. The state mobilized in December after the discovery that oak trees in Brooklyn and in Suffolk County on Long Island were infected with oak wilt, a deadly fungus that chokes off trees’ internal water supply. There is no known cure contaminated trees must be cut down and their root systems killed to prevent the fungus from spreading. The state issued an order forbidding the transporting of oak wood out of the affected counties. In Brooklyn, the outbreak was detected in a northern red oak tree  —   just one so far  —   inside the   Cemetery, the final resting place for many luminaries. Now, only a stump is left of a   shade tree that was over 50 years old. It was cut down last month to prevent the wilt’s spread. The stump will get a coat of herbicide that will kill the root system, which is still infected. “The potential for the devastation here is immediately impactful, but it’s also the significance for the oaks throughout the city,” said Joseph Charap, the director of horticulture for the cemetery, who first noticed the diseased oak. He stood among the graves on a recent morning, while in the bare canopy of an uninfected oak tree above him, teams of   men tethered to the upper branches sawed off limbs. The discovery had set off a race to prune all 664 of the cemetery’s oak trees while they are dormant for the winter as a barricade against the spread of disease. The branches that are trimmed are treated with a special paint to guard against the fungus entering the trees. “The potential to lose our oak collection is unthinkable,” Mr. Charap said. Across the country, invasive species cause over $100 billion in damage every year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, from blighted crops to boats covered with sharp zebra mussels. New York State does not keep a total for damage caused, but the annual bill just to control one species  —   the sea lamprey, a parasitic fish  —   is $500, 000. The overall budget for invasive species control is about $5. 5 million. While the state is at the epicenter of the problem, there are hot spots, including other parts of the East Coast, California and Texas. Sitting at the intersection of so many streams of commerce, New York has had to innovate under the pressures of invasive species. In 2009 it introduced a novel law forbidding the transporting of any firewood more than 50 miles from its source to prevent the spread of disease. (The oak at   Cemetery, Mr. Charap believes, was probably infected by firewood improperly brought to the city.) Inside a laboratory at Cornell University, tiny,   Galerucella birmanica beetles from China are kept under quarantine as their appetite for water chestnut is tested. An invasive aquatic species most likely introduced to New York in the 1880s, the water chestnut continues to clog the state’s fresh waterways. Someday, the bugs may be released as a biological means to control the plant. The state Conservation Department has also created an app that allows people to log sightings of plants and animals they suspect might not belong in their yards or any natural areas. Last year, over 300 people reported more than 12, 000 such sightings. On the ground, the battle is fought with teams of forestry experts going    inoculating root systems against fungus. In the air, the Conservation Department uses State Police helicopters to conduct seasonal patrols to spot shriveled trees on mountainsides or to search for animals that do not belong here, such as the Eurasian  boar. Such efforts do pay off. It’s been several years since the last boar sighting for Bill Burns, 75, a farmer who grows corn and other crops on over 600 acres in Spafford, N. Y. on the eastern edge of the Finger Lakes. Mr. Burns estimates that the animals, which are native to Russia and are believed to have been introduced here by game farmers who were careless with their fences, have caused more than $100, 000 in damages to his crops over the years. “They will go right down the corn planter tracks and suck the seed right out of the ground,” Mr. Burns said. He shot and killed several of them  —   “they taste rewarding,’’ he said  —   but it took a concerted effort by the state and federal authorities, which sent in specially trained trappers and dogs to round up the animals, to achieve true relief. The pigs have been eradicated from the state, according to the Conservation Department. Still, from his kitchen window, Mr. Burns can look across Skaneateles Lake and see stands of dead ash trees. He believes they have been killed by swarms of emerald ash borers, a   Asian beetle first confirmed to have colonized New York State in 2009, according to Cornell University. The insects are one of the state’s top priorities. Mr. Burns fears it is too late. “I am irritated and disappointed in just about everybody in the world that is careless,” he said."

"BOSTON  —   During a men’s hockey game between Boston University and Providence College in early December, Brittany Miller sat in the press box near center ice. She tracked statistics and typed notes in her laptop. Across the rink, Theresa Feaster kept a close eye on the game, logging video of the action. They could have been mistaken for reporters or merely diligent fans. But Miller and Feaster are much more than devoted followers of their beloved teams. They are    trailblazers. Last fall, Miller and Feaster became the first women to serve as   members of an N. C. A. A. Division I men’s hockey coaching staff when they were hired by their alma maters. But Miller, Boston University’s director of hockey operations, and Feaster, the coordinator of hockey operations at Providence College, say their gender rarely comes up in conversations with coaches or players. “I’m just on the staff and come to work every day and work hard,” Feaster said. “That’s all there is to it. It’s not really something that crosses my mind. ” Miller and Feaster had noticed each other during games when they both worked as student managers, first as undergraduates and then as graduate students. But they did not formally meet until a meeting of the Hockey East Association, the teams’ conference, after both had been hired full time. “It’s nice to have someone else who worked hard as a manager and proved herself to her coaching staff,” Miller said. “It shows that Hockey East is really moving forward in hiring females. ” Each has been around hockey for as long as she can remember, though they came to their new jobs from opposite directions. Miller grew up on the ice, learning to skate at age 3 and playing competitive hockey through her high school years at Boston Latin School. Feaster did not play, but she began learning the game while bouncing around the minors with her father, Jay, and gained a newfound interest when his job as general manager of the Calgary Flames led to a connection to Providence while she was studying there. Miller, who had followed her older brother into the game and was coached by her father, started working as a manager at B. U. during the first semester of her freshman year, attending all of the Terriers’ practices and games while still managing a full class load. She was finishing up her master’s degree and working as an intern for a sports marketing research company in London last summer when she received calls from Coach David Quinn and the athletic director, Drew Marrochello. The Terriers had an opening on their coaching staff, and both men thought Miller was the perfect candidate. Now she is in charge of all of the teams’ travel logistics, ensures players handle their academic work and helps track statistics. Miller said Quinn and the rest of the staff had treated her as an equal since she accepted the job in September. “They trust me to do a good job, and they know that I can do this job just as good if not better than any guy,” she said. Marrochello said he had known early on that Miller would be successful in any endeavor she chose. “I’m frankly glad it is in hockey, in college sports,” he said. “I know she’s got a high ceiling. ” While Miller’s love for hockey has burned since her youth, Feaster’s was more like rekindling an old flame. As a young child in the   Feaster was a regular at the rink and aboard the team bus when her father was the general manager of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League. Jay Feaster remembered his    daughter sitting on the training table talking hockey with Mitch Lamoureux, a center who had played parts of three seasons in the N. H. L. but was by then a   lifer on the wrong side of 30. “I’ll see that in my mind until the day I die,” Jay Feaster said. “It was like two players just sitting there having a conversation. ” As Theresa Feaster grew older, she would pepper her father, who helped the Tampa Bay Lightning win the Stanley Cup as their general manager in 2004, with questions about the game. But she did not think seriously about getting involved in the sport until she attended the 2012 N. H. L. draft. Jay Feaster was Calgary’s general manager at the time, and the Flames selected two players who ended up at Providence. Theresa Feaster introduced herself to Friars Coach Nate Leaman, told him that she was entering her junior year and asked if she could volunteer with the team. She was soon attending coaches’ meetings and helping the program with anything it needed. She made such a good impression that Leaman hired her full time in October. Her new role is similar to the one she had as a student. She works on video and statistics projects, makes travel arrangements and helps with administrative tasks. “I feel like every day I’m learning more,” Feaster said. “One of the rewarding parts of this job is you come to the rink every day and you know that you’re going to learn and you’re going to get better. I find that incredibly rewarding. ” Although Miller and Feaster are technically members of their programs’ coaching staffs, N. C. A. A. rules prohibit anyone in their position from working with players on the ice or sitting on the bench during practices or games. Still, they are interacting with the coaches and players daily and gaining valuable experience. Both women aspire to management roles and, possibly, the N. H. L. They would again be an anomaly: Few women have worked in   roles in an N. H. L. front office, and none have been a general manager. Jay Feaster has spoken with his daughter about the grueling nature of hockey: the scarcity of   positions, the long hours and the lack of job security. It is not an easy road, but if it is the one she chooses, she is off to a good start. “I give her a hard time about, ‘You’re too smart to be in this racket. Do you want to be in the hockey business? You’re too smart for that,’” Jay Feaster said. “But I’m very, very proud. ”"
"You may have missed it, but a recent report declared that the main strategy of world leaders for tackling climate change won’t work. It’s called green growth, and it’s favoured by some of the largest and most influential organisations in the world, including the United Nations and the World Bank.  Green growth is a vague term with many definitions, but broadly speaking, it’s the idea that society can reduce its environmental impacts and slash its emissions, even while the economy continues to grow and the quantity of stuff that’s produced and consumed increases. This would be achieved by improving the efficiency of production and manufacturing processes, transitioning to cleaner energy sources and developing new technologies to deal with the pollution that economic activity creates. Better yet, it’s argued, all of this could be done fast enough to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to below 1.5ᵒC. Fixing the climate crisis without having to compromise on economic growth sounds appealing. But the Decoupling Debunked report echoes work by prominent academics in finding that there is no evidence that societies have ever managed to decouple economic growth from emissions at this scale in the past, and little evidence they have the capacity to achieve it in the future. It’s no surprise that, historically, global carbon emissions have gone up as economies have grown. The processes that produce the goods and services we all consume use raw materials as inputs and generate pollution, carbon emissions and waste. Making these processes more efficient and swapping fossil fuels for renewables can, and has, reduced the average emissions that come with each additional dollar of economic growth. This is known as “relative decoupling”, because each dollar of new economic growth has fewer emissions attached to it, relative to each dollar of past growth. But, emissions still rise in absolute terms because the economy is still growing. Since it is the total amount of carbon in the atmosphere that matters in the race against climate change, we need to contrast this idea of “relative decoupling” with the stronger concept of “absolute decoupling”. Absolute decoupling means that even as the economy grows, total carbon emissions fall year-on-year. With this distinction in mind, the question becomes: is absolute decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions possible? And can it be done fast enough to prevent catastrophic climate change? According to the IPCC, there is a 66% likelihood that the world can remain under the Paris Agreement target of 1.5°C of warming if we emit no more than 420 billion additional tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, from early 2018. Humans currently emit about 37 billion tonnes of carbon every year, and that number is still growing. Even the most generous projections suggest that if emissions continue at this rate, the carbon budget will be used up in less than 20 years. The rate of decarbonisation that’s needed is huge, and far in excess of anything that’s been seen previously. Economic growth makes that challenge even harder, as gains in decarbonisation may be outweighed by increases in production and consumption. But green growth advocates insist it’s possible.

      Why protesters should be wary of '12 years to climate breakdown' rhetoric


 The IPCC’s Special Report, released in October 2018, gives 90 scenarios that would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, while also continuing with economic growth. So far, so good. But almost every single one of these scenarios relies on a negative emissions technology called Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) that’s completely untested at large scales. BECSS involves growing large plantations of trees, which draw down carbon from the atmosphere, then harvesting and burning them to generate energy. The CO₂ emissions from this process are then stored underground. To limit warming to 1.5°C, this technology would need to absorb 3-7 billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere every year. That’s at least 2,000 times more than it’s currently capable of doing. In order to absorb that much carbon, an area two to three times the size of India would need to be covered with tree plantations. Think about the difficulty of acquiring that much land, the pressure it would put on other land uses, like food production, and how much natural habitat it could erase. No one can say that these feats are categorically impossible. But the evidence suggests that the chances of meeting the 1.5ᵒC warming target alongside continued economic growth are, at best, highly unlikely. Can we really take this risk — relying on unproven technologies to rescue us from the threat of climate change? Given the consequences of getting the gamble wrong, surely the answer is no. Proposals for green growth that rely solely on technology to solve the climate crisis are based on a flawed idea. This is, that the limits to the world’s physical systems are flexible, but the structure of its economies are not. This seems entirely backwards and more a reflection of the importance of politics and power in determining what solutions are deemed viable, than any reflection of reality. So society should ask, are these global institutions promoting green growth because they believe it’s the most promising way of avoiding climate breakdown? Or is it because they believe it’s simply not politically feasible to talk about the alternatives? If we can be optimistic about humanity’s ability to develop fantastical new technologies to bend and overcome the limits of nature, can’t we lend that same optimism to developing new economic structures? Our goal in the 21st century should be creating economies that allow people to flourish, even when they don’t grow. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"HONG KONG  —   Three masked explorers appeared atop an apartment tower in Hong Kong’s North Point district and sent a black drone flying, over a clothesline, until it was buzzing more than 10 stories above the cars, trams and pedestrians on the street below. If history was any guide, the explorers said, the building the drone was filming  —   a 1952 theater with unusual roof supports  —   would eventually be demolished because it is not on Hong Kong’s list of declared monuments. The authorities are “renewing the city on behalf of the developers, not the people,” said one of the explorers, who goes by the alias Ghost in videos and whose pollution mask and fingerless gloves gave him the air of a bank robber or graffiti artist. The explorers belong to HK Urbex, a   urban exploration collective whose expeditions often require trespassing or walks through dark, abandoned or dangerous sites. But unlike some urban explorers, they do not court danger purely for its own sake. Their primary goal is to peel back layers of history  —   sometimes literally, by digging through dust and trash  —   and forge a video archive of Hong Kong’s   environment. “Until you peel them back, you don’t know what existed before,” said Ghost, 33. “Others are interested in the adrenaline rush, but we’re interested in the story. What can it tell us about the past?” Many buildings that went up here before Hong Kong’s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule have already been replaced by taller ones, as exceptionally high property values create economic incentives to cram more towers into an already crowded skyline. But some buildings lie fallow for years between tenant evictions and demolition, and others, like the 1952 State Theater that the explorers filmed recently, are partly open to the public. The State Theater’s main space, for example, is now a snooker hall. HK Urbex sees these structures as prime targets for urban expeditions. So far HK Urbex has released more than three dozen videos documenting their perambulations through derelict prisons, tenements, cinemas, hospitals, casinos, police stations, bomb shelters, subway tunnels, a shipwreck and other sites across Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. Fans say the elegiac videos, cut with bleak soundscapes and often presented without narration, are poignant meditations on urban evolution and decay. “It’s about forcing us to confront the aesthetic of loss,” Lee Kah Wee, an assistant professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore, said of the group’s film oeuvre. “It forces us to come face to face with this debris of modernization and these ruins that are constantly accumulating, even as we keep building. ” The group says its most popular videos have been viewed more than 20, 000 times on YouTube. Its photographs and videos have also been cited or featured in an international art exhibition, a forthcoming photography book and an advocacy campaign to save Central Market, a 1930s landmark in central Hong Kong, from demolition. The group’s eight members, all longtime Hong Kong residents, use aliases in their work to keep public attention focused on their mission instead of their personalities but also because anonymity helps shield them from potential legal trouble. They agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified only by their aliases. The HK Urbex members often spend weeks researching obscure and abandoned sites before visiting them. Once inside, they document everyday items that they stumble upon  —   family portraits,   ancestral shrines, a broken piggy bank  —   and that will probably never be recorded in history books. “If not for this group of urban adventurers, all of these buildings would eventually disappear without anyone knowing what they meant to society at a certain point in time,” said Lee Ho Yin, the director of architectural conservation programs at the University of Hong Kong. He added that he regarded the group’s members as “extreme urban anthropologists. ” The Hong Kong government’s Antiquities and Monuments Office has granted 114 buildings and cultural landmarks permanent protection from development, and assigned grades to about 1, 000 historic buildings, a list that may soon include the 1952 State Theater. But Professor Lee of the University of Hong Kong said that the second classification did not legally protect buildings from demolition, and that Hong Kong officials  —   unlike their counterparts in Singapore, another wealthy Asian city and former British colony  —   rarely bestowed conservation status on modernist landmarks like the State Theater. “Unfortunately, the economy of Hong Kong is still very much pegged to property development,” he said. A spokeswoman for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, reached by telephone, declined to comment on HK Urbex or its activities. The group was formed in 2013 by Ghost and a friend, who goes by the alias Echo Delta. They both are   filmmakers, and they discovered their initial HK Urbex sites while scouting locations for film shoots, Echo Delta said. After a video they shot of a Hong Kong shipwreck received wide coverage in the city’s   news media, they said, they decided to create the HK Urbex Facebook page, and later a YouTube channel and Tumblr blog. HK Urbex members say their videos are visual expressions of the “localist” political movement that has recently gained support in Hong Kong and reflects a conviction among many younger people that their city’s identity is distinct from that of the Chinese mainland. The localist movement is itself an outgrowth of the   Occupy Central protests of 2014, which swept Hong Kong  and reflected a widespread fear among many people here that Beijing is running roughshod over the “one country, two systems” principle governing Hong Kong’s transfer to Chinese rule. The principle granted the city a high degree of legal, financial and political autonomy until 2047. “I guess we’re indirectly political,” Ghost said, as Echo Delta’s drone buzzed above North Point. After filming the State Theater, whose structural supports soar above its roof in concrete parabolas like those of a suspension bridge, Echo Delta and Ghost took a taxi to the city’s Central district. The idea was to check on some abandoned buildings that they have been monitoring over the years. One stop was Central Market, a 1930s landmark that Ghost had previously explored twice  —   first by sneaking past a security guard who was urinating and later by climbing in through a window. This time, a side door was unlocked. Echo Delta slipped inside, but a security guard quickly shooed him away. “Sorry,” he said. On nearby Bridges Street, a white residential building that the pair had once sneaked into was now ringed by a fence, with “X” marks in its windows. “They’ve cleared it out,” said Echo Delta, whose alias is a play on his   nickname. Later, they saw that while several abandoned buildings near the Graham Street Market had been razed for new construction, others were still standing, right beside the market’s   vegetable hawkers. One squat apartment building in particular, which had plants growing in its crevices, caught their eye. They lingered for a few minutes under its shadow, apparently transfixed by its architectural features. “Look at those long windows,” Echo Delta said quietly. “Victorian  —   no, Georgian?” “That would be one to look into,” said Ghost, the only white member of HK Urbex. His alias plays on a Cantonese slang term for foreigners. His partner nodded. “I bet it’s going to be turned into a Starbucks,” Echo Delta said."

A Great Freeze Over the Great Lakes
Ice cover on North America’s Great Lakes reached 88 percent in mid-February 2014—levels not observed since 1994.

The average maximum ice extent since 1973 is just over 50 percent. It has surpassed 80 percent just five times in four decades. The lowest average ice extent occurred in 2002, when only 9.5 percent of the lakes froze.
The image above shows the Great Lakes in natural color in the early afternoon, when ice covered 80.3 percent of the lakes, according to NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory.

“Persistently low temperatures across the Great Lakes region are responsible for the increased areal coverage of the ice,” said Nathan Kurtz, cryospheric scientist NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Cold air and winds remove heat from the fresh water until it reaches the freezing point, at which point ice begins to form on the surface. “Low temperatures are the dominant mechanism for thickening the ice, but secondary factors like clouds, snow, and wind also play a role.”
“We had an early ice season this year, owing to cold temperatures in the fall and early winter,” added George Leshkevich of NOAA’s Great Lakes lab. “Ice was reported on bays and harbors of the Great Lakes as early as the end of November, as opposed to the normal timing of mid-December.”
The frozen lakes have implications well beyond the water surface and the winter. Extensive ice cover on the Great Lakes can change the patterns and amounts of the famous “lake effect” snowfall in the region, explained Walt Meier, a cryospheric scientist at NASA Goddard. When the lakes are mostly ice free, cold west or north winds blow over the warmer water, pick up moisture, and then drop snow on the lee side of the lakes (usually eastern and southern shores). When the lakes freeze, the effect generally shuts down. However, the region is still receiving a fair amount of snow this winter due to other weather patterns, Meier noted.
Lake levels could be affected in the summer. Winter ice cover generally reduces evaporation during winter months. If that turns out to be the case in 2014, it would be “good news for local water supplies, as well as for shipping and recreational use,” Meier said.
A 2012 study published in the Journal of Climate by scientists from NOAA’s Great Lakes lab found that winter ice cover on Lake Superior decreased 79 percent from 1973 to 2010. The study also showed that ice cover on the lakes is highly variable and difficult to predict.

"In an article that appeared online in The Mail on Sunday, a British tabloid, the journalist David Rose described “astonishing evidence” that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States had “rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris agreement on climate change. ” “Exposed: How world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data,” the article’s headline read. Mr. Rose, who has made   claims in the past that did not hold up to scrutiny, said a “  ” John J. Bates, a recently retired scientist at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, had told him that the agency “breached its own rules on scientific integrity” in publishing the study in June 2015. According to Mr. Rose, the study, which refuted earlier work that suggested global warming had slowed in the first decade of this century, “was aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders” at the talks in Paris in December 2015 that led to the agreement by more than 190 nations to set limits on carbon emissions. After Mr. Rose’s article was published, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and its chairman, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, wrote about it on Twitter. Beginning in 2013, scientists published papers showing that, according to land and sea surface temperature data, the rate of global warming had slowed since the late 1990s. This pause or hiatus, as it was often called, puzzled scientists because it came despite a continuing increase in emissions of carbon dioxide and other   gases. The findings also became a cause célèbre among climate change denialists, who cited the papers as evidence that concerns about global warming were at the least overblown. The 2015 paper, by Thomas R. Karl, who was then director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and others, used improved data sets to show that the slowdown probably did not occur at all. Because temperature data was collected in different ways over the years  —   and some methods were more reliable than others  —   it is normal for the data to be refined and adjusted. Mr. Karl’s paper reflected the latest refinements, especially for ocean data. In the Mail on Sunday article, Dr. Bates, who at one point was in charge of archiving climate data at the centers, accused Mr. Karl of having used “unverified” data. In a long blog post published Saturday, Dr. Bates went into extensive detail  —   the kind that only true data geeks could love  —   about how data sets are or are not archived and verified at NOAA. But Dr. Bates also accused Mr. Karl of misusing the process. “We find Tom Karl’s thumb on the scale pushing for, and often insisting on, decisions that maximize warming and minimize documentation,” he wrote. Republicans on the House committee and Mr. Smith, in particular, have long attacked Mr. Karl’s paper and have focused on it as part of a lingering investigation of what Mr. Smith has described as the Obama administration’s “suspect climate agenda. ” The committee has demanded that NOAA researchers turn over emails related to the work the scientists have refused to do so. Climate scientists, some of whom had worked on the data sets, voiced support for the work of Mr. Karl and the other researchers. In a post on the blog of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University, Peter Thorne, who worked on the data but left NOAA before work began on the paper itself, disputed much of what Dr. Bates said. Dr. Bates, Dr. Thorne wrote, was not involved in the data work and had misrepresented “the processes that actually occurred. ” Dr. Thorne also disputed the idea that Mr. Karl had his “thumb on the scale. ” Mr. Karl only used the data  —   he was not personally involved in the refinements, Dr. Thorne wrote. “At no point was any pressure brought to bear to make any scientific or technical choices. ” In a post at Carbon Brief, a British website that covers climate science and policy, Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, disputed the contention that the data sets used in Mr. Karl’s paper were unverified or that the data had been manipulated. Dr. Hausfather was one of the authors of a review of the NOAA ocean data, which showed the most change. The paper, published in January, compared the old and new NOAA data with independent data from satellites, buoys and other sources and found that the new data matched the independent data more closely. The result, he wrote, “strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. ” In an interview on Monday with EE News, Dr. Bates appeared to distance himself from some of what he wrote in the blog post, and from the way his criticisms were portrayed in the Mail on Sunday article. “The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data,” he said, “but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was. ” Climate Home, a nonprofit site based in London that offers news and analysis, also weighed in on one of the central contentions of Mr. Rose’s article, that the publication of the NOAA paper had ”duped” policy makers into adopting the Paris accord. The site contacted representatives to the talks from 10 countries none said that the paper had any influence."

Dictators have been falling in the Middle East, but that doesn’t mean freedom is inevitably expanding. Unfortunately, the Arab Spring has turned into something far different than hoped. Especially for religious minorities.



The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has released its latest report with grim news. According to USCIRF: “Across the global landscape, the pivotal human right of religious freedom was under escalating attack. To an alarming extent, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief was being curtailed, often threatening the safety and survival of innocent persons, including members of religious minorities.”



Religious liberty matters even to people who are not religious. Everyone has a transcendent worldview. Protecting the right to believe also means protecting the right not to believe.



Moreover, religious liberty is an important indicator of political freedom and other human rights. A society and state which refuse to respect the most fundamental right of conscience in religion are unlikely to respect it elsewhere. Religious liberty is the proverbial canary in the mine. If people are oppressed because of their religious faith, they are likely to be victimized for holding other unpopular beliefs.



The problem is not just direct state oppression. Some governments aid and abet persecution by not protecting religious minorities. Noted the Commission: “The failure to prevent or punish violence against vulnerable religious minorities provided a grim portrait of how states can create or fuel a culture of impunity, encouraging private citizens or groups to threaten, intimidate, and even murder others.”



Religious persecution is widespread, but it is not in America, where the First Amendment guarantees Americans a degree of religious liberty that is almost unique in the world. Cultural hostility to religion exists, but is not the same as religious persecution.



The Commission focused on 25 particularly egregious countries. It advocated that the State Department rate 16 of them as “Countries of Particular Concern” because they are responsible for “particularly severe” violations of religious liberty. USCIRF put another nine nations on its “Watch List” because of “negative trends that could develop into severe violations.”



Alas, the CPCs included many supposed American allies and friends.



 **Burma**. The military junta relinquished power to a nominally civilian government, which is liberalizing the political process. Nevertheless, the legacy of past abuses lives on. Reported the Commission: “Religious groups, particularly ethnic minority Christians and Muslims and Buddhist monks suspected of engaging in anti‐​government activity, faced intrusive monitoring, arrest, mistreatment, destruction or desecration of property, severe restrictions on worship, education, and religious activities, and targeted violence.”



However, if present trends continue, Burma may fall off of the list of its own accord. For instance, the government has reached a ceasefire with the rebellious Karen National Union, which represents the predominantly Christian Karen. Moreover, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has gone from house arrest to parliament. Much more remains to be done, but for the first time in decades the prognosis appears positive.



 **China**. The People’s Republic of China is far freer than it was during the maniacal and murderous reign of Mao Zedong. However, noted USCIRF: “The Chinese government continues to violate severely its international obligations to protect the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief. Religious groups and individuals considered to threaten national security or social harmony, or whose practices are deemed superstitious, cult‐​like, or beyond the vague legal definition of ‘normal religious activities’ face severe restrictions, harassment, detention, imprisonment, and other abuses.”



Proselytizing Christians and the orthodox, non-“Patriotic” Catholic Church, face significant repression. However, added the Commission, “religious freedom conditions for Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims remain particularly acute.” It isn’t just religious believers who face persecution. Said USCIRF: “The Chinese government also continues to harass, detain, intimidate, disbar, and forcibly disappear attorneys who defend vulnerable religious groups.”



 **Egypt**. The problems with the so‐​called Arab Spring are on dramatic display. The overthrow of dictator Hosni Mubarak has made a bad situation worse.



Noted the Commission: “Over the past year, the Egyptian transitional government continued to engage in and tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief. Serious problems of discrimination, intolerance, and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavored Muslims, remain widespread in Egypt.”



Unfortunately, Islamists are likely to dominate Egypt’s future. And no one scrambling for power seems very interested in protecting unpopular minorities. Concluded USCIRF: “In 2011, violent sectarian attacks, targeting primarily Coptic Orthodox Christians, have resulted in nearly 100 deaths, surpassing the death toll of the previous 10 years combined. During the transitional period, the lack of adequate security in the streets has contributed to lawlessness in parts of the country, particularly in Upper Egypt.”



 **Eritrea**. This relatively young country emerged from years of conflict with Ethiopia with independence, not liberty. The Commission wrote: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Eritrea. These violations include: torture or other ill‐​treatment of thousands of religious prisoners; arbitrary arrests and detentions without charges of members of unregistered religious groups; a prolonged ban on public religious activities; revocation of citizenship rights of Jehovah’s Witnesses; interference in the internal affairs of registered religious groups; and inordinate delays in responding to registration applications from religious groups.”



No one is safe from the brutal attentions of the authoritarian government, but minority sects are particularly vulnerable. Noted USCIRF: “The situation is particularly dire for Jehovah’s Witnesses and members of other small and non‐​traditional religious groups, such as Evangelical and Pentecostal Christians.”



 **Iran**. It should surprise no one that Iran is inhospitable to religious liberty. Said the Commission: “The government of Iran continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused.”



All religious minorities are at risk, “most notably Baha’is, as well as Christians and Sufi Muslims,” upon whom “physical attacks, harassment, detention, arrests, and imprisonment intensified. Even the recognized non‐​Muslim religious minorities protected under Iran’s constitution—Jews, Armenian and Assyrian Christians, and Zoroastrians—faced increasing discrimination, arrests, and imprisonment.” So, too, dissenting Muslims “were intimidated, harassed, and detained.”



With the regime under increasing domestic pressure after the disputed 2009 election, “religious freedom conditions in Iran have regressed to a point not seen since the early days of the Islamic revolution.” Unfortunately, the situation is likely to worsen as foreign pressure directed at Tehran’s alleged nuclear program increases.



 **Iraq**. The U.S. invasion of Iraq was supposed to “drain the swamp” of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship. However, the situation has deteriorated dramatically for religious minorities. Reported the Commission: “The Iraqi government continues to tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations. In the past year, religious sites and worshippers were targeted in violent attacks, often with impunity, and businesses viewed as ‘un‐​Islamic’ were vandalized.”



The worst recent attacks were against Shi’as. However, religious minorities have suffered the most since the U.S. invasion. According to USCIRF: “Large percentages of the country’s smallest religious minorities—which include Chaldo‐​Assyrian and other Christians, Sabean Mandaeans, and Yazidis—have fled the country in recent years, threatening these ancient communities’ very existence in Iraq.”



 **Nigeria**. Violations of religious liberty are on the increase in this religiously‐​divided country. Noted the USCIRF: “The past year saw a dramatic rise in sectarian or religiously‐​related violence.”



Although these attacks, largely directed by radical Muslims against Christians, are not new—some 14,000 have died since 1999—they have escalated, explained the Commission, with the rise of “Boko Haram, a militant group that espouses an extreme and violence interpretation of Islam, [which] has been emboldened by the climate of impunity. Boko Haram has shifted its tactics and emphasis by targeting, killing, and bombing Christians and Christian clergy and threatening to kill all remaining Christians in the north.”



 **North Korea**. There may be no more oppressive state than the so‐​called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Getting reliable information about the DPRK is difficult, but, reported USCIRF: “There continues to be reports of severe religious abuses occurring during the past year, including: discrimination and harassment of both authorized and unauthorized religious activity; the arrest, torture, and possible execution of those conducting clandestine religious activity; and the mistreatment and imprisonment of asylum‐​seekers repatriated from China, particularly those suspected of engaging in religious activities.” There is no sign of liberalization after the death of long‐​time “Dear Leader” Kim Jong‐​il in December.



 **Pakistan**. Although nominally democratic, Pakistan is not liberal in any sense, especially when it comes to religion. Reported the Commission: “The government of Pakistan continues to both engage in and tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief. Pakistan’s repressive blasphemy laws and other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism. Sectarian and religiously‐​motivated violence is chronic, and the government has failed to protect members of the majority faith and religious minorities.”



In Pakistan the lack of religious liberty signals significant threats to other freedoms. For instance, liberal Muslims are threatened by the same extremist forces. Noted USCIRF: “Growing religious extremism threatens the freedoms of religion and expression, as well as other human rights, for everyone in Pakistan.” Unfortunately, the country is growing less rather than more stable and dangerous.



 **Saudi Arabia**. Another thuggish U.S. “friend” is Riyadh, which uses its abundant oil revenues to promote Islamic radicalism around the world. Reported the Commission: “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom continued in Saudi Arabia despite improvements.” A decade after 9/11 “the Saudi government has failed to implement a number of promised reforms related to promoting freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief.”



Moreover, Riyadh bans any non‐​Muslim worship. Even private religious activities are suppressed if they are discovered. Religion combined with politics is especially toxic for the Saudi royals. Explained USCIRF: “There have been numerous arrests and detentions of Shi’a Muslim dissidents, partly as a result of increasing protests and demonstrations related to 2011 uprisings in the region.”



 **Sudan**. Millions of people have died in recent decades in Sudan. Between 1983 and 2005, the Commission “identified Sudan as the world’s most violent abuser of the right to freedom of religion or belief.” The brutal civil war, thankfully, has ended. However, conflict between Muslim‐​majority Sudan and the newly created nation of South Sudan, dominated by Christians and animists, looks increasingly possible.



Beyond war, reported USCIRF: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief continue in Sudan. Violations include: the criminalization, subject to the death penalty, of apostasy; the efforts by the government in Khartoum to impose its restrictive interpretation of Shari’ah (Islamic law) on Muslims and non‐​Muslims; attacks and threats against the Christian community,” as well as “the denial of public religious expression and persuasion of Muslims by non‐​Muslims, while allowing proselytizing of non‐​Muslims by Muslims; and the difficulty in obtaining permission to build churches.”



 **Tajikistan**. The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have turned into human rights black holes. Observed the Commission: “The religious freedom situation in Tajikistan further deteriorated during the reporting period as it has over the past several years, leading to systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief. The state suppresses and punishes all religious activity independent of state control, and imprisons individuals on unproven criminal allegations linked to religious activity or affiliation.”



Government policies “target minority communities viewed as foreign‐​influenced, particularly Protestants and Jehovah’s Witnesses.” However, the country is an equal opportunity oppressor. Even majority Muslims are victimized by the government.



 **Turkey**. USCIRF’s most surprising (and divided) designation went to NATO ally Turkey. Explained the Commission: “The Turkish government, in the name of secularism, has long imposed burdensome regulations and denied full legal status to religious groups, violating the religious freedom rights of all religious communities. These restrictions, including policies that deny non‐​Muslim communities the rights to train clergy, offer religious education, and own and maintain places of worship, have lead to their decline, and in some cases, their virtual disappearance.”



Even Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of Turkey’s population, have suffered for years under heavy‐​handed secularist policies. As for other faiths, USCIRF pointed to “the Turkish government’s intervention into minority religious communities’ religious affairs; societal discrimination and occasional violence against religious minorities; limitations on religious dress; and anti‐​Semitism in Turkish society and media.”



 **Turkmenistan**. This Central Asian state long was a North Korean wannabe—a repressive, isolated totalitarian system with suffocating personality cult. The death of one dictator only led to the elevation of another one. Reported the Commission: “Severe religious freedom violations and official harassment of religious adherents persist in Turkmenistan.” Despite some minor political reforms in recent years, “the country’s laws, policies, and practices continue to violate international human rights norms, including those on freedom of religion or belief. Police raids and other harassment of registered and unregistered religious groups continue.”



 **Uzbekistan**. No better is neighboring Uzbekistan. The government, observed USCIRF: “has systematically and egregiously violated freedom of religion or belief. The Uzbek government violates the full range of human rights and harshly penalizes individuals for independent religious activity regardless of their religious affiliation.” The objective is to maintain political control, resulting in restrictions on Muslims, who make up a majority of the population. Explained the Commission, “The government continues to arrest Muslims and repress individuals, groups, and mosques that do not conform to officially‐​prescribed practices or that it claims are associated with extremist political programs.”



 **Vietnam**. This nominally communist country remains hostile to religious liberty. Concluded USCIRF: “The government of Vietnam continues to control all religious communities, restrict and penalize independent religious practice severely, and repress individuals and groups viewed as challenging its authority.” Despite some improvements in recent years, “individuals continue to be imprisoned or detained for reasons related to their religious activity or religious freedom activity.”



In fact, Vietnam appears to be regressing. The Commission warned that “in the past reporting period, there were marked increases in arrests, detentions, and harassment of groups and individuals viewed as hostile to the Communist Party, including violence aimed at peaceful ethnic minority gatherings and Catholics protesting land confiscations and harassment.” Hanoi may be friendlier toward Washington, but it remains ruthlessly hostile to religious belief.



Religious persecution is serious but less pervasive in another nine countries, which made USCIRF’s Watch List.



 **Afghanistan**. Liberated from the extremist Taliban by allied forces, Afghanistan nevertheless remains inhospitable to religious liberty. Reported the Commission: “Conditions for religious freedom are exceedingly poor for dissenting members of the majority faith and for minority religious communities.” The constitution “contains a repugnancy clause stating that no law can be contrary to the tenets of Islam, which the government has interpreted to limit fundamental freedoms. Individuals who dissent from the prevailing orthodoxy regarding Islamic beliefs and practices are subject to legal action.” Like Saudi Arabia, there is not even one Christian church operating openly.



 **Belarus**. This former Soviet republic still operates much like the old Soviet Union. Explained USCIRF: “The government of Belarus, through intrusive laws and policies, continues to violate the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief throughout the country. Religious communities and individuals found to have violated these restrictive laws have been harassed, raided, fined, and detained. Vandalism of religious properties has occurred with impunity.”



 **Cuba**. This poor island nation has not abandoned the formal pretense of communism, but appears to be informally giving up the practice. Unfortunately, though, the Commission found that “Serious religious freedom violations continue in Cuba despite some improvements. Violations by the Cuban government include: detention, sporadic arrests, and harassment of clergy and religious leaders, as well as interference in church affairs. The Cuban government also controls and monitors religious belief and practices through surveillance and legal restrictions.”



 **India**. The world’s largest democracy does not itself persecute, but has proved unable or unwilling to stop religious repression at the provincial level as well as communal violence. Noted USCIRF: “intimidation, harassment, and occasional small‐​scale violence against members of religious minority groups continued, particularly against Christians in states with anti‐​conversion laws. While there has been no large‐​scale communal violence against religious minorities since 2008… the deleterious pace of the judicial responses and the adopted anti‐​conversion laws enable impunity.”



 **Indonesia**. The most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia has moved steadily along the democratic path. However, reported the Commission, “the country’s tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism has been strained. While the government has addressed past sectarian violence and curtailed terrorist networks, religious minorities continue to experience intimidation, discrimination, and societal violence… and national laws and provincial decrees have restricted religious freedom.”



 **Laos**. Another communist relic, noted USCIRF, “the Lao government restricts religious practice through its legal code and has not curtailed religious freedom abuses in some rural areas. Provincial officials continue to violate the freedom of religion or belief of ethnic minority Protestants through detentions, surveillance, harassment, property confiscations, forced relocations, and forced renunciations of faith.” Thankfully, the status of religious liberty has improved in urban areas.



 **Russia**. The former communist motherland tragically is regressing. The Commission explained: “The government increasingly used its anti‐​extremism law against peaceful religious groups and individuals, particularly Jehovah’s Witnesses and Muslim readers of the works of Turkish theologian Said Nursi. National and local officials also apply other laws to harass Muslims and groups they view as non‐​traditional or alien. These actions, along with rising xenophobia and intolerance, including anti‐​Semitism, are linked to violent or lethal hate crimes.”



 **Somalia**. This failed state lacks any effective government. USCIRF wrote that “Egregious religious freedom violations by the U.S.-designated terrorist group al‐​Shabaab continue in Somalia, including: the violent implementation of its extremist interpretation of Islamic law and use of hudood punishments; execution of those it deems ‘enemies of Islam;’ and killing of Christian converts.”



 **Venezuela**. President Hugo Chavez may be dying, but his system of repression remains brutally healthy. Reported the Commission, violations of religious liberty include: “the government’s failure to investigate and hold accountable perpetrators of attacks on religious leaders and houses of worship, and virulent rhetoric from president Hugo Chavez, government officials, state media, and pro‐​Chavez media directed at the Venezuelan Jewish and Christian communities.”



Even these states do not end the parade of evil. Assaults on religious liberty occur elsewhere. USCIRF pointed to serious abuses in Bahrain, Bangladesh, and Kazakhstan. Violations are even evident in Europe, most notably Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, where Muslim women have been barred from voluntarily wearing the hijab.



Despite its best efforts, America cannot make the world free. But at least Americans can work to make the world freer. They should support religious liberty as they go out into the world.

—————————————————-
Many of us were shocked at hearing the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) had sharply criticized University of Alabama climate scientist Dr. Roy Spencer because he finally decided to defend himself against the constant stream of Holocaust-laced slurs and abuse that had been thrown his way by rabid global warming activists over years. The reason for the continuous string of slurs and insults? The leading climatologist disagreed with alarmist climate science. His scientific opinions were different.
So why is the ADL focusing only on Spencer’s harsh choice of words and totally ignoring the years of Holocaust-laden “denier” slurs and analogies that have been fired regularly at skeptic scientists and journalists? We can only speculate that they have been sleeping on the job.
What follows are just a few examples of the hate and defamation that skeptics (people with a different opinion) have been the target of.
In 2006 Grist Magazine’s David Roberts called for Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” of the global warming “denial industry.” Professor Roger Pielke Jr. responded on October 9, 2006: “Let’s be blunt. This allusion is an affront to those who suffered and died in the Holocaust. This allusion has no place in the discourse on climate change.” He’s right and surely the ADL agrees.
How can anyone equate disagreement on climate science to denying the Holocaust? Roberts thinks that denying the Holocaust is equal to denying his climate science? To me this is a diminishment of the Holocaust of the nastiest sort.
Former NASA GISS director and global warming activist James Hansen accused skeptics of global warming scientists of committing “a crime against humanity”, a label used to describe atrocities like genocide or the Nazi Holocaust. Hansen even equated coal wagons to rail cars that transported Jews to concentration camps. How sickening can you get? Why was there not a peep from the ADL?
Yet another extremely deplorable example of intolerance and intellectual arrogance occurred just 15 months ago when University of Graz music professor Robert Parncutt openly called for the death penalty for climate skeptics, a clear defamation of people who simply have a different view of climate science. Parncutt portrayed skeptics as criminals so heinous that they deserved to die. Where was the ADL?
Yesterday Marc Morano at his Climate Depot reminded us of the disturbingly twisted final-solution-type fantasies greenshirt zealots have for climate science skeptics. NYU bioethicist S. Matthew Liao, who thinks skepticism in climate science is a mental illness. ‘If you can give something like oxytocin to people, then maybe they’ll be more willing to cooperate, to care more about the environment’. This reminds of how Alan Turing‘s homosexuality was viewed in a similarly appalling way. For his “deviance”, Turing was chemically castrated by the British government and became so depressed that he was driven to suicide. At the time 97% of experts said homosexuality was deviant.
Morano offers other examples of systematic defamation and criminalization of alternative scientific thought.
Far worse and disturbing, however, is that global warming zealots openly express their violent fantasies of dehumanizing, criminalizing and blowing skeptics into bloody bits and pieces. Where is the ADL? From which regimes have we seen such a level of arrogance and intolerance in the past?

Last spring, the German government even went so far as to issue a 123-page brochure that singled out and named US and German skeptic scientists and journalists, and warned the German public not to listen to them. German journalist Henryk Broder, who himself is Jewish, found the German policy so shocking that it reminded him of the Reichskulturkammer, a Nazi agency charged with making sure German art remained “pure”. Even Jewish intellectuals like Broder are ringing the alarm bells. Where’s the ADL?
So precisely what ingredients are needed to cook up an atrocity, like those fantasized in the 10:10 No Pressure video? In the 1973 Ascent of Man series scientist Jacob Bronowski provides the answer: arrogance and dogma.
That deliberate deafness to suffering has become the monster in the war machine. […] The assertion of dogma that closes the mind and turns a nation, a civilization into a regiment of ghosts, of obedient ghosts, or of tortured ghosts. […]
This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some 4 million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods […] Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.”
It is the belief of having absolute knowledge and being the keeper of the truth that turns one into a dangerous menace. Bronowski aptly quotes Oliver Cromwell:
I beseech you from the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.”
This is what skeptics are pleading – and for this they are being criminalized and defamed.
Ironically many of the skeptics being attacked and labeled deniers are Jews themselves: Fred Singer (who actually fled the Nazis), Richard Lindzen, Nir Shaviv, Benny Peiser, to name four off the top of my head. I wonder what they think of the ADL’s one-sided attack on Dr Spencer. My guess is that they are appalled by the ADL’s blindness and poorly judged move.
Bronowski ends with the moving images of him scooping the remains from a pond, where he pleads:
We have to touch people.”
Touch people…and not blow them up to bits and pieces.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe alarmists at Skeptical Science put up a “Hiroshima Bomb Heat Clock” claiming that the earth’s climate system has “accumulated” over 2 billion Hiroshima bombs worth of thermonuclear heat since 1998. This heat, they say, will pop out in the future and make us all very sorry.

Image cropped yesterday from Skeptical Science. 
Yet, despite the hundreds of millions of Hiroshima heat bombs, we have seen 0°C of warming in the earth’s atmosphere during the very same period. Comically, despite the 2 billion plus climate ground-zeros, not a single one of them can be found in our atmosphere:

NTZ climate temperature clock. Chart: Wood For Trees. 
So where could all that heat possibly have gone? Why hasn’t the global atmospheric temperature gone up with all that accumulated (trapped) heat?
The answer is that a part of this alleged quantity of heat very likely has not been permanently trapped. A significant part likely has been re-radiated back out into space. Things like that happen when it’s a little warmer. Moreover, much of it probably has been absorbed by the oceans, whose sheer mass has a thermal heat capacity that is 100 times that of the atmosphere. Even SkS acknowledges this here.
The problem is that the SkS bedwetters would like to have us believe that the heat absorbed by the oceans is somehow getting packed in a compact suitcase, is getting transported around below the ocean surface for awhile, and that it will later get suddenly belched out back into the atmosphere almost all at once. This is a story that is either the product of astonishing ignorance or a malevolent desire to deceive.
That’s not the way heat behaves, of course.

Think of it as hot water getting introduced into a bath tub filled with cool water. The heat just doesn’t stay together in a clump and swim around waiting to scald you 30 minutes later, rather it quickly gets distributed via conduction and convection throughout the entire bathtub.
In a similar manner, heat absorbed by the ocean gets distributed around the ocean’s vast volume via convection and thermal conduction as well. It just doesn’t stay clumped together, hide for awhile, and later pop out all at once. It’s very complex and it just doesn’t work the way the SkS horror-storytellers say it does. In fact, none of their stories have turned out to be right so far. According to their fairy tales from ten years ago, the atmosphere was supposed to be some 0.3°C warmer today than it actually is.
2 billion Hiroshima bombs would heat the ocean a mere 0.024°C
So how much would 2 billion Hiroshima bombs heat the entire ocean system if it got more or less uniformly distributed? This is easy to compute. The mass of the ocean is about 1.3 x 10exp24 grams. The energy of 2 billion Hiroshima bombs is approx. 130  x 10exp21 Joules. the specific heat of water is 4.186 Joules/g°C. Thus the 2.1 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat would warm the ocean by approx.:
0.024°C
The range of uncertainty in measuring ocean temperature is far greater. There are lots of zeros involved and hopefully I didn’t lose or gain one or two during the number-crunching. Remember, this is assuming that there really is 2.1 billion bombs of heat accumulated.
What we are talking about here is on the same order of magnitude as someone trying to heat his home with a single cigarette lighter…and hoping none of the heat escapes out of the house!
Of course added heat is not distributed throughout the ocean uniformly, but it is certainly not kept in a tidy little package either. Ocean currents are still very poorly understood.
The Hiroshima heat clock is a gimmick
So why has SkS come up with this somewhat idiotic and reality-remote Hiroshima heat-bomb-clock? It’s a gimmick. It’s to distract the readers from the embarrassment of no global atmospheric warming since their silly clock started counting.
We’ll get our natural ENSO heat releases and absorptions and the corresponding heating and cooling in the atmosphere. But at the same time, any external heat absorbed by the ocean will get distributed with much of it is likely not coming back out for a very long time…and only when the atmosphere cools.

 _Cato will be hosting a panel discussion on January 28,The Future of Progressive Foreign Policy: 2020 and Beyond, featuring Kate Kizer from Win Without War, Loren DeJonge Schulman from the Center for a New American Security, Dan Nexon from Georgetown University, Adam Mount from the Federation of American Scientists, and Mena Ayazi from the Alliance for Peacebuilding. _



_To provide some broad perspective for the discussion, we are sharing a slightly updated version of an article wepublished in the November/​December issue of the German magazine, _Internationale Politik _. In it we use speeches and campaign literature from the candidates to discern their foreign policy perspectives. Through our efforts we identified three broad clusters within the Democratic Party that we call traditional liberal internationalist, millennial liberal internationalist, and progressive. The challenge for Democrats, as we discuss below, is to determine which vision is the right one for the post‐​Trump era…_



The recent Democratic debate was the first to showcase foreign policy in a meaningful way. The candidates grappled with questions about the role of Commander‐​in‐​Chief, the confrontation with Iran, whether to keep troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and broader questions of military intervention. Though foreign policy hasn’t played a huge role in the Democratic race so far, international affairs are poised to play a central role this fall. Even without the Ukraine scandal, Trump’s erratic and unpopular record as a statesman provides an opening for Democrats to score points on foreign policy in 2020, but only if they can articulate a new vision that resonates with the American public.



Even before Trump’s election in 2016 foreign policy thinkers were beginning to realize that American grand strategy had to change. After more than fifteen years of war in Afghanistan and the Middle East Americans enthusiasm for foreign adventures had expired, and many observers believed that public support for the traditional American leadership of the liberal international order had expired along with it. The big question was: what would come next?



To most of the Washington foreign policy establishment, Trump’s embrace of “America First” suggested the most terrifying answer possible to this question. Instead of steady American leadership, free trade, a robust system of alliances, and intervention in hot spots around the globe, Trump’s vision relied on unilateralism, protectionism, and withdrawing from America’s endless wars. To say Trump’s election sent shock waves through foreign policy circles in the United States is an understatement.



As Trump nears his fourth year in office, however, it turns out that the public has not embraced his “America First” vision. In fact, Trump has single‐​handedly pushed public support for international engagement and free trade to near record highs. Since Trump took office, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs finds that Americans are seven percentage points more likely to support global engagement, six percentage points more likely to support the Iran deal and Paris Climate Accords, ten percentage points increase for support for NAFTA, and support for alliances with Japan, South Korea, and NATO are at their highest level since polling began. The result is that Democrats have an opportunity to respond not only to Trump but to provide an updated strategy for dealing with 21st century challenges.



The problem is that Democrats have not yet developed a consensus around that new vision, whatever it might be someday. Since the 2016 campaign candidates and foreign policy experts have been waging a slow but steady, behind‐​the‐​scenes battle to define the future of Democratic foreign policy. Though most Democrats can agree on several things like how disastrous Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Treaty was, or how poorly Trump has treated America’s allies, or how harmful his cozying up to autocrats has been, Democrats have not yet provided a definite answer to at least six important questions:



To determine where the Democrats stand today we assessed the eighteen most serious candidates’ positions on nineteen different issues. These issues include things like what the United States should do in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, whether the United States should intervene militarily in North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Ukraine, or Yemen, and how the United States should deal with both China and the war on terror. We also examined candidate positions on how ambitious and active American foreign policy should be, the importance of alliances and international agreements like the Paris Climate Treaty, and support for free trade agreements as well as the trade war with China.



To identify the candidates’ views we reviewed the candidates’ speeches, websites, sound bites in media coverage, their answers to foreign policy questions in the debates, as well as other efforts by organizations like the Washington Post and the Council on Foreign Relations to summarize their views on the issues.



Our general approach for each issue was to ask whether the candidate’s position was roughly in line with current policy and, if not, in what direction it differed. For military issues we asked whether a candidate was taking a more or less hawkish position than the status quo. We asked whether the candidate favored more or less international cooperation on a range of issues. And we assessed whether candidates were more or less supportive of free trade than current policies.



Though this approach simplifies things a good deal, it allows us to make use of the available information, which is relatively scarce for certain issues and several candidates. This scoring system also allowed us to provide each candidate with an easy‐​to‐​understand score for militarism, embrace of international cooperation, and support for free trade. Figure One below summarizes the results of this exercise, illustrating both where candidates stand relative to current American policies and also to one another (warning: these figures were made before several candidates dropped out).



 **Figure One. 3 Dimensions of Democratic Foreign Policy View**





The numbers make it all look very scientific, but it’s important not to push our data too far. After all, most of the candidates have not produced a fully imagined foreign policy doctrine, nor has foreign policy taken center stage at any point so far in the campaign. Some candidates may have remained noncommittal in order to make themselves attractive as a vice presidential running mate. We have undoubtedly missed some important nuances and some candidates may articulate positions different from the ones we have captured here.



The analysis nonetheless helps us identify broad patterns. First, in relation to President Trump, all of the Democrats are less hawkish (though to varying degrees), more inclined toward international cooperation (with very little variation), and only slightly more supportive of free trade. None of these findings are surprising, but they do bolster our confidence that our approach to measuring candidate positions makes sense.



 **Competing Camps of Democratic Foreign Policy**



The second and more interesting pattern emerges from focusing on the issues that divide the Democrats. As Figure One shows, all Democrats embrace the need for international cooperation in a general sense. The two main issues dividing them into competing factions today are 1) how forcefully should the United States attempt to exert global leadership, and 2) what role should the use of military force play in American foreign policy?



As Figure Two reveals, when we array the Democrats across the dimensions of militarism and foreign policy activism, we can identify three camps competing to define next generation Democratic foreign policy.



 **Figure Two. Democratic Foreign Policy Matrix**





_The traditional liberal internationalists_



The first of these is what we call the traditional liberal internationalist camp and comprises the status quo wing of Democratic foreign policy. This camp includes candidates who score high both on militarism but also on the broader index of foreign policy activism, which we determined by how often a candidate has called for doing more than the status quo on an issue, whether the issue is trade, cooperation, or military focused, and by factoring in any explicit statements they have made about the role of American leadership in the world.



The animating principle of the traditional liberal internationalist camp has not changed much



over time. Its advocates believe that the United States remains the “indispensable nation” and has the responsibility to defend the liberal international order and to intervene around the world – through diplomacy as well as by military force – to resolve international problems like climate change, to promote regional stability, to prevent humanitarian tragedies, and to contain the rise of peer competitors like China.



This camp has long dominated both the Republican and Democratic parties, and its members have included George W. Bush and Barack Obama as well as Hillary Clinton. Former Vice President Joe Biden now carries the flag, ranking at the top of the group on both the militarism and cooperation scales and advocating energetic American leadership abroad. Biden’s fellow travelers in this camp include Senator Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota and Dan Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado.



Biden has made it clear that if he is elected, he would abandon the inward‐​looking aspects of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy. On a page from his web site aptly titled “American Leadership,” Biden argued that the United States must take “immediate steps” to “once more place America at the head of the table, leading the world to address the most urgent global challenges.”



And despite the fact that Biden, like all of the other Democrats, has called for ending the “forever wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq, his campaign rhetoric makes it clear that he fully supports the continued pursuit of military primacy, embraces the global war on terrorism, and views the use of military force as an essential foreign policy tool.



 _The Millennial liberal internationalists_



In the middle of the matrix we find the largest group of candidates in a cluster that we call the Millennial liberal internationalists. This group of candidates represents a generational shift between older Democrats who continue to embrace the traditional notion of American exceptionalism and younger Democrats who seem more comfortable with a framework of shared global leadership.



Though the older candidates like Biden, Sanders, and Warren currently lead the pack, these younger candidates clearly sense that the days of traditional foreign policy are numbered. Pete Buttigieg, the 38‐​year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is technically the only member of the Millennial generation in the race, but he is also the candidate who has spent the most time articulating what this vision might look like. In a major foreign policy speech earlier this year, Buttigieg noted that “…we face not just another presidential election, but a transition between one era and another….I believe that the next three or four years will determine the next 30 or 40 for our country and the world.”



On a policy level, the Millennial liberal internationalists tend to have less ambitious visions and, perhaps most importantly, they exhibit less enthusiasm for the use of military force than their older colleagues. As Andrew Yang argues, “America is the beneficiary of the international world order we helped establish throughout the twentieth century. That said, we have deluded ourselves into thinking that we are capable of doing things that we are not, sometimes at a terrible cost to ourselves and others. My first principles concerning foreign policy are restraint and judgment — we should be very judicious about projecting force and have clear goals that we know we can accomplish.”



 _Progressive internationalism_



Finally, on the left side of the matrix we can identify the progressive foreign policy camp, championed most energetically by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but also including former Representative Beto O’Rourke, Senator Kristin Gillibrand, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard. Thanks to the success of Bernie Sander’s 2016 campaign and the increasing prominence of progressives in the Democratic Party since the 2018 midterm elections, the progressive foreign policy camp has generated a good deal of momentum of late.



The clearest thread connecting the members of the progressive wing is distaste for the use of military force. The most dovish of this group is Tulsi Gabbard, who argues that the United States needs a new foreign policy that “stops wasting our resources, and lives on regime change wars, and redirects our focus and energy towards peace and prosperity for all people.” In a similar vein, Elizabeth Warren articulated a common progressive critique of American foreign policy when she wrote that “we have allowed the imperial presidency to stretch the Constitution beyond recognition to justify the use of force, with little oversight from Congress. The government has, at times, defended tactics, such as torture, that are antithetical to American values.”



But though the lack of militarism is the most obvious factor that distinguishes this camp from the other two, the most important differences are actually the progressive camp’s idealism and its attempt to link domestic and foreign policy with a unifying thread. The result is that even though there is a good deal of overlap between the policy positions of the progressives and many of the other Democrats, the animating forces of progressive foreign policy and some of its ultimate aims are quite different.



Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, in particular, have articulated foreign policy visions that embrace vigorous American leadership while placing much heavier emphasis on promoting American ideals. They promise much more active American efforts to defend the liberal international order, for example, as well as the promotion of democracy in the face of rising authoritarian challenges. As one observer said of Sanders’ platform, ““It’s a vision in which international economics would be subordinated to a vision of political relations and human rights that would be as big a departure from Clintonism as Trumpism, just in a different direction.”



And in recognition that Trump’s America First rhetoric has struck a chord on Main Street, both Sanders and Warren have attempted to justify foreign policy activism by connecting it to domestic economic concerns. As Warren has written, “Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Instead, efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for competitors to rise up and lash out.” Sanders concurs, arguing that, “we see a growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy” and that the United States needs to “take into account the outrageous income and wealth inequality that exists globally and in our own country.”



 **Looking Ahead**



This snapshot of the competing Democratic visions raises two important questions. First, assuming one of these Democrats becomes the next president, how far can we trust this analysis to predict his or her future foreign policy choices? Second, which of these will generate the most support from the American public?



Sadly, for foreign policy analysts the predictive power of exercises like this is relatively limited. Rarely do four years pass without events derailing the best laid plans of an administration. George W. Bush, recall, took office in 2001 having argued on the campaign trail that the United States should resist nation building and military intervention abroad.



But even if events did not intrude, there is simply an enormous amount of inertia in American foreign policy, reflected in international institutions and alliances, in domestic politics and public opinion, and in the worldviews of national security professionals. The “Blob” as President Obama called the foreign policy establishment, dominates public foreign policy debates and its members occupy almost all of the important roles in foreign policy making. This has made it difficult for presidents to pursue foreign policies that deviate from traditional liberal internationalism. President Trump has met tremendous backlash whenever he has threatened to chart a more “America First” path, dampening his ability to make big changes. Democrats promoting more radical departures from the status quo like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Tulsi Gabbard, would very likely face similar difficulties.



The last question is how well these competing visions are playing with the public. Though Biden leads in most of the polls, his foreign policy is the least appealing to most Democrats, and to young Americans more generally. Research has shown that younger Americans remain committed to cooperative forms of international engagement, but are far less supportive of defense spending and the use of military force than older Americans. In a recent poll, for example, just 44 percent of Millennials felt that maintaining superior military power should be a critical U.S. foreign policy goal, compared to 64 percent of Baby Boomers and 70 percent of the Silent Generation.



The shift from militarism is easily understood. Younger Americans have spent their formative years and early adulthood watching – and fighting in – lengthy, unsuccessful military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Unlike their grandparents, they did not experience the heady aftermath of World War II when the United States enjoyed incredible economic and political dominance. Coming of age after the end of the Cold War, neither Millennials nor members of Generation Z have a real awareness of the role military strength played in the successful containment strategy of the Cold War. If they were aware, they’d have also noticed that the United States rarely used military force after the Vietnam debacle and still won the Cold War in 1991. Simply put, to young Americans, war has looked like a poor strategy. As a result, they do not share their elders’ confidence in America’s ability to use military force to pursue national interests effectively.



This intergenerational shift favors both the Millennial liberal internationalists like Pete Buttigieg and the progressive internationalists like Sanders and Warren, at least to a point. A red flag for progressives, however, is the way both Sanders and Warren have recast foreign policy as an extension of domestic debates over economic and social policy. To win middle‐​class votes, both Sanders and Warren have decried unfair trade deals, kleptocracy, global inequality and the influence of multinational corporations.



Though these are important issues, they are also potential justifications for fruitless and expensive efforts to reshape the world. And just as American military power has failed – dramatically and at staggering cost — to reshape the Middle East over the past 18 years, so too would American economic and diplomatic power fail to reorganize the world to the tastes of the progressives in the Democratic Party.



In short, the danger is that in their search for a motivating principle for the future of U.S. foreign policy, Democrats may propose big ideas that sound nice but will instead promote more misguided U.S. activism under a new heading. Instead, the Democrats’ best bet to win public support, especially from the next generation, is to identify what current U.S. responsibilities — from the ongoing forever wars in at least eight countries to longstanding treaty commitments to militarily defend more than 60 nations abroad – should be abandoned and which must be maintained for the 21st Century.

"Look with your eyes, not your hands. You were probably told that at some point growing up, as your eagerness to see and experience something new was checked by a wary adult. Humans now handle the Earth in a similarly precarious manner. Our desire to explore the world is increasingly plagued by an awareness that international travel harms the very places we spend so much to visit. There are more commercial flights taking off today than at any other time in history. Many of them will take tourists to see the world’s most striking natural beauty. Snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef, trekking in the Amazon, boat tours in the Arctic – cheap air travel has opened more of the world to tourism and ensured more people can afford to see it.  But it has come at a heavy cost to the planet. Aviation currently accounts for 2-3% of all annual carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. That may not sound a lot, but aeroplanes heat the atmosphere by up to three times more than their CO₂ emissions alone because they release nitrogen oxides – powerful greenhouse gases – and create contrails in their wake which trap even more heat in the atmosphere. A single flight from London to New York is estimated to melt about 3.3 square metres of Arctic ice. Greta Thunberg – the campaigner who started the youth climate strikes – is making that journey to attend the UN annual climate summit in September. Rather than take a transatlantic flight and contribute to yet more ice melting, she’s sailing from Plymouth on a zero-carbon yacht.  Meanwhile, the aviation industry is predicted to double by 2040  – doubling the number of flights and the number of people taking them. Earth has warmed by 1°C since pre-industrial times and already many coral reefs are struggling beyond their thermal limits, while rainforests are drying out. Without drastic action, there may be little cause for exploring the world’s natural beauty in future, as there’ll be much less of it to see. In this fifth issue of Imagine, we asked researchers to scan the horizon of air travel. Does the climate crisis demand we turn our backs on the skies and remain permanently grounded? Or could a technological breakthrough keep our travel obsessions afloat? What is Imagine? Imagine is a newsletter from The Conversation that presents a vision of a world acting on climate change. Drawing on the collective wisdom of academics in fields from anthropology and zoology to technology and psychology, it investigates the many ways life on Earth could be made fairer and more fulfilling by taking radical action on climate change.

Few analogies capture the urgency of the climate crisis so succinctly. Political recognition of the crisis has been sluggish, but at the time of writing four countries have declared a climate emergency: the UK, France, Canada and Ireland. Worldwide, 935 local government bodies, which cover 206m people in 18 countries, have done the same. In the UK, parliament voted to declare a climate emergency on May 1 2019. But less than a year before that, MPs voted by 415 votes to 119 to build a third runway at London’s Heathrow airport – already the largest single source of CO₂ in the UK. Had Britain’s parliamentarians suddenly realised their error a year on? More likely, they are like most of us who recognise the threat of the climate crisis but aren’t aware of – or would rather not think about – the scale of the change that’s needed to avert it. That’s a problem that undermines many pledges to reduce emissions – and not just those made on the international stage. Within the towns and cities we live, councils commit to radical action in one breath while approving plans that will ramp up emissions in the next. The city council of Leeds recently declared a climate emergency and signed off on a strict carbon budget which commits the city to emitting no more than 42 megatonnes of CO₂ between 2018 and 2050. At the same time, the council has endorsed the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport – promising new transport links and a commercial centre nearby.

      We can't expand airports after declaring a climate emergency – let's shift to low-carbon transport instead


 Airport expansion – In 2018, four million passengers used Leeds Bradford Airport. With the expansion of the main terminal, the number is predicted to double to eight millioin by 2030. Climate impact – All those additional flights would amount to more than double the 2030 target emissions for the entire city of Leeds. Up and up from 2030? – If passenger numbers continue growing after 2030, even at a slower rate, emissions from Leeds Bradford Airport would overshoot the city’s carbon budget by a factor of nine by 2040. But even if the airport doesn’t expand and the number of passengers using Leeds Bradford remains at today’s levels, all flights between 2018 and 2050 would still consume the city’s entire carbon budget. Only rapidly reducing the number of flights that take off from the world’s airports each year will lower emissions sharply enough to meet carbon budgets like that of Leeds, which are intended to limit global warming to 1.5°C at best. That could be done, say Jefim Vogel, Joel Millward-Hopkins and Yannick Oswald – researchers in sustainability and ecological economics at the University of Leeds – but we have to start right now. They said: If cut in half by 2022 and 75% by 2030, the flights of Leeds residents alone would use up 8% of the city’s carbon budget. This might be just low enough to squeeze all other activities in Leeds into the remaining carbon budget – if these are also radically decarbonised. Airlines have proved wily in avoiding regulation. They are often totally omitted from emission accounting and aren’t subject to fuel taxes. But even when measures have been taken to rein in their emissions, they’ve often failed. In Australia, a carbon price of A$23-$24 (roughly £13) per tonne of CO₂ was levied on flights between July 2012 and July 2014. This measure proved very effective at reducing emissions in the energy sector, but it had no detectable effect on the number of kilometres flown – and therefore CO₂ emitted – from Australian airports. Why?

      Why our carbon emission policies don't work on air travel


 An investigation led by Francis Markham – a research fellow in human geography at Australian National University – and Arianne C. Reis – a senior lecturer in leisure studies at Western Sydney University – found that a fall in ticket prices of 55% between 1992 and 2018 had eclipsed any cost increase from the carbon levy. Even when the cost was passed on to customers in full, the carbon price was too small to reduce demand as intended.  Airlines spend between 30 and 40% of all their expenses on fuel, and the cost of jet fuel has fluctuated wildly since 2005. When the carbon price came into effect in 2014, oil cost as much as USD$100 per barrel, but it fell to half that just a year later.  “Compared to the volatility in the cost of fuel, the carbon price was negligible”, Markham said.  Carbon prices work to decarbonise the energy sector because electricity generators can switch to solar or wind power which aren’t subject to the levy. But currently, cleaner fuels and technology to which the airlines might switch don’t exist on the same scale. Instead, passengers might be dissuaded from flying with a frequent flyer levy which increases taxes in line with the number of flights a person takes. But this would be inherently unfair, argues Keith Baker, a research associate in sustainable urban environments at Glasgow Caledonian University. Most plane passengers are already relatively wealthy. Only 18% of the world’s population have ever flown and in any given year, an elite 3% of the world flies. That’s about 230m people, but flights carried four billion passengers in 2017. So the average flyer takes eight return flights and aeroplanes rack up seven trillion air miles each year. Frequent flyer taxes could price poorer people out of air travel while ensuring the richest can still afford flying to excess. Rationing the number of flights a person can take each year meanwhile would be much fairer, Baker says. This could work by setting an allowance of 500km for everyone to use in the first year of the scheme. If someone didn’t use it, their allowance would double to 1,000km the year after – and would continue doubling while it’s unspent. People could bank their flight kilometre credits for a big trip, or trade them in for cash. If anyone exceeded their allowance, they could be fined or have their right to travel revoked for a period of time. By restricting how much people can fly, the intention is to encourage them to use trains instead. Rail travel is a lower-carbon alternative to flying, but understandably, it’s not as practical for long distances. That didn’t stop Roger Tyers though, a research fellow in environmental sociology at the University of Southampton. After pledging to go “flight-free” in 2019 and 2020, he won a fellowship to study Chinese attitudes to sustainability. That, unfortunately, involved field work in China, but rather than break his commitment, Tyers resolved to get the train from Southampton to Shanghai instead. He said: The cost of the trains was over £2,000, dwarfing the £700 I could pay for a London to Beijing return flight. Time-wise, the train trip took just under two weeks each way. But in terms of carbon emissions my trip was a steal, contributing just 10% of the emissions of the equivalent flights.

 Greta Thunberg’s decision to abstain from flying is perhaps the most high-profile of such commitments. In her native Sweden, her example has helped cultivate a nascent taboo around air travel. Flygskam – or “flight shame” – was coined to describe the feeling that you’re pushing the world a little deeper into the climate crisis every time you book a plane journey. Already, it’s reported to have helped cut the number of passengers at Sweden’s ten busiest airports by 8% from January to April 2019. Individual actions, though laudable, won’t drive a sufficiently large shift from air travel to trains on their own, particular when rail journeys are more expensive. Huge infrastructure changes and massive investment are needed to expand and improve mass public transport. With proper planning, Holly Edwards – a PhD researcher in low-carbon technologies at the University of Leeds – believes that high speed rail could replace many flights. Planes versus trains – Out of the world’s top ten busiest air routes, all but one are domestic flights that could be replaced by rail journeys. Faster by train – For many of these flight routes, such as São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, high-speed rail would be faster and emit between 75 and 97% less CO₂. Global potential – There’s about 43,000km of high-speed rail currently operating worldwide and a further 55,000km planned for the near future.

 It’s now well over a century since humans first took to the skies in aeroplanes – a feat thought impossible by many right up until it happened. Are we due another revolution in human flight, one which powers air travel with zero-carbon technology? The great hope is that electric aeroplanes could oust the current fleet of commercial airliners which rely on fossil fuels. Electric batteries are replacing combustion engines in road vehicles at such a rate that by 2030, electric cars are expected to make up one-third of the car market. Meanwhile, most electric aeroplane prototypes are grounded on the drawing board. Venkat Viswanathan, Shashank Sripad and William Leif Fredericks – all experts in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in the US – believe it’s because batteries can’t store as much energy per weight as liquid fuels. This, they say makes batteries relatively heavy for aviation. As they explain: Although the best batteries store about 40 times less energy per unit of weight than jet fuel, a greater share of their energy is available to drive motion. Ultimately, for a given weight, jet fuel contains about 14 times more usable energy than a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery.

      Why aren't there electric airplanes yet?


 But a breakthrough could come sooner than expected. Alice, the world’s first all-electric commercial airliner was unveiled in Paris in June 2019. It carries nine passengers for up to 650 miles (1,040km) at 10,000ft (3,000 metres) at 276mph (440km/h) on a single charged battery. It’s expected to enter service in 2022. Alice is still too small to carry the hundreds of people that most commercial flights manage today, but flying it is surprisingly cheap, according to John Grant, a senior lecturer in natural and built environments at Sheffield Hallam University. The fossil fuel costs of small aircraft are about US$400 per 100 miles. For Alice, the costs are projected to be as little as US$8 for the same distance, and if the electricity is from renewable energy – perhaps generated by solar panels at the airport – then the plane could be zero-carbon. Instead of waiting for mass electric air travel, Grant believes there are alternatives that could be built right now. Orbital rings sound like something straight out of science fiction, but Grant insists that the technology needed to build them already exists – all that’s missing is the ambition to do it. An orbital ring is a steel cable that would surround Earth 80km above its surface. Connected to the ground by steel cables, which would also host passenger elevators, the ring could support two train tracks – one on its underside and the other on the outside – which would use magnets to propel trains without friction at great speeds above the Earth. Spun at the correct speed, the combined forces of gravity – pulling the ring towards Earth – and velocity would hold the ring in place, allowing passengers to reach the other side of the world in perhaps as little as 45 minutes. Sound far fetched? Well it’s no more crazy than letting the world descend into catastrophic climate change by not changing how we travel, Grant argues. He says we could actually return to a tried and tested method of flight that predates aeroplanes. For as long as humans have taken to the skies we’ve had a low-carbon alternative to burning vast amounts of fossil fuels to keep us up there – balloons. The Hindenburg disaster may have condemned the industry to relative obscurity for almost a century, but it has never really gone away. Safer fuels – the Hindenburg ignited due to its explosive hydrogen fuel, but modern airships use sacs of helium or safer forms of hydrogen which are cheap and relatively abundant. Low energy costs – unlike jet aircraft, airships don’t need lots of energy to stay aloft. At that point, energy costs become comparable with rail travel. Air cruises – airships are relatively slow, but they afford passengers stunning views of the world below. These “flying hotels” were originally designed to accommodate dining rooms and ballrooms. Thunberg’s transatlantic crossing is expected to take two weeks, while the record from Frankfurt to New York by Zeppelin was 44 hours. Today people prize speed and convenience above all else, but the ongoing political awakening to the global climate emergency might finally herald a new age. There are, after all, benefits to not being squashed into a metal tube and hurled across the world at high speed. For all those seeking a slower and less frantic pace of life, the retirement of hydrocarbon-powered aeroplanes could finally make the journey as satisfying as the destination. Climate change and air travel: why we have a responsibility to countries dependent on tourism Researchers, set an example: fly less Climate strikes: Greta Thunberg calls for ‘system change not climate change’ – here’s what that could look like It’s time to wake up to the devastating impact flying has on the environment Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Hey, if you can’t win the scientific debate, then just have the US federal government declare it over and to go after anyone who doesn’t agree.

Obviously the alarmists are tired of losing and seeing support slip away. They just want to be declared the winner, and anyone who can’t accept that should learn to do so using the threat of RICO-style prosecution.
Much of the panel discussion has the participants trying to re-convince themselves there is a scientific consensus and that anyone who disagrees is just stupid anyway. They also talk about what the media can do to control the message, and they praise the LA Times for censoring skeptic views.
After watching parts of the above discussion, you’ll agree that the best thing to do is to just keep on doing what they hate the most: Focus on the data and the charts, and getting people to look out the window (that is if it isn’t buried in snow).

A bag of charcoal briquettes is worth more than a ton of EU carbon right now.
UPDATE: it’s worse than we thought, see below.
Carbon has closed below $4 a ton in a new record low while Deutsche Bank bails
From Reuters:

"The air is clean and fresh, fish have reappeared in urban waterways, birds are frequenting uncut gardens, wild mammals are meandering through cities and greenhouse gas emissions will likely drop by an unprecedented 8% this year. Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.  The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering.  There is a second inadvertent link between climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that is perhaps less examined. The recovery packages designed and implemented by governments to rescue the ailing global economy could rise as high as $20tn over the next 18 months. The scale of this stimulus will shape the contours of the global economy over the next decade, if not longer. This is precisely the decade when climate scientists have warned global emissions will need to be cut by half in order to reach a sustainable trajectory. In the midst of the crisis wreaked by the pandemic is an opportunity: to ensure rescue packages don’t merely recover the high carbon economy of yesterday, but help us build a healthier economy that is low on carbon, high in resilience and centred on human wellbeing. The case for rebuilding our economies in line with environmental targets has broad public support. A recent poll from Ipsos Mori shows that 71% of the global population understands that climate change is as at least as serious a crisis as Covid-19, and 65% think the former should be prioritised in the economic recovery. This is not only in industrialised countries that can more easily afford to green their economies; 81% of the citizens in India and 80% of people from Mexico were also strongly in favour of a green and healthy economic recovery.  One of the first institutions to call for this dual approach was the International Energy Agency, which will publish a report this month detailing policies that governments could adopt to chart the course of recovery while decarbonising their economies. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is not only advising that fiscal stimulus packages should be based on green measures, but going as far as recommending scrapping fossil fuel subsidies and taxing carbon.  A growing number of corporate leaders are also calling for government stimulus packages to have green strings attached. In the UK, the call from a group of major business leaders for the government to embrace a green recovery was answered by the prime minister’s statement that the UK’s commitment to delivering net zero emissions “remains undiminished”. In Europe, 180 business leaders, policymakers and researchers explicitly urged the EU to build the recovery package around the Green Deal. Meanwhile the Spanish government recently released a draft law banning all new coal, oil and gas projects, establishing the direction of the Covid-19 recovery effort. In Canada, more than 320 signatories representing more than 2,100 companies have signed on to support a resilient recovery. Perhaps most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that have confirmed they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic, including BP, Shell, Daimler and Rio Tinto. Elsewhere, eight investment groups, including BNP Paribas Asset Management, DWS and Comgest Asset Management, have urged corporates to maintain their focus on decarbonisation while dealing with the consequences of the recession. The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group of institutional investors representing more than $4.6tn in assets under management (AUM), remains committed to an “irreversible shift to a resilient, net-zero and inclusive economy”. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with $7.4 tn AUM, has pledged to punish the directors of companies that fail to manage environmental risks in 2020. But it’s not all good news. For every corporate actor that has shown a commitment to greening the economy, there are many that haven’t adhered to these values. Some have used the crisis as an opportunity to roll back environmental commitments or push through controversial projects and laws. Plastic companies in the US have lobbied to reverse single-use plastic laws, while three states have criminalised environmental protest. In Europe, car manufacturers are pushing to loosen emissions standards; globally, airlines are lobbying to stop using 2020 as a baseline emissions year, and China has announced it will loosen environmental legislation to boost the post-coronavirus recovery. This is the moment to raise voices everywhere and remind leaders of their chief responsibility: protecting their citizens and putting human wellbeing at the centre of the decision-making process. Some of this is already happening. Organisations representing more than 40 million health professionals from 90 countries worldwide have just published an open letter to G20 leaders and their chief medical advisers in support of a “healthy recovery” where carbon emissions would be massively reduced. Crises are a moment of rupture and change. In the midst of the pandemic, we face a choice between recovering the carbon-intensive global economy that has set us on the path towards environmental breakdown, or accelerating the transition towards a future that prioritises the health of people and planet. Today, that future may be closer within our reach than it was at the beginning of 2020. •  Christiana Figueres was head of the UN climate change convention that achieved the Paris agreement in 2015, and is co-author of The Future We Choose"

New Solar Installations Banned
Greece, aiming to stave off a fresh energy crisis, plans to support its main electricity market operator through a temporary tax on renewable power producers and by extending an emergency loan, a senior official said on Friday. The electricity system came close to collapse in June when market operator LAGHE was overwhelmed by subsidies it pays to green power producers as part of efforts to bolster solar energy. Greece has slashed the guaranteed feed-in prices it pays to some solar operators and is no longer approving permits for their installation. –Harry Papachristou, Reuters, 28 September 2012 (http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/28/us-greece-interview-idUSBRE88R0UQ20120928)

I am Patrick J. Michaels, Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit, non‐​partisan public policy research institute located here in Washington DC, and Cato is my sole source of employment income. Before I begin my testimony, I would like to make clear that my comments are solely my own and do not represent any official position of the Cato Institute.



My testimony concerns the selective science that underlies the existing federal determination of the Social Cost of Carbon and how a more inclusive and considered process would have resulted in a lower value for the social cost of carbon.



Back in 2015, the federal government’s Interagency Working Group (IWG) on the Social Cost of Carbon released a report that was a response to public comments of the IWG’s determination of the social cost of carbon that were solicited by the Office of Management and Budget in November 2013. Of the 140 unique sets of substantive comments received (including a set of my own), the IWG adopted none. And apart from some minor updates to its discussion on uncertainty, the IWG, in its most recent August 2016 report, retained the same, now obsolete, methodologies that were used in its initial 2010 SCC determination.



Here, I address why this decision was based on a set of flimsy, internally inconsistent excuses and amounts to a continuation of the IWG’s exclusion of the most relevant science—an exclusion which assures that low, or even negative values of the social cost of carbon (which would imply a net benefit of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels), do not find their way into cost/benefit analyses of proposed federal actions. If, in fact, the social cost of carbon were near zero, it would eliminate the justification for any federal action (greenhouse gas emissions regulations, ethanol mandates, miles per gallon standards, solar/wind subsidies, DoE efficiency regulations, etc.) geared towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions.



 _Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity_



In May 2013, the Interagency Working Group produced an updated SCC value by incorporating revisions to the underlying three Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) used by the IWG in its initial 2010 SCC determination. But, at that time, the IWG did _not_ update the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) employed in the IAMs. This was not done, despite, now, there having been, since January 1, 2011, at least 16 new studies and 32 experiments (involving more than 50 researchers) examining the ECS, each lowering the best estimate and tightening the error distribution about that estimate. Instead, the IWG wrote in its 2013 report: “It does not revisit other interagency modeling decisions (e.g., with regard to the discount rate, reference case socioeconomic and emission scenarios, or equilibrium climate sensitivity).”



This decision was reaffirmed by the IWG in July 2015 and again in its most recent August 2016 report. But, through its reaffirmation, the IWG has again refused to give credence to and recognize the importance of what is now becoming mainstream science—that the most likely value of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower than that used by the IWG and that the estimate is much better constrained. This situation has profound implications for the determination of the SCC and yet continues to be summarily dismissed by the IWG.



The earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity is defined by the IWG in its 2010 report (hereafter, IWG2010) as “the long-term increase in the annual global-average surface temperature from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration relative to pre-industrial levels (or stabilization at a concentration of approximately 550 parts per million (ppm))” and is recognized as “a key input parameter” for the integrated assessment models used to determine the social cost of carbon.



The IWG2010 report has an entire section (Section III.D) dedicated to describing how an estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the scientific uncertainties surrounding its actual value are developed and incorporated in the IWG’s analysis. The IWG2010, in fact, developed its own probability density function (pdf) for the ECS and used it in each of the three IAMs, superseding the ECS pdfs used by the original IAMs developers. The IWG’s intent was to develop an ECS pdf which most closely matched the description of the ECS as given in the _Fourth Assessment Report_ of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change which was published in 2007.



The functional form adopted by the IWG2010 was a calibrated version of the Roe and Baker (2007) distribution. It was described in the IWG2010 report in the following Table and Figure (from the IWG2010 report):







The calibrated Roe and Baker functional form used by the IWG2010 is _no longer scientifically defensible;_ nor was it at the time of the publication of the IWG 2013 SCC update, nor at the time of the August 2016 update.



The figure below vividly illustrates this fact, as it compares the best estimate and 90% confidence range of the earth's ECS as used by the IWG (calibrated Roe and Baker) against findings in the scientific literature published since January 1, 2011.



Whereas the IWG ECS distribution has a median value of 3.0°C and 5th and 95th percentile values of 1.72°C and 7.14°C, respectively, the corresponding values averaged from the recent scientific literature are ~2.0°C (median), ~1.1°C (5th percentile), and ~3.5°C (95th percentile).



These differences will have large and significant impacts on the SCC determination.





_CAPTION: The median (indicated by the small vertical line) and 90% confidence range (indicated by the horizontal line with arrowheads) of the climate sensitivity estimate used by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon Climate (Roe and Baker, 2007) is indicated by the top black arrowed line. The average of the similar values from 22 different determinations reported in the recent scientific literature is given by the grey arrowed line (second line from the top). The sensitivity estimates from the 32 individual determinations of the ECS as reported in new research published after January 1, 2011 are indicated by the colored arrowed lines. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95% confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. Likewise, Bates (2016) presents eight estimates and the green box encompasses them. Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing._



In addition to recent studies aimed at directly determining the equilibrium climate sensitivity (included in the chart above), there have been several other major studies which have produced results which qualitatively suggest a climate sensitivity lower than mainstream (e.g. Roe and Baker calibration) estimates. Such studies include new insights on cloud condensation nuclei and cosmic rays (Kirkby et al., 2016), radiative forcing of clouds (Bellouin, 2016; Stevens, 2015), cloud processes (Mauritsen and Stevens, 2015) and the underestimation of terrestrial CO2 uptake (Sun et al., 2014).



The IWG2010 report noted that, concerning the low end of the ECS distribution, its determination reflected a greater degree of certainty that a low ECS value could be excluded than did the IPCC. From the IWG2010 (p. 14):



“Finally, we note the IPCC judgment that the equilibrium climate sensitivity “is very likely larger than 1.5°C.” Although the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution, for which the probability of equilibrium climate sensitivity being greater than 1.5°C is almost 99 percent, is not inconsistent with the IPCC definition of “very likely” as “greater than 90 percent probability,” it reflects a greater degree of certainty about very low values of ECS than was expressed by the IPCC.”



In other words, the IWG used its _judgment_ that the lower bound of the ECS distribution was higher than the IPCC 2007 assessment indicated. However, the collection of the recent literature on the ECS shows the IWG’s judgment to be in error. As can be seen in the chart above, the large majority of the findings on ECS in the recent literature indicate that the lower bound (i.e., 5th percentile) of the ECS distribution is lower than the IPCC 2007 assessment. And, the average value of the 5th percentile in the recent literature (~1.1°C) is 0.62°C _less_ than that used by the IWG—a sizeable and important difference which will influence the SCC determination.



In fact, the abundance of literature supporting a lower climate sensitivity was at least partially reflected in the new IPCC assessment report issued in 2013. In that report, the IPCC reported:



Equilibrium climate sensitivity is _likely_ in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C ( _high confidence_ ), _extremely unlikely_ less than 1°C ( _high confidence_ ), and _very unlikely_ greater than 6°C ( _medium confidence_ ). The lower temperature limit of the assessed _likely_ range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4…



Clearly, the IWG’s assessment of the low end of the probability density function that best describes the current level of scientific understanding of the climate sensitivity is incorrect and indefensible.



But even more influential in the SCC determination is the upper bound (i.e., 95th percentile) of the ECS probability distribution.



The IWG2010 notes (p.14) that the calibrated Roe and Baker distribution better reflects the IPCC judgment that “values substantially higher than 4.5°C still cannot be excluded.” The IWG2010 further notes that



“Although the IPCC made no quantitative judgment, the 95th percentile of the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution (7.1 °C) is much closer to the mean and the median (7.2 °C) of the 95th percentiles of 21 previous studies summarized by Newbold and Daigneault (2009). It is also closer to the mean (7.5 °C) and median (7.9 °C) of the nine truncated distributions examined by the IPCC (Hegerl, et al., 2006) than are the 95th percentiles of the three other calibrated distributions (5.2–6.0 °C).”



In other words, the IWG2010 turned towards surveys of the scientific literature to determine its assessment of an appropriate value for the 95th percentile of the ECS distribution. Now, some seven years later, the scientific literature tells different story.



Instead of a 95th percentile value of 7.14°C, as used by the IWG2010, a survey of the recent scientific literature suggests a value of ~3.5°C—more than 50% lower.



And this is very significant and important difference because the high end of the ECS distribution has a large impact on the SCC determination—a fact frequently commented on by the IWG2010.



For example, from IWG2010 (p.26):



“As previously discussed, low probability, high impact events are incorporated into the SCC values through explicit consideration of their effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density function for equilibrium climate sensitivity. Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results in more high temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages. Although FUND does not include catastrophic damages (in contrast to the other two models), its probabilistic treatment of the equilibrium climate sensitivity parameter will directly affect the non‐​catastrophic damages that are a function of the rate of temperature change.”



And further (p.30):



 _Uncertainty in extrapolation of damages to high temperatures_ : The damage functions in these IAMs are typically calibrated by estimating damages at moderate temperature increases (e.g., DICE [Dynamic Integrated Climate and Economy] was calibrated at 2.5 °C) and extrapolated to far higher temperatures by assuming that damages increase as some power of the temperature change. Hence, estimated damages are far more uncertain under more extreme climate change scenarios.



And the entirety of Section V “A Further Discussion of Catastrophic Impacts and Damage Functions” of the IWG 2010 report describes “tipping points” and “damage functions” that are probabilities assigned to different values of global temperature change. Table 6 from the IWG2010 indicated the probabilities of various tipping points.





The likelihood of occurrence of these low probability, high impact, events (“tipping points”) is _greatly_ diminished under the new ECS findings. The average 95th percentile value of the new literature survey is only ~3.5°C indicating a very low probability of a warming reaching 3-5°C by 2100 as indicated in the 3rd column of the above Table and thus a significantly lower probability that such tipping points will be reached. This new information will have a large impact on the final SCC determination using the IWG’s methodology.



The size of this impact has been directly investigated.



In their _Comment on the Landmark Legal Foundation Petition for Reconsideration of Final Rule Standards for Standby Mode and Off Mode Microwave Ovens_ , Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2013) ran the DICE model using the distribution of the ECS as described by Otto et al. (2013)—a paper published in the recent scientific literature which includes 17 authors, 15 of which were lead authors of chapters in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s _Fifth Assessment Report_. The most likely value of the ECS reported by Otto et al. (2013) was described as  
“2.0°C, with a 5–95% confidence interval of 1.2–3.9°C.” Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC by 42 percent, 41 percent, and 35 percent (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). This is a significant decline.



In subsequent research, Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) examined the performance of the FUND (Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation, and Distribution) model, and found that it too, produced a greatly diminished value for the SCC when run with the Otto et al. distribution of the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC produced by the FUND model to $11, $6, $0 compared with the original $30, $17, $2 (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). Again, this is a significant decline.



The Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) results using FUND were in line with alternative estimates of the impact of a lower climate sensitivity on the FUND model SCC determination.



Waldhoff et al. (2011) investigated the sensitivity of the FUND model to changes in the ECS. Waldhoff et al. (2011) found that changing the ECS distribution such that the mean of the distribution was lowered from 3.0°C to 2.0°C had the effect of lowering the SCC by 60 percent (from a 2010 SCC estimate of $8/ton of CO2 to $3/ton in $1995). While Waldhoff et al. (2011) examined FUNDv3.5, the response of the current version (v3.8) of the FUND model should be similar.



Additionally, the developer of the PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model, affirmed that the SCC from the PAGE model, too drops by 35% when the Otto et al. (2013) climate sensitivity distribution is employed (Hope, 2013).



More recently, the FUND and DICE model were run with equilibrium climate sensitivities that were determined by Lewis and Curry (2014) in an analysis which updated and expanded upon the results of Otto et al. (2013). In Dayaratna et al. (2017), the probability density function (pdf) for the equilibrium climate sensitivity determined from an energy budget model (Lewis and Curry, 2014) was used instead of the Roe and Baker calibrated pdf used by the IWG. In doing so, Dayaranta et al. (2017) report:



“In the DICE model the average SCC falls by 30–50% depending on the discount rate, while in the FUND model the average SCC falls by over 80%. The span of estimates across discount rates also shrinks considerably, implying less sensitivity to this parameter choice…Furthermore the probability of a negative SCC (implying CO2 emissions are a positive externality) jumps dramatically using an empirical ECS distribution.”



These studies make clear that the strong dependence of the social cost of carbon on the distribution of the estimates of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (including the median, and the upper and lower certainty bounds) requires that the periodic updates to the IWG SCC determination must include a critical examination of the scientific literature on the topic of the equilibrium climate sensitivity, not merely kowtowing to the IPCC assessment. There is no indication that the IWG undertook such an independent examination. But what is clear, is that the IWG did _not_ alter its probability distribution of the ECS between its 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2016 SCC determinations, despite a large and growing body of scientific literature that substantially alters and better defines the scientific understanding of the earth’s ECS. It is unacceptable that a supposed “updated” social cost of carbon does not include updates to the science underlying a critical and key aspect of the SCC.



I note that there has been one prominent scientific study in the recent literature which has argued, on the basis of recent observations of lower tropospheric mixing in the tropics, for a rather high climate sensitivity (Sherwood et al., 2014). This research, however, suffers from too narrow a focus. While noting that climate models which best match the apparent observed behavior of the vertical mixing characteristics of the tropical troposphere tend to be the models with high climate sensitivity estimates, the authors fail to make note that these same models are the ones whose projections make the _worst_ match to observations of the evolution of global temperature during the past several decades.



While Sherwood et al. (2014) prefer models that better match their observations in one variable, the same models actually do _worse_ in the big picture than do models which lack the apparent accuracy in the processes that Sherwood et al. (2014) describe. The result can only mean that there must still be even bigger problems with _other_ model processes which must more than counteract the effects of the processes described by Sherwood et al.



This illustrates the inherent problems with “tuning” climate models to try to best reproduce a known set of observations—efforts to force climate models to better emulate one set of physical behaviors can degrade their performance on other ones. Voosen (2016) recently reported on the climate modelling community efforts to be more open and transparent with their multitude of (secret) “tuning” procedures. Voosen’s reporting was eye‐​opening not only in revealing the degree to which climate models are tuned and the significant role that tuning plays in model projections, but as to the reasons why modelers have not wanted to be up front about their methods. I reproduce an extended and relevant excerpt here:



At their core, climate models are about energy balance. They divide Earth up into boxes, and then, applying fundamental laws of physics, follow the sun’s energy as it drives phenomena like winds and ocean currents. Their resolution has grown over the years, allowing current models to render Earth in boxes down to 25 kilometers a side. They take weeks of supercomputer time for a full run, simulating how the climate evolves over centuries.



When the models can’t physically resolve certain processes, the parameters take over—though they are still informed by observations. For example, modelers tune for cloud formation based on temperature, atmospheric stability, humidity, and the presence of mountains. Parameters are also used to describe the spread of heat into the deep ocean, the reflectivity of Arctic sea ice, and the way that aerosols, small particles in the atmosphere, reflect or trap sunlight.



It’s impossible to get parameters right on the first try. And so scientists adjust these equations to make sure certain constraints are met, like the total energy entering and leaving the planet, the path of the jet stream, or the formation of low marine clouds off the California coast. Modelers try to restrict their tuning to as few knobs as possible, but it’s never as few as they’d like. It’s an art and a science. “It’s like reshaping an instrument to compensate for bad sound,” Stevens says.



Indeed, whether climate scientists like to admit it or not, nearly every model has been calibrated precisely to the 20th century climate records—otherwise it would have ended up in the trash. “It’s fair to say all models have tuned it,” says Isaac Held, a scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, another prominent modeling center, in Princeton, New Jersey.



For years, climate scientists had been mum in public about their “secret sauce”: What happened in the models stayed in the models. The taboo reflected fears that climate contrarians would use the practice of tuning to seed doubt about models— and, by extension, the reality of human‐​driven warming. “The community became defensive,” [Bjorn] Stevens [of the Max Planck Institut] says. “It was afraid of talking about things that they thought could be unfairly used against them.” Proprietary concerns also get in the way. For example, the United Kingdom’s Met Office sells weather forecasts driven by its climate model. Disclosing too much about its code could encourage copycats and jeopardize its business.



But modelers have come to realize that disclosure could reveal that some tunings are more deft or realistic than others. It’s also vital for scientists who use the models in specific ways. They want to know whether the model output they value—say, its predictions of Arctic sea ice decline— arises organically or is a consequence of tuning. [Gavin] Schmidt [Head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which, ironically concentrates on earth’s climate] points out that these models guide regulations like the U.S. Clean Power Plan, and inform U.N. temperature projections and calculations of the social cost of carbon. “This isn’t a technical detail that doesn’t have consequence,” he says. “It has consequence.”



Recently, while preparing for the new model comparisons, MPIM modelers got another chance to demonstrate their commitment to transparency. They knew that the latest version of their model had bugs that meant too much energy was leaking into space. After a year spent plugging holes and fixing it, the modelers ran a test and discovered something disturbing: The model was now overheating. Its climate sensitivity—the amount the world will warm under an immediate doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations from preindustrial levels—had shot up from 3.5°C in the old version to 7°C, an implausibly high jump.



MPIM hadn’t tuned for sensitivity before— it was a point of pride—but they had to get that number down. Thorsten Mauritsen, who helps lead their tuning work, says he tried tinkering with the parameter that controlled how fast fresh air mixes into clouds. Increasing it began to ratchet the sensitivity back down. “The model we produced with 7° was a damn good model,” Mauritsen says. But it was not the team’s best representation of the climate as they knew it.



That climate modelers were worried about being open about their methodologies for fear that “contrarians” would “unfairly” use such procedures against them indicates that the modeling community is more interested in climate policy (that may find support in their model projections) than climate science (which would welcome criticism aimed at producing a better understanding of the physical processes driving the earth’s climate). Given the degree of “secret sauce” mixed into the models at this point in time, a healthy dose of skepticsm regarding the verisimilitude of climate model output is warranted.



But even with the all the model tuning that takes place, the overall model collective is _still_ warming the world much faster than it actually is. As shown by Christy (2016, and updates), there is a gross departure of “reality” from model predictions. Christy (2016) noted that “for the global bulk troposphere [roughly the bottom 40,000 feet of the atmosphere], the models overwarm the atmosphere by a factor of about 2.5.” The warming influence of a large and naturally occurring El Niño event has, temporarily, added a blip to the end of the observational record. But despite this short-term natural warming event, collectively the models still produce about twice as much warming as can be found in the real world over the past 38 years. And as the warming of the recent strong El Niño event fades (global surface temperatures have returned most of the way to pre-El Niño levels; see Figures below), the model/real world discrepancy will start to grow once again.





_CAPTION: Five-year running mean temperatures predicted by the UN's climate models, and observed lower atmospheric temperatures from weather balloons and satellites (figure courtesy of John Christy).The last point is a four-year running mean, and the first two are three and four, respectively._







_CAPTION: Monthly temperature anomalies, January 1997 through December 2016 (surface observations; top) and January 1997 through January 2017 (satellite observations of the mid-troposphere; bottom) show the impact of the strong 2016 El Niño event and the fading warmth since. The surface readings are from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, and the satellite readings are from University of Alabama-Huntsville._



Another way to assess model performance is to compare model projection with observed trends in the vertical dimension of the atmosphere. Here again, as shown in the Figure below, models grossly produce much more warming than has been observed. This chart, courtesy of the University of Alabama at Huntsville’s Dr. John Christy, focuses on the tropics (between 20S and 20N)—the area where climate models project the greatest amount of warming through the atmosphere. The communal failure of the models is abject.



The characteristics of the vertical profile of temperature are important environmental variables in that it is the vertical temperature distribution that determines atmospheric stability. When the lapse rate—the difference between the lowest layers and higher levels—is large, the atmosphere is unstable. Instability is the principal source for global precipitation. Although models can be (and are) tuned to mimic changes in surface temperatures, the same can’t be done as easily for the vertical profile of temperature changes. As the figure indicates, the air in the middle troposphere is warming far more slowly than has been predicted, even more slowly than the torpid surface warming. Consequently, the difference between the surface and the middle troposphere has become slightly greater, a condition which should produce a very slight increase in average precipitation. On the other hand, the models forecast that the difference between the surface and the middle troposphere should become less, a condition which would add pressure to decrease global precipitation.



The models are therefore making systematic errors in their precipitation projections. That has a dramatic effect on the resultant climate change projections. When the surface is wet, which is what occurs after rain, the sun’s energy is directed toward the evaporation of that moisture rather than to directly heating the surface. In other words, much of what is called “sensible weather” (the kind of weather a person can sense) is determined by the vertical distribution of temperature. If the popular climate models get that wrong (which is what is happening), then all the subsidiary weather may also be incorrectly specified.

The red line is the model mean and the green line is the observed mean. The trend in the bulk lower atmosphere (middle troposphere) from several different satellite data compilations (colored plus signs, top box) and several reanalysis datasets (colored crosses, top box) is compared with the model projection for the same layer in the box at the top of the figure.

These results argue strongly against the reliability of the Sherwood et al. (2014) conclusion and instead provide robust observational evidence that the climate sensitivity has been overestimated by both climate models, and the IWG alike.  
 _Agricultural Impacts of Carbon Fertilization_



Carbon dioxide is known to have a large positive impact on vegetation (e.g., Zhu et al., 2016), with literally thousands of studies in the scientific literature demonstrating that plants (including crops) grow stronger, healthier, and more productive under conditions of increased carbon dioxide concentration. A study (Idso, 2013) reviewed a large collection of such literature as it applies to the world's 45 most important food crops (making up 95% of the world's annual agricultural production).



Idso (2013) summarized his findings on the increase in biomass of each crop that results from a 300ppm increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide under which the plants were grown. This table is reproduced below, and shows that the typical growth increase exceeds 30% in most crops, including 8 of the world's top 10 food crops (the increase was 24% and 14% in the other two).



Idso (2013) found that the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide that took place during the period 1961-2011 was responsible for increasing global agricultural output by 3.2 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars). Projecting the increases forward based on projections of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, Idso (2013) expects carbon dioxide fertilization to increase the value of agricultural output by 9.8 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars) during the 2012-2050 period.



 **Average percentage increase in biomass of each of the world's 45 most important food crops under an increase of 300ppm of carbon dioxide.**





This is a large positive externality, and one that is insufficiently modeled in the IAMs relied upon by the IWG in determining the SCC.



In fact, only one of the three IAMs used by the IWG has any substantial impact from carbon dioxide fertilization, and the one that does, underestimates the effect by approximately 2-3 times.



The FUND model has a component which calculates the impact on agricultural as a result of carbon dioxide emissions, which includes not only the impact on temperature and other climate changes, but also the direct impact of carbon dioxide fertilization. The other two IAMs, DICE and PAGE by and large do not (or only do so extremely minimally; DICE includes the effect to a larger degree than PAGE). Consequently, lacking this large and positive externality, the SCC calculated by the DICE and PAGE models is significantly larger than the SCC determined by the FUND model (for example, see Table A5, in the IWG 2013 report).



But even the positive externality that results from carbon dioxide fertilization as included in the FUND model is too small when compared with the Idso (2013) estimates. FUND (v3.7) uses the following formula to determine the degree of crop production increase resulting from atmospheric carbon dioxide increases (taken from Anthoff and Tol, 2013a):





Column 8 in the table below shows the CO2 fertilization parameter (γ _r_ ) used in FUND for various regions of the world (Anthoff and Tol, 2013b). The average CO2 fertilization effect across the 16 regions of the world is 11.2%. While this number is neither areally weighted, nor weighted by the specific crops grown, it is clear that 11.2% is much lower than the average fertilization effect compiled by Idso (2013) for the world's top 10 food crops (35%). Further, Idso's fertilization impact is in response to a 300ppm CO2 increase, while the fertilization parameter in the FUND model is multiplied by ln(CO2t/275) which works out to 0.74 for a 300ppm CO2 increase. This multiplier further reduces the 16 region average to 8.4% for the CO2 fertilization effect—some 4 times smaller than the magnitude of the fertilization impact identified by Idso (2013).



Although approximately four times too small, the impact of the fertilization effect on the SCC calculation in the FUND model is large.



According to Waldhoff et al. (2011), if the CO2 fertilization effect is turned off in the FUND model (v3.5) the SCC increases by 75% from $8/tonCO2 to $14/tonCO2 (in 1995 dollars). In another study, Ackerman and Munitz (2012) find the effective increase in the FUND model to be even larger, with CO2 fertilization producing a positive externality of nearly $15/tonCO2 (in 2007 dollars).





Clearly, had the Idso (2013) estimate of the CO2 fertilization impact been used instead of the one used in FUND the resulting positive externality would have been much larger, and the resulting net SCC been much lower.



This is just for one of the three IAMs used by the IWG. Had the more comprehensive CO2 fertilization impacts identified by Idso (2013) been incorporated in all the IAMs, the three-model average SCC used by the IWG would be been greatly lowered, and likely even become negative in some IAM/discount rate combinations.



In its 2015 “Response to Comments Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866,” the IWG admits to the disparate ways that CO2 fertilization is included in the three IAMs. Nevertheless, the IWG quickly dismisses this as a problem in that they claim the IAMs were selected “to reflect a reasonable range of modeling choices and approaches that collectively reflect the current literature on the estimation of damages from CO2 emissions.”



This logic is blatantly flawed. Two of the IAMs do not reflect the “current literature” on a key aspect relating to the direct impact of CO2 emissions on agricultural output, and the third only partially so.



 _CO2 fertilization is a known physical effect from increased carbon dioxide concentrations_. By including the results of IAMs that do not include known processes that have a significant impact on the end product must disqualify them from contributing to the final result. The inclusion of results that are known _a priori_ to be wrong can only contribute to producing a less accurate answer. Results should only be included when they attempt to represent known processes, not when they leave those processes out entirely.



The justification from the IWG (2015) that “[h]owever, with high confidence the IPCC (2013) stated in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that ‘[b]ased on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive ones’” is completely irrelevant as CO2 fertilization is an impact that is apart from “climate change.” And further, the IAMs do (explicitly in the case of FUND and DICE or implicitly in the case of PAGE) include damage functions related to the climate change impacts on agriculture. So not only is the IWG justification irrelevant, it is inaccurate as well. The impact of CO2 fertilization on agricultural output and its impact on lowering the SCC _must_ be considered.



 _Additional Climate Model Parameter Misspecifications_



In addition to the outdated climate sensitivity distribution and the insufficient handling of the carbon dioxide fertilization effect, there has also been identified a misspecification of some of the critical parameters within the underlying box models that drive the pace and shape of the future climate evolution in the IAMs.



A recent analysis (Lewis, 2016) finds that the physically-based two-box climate model inherent in the DICE IAM is fit with physically unrealistic ocean characteristics. According to Lewis (2016):



In the DICE 2‐​box model, the ocean surface layer that is taken to be continuously in equilibrium with the atmosphere is 550 m deep, compared to estimates in the range 50–150 m based on observations and on fitting 2‐​box models to AOGCM responses. The DICE 2‐​box model’s deep ocean layer is less than 200 m deep, a fraction of the value in any CMIP5 AOGCM, and is much more weakly coupled to the surface layer. Unsurprisingly, such parameter choices produce a temperature response time profile that differs substantially from those in AOGCMs and in 2‐​box models with typical parameter values. As a result, DICE significantly overestimates temperatures from the mid‐​21st century on, and hence overestimates the SCC and optimum carbon tax, compared with 2‐​box models having the same ECS and TCR but parameter values that produce an AOGCM‐​like temperature evolution.



When the DICE 2‐​box model is parametrized with values for the ocean layers that are in line with established estimates, the value of the social cost of carbon that results is reduced by one‐​quarter to one‐​third during the 21th century. Lewis further point out that notes that “The climate response profile in FUND and in PAGE, the other two IAMs used by the US government to assess the SCC, appear to be similarly inappropriate, suggesting that they also overestimate the SCC.”



Ultimately, Lewis (2016) concludes:



It seems rather surprising that all three of the main IAMs have climate response functions with inappropriate, physically unrealistic, time profiles. In any event, it is worrying that governments and their scientific and economic advisers have used these IAMs and, despite considering what [equilibrium climate sensitivity] and/​or [transient climate sensitivity] values or probability distributions thereof to use, have apparently not checked whether the time profiles of the resulting climate responses were reasonable.



 _Sea Level Rise_



The sea level rise module in the DICE model used by the IWG2013/2015/2016 produces future sea level rise values that far exceed mainstream projections and are unsupported by the best available science. The sea level rise projections from more than half of the scenarios (IMAGE, MERGE, MiniCAM) exceed even the highest end of the projected sea level rise by the year 2300 as reported in the _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see figure).





_CAPTION: Projections of sea level rise from the DICE model (the arithmetic average of the 10,000 Monte Carlo runs from each scenario ) for the five scenarios examined by the IWG2013 compared with the range of sea level rise projections for the year 2300 given in the IPCC AR5 (see AR5 Table 13.8)._ _(DICE data provided by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation)._



How the sea level rise module in DICE was constructed is inaccurately characterized by the IWG (and misleads the reader). The IWG report describes the development of the DICE sea level rise scenario as:



“The parameters of the four components of the SLR module are calibrated to match consensus results from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).6”



However, in IWG footnote “6” the methodology is described this way (Nordhaus, 2010):



“The methodology of the modeling is to use the estimates in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).”



“Using estimates” and “calibrating” are two completely different things. Calibration implies that the sea level rise estimates produced by the DICE sea level module behave similarly to the IPCC sea level rise projections and instills a sense of confidence in the casual reader that the DICE projections are in accordance with IPCC projections. However this is not the case. Consequently, the reader is misled.



In fact, the DICE estimates are much higher than the IPCC estimates. This is even recognized by the DICE developers. From the same reference as above:



“The RICE [DICE] model projection is in the middle of the pack of alternative specifications of the different Rahmstorf specifications. Table 1 shows the RICE, base Rahmstorf, and average Rahmstorf. _Note that in all cases, these are significantly above the IPCC projections in AR4._ ” [emphasis added]



That the DICE sea level rise projections are far above mainstream estimated can be further evidenced by comparing them with the results produced by the IWG-accepted MAGICC modelling tool (in part developed by the EPA and available from http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/wigley/magicc/).



Using the MESSAGE scenario as an example, the sea level rise estimate produced by MAGICC for the year 2300 is 1.28 meters—a value that is less than 40% of the average value of 3.32 meters produced by the DICE model when running the same scenario (see figure below).





_CAPTION: Projected sea level rise resulting from the MESSAGE scenario produced by DICE (red) and MAGICC (blue)._



The justification given for the high sea level rise projections in the DICE model (Nordhaus, 2010) is that they well-match the results of a “semi-empirical” methodology employed by Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009).



However, subsequent science has proven the “semi-empirical” approach to projecting future sea level rise unreliable. For example, Gregory et al. (2012) examined the assumption used in the “semi-empirical” methods and found them to be unsubstantiated. Gregory et al (2012) specifically refer to the results of Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009):



The implication of our closure of the [global mean sea level rise, GMSLR] budget is that a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR is weak or absent in the past. The lack of a strong relationship is consistent with the evidence from the tide‐​gauge datasets, whose authors find acceleration of GMSLR during the 20th century to be either insignificant or small. It also calls into question the basis of the semi‐​empirical methods for projecting GMSLR, which depend on calibrating a relationship between global climate change or radiative forcing and the rate of GMSLR from observational data (Rahmstorf, 2007; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Jevrejeva et al., 2010).



In light of these findings, the justification for the very high sea level rise projections (generally exceeding those of the IPCC AR5 and far greater than the IWG‐​accepted MAGICC results) produced by the DICE model is called into question and can no longer be substantiated.



Given the strong relationship between sea level rise and future damage built into the DICE model, there can be no doubt that the SCC estimates from the DICE model are higher than the best science would allow and consequently, should not be accepted by the IWG as a reliable estimate of the social cost of carbon.



And here again, the IWG (2015) admits that these sea level rise estimates are an outlier on the high end, yet retains them in their analysis by claiming than they were interested in representing a “range” of possible outcomes. But, even the IWG (2015) admits that the IPCC AR5 assigned “a low confidence in projections based on such [semi‐​empirical] methods.” It is internally inconsistent to claim the IPCC as an authority for limiting the range of possibilities explored by the IAMs (which it did in the case of equilibrium climate sensitivity) and then go outside the IPCC to justify including a wildly high estimate of sea level rise. Such inconsistencies characterize the IWG response to comments and weaken confidence in them.



I did not investigate the sea level rise projections from the FUND or the PAGE model, but suggest that such an analysis must be carried out prior to extending any confidence in the values of the SCC resulting from those models—confidence that, as demonstrated, cannot be assigned to the DICE SCC determinations.



 _Conclusion_



The social cost of carbon as determined by the Interagency Working Group in their August 2016 Technical Support Document (updated from IGW reports from February 2010, November 2013, and July 2015) is unsupported by the robust scientific literature, fraught with uncertainty, illogical, and thus completely unsuitable and inappropriate for federal rulemaking. Had the IWG included a better‐​reasoned and more inclusive review of the current scientific literature, the social cost of carbon estimates would have been considerably reduced with a value likely approaching zero. Such a low social cost of carbon would obviate the arguments behind the push for federal greenhouse gas regulations.

"If you need a distraction from fighting about “La La Land,” cheering at “Hidden Figures” or weeping about “Moonlight”  —   all of which might have been distracting you from other things  —   there are 15   movies quietly soliciting your attention, along with that of the academy voters. The   nominees are often unsung   highlights, too easily overlooked except for   balloting purposes. This is a shame, since in about the time it would take to watch “Arrival” three times or “Toni Erdmann” twice, you could take a remarkably   tour of world cinema. Even in a generally strong year like this one, the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack. The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions, and dark, adult themes as well as   charm and whimsy. The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful   material with compassion, courage and imagination (though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality). All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms (though several can be found on various sites now). Here is a brief critical guide. Before it was a mighty fief within Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Pixar was a plucky and resourceful   and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings. This year’s, “Piper” (directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer) is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent. (The story is a bit like “Moana” in reverse.) The   relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme, figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou  ’s “Borrowed Time,” about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son, and Patrick Osborne’s “Pearl” (now on YouTube) about a rock ’n’ roll dad and his rock ’n’ roll daughter. All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue, and offer a respite from the usual    cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes. “Blind Vaysha,” a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric, Eastern European overtones, is a bit talkier, with a narrator’s voice accompanying eerie,   images. “Pear Cider and Cigarettes,” the longest, richest and saddest of the films, also uses   narration to tell a painful personal story about the life and death of Techno Stypes, a   childhood friend of Robert Valley, who directed the film. (It’s available on Vimeo for a fee.) If I were voting, I’d go for Techno, but if I had to make a prediction, I’d never bet against Pixar. The predicament of migrants and refugees in Europe figures in two of the nominees, “Ennemis Intérieurs” (“Internal Enemies”) from France, and “Silent Nights,” from Denmark. The first, directed by Sélim Azzazi, consists mainly of a tense interview between two men, both of Arab descent, who have lived in France all their lives. The older man is a former convict applying for citizenship, the younger one a government official. Their conversation, which takes place in 1998, touches on terrorism, religion and the integrity of “La Republique,” issues that could hardly be more relevant as France approaches a possibly fateful presidential election. “Silent Nights” confronts similar questions as it traces the relationship between a young Danish woman and a Ghanaian immigrant, whose mutual empathy (and romantic attraction) is tested by the drastically different circumstances they face. The humanism of this film, directed by Aske Bang and Kim Magnusson, is shadowed by an inescapable pessimism, an intimation that kindness, while essential, may not be enough when survival is at stake. There is nothing overtly topical or political in the other three nominees, which are also from Europe. “La Femme et le TGV” (“The Woman and the TGV,” available for a fee from iTunes) from Switzerland, is almost rescued from mawkish triviality by the affecting performance of the great Jane Birkin as the title character, and nearly ruined by a cloying, aggressive score. The Spanish film “Timecode,” about the clandestine activities of parking garage security guards, might seem equally slight, but it reveals itself to be a sly fable of creative resistance in the face of deadening routine. And Kristof Deak and Anna Udvardy’s “Sing,” my favorite in this batch, might be mistaken for a sweet story of the friendship between two Hungarian schoolgirls until the last scene, when it becomes a parable of defiance against unjust and corrupt authority. (Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!) Like the nominees in the   best documentary category, the five films in this group demonstrate a commitment to both relevance and experimentation. Only one of them, “Joe’s Violin” (now on YouTube) follows the conventional,   template, alternating interviews, archival footage and   events as it tells the touching story of a Holocaust survivor who donated his violin to a public school in the Bronx. The film, directed by Kahane Cooperman, proceeds though familiar beats, but its emotions are genuine and its characters are well worth knowing. Their lives are not easy, but “Joe’s Violin” feels downright soothing alongside its competition, which includes some of the most wrenching, unsparing images I have seen on film in the past year. The aptly named “Extremis,” by Dan Krauss (on Netflix now) plunges the viewer into the midst of gravely ill patients and the doctors who must help their families decide whether to continue life support. The reality of death is something we often avoid, and even for half an hour, this film is difficult to watch. But it is also gripping, suspenseful and moving  —   a hard look at a hard subject. Those words also describe the three short documentaries about the Syrian war and the European refugee crisis. Daphne Matziaraki’s “4. 1 Miles” (produced by The New York Times’s Opinion section and available on nytimes. com) plies the waters off the Greek island of Lesbos as coast guard officers try to rescue migrants crowded onto inflatable rafts. “The White Helmets,” by Orlando von Einsiedel and Joanna Natasegara (now on Netflix) and “Watani: My Homeland,” by Marcel Mettelsiefen and Stephen Ellis, both take place in Aleppo, and provide a glimpse of the horror that city has endured in recent years. Too rigorous to offer false hope, they nonetheless affirm the necessity of witness and an antidote to despair. I can’t choose between them, but I hope one of them wins."
"How important are bees and what will happen when they go extinct? Is there research into what is killing them? I’ve been told it’s weed killers… – Tink, aged 18, Cornwall, UK. Bees – including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees – are very important because they pollinate food crops. Pollination is where insects move pollen from one plant to another, fertilising the plants so that they can produce fruit, vegetables, seeds and so on. If all the bees went extinct, it would destroy the delicate balance of the Earth’s ecosystem and affect global food supplies.  There are more than 800 wild bee species within Europe, seven of which are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically endangered. A further 46 are endangered, 24 are vulnerable and 101 are near threatened. While it’s unlikely that all bee species will be wiped out anytime soon, losing these threatened species would still have a big impact on pollination around the world, wiping out plant species, some of which we rely on for our food. I Need To Know is a series by The Conversation, which gives teenagers the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. But the problem goes far beyond bees. In fact, honeybees are responsible for only one third of crop pollination and a very small proportion of the wild plant pollination. There are a diverse range of other insects including butterflies, bumblebees and small flies that do the rest of the work – and it looks like these insects are in trouble too.  A recent study suggests that as many as 40% of the world’s insect species are in decline. Insects are facing extinction rates that are eight times higher than vertebrates. In Germany, scientists have recorded losses of up to 75% of the total mass of insects in protected areas. These trends lead scientists to believe that about a third of all insect species – that’s nearly 2m – may be threatened with extinction. And that figure is growing by over 100,000 species every year. Yet hard data on threatened insect species is lacking, with only 8,000 records actually assessed by the IUCN. Here’s a rundown of what scientists believe to be the top causes of  declines in insect diversity and abundance.  Invasive predators, parasites and disease-causing bacteria called “pathogens” have been blamed for the collapse of honeybee colonies around the world.  Recently, the spread of the Asian Hornet in Europe has caused great concern. This species preys on honey bees, and a single hornet is capable of killing an entire hive.  There is some evidence that wild bees in North America have declined in the face of fungal and bacterial diseases.

      Embattled bees face yet another potential threat – virus-carrying hoverflies


 Of course, in the past bees have coexisted with these pathogens. The fact that scientists have seen more bees lost to these diseases in recent times is probably linked with the bees’ increased exposure to pesticides, which can damage their immune systems. Pollution – particularly from exposure to pesticides – is a key cause of pollinator decline. There are three types of chemical pesticide widely used in the UK: insecticides targeting insect pests, fungicides targeting fungal pathogens of crops and herbicides targeting weeds. Insecticides contain chemicals that can kill pollinators, so they’re clearly a threat. But they may not be the greatest problem pollinators experience. Herbicides are actually used five times as much in farming as insecticides. These weed killers target a huge variety of the wild plants that bees need to forage.  Environmentally-friendly farming schemes recommend planting wildflower strips on the edge of crops, to provide safe refuge and food sources for pollinators. Yet drifting clouds of herbicide from growing fields can contaminate these wildflower strips.  The most cutting-edge research suggests glyphosate (the most commonly used weed killer) can impact the gut microbes of bees, which can have devastating implications for their health.  Although exposure to herbicides and pesticides used by farmers is likely to be one of the main causes of pollinator decline, the chemicals used by city authorities and civilian gardeners might also be harming bees and other insects. So, for the bees’ sake, it’s best to avoid using them where possible. Global warming is believed to be a major driver of wild bee declines. Some wild bees can only survive in a narrow range of temperatures. As their habitats get warmer, the places where they can live grow smaller. For example, some might be forced to live at higher altitudes, where it’s cooler, reducing the space they have to live in. The way land is farmed has been associated with declines in biodiversity and pollination. Farming destroys the kinds of spaces that bees use to nest, it takes away the diversity of food that bees use to forage on and it even has wider impacts on other animals like wild birds, mammals and amphibians.  While countless insect species are currently going extinct, those that remain are taking their place, so it’s unlikely that crops will stop being pollinated any time soon. Generalist species such as the buff-tailed bumblebee, the European honey bee and common small black flies, which can survive in a huge range of temperatures and conditions, will become the main species pollinating our food sources, while rarer, more specialist species will decline.  But as generalist species move in to take the place space left by the losses of specialists, and complex ecosystems become dominated by a couple of generalists, the whole system becomes far more susceptible to a single sudden change. Insects form the base of many intricate food webs, their decline will result in a complex cascade of impacts on vertebrates, threatening ecological stability."
"A man everyone calls Cheese won Somalia’s presidency on Wednesday, and the streets of the beleaguered capital, Mogadishu, exploded in cheers. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a former prime minister, was chosen for the top job, capping a   electoral process that had been widely criticized as corrupt even by Somali politicians who participated in it. Mr. Mohamed, better known in Somalia by his nickname, Farmajo (from formaggio, the Italian word for cheese, for which his father was said to have acquired a taste when Somalia was an Italian colony) was considered the protest candidate and less manipulated by foreign interests than the departing president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Mr. Mohamed enjoys wide support within Somalia’s army. The moment his victory was announced, celebratory gunfire rang out in Mogadishu as soldiers across the city sprayed bullets into the sky. Mr. Mohamed is rare on the Somali political scene for one reason: He is popular. Crowds of ordinary people poured into Mogadishu’s streets to cheer and whistle on Wednesday night. As one Somalia analyst put it: The least corrupt and    candidate won Somalia’s most corrupt and least democratic election. Go figure. Somalia, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the central government collapsed in 1991, did not hold direct elections. Instead, Western donors helped set up a complicated indirect election in which Somalia’s regions and its myriad clans, subclans and subsubclans chose 329 members of Parliament, and those members of Parliament then voted for a president. Western officials thought it too dangerous to hold direct elections because of the persistent threat from the Shabab militant group, which has killed thousands across East Africa. On Tuesday, the Shabab fired mortar rounds into the area in Mogadishu where the election was being held. Mr. Mohamud, the incumbent, handily won the first round of voting, leading Mr. Mohamed by 88 to 72 votes in a field of more than 20 candidates. Many analysts said that Mr. Mohamud had built a huge war chest by receiving secret payments from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, and that he used that money to line up votes ahead of time in Parliament. Many analysts considered it his election to lose. But Mr. Mohamed seems to have tapped into growing resentment about corruption, or possibly, some analysts said, he had his own ways to win over lawmakers. In the last few years, Somali government officials have been steadily enriching themselves, analysts said, while much of the population has sunk deeper into poverty. Aid workers are now worried that millions of Somalis will soon face a famine it would be the third one in 25 years. In the second round of voting, the other presidential contenders threw their weight behind Mr. Mohamed. He won, 184 to 97. Western diplomats quietly cheered on Mr. Mohamed, seeing him as the most organized  —   and least crooked  —   of the contenders. But just about everyone agrees that Somalia still has a long way to go. The government provides few services and controls only small slices of territory. The only reason it controls any territory is the presence of thousands of African Union peacekeepers who have been battling the Shabab for years, taking heavy casualties. Mr. Mohamed, who was born in 1962, had a good reputation as prime minister. As soon as he took office in 2010, he set up a payroll system for soldiers, shrank a bloated cabinet and spoke out against corruption, even though graft continued to blossom on his watch. When he was pushed out less than a year later, as part of a bitter power struggle within the government, protests exploded. Before entering politics, Mr. Mohamed worked as a diplomat for the Somali government and later for the New York State Department of Transportation in Buffalo. He holds American and Somali citizenship, and when he returned to his cubicle in Buffalo after his short stint as prime minister, his   baked him a cake."

From the University of British Columbia , a fish story inspired by a model:

Fish getting smaller as the oceans warm: UBC research
Changes in ocean and climate systems could lead to smaller fish, according to a new study led by fisheries scientists at the University of British Columbia.
The study, published today in the journal Nature Climate Change, provides the first-ever global projection of the potential reduction in the maximum size of fish in a warmer and less-oxygenated ocean.

The researchers used computer modeling to study more than 600 species of fish from oceans around the world and found that the maximum body weight they can reach could decline by 14-20 per cent between years 2000 and 2050, with the tropics being one of the most impacted regions.
“We were surprised to see such a large decrease in fish size,” says the study’s lead author William Cheung, an assistant professor at the UBC Fisheries Centre. “Marine fish are generally known to respond to climate change through changing distribution and seasonality. But the unexpectedly big effect that climate change could have on body size suggests that we may be missing a big piece of the puzzle of understanding climate change effects in the ocean.”
This is the first global-scale application of the idea that fish growth is limited by oxygen supply, which was pioneered more than 30 years ago by Daniel Pauly, principal investigator with UBC’s Sea Around Us Project and the study’s co-author.
“It’s a constant challenge for fish to get enough oxygen from water to grow, and the situation gets worse as fish get bigger,” explains Pauly. “A warmer and less-oxygenated ocean, as predicted under climate change, would make it more difficult for bigger fish to get enough oxygen, which means they will stop growing sooner.”
This study highlights the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and develop strategies to monitor and adapt to changes that we are already seeing, or we risk disruption of fisheries, food security and the way ocean ecosystems work.
###
Note the press release headline: Fish getting smaller as the oceans warm: UBC research – they tout that as if it were measured, it isn’t.
Of course actual field experiments with real data trump models every day of the week and twice on Sunday. For example here’s a graph from the paper The effect of temperature and fish size on growth, feed intake, food conversion efficiency and stomach evacuation rate of Atlantic salmon post-smolts by Handeland et al published in the journal Aquaculture in June 2008:

Fig. 1. Mean weight in Atlantic salmon smolts (±SE, n=23) transferred to seawater at 6 (□), 10 (Δ), 14 (⋄) and 18 (○) °C. The first point (week 0) refers to the freshwater group (control). Different letters indicates significant differences (Student–Newman–Keuls, pb0.05) between temperature groups at same time of sampling, n.s., non significant.
The authors conclude:
In conclusion, the present study shows ontogenetic variation in optimum temperature for growth in juvenile Atlantic salmon smolts, with increased temperature optimum for growth and decreased temperature for feed conversion efficiency as the fish grow bigger.
Temperature tolerance increases with size, but Atlantic salmon smolts are eurythermal (Able to tolerate a wide range of temperatures.) in the size range investigated.

Now as Willis would point out, clearly this is tank studies, and not the open ocean, and you can’t duplicate the complexity of the ocean in a tank. But the fish don’t seem to have a temperature issue, in fact they seem to thrive at warmer temperatures. The claim is that as oceans warm, less oxygen will be available, and that will stunt the growth of fish. This claim in the modeling paper comes from the elemental saturation curve for dissolved oxygen (DO) in water, which is much like that of CO2. From a lecture on water chemistry at keystone.edu:

I found this part of the lecture interesting, and was something I didn’t know:
Nota bene:  100% saturation does not mean that no more O2 can be held in solution.  I have measured DO >200%.  Does this mean that bubbles should be forming?  No, not necessarily. Saturation here means that 10.92 mg/l can be held at equilibrium; if 200% is produced by intense photosynthetic activity, the extra amount will be lost (diffused) at the air/water interface.


a nomogram can be used to determine degree of saturation; use a straightedge to connect the water temperature and DO.  Read the % saturation at the intersection of this line with the middle line.


Dissolved Oxygen % Saturation Nomogram
 ·         at 10 meters, with a temperature of 10°C, at surface pressure would hold (at 100% saturation) 10.92 mg, but you may find 15 mg/l.; compared to the surface it would be supersaturated, but at the depth and pressure it’s at, it may be less than saturated.
o       How can water be supersaturated?
§         intense photosynthesis
§         entrainment of air falling over a dam or spillway; high pressure of impact drives gases into solution; may lead to gas bubble disease, a problem in TVA dams
§         affects fish if subjected for a few hours to >115% saturation; bubbles form in tissues; emboli collect in gills causing anoxia and death; also affects cladocerans.  Other biota, e.g., crayfish and stoneflies are hardier.
So, too much oxygen is also a problem. But what really piqued my interest wad the statement of “intense photosynthesis” as a cause. That made me wonder if photosynthetic algae and diatoms would respond to increased temperature, so I went looking and found this paper:  Production and fate of extracellular polymeric substances produced by benthic diatoms and bacteria: A laboratory study by Lundkvist et al.
And the graph showing how photosynthetic oxygen production changes with temperature, again hard data from observation:

Fig. 7. Dose-response curve on light intensity and photosynthesis measured as oxygen production by benthic algae population.
So, it seems to me that the ocean already has this worked out. If O2 can be supersaturated, and “intense photosynthesis” can be a cause, it would seem that warmer water that normally would get oxygen from air-sea interaction and entrainment might be supplemented from increased algal photosynthesis.
Besides, broad differences in oxygen content by latitude are well known:

Image: Wikipedia
And fish aren’t static entities…they move. So I suppose I’m not too worried about global warming shrinking fish. Overfishing is likely a far greater problem for reduced fish size, as are oxygen deprived dead zones due to fertilizer runoff as we’ve seen in the Gulf of Mexico:

Dead zones occur throughout the world and are caused primarily from excess fertilizer and animal manure run-off, as well as, emissions from sewage treatment plants, urban and suburban run-off, and air emissions from vehicles. The largest dead zone in the country occurs at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the Gulf of Mexico each spring. In past years, the dead zone (pictured in the satellite image as the red coastal areas around Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida) has encompassed some 5,000 square miles. – ewg.org

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst cherry-picks its way to warming, hiding that the temperature has been cooling since 2000.
================================================
The German Weather Service has a problem with the climate

By Dr. D. E. Koelle
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
One typically regards the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) as a serious organization that supplies us with reliable weather data. But when it comes to climate, doubt grows when one reads the statements made by leading DWD representatives with respect to the press conference in Berlin over the year 2013.
In it they announce “that the warming is marching on” even though this is not the case according to the DWD’s own data – especially in Germany! Such a claim can only be explained by a political instruction or a hasty allegiance to a government climate policy. Even the director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Prof. Dr. Jochem Marotzke, said “I don’t know of any serious colleague who would deny that it hasn’t gotten warmer over the last years.”
1990 reference period one today date reference period, which is also used in the USA. When that period is used things look quite different:
The year 2013 is 0.2°C below normal.
A second example used is that today is 1.2°C warmer in Germany than in 1881. Here as well a low temperature reference point is selected again. If, for example, the year 1860 were selected, then the difference would be only half as much, approx. 0.6°C.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




And there is no mention of the fact that the annual temperatures in Germany dropped 0.6°C from 2000 to 2013 (using DWD data!) and that 2013 was the second coldest year of the last 14 years (Figure 1). It was not possible to find any chart showing the recent development at any of the DWD’s Internet pages. Obviously it just doesn’t fit with the prescribed climate ideology. Also when one considers the time period since 1990, there has not been any temperature rise. Instead there has been an almost constant level.
A third example mentioned by the DWD is the claim that the 1983 – 2012 time period is likely the warmest of the last 1400 years, citing the IPCC report. Doesn’t the DWD have its own historical data? Doesn’t the DWD know that not only 1000 years ago was it just as warm as today, but also over the last 3200 years it was just as warm on multiple occasions (and that without the influence of CO2)?
Figure 2 depicts the climate history which shows that warm periods were always times of political stability and economic prosperity. On the other hand the cool periods that occurred between the warm ones were times of instability (migration) and famine occurring due to drought.

"Liverpool has declared a climate emergency. The mayors of both the city itself and the surrounding “city region” have recognised the emergency, and both have suggested that a tidal barrage on the River Mersey could form part of the solution. And on a recent visit to the city, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would support the £3.5 billion project.  Two years ago, I teamed up with colleagues at the National Oceanography Centre and University of Liverpool to look at how to realise the River Mersey’s energy potential: we concluded that a tidal power station could be part of the solution.  So what actually is a “tidal barrage”, and why do we think the Mersey is so suitable? A tidal barrage generates electricity in a similar way to traditional hydroelectric power, using a dam (or barrage) to create a difference in height between two bodies of water. As tidal waters flow in and out of the estuary, the barrage blocks the flow, raising the water level on one side. When the desired difference in water level is reached, the water is then allowed to flow through turbines, generating electricity. Tidal barrages can operate in both directions and, as the tide goes in and out twice a day, are capable of producing electricity four times a day. A few different factors make the Mersey an ideal place for a barrage. Its tidal range (the difference in water level between high and low tide) can be 10 metres or more at spring tides – the UK’s second highest, while a narrow channel at its entrance (known as “The Narrows”) means the barrage could be shorter and thus cheaper to construct. It’s also close to a large urban area, with lots of electricity demand. We estimated a Mersey barrage could produce 0.9 to 1.5 terawatt hours of electricity each year. A terawatt is a million million watts, so this is a lot of energy – enough to supply electricity to about 300,000 homes, or more than all the homes in the city of Liverpool.  The technology has been around for a while. The world’s first tidal barrage was completed in 1966 on La Rance river in Brittany, France, and is still operational today. However, the high initial costs and potential environmental impacts mean there are still very few of these projects worldwide. The idea to generate energy from the River Mersey’s tides was first put forward in 1981, with a series of proposals and feasibility studies since. As ever, the key issues are financial and environmental. Financial issues came into focus in June 2018 when the UK government rejected proposals for a similar “tidal lagoon” power station in Swansea Bay on the grounds of “value for money” compared to nuclear power and offshore wind. That’s despite Swansea tidal power having received strong backing in an independent review the government commissioned 18 months previously.  This raised questions about how tidal energy generation capacity will become a reality for the UK. Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government would pay for a Mersey barrage but, at this point, it seems that it would only happen under a Conservative government if privately funded – as with the Swansea Lagoon. The Mersey is also a busy commercial waterway. Some disruption during construction would be inevitable, and designers would have to figure out how to best allow shipping access through locks built alongside the barrage. The environmental implications are difficult to predict. At La Rance, sand-eels and other marine fauna initially suffered, but after ten years a new biological equilibrium was reached and the estuary was once again considered richly diverse. In the Mersey, one major concern is that a tidal barrage would likely mean less exposure for the estuary’s mudflats, which are an important feeding habitat for migratory birds. Here, impacts could be reduced by generating electricity on both the ebb and flood tides, as opposed to one way generation on the ebb tide. Two way generation reduces the time the tide is held back, and thus there is less difference in height between water on either side of the barrage – generation may be reduced overall, but it is better environmentally. If used in the Mersey, two way generation would almost maintain the size of the intertidal area. It will be hard to build a tidal barrage without at least some local environmental impact. The same could be said for almost any renewable energy project, however, and by reducing carbon emissions tidal energy could deliver environmental benefits on a much larger scale. A barrage could also create a pedestrian and cycle link between Liverpool and the Wirral. Finally, as recognised in the government-commissioned report, large tidal energy projects could see the UK use its expertise in maritime engineering to develop technology for export worldwide. If the environmental and financial issues can be resolved, a tidal barrage across the Mersey would provide a substantial amount of renewable electricity for many years to come, as well as a clear statement of the UK’s progress to achieving zero carbon energy."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I keep reading these claims that we’re all going to starve because of global warming. People say it’s going to be the death of agriculture, that increasing temperatures will cause significant drops in crop yields. Here’s a typical bit of alarmism (emphasis mine):
A study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), indicates that climate change would hit developing countries the hardest, leading to massive decline in crop yields and production.
Whoa, a massive decline in crop yields due to increasing temperatures, sounds scary. So I thought I’d review the facts. Here is the global situation, showing the global yields of rice, corn, and wheat, along with the change in global temperature.
Figure 1. Changes in global grain yields and global temperatures 1961-2011. Data Sources: FAO, BEST, Photo 
Now call me crazy, but what I see going on there is not a global crisis. Nor is it “massive declines”. Notice that (according to BEST) the global temperature has gone up one full degree centigrade … anyone remember any thermal crises that have resulted from that one degree of warming? Since two degrees is supposed to bring untold sorrows, where are the sorrows of one degree? Where is the lethal sea level rise? Where are the disasters? ¿Où sont les neiges d’antan? And most of all, where are the decreases in yield from that one degree of warming?

Of course, you could say that this is just because it’s a global average, and not all countries produce wheat, so we wouldn’t expect good agreement between global temperature and global grain production. And you might be right. So … here’s the same chart, only this time just for the US;
Figure 2. As in FIgure 1, except for the US rather than for the whole globe. BEST US temperature data.
Again, there is no thermal related decline in yields. According to BEST the US, like the globe, has gone up about a degree since 1960 … where are the climate refugees? Where are the corpses? Where are the thermal catastrophes? And more to the current point, where are the declines in food production? I don’t see them.
Finally, I thought “Well, maybe if I detrend all of the US data and then see how well related the change in annual temperature is to the change in annual crop yields” … no joy there either. Below are the measurements for those relationships. The strength of a relationship between two variables  is measured by something called “R squared” (written “R2“), which varies from 0.0 for no relationship between the variables, up to 1.0 for perfectly related variables. Here’s the relationship of US temperature and US crop yields:
R2, US BEST Land Temperature and US Maize (corn) yield : 0.001
R2, US BEST Land Temperature and US Rice yield : 0.000
R2, US BEST Land Temperature and US Wheat yield : 0.022
In other words, no relationship at all. I gotta confess, I don’t see what folks are screaming about. If you believe the BEST data, we’ve seen a full degree of temperature rise in the last half century, and it hasn’t done us any harm—no atolls gone underwater, no millions of climate refugees, no increases in extreme weather. And through all of that temperature rise, the crop yields have kept going up. Will they reach a maximum? Assuredly they will … but it doesn’t seem like that maximum yield is going to be much affected by the temperature.
So I fear that once again we’ll have to postpone Paul Ehrlich’s celebration. He’s been predicting the global Malthusian food crisis for decades now, to no avail. Near as I can tell, according to the Malthusian philosophers like Ehrlich, the problem is that this continued increase in crop yields works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory …
w.
Further Reading: I put up a post a while ago called “Border Transgressions“, about wheat production and temperature in Mexico. I also discussed how much food people actually have to eat in “I am so tired of Malthus“.
[UPDATE] Some people seem to have understood me as saying that because temperatures were rising and crop yields were rising as well, that the rising temperatures were causing the rising yields. I am not saying that. It may indeed be true that in a warmer world, the general yield would be better, and I see no reason it would not be better … but that’s not what I’m saying.
Some people seem to have understood me as saying that crops are not affected by temperatures above their optimum range. I am not saying that. All crops have preferred temperatures, above or below which they do not produce as well.
People are over-thinking this. What I am saying is simple. It is the answer to the question in the subject of the post—do increasing temperatures lower crop yields? I say no.
Note that I am not saying that increasing temperatures increase crop yields, although they may do so. Instead, I am falsifying the alarmists forecasting things like “massive drops” in crop yields. I’m not saying yields will or won’t go up if it gets warmer … I’m saying they won’t go down.
Here’s what lowers crop yields. Bad weather forecasts lower crop yields. If the farmer knows it will be colder next year, don’t worry, she’ll make money, she’ll plant later, use a different variety, plant beans instead of corn, get a bumper crop, be the envy of her neighbors. Same thing in reverse if she knows it will be hotter, she’ll plant early and have her crop in while the neighbors’ crops are wilting in the field.
But a bad forecast, she puts in hot weather seed and it turns out to be a cold year, the yield will go down.
So increasing temperatures, particularly predicted increasing temperatures, particularly predicted gradual increases over a century, will be lost in the noise of the thousands of changes that farmers do each and every year to account for the much larger interannual variations and interdecadal variations. Every year, the farmers successfully deal with the fact that not next century but next year may be two or three degrees warmer or cooler than this year … do you really think a degree’s rise spread over decades will affect those farmers’ crops? It’s lost in the noise, they’ve got three degrees to think about. Here’s the part that I think many folks don’t understand.
At the end of the day, crop yield is a measure of the farmers, not of the temperature.
In evidence of this, I offer the fact that the above analysis of the detrended US temperature data and detrended US crop yield data showed only an insignificant relationship between the two.
w.
[UPDATE 2] Someone downthread asked about the yields in the poorest countries. Here is that data.

As you can see, progress has been much slower in the developing world. However, even in the worst off countries on the planet, even with the warming of the last 50 years, the yields are still rising. And it is worth noting that the worst countries are all at or above the global average yield rates in 1961. In my lifetime, the poor of the world have moved to where the global average was when I was a kid …
And obviously, of course, at this end of the spectrum even the simplest of improved methods and seeds would double the yield … which is why temperature is not the issue, and never was.

"The EU’s farming sector needs radical reform, and the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rewritten if the climate crisis is to be tackled, a group of young climate activists will urge. Fridays for Future, founded by teenagers in the wake of Greta Thunberg’s school strikes, will confront the European commission’s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, online to call for new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, and replace subsidies based on the amount of land farmed with payments for farmers supplying public goods, such as clean water, clean air and lower carbon emissions.  “[We] demand a pathway to climate neutrality for the EU’s agricultural and food sector,” the activists wrote in an open letter published ahead of the virtual meeting. “We need to transform direct payments into payments for public goods. Public money needs to flow into the transition to sustainable, climate-friendly and peasant [sic] agriculture. We need a new evidence-based and just CAP.” The CAP is worth close to €60bn a year, and costs roughly €114 annually per citizen. However, the system has been blamed for the increase in intensive farming, overuse of pesticides and poor attention to soil conservation and wildlife protection. Earlier this week, the EU published its biodiversity strategy, which would devote €20bn a year to boosting wildlife, and require the planting of 3bn trees in the next decade, but stopped short of the sweeping reform of the CAP that campaigners want. “Current agropolicy is an immediate threat to our future,” Tilman von Samson, one of the activists, told the Guardian. “Not only because the CAP is inactive in reducing emissions – much worse, it is gambling away the potential for hope that lies in agriculture [which] can be a climate buffer.” Reform to subsidies could reward farmers for conserving carbon in their soil and vegetation, which would benefit nature as well as helping the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The EU’s farm to fork strategy would cut pesticide use, boost organic farming and halve the use of antibiotics on farm animals by 2030, as well as improving farming practices to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Fridays for Future wants the EU to go further as part of its European Green Deal, the centrepiece of the bloc’s strategy which is meant to steer Europe to net zero emissions by 2050. The European commission is trying to push the policy ahead of crunch climate talks, called Cop26, postponed to next year from their original date of this November in Glasgow. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, hailed the green deal plan as Europe’s equivalent of the US putting a man on the moon in the last century, a transformative proposal that would reach into every aspect of people’s lives, from energy and transport to food and nature. But von Samson told the Guardian: “Everything that has been discussed yet is incompatible with the Paris Agreement, and the future into which the current CAP proposals will lead us are as far from one another as the man on the moon and his home planet. We want to remind the commission of their responsibility. If they want to make a real change, they have to start with a new CAP.”"
"What we eat can harm not only our health, but the planet itself. About a quarter of all the greenhouse gas emissions that humans generate each year come from how we feed the world. Most of them are methane released by cattle, nitrogen oxides from chemical fertilisers and carbon dioxide from the destruction of forests to grow crops or raise livestock.  All of these gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. Extreme weather events like floods and droughts are becoming more frequent and severe in our warming world, destroying crops and disrupting growing seasons. As a result, climate change could wreak havoc on already precarious food supplies. The challenges for agriculture are vast, and they’ll only mount as the world’s population grows. The new special report on climate and land by the IPCC warns that without drastic changes in global land use, agriculture and human diets, efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions will fall significantly short of targets to hold global temperature rise below 1.5°C.

 A food system that produces nutritious food without harming the environment or other aspects of our well-being is sorely needed. But can it produce enough food to feed billions of people while reversing biodiversity loss and pollution?  This is where I believe archaeologists and anthropologists can help. Our recent paper in World Archaeology explores past agricultural systems and how they could help make agriculture more sustainable today.  There’s a long history of societies around the world experimenting with the way they produce food. Through these past successes and failures comes perspective on how humans have transformed local environments through agriculture and affected soil properties over thousands of years. Ancient agricultural practices weren’t always in balance with nature – there’s some evidence that early food growers damaged their environment with overgrazing or mismanaging irrigation which made the soil saltier. But there are also many instances where past systems of growing food improved soil quality, increased crop yields and protected crops against flooding and drought. One example originated in Pre-Incan South America, and was commonly used between 300 BC and 1400 AD. The system, known today as Waru Waru, consisted of raised soil beds up to two metres high and up to six metres wide, surrounded by water channels. First discovered by researchers in the 1960s around Lake Titicaca, these raised field systems were introduced into wetland and highland areas of Bolivia and Peru over the following decades.  Although some projects failed, the majority have allowed local farmers to improve crop productivity and soil fertility without using chemicals. Compared to other local agricultural methods, the raised beds capture water during droughts and drain water when there’s too much rain. This irrigates the crops all year round. The canal water retains heat and raises the air temperature surrounding the soil beds by 1°C, protecting crops from frost. The fish that colonise the channels also provide an additional food source.  Research is still ongoing, but today these Waru Waru systems are regularly used by farmers throughout South America, including in the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia – one of the largest wetlands in the world. Waru Waru farming could prove more resilient to the increased flooding and drought that’s expected under climate change. It could also grow food in degraded habitats once considered unsuitable for crops, helping ease pressure to clear rainforest. Monocultures are a much more familiar method of agriculture to people today. These are the vast fields that contain one type of crop, grown on a huge scale to guarantee higher yields that are easier to manage. But this method can also degrade soil fertility and damage natural habitats and decrease biodiversity. Chemical fertilisers used on these farms leach into rivers and oceans and their pesticides kill wildlife and create resistant pests. Growing multiple crops, rearing different species of livestock and reserving different habitats for conservation could make food supplies more nutritious and resilient to future shocks in the weather, while also creating more livelihoods and regenerating biodiversity.  That may sound like a lot to consider, but many ancient practices managed to achieve this balance with rather simple means. Some of them are even used today. In southern China, farmers add fish to their rice paddy fields in a method that dates back to the later Han Dynasty (25–220 AD).  The fish are an additional protein source, so the system produces more food than rice farming alone. But another advantage over rice monocultures is that farmers save on costly chemical fertilisers and pesticides – the fish provide a natural pest control by eating weeds and harmful pests such as the rice planthopper.  Research throughout Asia has shown that compared to fields that only grow rice, rice-fish farming increases rice yields by up to 20%, allowing families to feed themselves and sell their surplus food at market. These rice-fish farms are vital to smallholder communities, but today they’re increasingly pushed out by larger commercial organisations wishing to expand monoculture rice or fish farms.  Rice-fish farming could feed more people than current monocultures while using less of the agricultural chemicals which pollute water and generate greenhouse gas emissions. The enduring success of these ancient methods remind us that we could reimagine our entire food system to feed ten billion people while rejuvenating wildlife and locking carbon away. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we should look to what worked in the past and adapt it for the future."
"Pilots flying water-bombing aircraft are “consistently tasked too late for fires” and sit idle on the tarmac until conditions worsen, the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements has been told. The inquiry also heard that the radio networks used by firefighting agencies in each jurisdiction are “largely incompatible” with each other and the lack of national coordination meant that resources were not always used effectively.  John McDermott, the president of McDermott Aviation, a company that clocked up 10,000 hours of aerial firefighting during the 2019-2020 bushfires, said that only three states – Victoria, Western Australia and occasionally Tasmania – positioned aircraft on standby, to be airborne within 15 minutes of a fire being reported. In other states, they have to be tasked to a fire, and that call can be made too late. “We are consistently tasked to fires too late and miss the opportunity for a hard initial attack,” McDermott said. “Watching the fire develop when you’re sitting with a helicopter ready to go and attack it is a very frustrating exercise. We’ve obviously not allowed to go and attack the fire until we’re directed to attack it.” McDermott said they were frequently not dispatched until the wind had changed, “and by that stage, often the fire’s already off and running, and it’s a bigger problem for everybody”. “There’s often long periods of inaction – it would appear to us to be inaction– before being called to the fire ground.” Philip Hurst, the chief executive of the Aerial Application Association of Australia, said the lack of “overriding and overarching” national systems made it difficult for aerial firefighting in Australia to improve. Hurst said there were no national systems in place for safety management, continuous improvement, quality assurance, incident reporting or pilot feedback – a fact he pointed out in a parliamentary inquiry into bushfires in 2003, but has yet to be addressed. He said Australia should have a national aerial firefighting strategy that prioritised the use of predetermined dispatch, or having aircraft on standby to respond quickly to fires within a certain area. The industry peak body is also calling for the standard seasonal firefighting contract to be extended from 84 days to 120 days. Richard Alder, the general manager of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, said the different radio systems used by each jurisdiction meant that aircraft operating in border areas were often installed with six radios – two for aeronautical communications and two each for tactical communication with the different fire agencies. Alder said it was “currently impractical” to provide standard tactical radios in all firefighting aircraft Australia-wide “because each state and territory adopts a different system that are largely incompatible”. Lack of compatible radios sometimes played a role in resource deployment, the royal commission heard. Ruth Ryan, the corporate fire manager for HPV plantations, which lost 6,300 hectares of plantations in Victoria this summer, said she would like to see “state borders dissolved, effectively, especially for aerial support”. HPV is under contact to share its firefighting resources, including air support and 280 trained firefighters, with Victoria’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning.  Ryan said that for plantations in the south-west of the state, the closest aerial support was often in South Australia but because of the difference in radio systems she did not know if it was coming. “If I was sitting 20km inside the Victorian border, I cannot, unless I’ve got yet another radio in my vehicle, I cannot hear what’s happening in SA as far as any dispatch,” she said. The royal commission has received an additional 3,162 documents, totalling 44,000 pages, since the Friday before the public hearings began, senior counsel Dominique Hogan Doran said. That has caused delays to its proposed hearing schedule.  The commission is due to hold hearings for the rest of this week, then resume on 16 June. The 1,700 public submissions it received will begin to be published from next week."
"**Jason Bassett is planning a journey this weekend to tend a grave in Moffat cemetery.**
It is for a woman he had not heard of until a few days ago.
At the same time, Christine Hastie from Solihull has been spending time at a memorial to Mr Bassett's father - a man she never met.
It is all the result of an appeal made on Facebook in the hope of assistance due to the inevitable difficulties caused by coronavirus restrictions.
It started when Mr Bassett - a funeral director in Dumfries - realised his family was unlikely to be able to make the journey to his dad John's ashes memorial plot at Robin Hood Cemetery in Solihull this year.
""I moved away from Birmingham when I was 13 but my dad still stayed in Birmingham,"" he explained.
""We always made the trip to see my dad at Christmas and, when he passed away, we just continued doing it but putting a holly wreath at his memorial in the cemetery.
""Obviously this year we are not able to go down and I had just accepted, well I won't go down.""
However, he decided to post on a local Facebook group in Solihull to see if anyone else might be willing to help him.
""I was just inundated with people with messages,"" he said.
""I don't know how many people have been in contact since then to arrange things.""
One woman agreed to lay a wreath and then Ms Hastie got in contact to say she had a predicament much like his own.
""A lady messaged me to say she was in a similar situation but her mum was in Scotland,"" he said.
""I thought, I will ask where in Scotland because Scotland is big and I couldn't believe it when she said Moffat.
""It is only a 40-minute car journey for myself so I offered to do the same for her.""
Mr Bassett's father died seven years ago and he said it would mean a lot to his family for someone to visit his memorial.
""I think when someone passes away that's it so I don't get much from visiting people's graves - it is mainly for my brothers and sisters,"" he said.
""I know it would mean a lot more to them - but that doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything to me.""
Ms Hastie's mother, Catherine Rowley, died two years ago and her birthday was on Christmas Day so she likes to try to visit over the festive season.
When she saw Mr Bassett's post on Facebook it struck a chord.
""I understood how he felt because my mum is buried in Moffat cemetery and I get upset because I feel she is a bit neglected because we can't go and visit easily,"" she said.
""Jason offered to go and visit and tidy up the grave for me and I am reciprocating for his dad.
""Jason had quite a good response, we are quite a nice community. It was nice that so many people cared. ""
Ms Hastie said her mother was born in Hamilton but loved Moffat so much she wanted to go ""home"" when she died.
""I tried to explain it to Jason, I actually feel a bit of relief that somebody is going to just tend her grave so she is not alone,"" she said.
""I know that sounds really odd but it is nice to have visitors at a grave. Somebody is remembering you.""
Mr Bassett now hopes their story might encourage others to offer to visit graves that families cannot get to this year.
""This Christmas will be different, but it doesn't have to be any less special,"" he said."

I’ve commented on the failure of Obamanomics, with special focus on how both banks and corporations are sitting on money because the investment climate is so grim. Not exactly flattering to the White House.   
  
  
Using Minneapolis Federal Reserve data, I’ve compared the current recovery with the expansion of the early 1980s. Once again, not good news for the Obama administration.   
  
  
And I’ve shared a couple of cartoons — here and here — that use humor to show the impact of bad public policy.   
  
  
But here’s a Bloomberg story that provides what may be the most damning evidence that the President’s big government agenda is a failure: 



U.S. regulators have asked some banks to take more deposits from large investors even if it’s unprofitable, and lenders in return are seeking relief on insurance premiums and leverage ratios, according to six people with knowledge of the talks.   
  
  
Deposits are flooding into the biggest U.S. banks as customers seek shelter from Europe’s debt crisis and falling stock prices. That forces lenders to raise capital for a growing balance sheet and saddles them with the higher deposit insurance payments. With short‐​term interest rates so low, it’s hard for financial firms to reinvest the new money profitably.   
  
  
…At least one firm, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., tried to recoup some of the costs by charging depositors 13 basis points, or 0.13 percent, for holding unusually high balances.



Let’s think about what this article is really saying. Banks normally make money by attracting deposits and then lending that money to people and businesses that have productive uses for the funds.   
  
  
Yet the economy is so weak that banks are leery of taking more money. The story is complicated by other factors, including capital flight from Europe, taxes (or premiums) imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and various regulatory issues. But even with these caveats, it’s still remarkable that banks want to turn down money — or charge people for making deposits. That’s sort of like McDonald’s turning away customers because the firm loses money by selling Big Macs and french fries. Or, better yet, like McDonald’s turning away free goods from suppliers because not enough people want to buy the final product.

"**The Netherlands has made it compulsory to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus.**
The country is one of the last in Europe to introduce such a measure.
The rule will apply to those over the age of 13 in public buildings such as shops, railway stations and hairdressers from Tuesday.
The Netherlands has been one of the countries worst affected by Europe's second wave of Covid-19.
It broke daily case records throughout October, and the number of new confirmed infections in the country of 17 million has remained fairly stable at about 5,000 a day for several weeks.
The new face mask rule will remain in place for at least three months, with those who ignore it facing a fine of up to â¬95 (Â£85; $113).
But there are questions over how the measure will be enforced. Major retail chains have said they will inform customers about the rule but not refuse entry to those without a face covering.
""This is not something which we consider part of our job as shop workers,"" a spokesman for the Mirage retail group said.
Separately, under the measure, students and teachers will have to wear a mask when moving around school buildings but not during lessons. Teachers who move around the classroom while talking, however, will have to put on a face covering.
Places of worship, such as churches, temples, and mosques, are exempt.
""Making face masks mandatory almost everywhere makes it clearer what the rules are,"" a government website reads. ""[We] want to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.""
The Dutch have tied themselves up in knots over this issue.
As neighbouring nations followed World Health Organization advice (the body recommends wearing a mask to help reduce the spread of the virus), the government refused to follow suit and insisted it was being ""guided by the science"".
Scientists here doubted whether masks were effective. In fact, the prime minister even spoke of potential risks they posed and suggested they gave people a false sense of security.
Moreover, at the start of the crisis the Dutch were told they didn't need to be treated like children with curfews and other sweeping measures. That has made it harder for the government to convince people they do now need to be told what to do. This inconsistency has caused confusion and reduced compliance.
It's also worth noting that the coalition cabinet is made up of five political parties that have been battling with competing priorities: the economy, civil liberties and people's health.
The much-lauded Dutch ""live and let live"" mentality has also been used as an excuse for people not to change their habits or lifestyles. That said, the latest figures collected by the Dutch public health institute suggest 84% of people ""support the principle"" of wearing a mask.
Earlier in the year, the Dutch government adopted a strategy of ""intelligent lockdown"" that avoided strict national restrictions and did not shut down as much of public life as in many other countries.
At the time, Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the Netherlands as a ""grown-up country"" where people were glad to be ""treated as adults"".
Only in September were people in the country's major cities advised to wear face masks in shops."

UPDATE: Hockey stick achieved, see below.
Guess what? WUWT readers make up the majority of viewers of this farce video. Mostly curiosity I suppose. Watch the video, then see the numbers below.

Yesterday, Tom Nelson asked this question, and it got me to digging.
It’s now been two weeks: Does anybody know what happened to Al Gore’s “Reality Drop” campaign?


“Reality Drop” Brings Social Gaming (And Facts) To Dispelling Climate Change Misinformation 
Looking for an innovative way to dispel myths and spread science about climate change, Gore, Fox and their colleagues at The Climate Reality Project turned to agency Arnold Worldwide. Pete Favat, Arnold Worldwide’s chief creative officer, had attracted Gore’s attention because of his cause-related work for the Truth Campaign, the hugely successful national anti-tobacco program.
…
The product, “Reality Drop,” relies on sophisticated algorithms to highlight “hot” climate change stories and provide simple rebuttals to the most common climate change myths.
…
Users win points for sharing facts and eventually climb up the ranks of the game and earn Foursquare-like badges such as “Carbon Crusher,” “Shining Beacon,” and “Order of the Green Circle.”
Initial information on the game will be officially unveiled on November 14th during “24 Hours of Reality: The Dirty Weather Report,” a 24-hour event broadcast live on the Internet, culminating in a presentation by Gore on November 15th at 7 p.m. EST.
Without any advertising budget, Reality Drop will rely strictly on word-of-mouth to gain traction and influence the climate change discussion. “Success will be measured by the amount of people who are posting and the number of people involved,” says Favat. “People inherently want to be on the right side here.”
Reality Drop (RealityDrop) on Twitter
[Seven total tweets, none since Nov. 15]
Here’s the Twitter page, captured on 11/30/2012, showing all 7 Tweets

Now here comes the fun part, the “stats” section of the Vimeo video page for the propaganda movie at the top shows this:

Wow, 155 views in a week, and trending down, down, down. Some might call that interest “cooling”. When you click on the “Top URL embeds” (highlighted in yellow) you get this fun table showing that WUWT is the main external contributor to views of Al Gore’s ‘Reality Drop’ video. Heh.

What is really interesting is the comparison to the top “loads” leader, which has only 6 views compared to WUWT’s 999. More people from WUWT viewed Al’s video than anywhere else in the world. That’s gotta sting.
So what should we do to help Al get more views?
Well obviously WUWT’ers need to help. Simply click on the video “play” button above, and we’ll give him a hockey stick graph for views. If you have a website/Twitter feed/Facebook page, direct people here and ask them to help. To register a view from WUWT, you simply need to play the video above in the open WUWT browser window. It’s just that easy to give Al a hockey stick of traffic from those he seeks to destroy. I’ll post an update when the success is robust, er, graphically clear.
In the meantime, you might want to take this survey Al has prepared to help gauge the success of his video. I’m sure he’d love to hear your opinion!
==============================================================
UPDATE: We’ve presented a hockeystick, and WUWT is well in the lead. Thanks everybody!

Press Release: **New Conservative**



Mainstream media, as the purveyors of truth and source of balanced information, took another backward step yesterday with the announcement by _Stuff_ that most New Zealand organisations had joined 170 media outlets from around the world in the “Covering Climate Now” project.



“The last bastion for protecting free speech, which indeed advocates for independent and informed thought, has been media. Stuff’s announcement shows how far we have strayed from this value,” observes New Conservative Deputy Leader Elliot Ikilei.



With the comment by _Stuff_ editor in chief, Patrick Crewsdon, that the aim will be to “make the realities of climate change feel urgent, tangible and unignorable for New Zealanders”, it is clear that the objective is to present **selective information** designed to adjust public thought to what some think ‘should’ be thought.



“One of the principles of free speech is that there be opportunity for open, informed discourse on important issues”, says Elliot Ikilei. “When the media advises that they will present information that dictates the conclusions that are to be reached, they fail the foundations upon which journalism was built.”



Working extensively with young people and at-risk youth, Elliot is only too aware of the stresses and anxiety that exist. Failing to present balanced and detailed information, and robbing individuals of the ability to draw their own conclusions, is unnecessarily adding to a sense of despair and panic.



“This approach, to manipulate mainstream media leading up to the United Nations Climate Action Summit, is irresponsible and does a disservice to those working in journalism who are committed to presenting facts rather than opinion”, observes Elliot.



“New Conservative believes that to achieve real pollution solutions we must have information that can be relied upon, and most New Zealanders rely on media sources to at least introduce this information”, concludes Elliot.



“To have a media outlet as popular as _Stuff_ openly state that they will only present information that pre-determines public opinion, highlights the importance of protecting the freedom of individuals to openly debate issues of the day.”

US News and World Report is running a poll on whether or not Hurricane Sandy was caused by global warming.  Here is the poll results currently: 

Since it is open to everyone, no matter what side of this opinion you come down on, see their web site to add your vote if you wish.
http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/10/30/was-hurricane-sandy-caused-by-global-warming
UPDATE: From reader input it seems this poll is apparently of even poorer quality than one would expect,  and allows multiple voting. NO to vote stuffing. Be honest, 1 vote per person please…though, they may allow you to think it was counted. Sigh, what a poor design for a national magazine. In any event none of that vote stuffing please. OTOH this lack of basic input control negates any value the poll may have. – Anthony

"Over the past decade, the UK has tentatively begun to exploit its reserves of shale gas through a process best known as “fracking”. But according to our new research, UK shale gas reserves are substantially lower than previously thought – in fact, the amount of shale gas available may be just one sixth of the current official estimate.  Back in 2013, a UK government study estimated how much gas could be found in Bowland Shale. “A shale” consists of the sort of sedimentary rocks in which oil and gas can be formed – while “shale gas” is the gas formed but not yet released into reservoirs. The Bowland, stretching from Lancashire, across the Pennines and down into the Midlands, is the country’s largest and most economically viable shale. The 2013 study estimated that Bowland shale alone could provide the UK with up to 50 years of gas at current demand.  But it turns out this was a big over-estimate. At the time, scientists didn’t know much about the Bowland shale and didn’t have any published production data to work off. This meant they estimated the size of the reserves based on models that were developed for shales in the US, without taking into account key differences between shale gas in the two countries.  Further, the estimate was based on how much gas scientists thought the rocks could contain, rather that the actual amount the rocks were able to “generate”. Plus, initial estimates of this gas holding capacity may have been inflated as they overlooked the effect on moisture, which is known to reduce the amount of gas held within the shale. Our findings, now published in the journal Nature Communications, are the result of 11 years work developing a way to simulate in a lab the conditions that rocks would be exposed to deep underground, and therefore figure out how much oil or gas these rocks would “generate”. We then applied this method to shale gas, which meant we were able to measure and estimate shale reserves. We estimate that the maximum reserves for the Bowland Shale are around 200 standard trillion cubic feet – that’s less than a sixth of the 2013 estimate of around 1,300 trillion cubic ft. Assuming 10% of the reserves are economically recoverable – a fairly optimistic scenario – this corresponds to no more than ten years’ UK gas supply at current demand. Any predictive method will inevitably involve a degree of uncertainty, and both our study and the original 2013 report can only report a range of possible values, with the central prediction being the most probable. A truly foolproof way of assessing how much gas is buried below the UK, and how much is economically recoverable, could only come from widespread test drilling. So for now, more tests will be needed to reduce the degree of uncertainty. However, our findings can inform government decisions around the future of shale gas in the UK, as the country moves towards being carbon neutral by 2050.  Carbon neutrality means natural gas can only be used either to generate electricity when combined with carbon capture and storage, or potentially to produce hydrogen for transport or domestic heating. Given the scale of the roll-out needed for carbon capture, it is likely that UK gas consumption will fall over the next 30 years, therefore extending the life of reserves including both UK shale, and less controversially, conventional gas from the North Sea."
"**A nurse in Oregon has been placed on administrative leave after claiming she does not follow pandemic restrictions outside of her job.**
In a TikTok video which appeared to be filmed in her hospital, the nurse said she does not wear a mask away from work and lets her children have play dates.
It caused a stir on social media, with many calling for her firing.
Her employer, Salem Health, said she was under investigation and condemned her behaviour.
Reacting to the video, posted on 27 November, the hospital said the nurse had ""displayed cavalier disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic"".
In a statement released on Facebook, it added: ""We want to thank those of you who brought this to our attention and assure you that we are taking this very seriously. We also want to assure you that this one careless statement does not reflect the position of Salem Health or the hardworking and dedicated caregivers who work here.""
Initially identified in news reports only by her TikTok handle, she has since been named by hospital officials as Ashley Grames, who works in the oncology department at Salem Health.
Ms Grames has deleted the video, her TikTok profile and her Facebook account.
In the video, she is seen wearing hospital scrubs and a stethoscope around her neck, standing in what appears to be her workplace break room.
She lip-syncs to a scene from the movie How the Grinch Stole Christmas, in which the Grinch reveals his true identity.
A caption overlaid on her video reads: ""When my co-workers find out I still travel, don't wear a mask when I'm out and let my kids have play dates.""
The video sparked a swift backlash, prompting Ms Grames to take down the post, but a re-shared version of the original video with comment from another user - known as a ""duet"" on the platform - has amassed over one million views.
Hundreds of people took to the hospital's Facebook page to report the employee.
Hospital officials said the investigation into her conduct was aimed at protecting staff members and patients she may have come into contact with.
In addition, Oregon has experienced a surge of the virus over the past few weeks, setting records in daily caseloads and hospital admissions.
Several public figures have been castigated in recent weeks for their failure to observe pandemic restrictions. This week, British popstar Rita Ora apologised after she broke Covid rules in London to celebrate her birthday."
"Climate breakdown and the mass felling of trees has made the world’s forests significantly shorter and younger overall, an analysis shows.  The trend is expected to continue, scientists say, with worrying consequences for the ability of forests to store carbon and mitigate the climate emergency and for the endangered wildlife that depends on rich, ancient forests.   The analysis of more than 150 previous studies found the death rate of trees has increased, doubling in North America and significantly increasing in the Amazon, for example. The impact of forest destruction had cut the area of old growth forest by a third since 1900, the researchers said. But rising temperatures caused by global heating also cuts growth and increases tree deaths by limiting photosynthesis and causing stress. Furthermore, high temperatures, drought, high storm winds and pests and disease affect older trees more and are all on the rise. Tom Pugh, a scientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, said: “Our study reviews mounting evidence that climate change is accelerating tree mortality, increasingly pushing the world’s forests towards being both younger and shorter.  “They have been getting smaller and younger over the last century, primarily because of the effects of human land use change, and disturbances like wildfires and insect outbreaks and droughts. These are things that are increasing in frequency and severity.” There were exceptions, Pugh said, such as forests in high latitudes: “But in a world that’s generally hotter, more of the world will be covered by forests that are generally shorter.” “Over the last hundred years we have lost a lot of old forests,” said Nate McDowell, at the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, who led the analysis. “They’ve been replaced in part by non-forests and in part by young forests. This has consequences on biodiversity, climate mitigation, and forestry.” The research, published in the journal Science and including analysis of satellite data on land-use change, estimated that human felling of trees had cut total forest area by 12% since 1900. The proportion of old growth forest, more than 140 years old, fell from 89% to 66% in that time. Lack of data meant the researchers were not able to make a precise estimate of how much shorter the forests had become. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could increase tree growth but the researchers said this appeared to happen only in younger forests with abundant nutrients and water. However, most forests have limited nutrients and water, which drastically reduces the carbon dioxide benefits to trees. Pugh said the vast majority of forests in the UK and Europe were examples of unnaturally short and young woodlands. “They are not of the stature that many of those forests would have been before humans fundamentally changed them by harvesting at regular intervals and planting new species, in some cases monoculture,” he said. Prof Tom Crowther, at ETH Zurich University in Switzerland and not part of the analysis team, said the study was extremely important: “For a long time, scientists have predicted that elevated CO2 and warming will increase carbon storage in forests that will help to offset climate change. But this study adds to a growing concern that these factors, along with human disturbance, may in fact be decreasing the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems. “But it also suggests that, if we can protect the forests that we already have, and allow them to grow to maturity, there is a huge potential for them to capture a lot of additional carbon,” he said. Prof Simon Lewis at University College London said: “Because old-growth forest is being lost, then on average, across the globe, forests are getting shorter and younger. Yet, counter to this, and what the researchers don’t highlight is that within many old-growth forests the opposite is happening. “The world’s intact tropical and boreal forests are both globally important as carbon sinks, and are getting larger. The world’s forests currently slow climate change, and while future mortality trends could reverse this, the ideas in the new report don’t change what the world needs to do: stabilise the climate by quickly driving fossil fuel emissions to zero and protect the world’s forests.” Pugh said the analysis of changing conditions across the world also had implications for protecting forests. “When you’re thinking in conservation terms, it can be quite poignant,” he said. “You might be trying to preserve a [forest] ecosystem that fundamentally cannot continue to exist in the way that it has existed over the past.”"
"WASHINGTON  —   Margaret Thatcher famously declared that “we must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend. ” In a speech 32 years ago, Mrs. Thatcher, the British prime minister facing a threat from the Irish Republican Army, said she was not calling for censorship but proposing that “a voluntary code of conduct” for journalists might keep them from aiding “the terrorists’ morale or their cause. ” It was a   statement of a familiar point, one made repeatedly in the decades since: that the news media plays a crucial role in amplifying the effect of terrorist violence and giving it exactly the political import the terrorists crave. So for some experts who study terrorism, President Trump’s assertion this week that the news media has actually been ignoring and covering up terrorist attacks came as a surprise. “It’s totally astonishing,” said Martha Crenshaw, a Stanford scholar who has written on terrorism since the 1970s. “It has no basis in fact whatsoever. The criticism has always gone the other way. ” Other experts said Mr. Trump’s claim had less to do with the facts about terrorism coverage than with the new administration’s political goals, notably defending his executive order that temporarily bans refugees and visitors from some Muslim countries. In the face of the onslaught of legal challenges and outspoken opposition to the order, they said, the president has an interest in persuading Americans that the terrorist threat from abroad is worse than the news media has revealed. Years of books and articles critiquing the “symbiosis” of terrorism and news media coverage have pointed out that terrorists usually seek to promote a political or ideological cause and use spectacular violence with the specific goal of attracting attention. News executives, while sometimes expressing mixed feelings about giving terrorists what they seek, have generally felt obligated to give such attacks ample coverage. “It’s incredible to say that the media does not give enough attention to terrorism,” said David C. Rapoport, a retired U. C. L. A. political science professor considered a founder of terrorism studies. He said modern global terrorism arose in the 1880s in Russia in parallel with, and partly owing to, the rise of mass daily newspapers. In the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, even failed terrorist plots often have drawn saturation coverage  —   think of the fizzled   underwear bomb on a   airliner on Christmas Day 2009 or the S. U. V.   to blow up that produced only smoke in Times Square on a May night in 2010. Though no target was harmed, both attempts drew mountains of coverage, much of it focused on how terrorists went undetected. But in an appearance Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Trump reviewed the horrors of more recent attacks, including those inspired or directed by the Islamic State, and pronounced the coverage inadequate. “Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on   as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino,” he said at the headquarters of Central Command, which carries out military operations in the Middle East. “All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that. ” The president did not explain the reasons he believed journalists might have for not reporting Islamist terrorism. But in response to a wave of skeptical comment, the White House on Monday night released a list of 78 attacks around the world since September 2014. “Most have not received the media attention they deserved,” the accompanying statement said. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, stood by the point on Tuesday, though adjusting the language. “It’s becoming too often that we’re seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve,” he said. “And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country. ” It was a subjective judgment only a dozen of the 78 listed attacks occurred in the United States, and most resulted in few or no deaths, reducing their prominence in American news reports. The list omitted terrorist attacks by   including white supremacists like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine   at a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015. But news databases show virtually all 78 attacks got some coverage, and the big attacks in Paris Brussels Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. played out for days or weeks on cable television and news sites. Peter D. Feaver, a political scientist at Duke who studies public opinion on national security issues, said he saw no basis for the White House claims. “I don’t think there’s evidence of the press underreporting terrorism,” he said. “The corporate incentives run the other way. ” But Mr. Feaver, who served in the George W. Bush White House but publicly opposed Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, said the president’s remarks, if not literally true, nonetheless play out in a larger, partisan debate about terrorism. Democrats sometimes accused the Bush administration of exaggerating the terrorist threat. Republicans often charged President Barack Obama of minimizing the danger and embellishing his own successes against Al Qaeda. By suggesting that the news media is hiding the truth about the menace from “radical Islamic terrorists,” Mr. Trump may rally his base behind the executive order and other measures still to come. Mr. Spicer suggested as much, saying the executive order and the president’s remarks in Tampa have the same motive: “because he cares about making sure that we don’t have attacks in this country, that we’re protected. ” Mr. Trump wants Americans, he said, to “understand the unwavering commitment that the president has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe. ” Preventing terrorist attacks is, of course, a goal that is pretty much universally shared. But Mr. Trump’s loose relationship with facts, and his eagerness to fault journalists and judges, make some think he has a less lofty goal as well: to find scapegoats for terrorist attacks that sooner or later are certain to happen. “  blame,” said Ms. Crenshaw, the Stanford terrorism researcher. “Nothing’s happened. But if something does happen, he can blame the judiciary and the news media. ”"
"PARIS  —   Former President Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered by a judge to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012   campaign, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday, the latest impediment for a politician who not long ago was hoping for a comeback. Mr. Sarkozy, 62, a mercurial   politician who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer said he would appeal the decision, after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling. Mr. Sarkozy, who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3, 750 euros, or about $4, 000, is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates, and he no longer leads the   Republican Party. His diminished role in French politics would limit the fallout from a trial, but the judge’s decision comes amid growing anger against the political establishment and reflects increased scrutiny of its financial and personal arrangements. Mr. Sarkozy would be the second French president since 1958 to go on trial for a financial scandal. Jacques Chirac, who was president from 1995 to 2007, was given a suspended sentence in 2011 after being convicted of embezzlement and misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris. More recently, Christine Lagarde, a former economy minister for Mr. Sarkozy who went on to head the International Monetary Fund, was convicted in December of negligence for misusing public funds, but the court did not impose a fine or a sentence. François Fillon, Mr. Sarkozy’s former prime minister and the Republican presidential candidate, is bearing the brunt of the current outrage after revelations that he used taxpayer money to pay family members for parliamentary work that might not have been genuine. In Mr. Sarkozy’s case, the prosecution asserts that he knowingly authorized his 2012 campaign to surpass the strict spending limits set by French law. At the time, the limit for presidential campaigns was about $18. 6 million per candidate in the first round of the elections, and about $5 million on top of that in the second round for the two top   who included Mr. Sarkozy. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $45 million, nearly twice the limit, and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants. The case against Mr. Sarkozy is part of what is known as the Bygmalion affair, named for the public relations company suspected of issuing false invoices to Mr. Sarkozy’s party in 2012 for events that were actually for his presidential campaign. The prosecution asserts that the goal of the fraud was to hide the overspending by Mr. Sarkozy’s campaign from the electoral authorities. Mr. Sarkozy has repeatedly denied being aware of any false billing, and the prosecutors have not charged him with wrongdoing in that regard. Instead, the charges of illegal campaign financing relate only to the overspending, for which he has already paid a fine. Thirteen other people  —   including former party officials, aides close to Mr. Sarkozy and former executives at Bygmalion  —   were also ordered to stand trial on charges of involvement in the fraud, the prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday. Thierry Herzog, Mr. Sarkozy’s lawyer, noted in a statement that the decision was signed by only one of the two judges investigating the case, a potential sign of uncertainty about the evidence. “The clear disagreement between the two magistrates in charge of the matter is such a rare event that it is worth underlining,” he said, “as it illustrates the inanity of the decision. ” Mr. Sarkozy tried a political comeback last year, steering his presidential primary campaign rightward and hoping that the French electorate would look past his legal entanglements. But he was knocked out of   presidential primaries in November. Mr. Fillon was recently embroiled in legal problems of his own, after revelations in the French news media that he used taxpayer money to put his wife and children on the payroll, ostensibly as parliamentary aides. The revelations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician, who, unlike his opponents  —   Mr. Sarkozy primarily  —   was untainted by legal scandals. “There is no point in talking about authority when you are not yourself irreproachable,” Mr. Fillon said in August during the primary campaign. “Who can imagine for a single moment General de Gaulle placed under formal investigation?” he added, a clear swipe against Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Fillon has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in the presidential race, despite opinion polls showing that he is no longer the favorite and might not advance to the second round of the elections."
"The recent collapse of a bridge in Grinton, North Yorkshire, raises lots of questions about how prepared we are for these sorts of risks. The bridge, which was due to be on the route of the cycling world championships in September, collapsed after a month’s worth of rain fell in just four hours, causing flash flooding.  Grinton is the latest in a series of such collapses. In 2015, first Storm Eva and then Storm Frank caused flooding which collapsed the 18th century Tadcaster bridge, also in North Yorkshire, and badly damaged the medieval-era Eamont bridge in nearby Cumbria. Floods in 2009 collapsed or severely damaged 29 bridges in Cumbria alone. With climate change making this sort of intense rainfall more common in future, people are right to wonder whether we’ll see many more such bridge collapses. And if so – which bridges are most at risk? We know that bridges can collapse for various reasons. Some are simply old and already crumbling. Others fall down because of defective materials or environmental processes such as flooding, corrosion or earthquakes. Bridges have even collapsed after ships crash into them. Europe’s first major roads and bridges were built by the Romans. This infrastructure developed hugely during the industrial revolution, then much of it was rebuilt and transformed after World War II. But since then, various factors have increased the pressure on bridges and other critical structures. For instance, when many bridges were first built, traffic mostly consisted of pedestrians, animals and carts – an insignificant load for heavy-weight bridges. Yet over the decades private cars and trucks have got bigger, heavier and faster, while the sheer number of vehicles has massively increased. Engineers in many countries think that numerous bridges could have reached the end of their expected life spans (between 50-100 years). However, we do not know which bridges are most at risk. This is because there is no national database or method for identifying structures at risk. Since different types of bridges are sensitive to different failure mechanisms, having awareness of the bridge stock is the first step for an effective risk management of the assets.  In Newcastle, for example, seven bridges over the river Tyne connect the city to the town of Gateshead. These bridges vary in function (pedestrian, road and railway), material (from steel to concrete) and age (17 to 150 years old). The risk and type of failure for each bridge is therefore very different. Flooding is recognised as a major threat in the UK’s National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies. And though the Met Office’s latest set of climate projections shows an increase in average rainfall in winter and a decrease in average rainfall in summer, rainfall is naturally very variable. Flooding is caused by particularly heavy rain so it is important to look at how the extremes are changing, not just the averages.  Warmer air can hold more moisture and so it is likely that we will see increases in heavy rainfall, like the rain that caused the flash floods at Grinton. High resolution climate models and observational studies also show an intensification of extreme rainfall. This all means that bridge collapse from flooding is more likely in the future. To reduce future disasters, we need an overview of our infrastructure, including assessments of change of use, ageing and climate change. A national bridge database would enable scientists and engineers to identify and compare risks to bridges across the country, on the basis of threats from climate change.

Earlier this month, I detailed at some length why claims about the purported economic harms of piracy, offered by supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT-IP Act (PIPA), ought to be treated with much more skepticism than they generally get from journalists and policymakers.



My own view is that this ought to be rather secondary to the policy discussion: SOPA and PIPA would be ineffective mechanisms for addressing the problem, and a terrible idea for many other reasons, even if the numbers were exactly right. No matter how bad last season’s crops were, witch burnings are a poor policy response. Fortunately, legislators finally seem to be cottoning on to this: SOPA now appears to be on ice for the time being, and PIPA’s own sponsors are having second thoughts about mucking with the Internet’s Domain Name System. 



That said, I remain a bit amazed that it’s become an indisputable premise in Washington that there’s an enormous piracy problem, that it’s having a devastating impact on US content industries, and that _some_ kind of aggressive new legislation is needed _tout suite_ to stanch the bleeding. Despite the fact that the Government Accountability Office recently concluded that it is “difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the net effect of counterfeiting and piracy on the economy as a whole,” our legislative class has somehow determined that—among all the dire challenges now facing the United States— _this_ is an urgent priority. Obviously, there’s quite a lot of copyrighted material circulating on the Internet without authorization, and other things equal, one would like to see less of it.



But does the best available evidence show that this is inflicting such catastrophic economic harm—that it is depressing so much output, and destroying so many jobs—that Congress has no option but to Do Something immediately? Bearing the GAO’s warning in mind, the data we _do_ have doesn’t remotely seem to justify the DEFCON One rhetoric that now appears to be obligatory on the Hill.



The International Intellectual Property Alliance—a kind of meta‐​trade association for all the content industries, and a zealous prophet of the piracy apocalypse, released a report back in November meant to establish that copyright industries are so economically valuable that they merit more vigorous government protection. But it actually paints a picture of industries that, far from being “killed” by piracy, are _already_ weathering a harsh economic climate better than most, and have far outperformed the overall US economy through the current recession. The “core copyright industries” have, unsurprisingly, shed some jobs over the past few years, but again, compared with the rest of the economy, employment seems to have held relatively stable at a time when you might expect cash‐​strapped consumers to be turning to piracy to save money.



 **Decreasing creative output?**



Since the core function of copyright is to incentivize the production of creative works, it’s also worth looking for signs of declining output associated with filesharing. Empirically, it’s surprisingly hard to find an effect. Rather, a recent survey study by Felix Oberholzer‐​Gee of the Harvard Business School concluded that “data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers” from producing more works, at least in the US market.



So, for instance, Nielsen SoundScan data shows new album releases stood at 35,516 in 2000, peaked at 106,000 in 2008, and (amidst a general recession) fell back to mid‐​decade levels of about 75,000 for 2010. That’s against a general background of falling sales since 2004—mostly explained by factors unrelated to piracy—which finally seems to have reversed in 2011. The actual picture is probably somewhat better than that, because SoundScan data is markedly incomplete when it comes to the releases by indie artists who have benefited most from the rise of digital distribution.



If we look at movies, the numbers compiled by the industry statistics site Box Office Mojo show an average of 558 releases from American studios over the past decade, which rises to 578 if you focus on just the past five years. The average for the _previous_ decade—before illicit movie downloads were even an option on most people’s radar—is 472 releases per year. (As we learn from a recent Congressional Research Service report, it’s weirdly hard to detect a strong overall correlation between output and employment in the motion picture industry, which actually fell slightly from 1998 to 2008, even as profits and CEO pay soared. One reason is the growing trend in recent decades for “Hollywood” features to actually be produced in Canada or Australia.)



That’s all very nice, one might object, but wouldn’t these heartening numbers be _even higher_ if labels and studios could recapture some of the revenue lost to illicit downloads? Well, they surely _might_ —but it’s not nearly as clear as you’d think.



One reason is that they already _are_ recapturing much of that revenue through “complementary” purchases. As Oberholzer‐​Gee observes, recording industry numbers show large increases in concert revenues corresponding to the drop in recorded music sales. That suggests that, as people discover new artists by sampling downloaded albums online, they’re shifting consumption _within_ the sector to live performances. In other words, people have a roughly constant “music budget,” and what they don’t spend on the albums they’ve downloaded gets spent on seeing that new band they discovered. For the firms that specifically make their money from the sale of recordings, that may seem like cold comfort, but if we’re concerned with the _music_ industry as a whole, it’s a wash. Something similar might occur with respect to purchases of merchandise based on licensed film properties.



Another factor is that, notwithstanding projections of a “long tail” effect resulting from lower search and distribution costs in the digital era, most entertainment industries continue to operate on a “tournament” or “lottery” model, where a few hits generate jackpot revenues, sufficient to make up for losses on the majority of new products. Unsurprisingly, the most heavily pirated movies each year tend to be the ones that are also highly successful at the box office and in DVD sales, with similar patterns in album downloads. In other words, bleeding revenue to piracy is going to be a problem to the extent that your product is a hit, in a market where the core uncertainty about this crucial fact (at the time when the decision whether to greenlight production is made) looms a lot larger than the marginal loss from illicit downloads if you _are_ successful.



It’s a tricky but more or less tractable problem to estimate roughly how many full‐​time jobs you’ll need regionally to support one additional $150 million movie production next year. It’s a totally different question how aggregate sectoral employment in a volatile and evolving industry changes based on investor responses to a $150 million across‐​the‐​board drop in the size of the total film jackpot, especially given that arcane financial arrangements are one place Hollywood does show a genius for constantly adapting its business model. If you want to know how many people are getting laid off when McDonald’s revenues drop, it makes a difference whether it’s each of 13,000 franchises earning $100 less per year, or one franchise earning $1.3 million less, even though the total reduction is the same.



Finally, _more demand for content_ being captured by the content industries is not always the same thing as _demand for more content_ , in the sense of “a greater variety of output.” I noted earlier that the past few years have seen a significant spike in the number of movie titles released annually. But as the _Los Angeles Times_ reported in 2008, studio executives soon began complaining about a “glut” of new movies, many of which were targeted at the same demographics, and therefore cannibalizing their own audiences. As one executive suggested, that meant that (at least in a market dominated by a few huge distributors) releasing _fewer_ titles could yield higher profits—and, indeed, the number of titles released in the following two years dropped back to mid‐​decade levels.



The key point here is that shifting some portion of the pirate audience to some form of legal viewing doesn’t necessarily change this basic calculus, because there’s an upper bound to the number of hours most people are going to spend watching (say) racing movies, whether they’re paying for the privilege or not. Rising demand can just as easily, for instance, bid up star salaries for a fixed number of films.



 **Still seeking a real, quantifiable link**



The point here isn’t that piracy by American consumers is somehow completely independent from output or employment rates in the content industries—though, again, that’s not at all the same thing as the _overall US employment rate_. Obviously, at _some_ level it has to have some effect. But the link is, to use the technical economic term, _weirder_ than in many other sectors of the economy. In many industries, the relationship between consumer spending and job creation is _relatively_ straightforward. If demand for widgets or restaurant meals rises, satisfying that demand requires a roughly linear increase in widget factories and restaurants, in hiring of widget‐​makers and cooks and waiters, and in purchases of the raw material inputs for those goods. Distribution of copyrighted content—and in particular digital distribution over the Internet—is a bit more complicated, for precisely the same reason piracy is an issue: once the first copy of a work has been created, an unlimited number of additional units (of the digital product) can be produced at effectively zero cost.



Let’s imagine, implausibly, that a measure like SOPA _did_ manage to reduce online piracy by US consumers by some meaningful amount. A small portion of that reduction, the minority of downloads representing legal purchases displaced by file sharing, would translate into sales for the content industries. What form would these take? It seems reasonable to suppose that the majority of people who were previously getting their music and movies from The Pirate Bay are not typically lining up to buy shiny plastic discs at Wal‐​Mart. Rather, they’re probably disproportionately displacing _legal digital downloads_ from venues like iTunes and Amazon, or subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, which are pretty clearly where the overall market is quickly going anyway. (Apparently, literal thieves don’t even bother stealing physical media anymore.) For movies, there’s probably also some displacement of theatrical ticket sales, though as the theatrical experience is in many ways a distinct good, it’s hard to say how much substitution it’s reasonable to expect.



In the very short term, increased legal purchases of digital content wouldn’t seem likely to generate many additional jobs. If spending in the physical retail sector jumps 20 percent, shops need to hire more clerks, and their suppliers more manufacturing workers, to meet the increased demand. If spending in the iTunes store jumps 20 percent, Apple probably needs to pay a few bucks more for bandwidth and electricity, but basically everyone just gets to smile and pocket the extra profit. The jobs effects estimates we’re seeing tossed around, however, are coming from a 2007 study that would have had to employ, at the most recent, adjustments made several years before _that_ to the benchmark multipliers the Bureau of Economic Analysis developed in 2002.



Even leaving aside its many other problems, then, the job impact estimates in that study would have been largely based on legacy assumptions from a brick‐​and‐​mortar economy. (The loss estimates relied on would also, necessarily, fail to account for the recent rise of popular, legal streaming services that have likely lured many consumers back from the pirate market. There is, alas, no very good data here, but I’d wager Hulu and Netflix have done exponentially more to reduce piracy losses than enforcement crackdowns ever will.) In any event, you’d expect the most _immediate_ effect of consumer spending shifts from widgets and restaurants to digital downloads would be, if anything, fewer _net_ jobs. The output and employment effects, rather, would show up in the longer term as lower returns reduce incentives to produce new content—and hire the workers needed to support that production. For some of the reasons discussed above, though, empirically there’s just not much evidence for a dramatic effect of this kind.



No doubt piracy is costing the content industries _something_ —or they wouldn’t be throwing so much money at Congress in support of this kind of legislation. If we could wave a magic wand and have less piracy, obviously that would be good. But in the real world, where enforcement has direct costs to the taxpayer, regulation has costs on the industries it burdens, and the reduction in piracy they’re likely to produce is very small, it seems important to point out that the credible evidence for the _magnitude_ of the harm is fairly thin.



As a rough analogy, since anti‐​piracy crusaders are fond of equating filesharing with shoplifting: suppose the CEO of Wal‐​Mart came to Congress demanding a $50 million program to deploy FBI agents to frisk suspicious‐​looking teens in towns near Wal‐​Marts. A lawmaker might, without for one instant doubting that shoplifting is a bad thing, question whether this is really the optimal use of federal law enforcement resources. The CEO indignantly points out that shoplifting _kills one million adorable towheaded orphans_ each year. The proof is right here in this study by the Wal‐​Mart Institute for Anti‐​Shoplifting Studies. The study sources this dramatic claim to a newspaper article, which quotes the CEO of Wal‐​Mart asserting (on the basis of private data you can’t see) that shoplifting kills hundreds of orphans annually. And as a footnote explains, it seemed prudent to round up to a million. I wish this were _just_ a joke, but as readers of my previous post will recognize, that’s literally about the level of evidence we’re dealing with here.



In short, piracy is certainly one problem in a world filled with problems. But politicians and journalists seem to have been persuaded to take it largely on faith that it’s a uniquely dire and pressing problem that demands dramatic remedies with little time for deliberation. On the data available so far, though, reports of the death of the industry seem much exaggerated.

"The past 18 years has been a period of significant disengagement and disinterest by the community in Australian political affairs. The political shenanigans described in Malcolm Turnbull’s recent book A Bigger Picture ought to be a wake-up call that as our political leaders have jostled for the right to exercise power from the PM’s office, time has been a’wasting in finding appropriate solutions for the challenges Australia must face over the next three decades. It is time for us to hold our governments to account for the quality of their governance. Until the end of last year, we had blindly turned away from doing anything to address many of the challenges that have been laid out by science and respected commentators. Bigots in our media and parliaments have held sway and prevented much from being done. The result has been a lack of preparation to deal with the serious issues we confront.  This lack of preparedness concerns me. I spent more than 40 years in the defence force watching for events that could present challenges to our national security. Successes under my leadership were made possible by preparedness and a federal government that listened carefully and acted appropriately. With the shock of the bushfires and fire storms of the last summer followed by floods and now with the global Covid-19 pandemic Australians have experienced first-hand the manifestation of a significant lack of preparedness fostered by the absence of strong, principled and effective leadership. The impact of these shocks will have a lasting impact on our economy, our society, and our wellbeing. The current pandemic is a wake-up call for what needs to be done to counter predictable and potentially existential threats from global warming, and their impact on the climate and other systems critical to human life on the planet. Early in April the Economist Intelligence Unit reported an expected global economic contraction of 2.5% this year as a result of the pandemic. This huge downturn in the global economy has taken place in just a few weeks. Its effects will be felt for a long time. But it is not uniformly distributed around the globe. Significant economies such as the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and even Australia have been in lockdown and are slowly moving out of it. We are not certain where the future lies. Yet, there are a few better prepared economies such as Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong that have dealt with the pandemic much better. It is ironic that Taiwan, the world leader on pandemic management is not included as a full member in the World Health Organization! We have heard also about the “unexpected” nature of this downturn. It has been labelled as a black swan event. According to Nassim Taleb a black swan event flows from the extreme impact of rare and unpredictable outlier events – and the human tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events, retrospectively. For those in the science community looking at global warming and its consequences since the early 1990s, climate change and related health issues have been predicted. It’s just that very little has been done to prepare for them, even though there have been many scenario games and simulations held in our government bureaucracies and some businesses to stress test our capabilities. Some of those scenarios have looked like the ones we are going through now. Last week I obtained an unclassified copy of a mobilisation review prepared for the senior leadership in defence. It was completed in June 2019. I knew work on mobilisation was being done in defence. In 2012 I was the facilitator of a closed workshop of international and national experts who examined nuclear issues, mass migrations, Pacific relocation, Southern Ocean disaster, extreme weather, pandemic and Southern Ocean eco-tourism. A report of this workshop is included in the mobilisation review.  The broad findings of the review are: The geo-strategic environment is more uncertain than it has been for many decades. Defence needs to have confidence that its planning arrangements are appropriate for the contemporary context. While considerable defence mobilisation has occurred at lower levels since the 1998 lead up to operation Interfet there has been limited consideration of formal planning for large-scale, (including national) mobilisation since the Vietnam era or the need to mobilise in less traditional ways.  Despite an extended period of ADF operations since the late 1990s the mobilisation impact on the Australian economy and population has been limited to a narrow element of defence industry and some employers of defence reserves. In the detail of the review there is much food for thought. For example, in the global engagement workshop we considered the drastic measures needed to deal with the consequences of a pandemic. Prescient as it was, this review stated in 2019 that “the World Health Organization (WHO) expects a significant pandemic to emanate from Asia in the next 10 years” and noted that a “key area of concern is the availability of pharmaceutical supplies” because 90% of all Australian supplies are imported. But given our current experience it is clear that going through the review in the context of preparedness would begin to reveal the extent of work needed to overcome weaknesses and the vulnerabilities exposed by it, not just by the defence department, but by a whole-of-government look. This action would represent only a start. We cannot afford to go on as unprepared as we have been over the past 18 years. It is time Australian governments started to take notice of experts and listened to the people. Australia’s geo-strategic future is very uncertain. Our national character and will are likely to be challenged in many new ways. The bushfires and fire storms of last summer were met with an unacceptable lack of preparedness, despite several rural fire chiefs having tried to get the federal government to hear their well-founded concerns in April 2019. The warning about cyber security vulnerabilities set out in the review must also be taken seriously, especially in the context of unconventional cyber warfare and the potential for negative effects on social cohesion. As well as improving national security domestically we should also consider the limits on Australia’s ability to shape the kind of world we would like. By 2050 we will be about 40 million people living with neighbours numbering 3.5 billion. Nearest to us, Indonesia will have a population of about 330 million, and PNG about 14 million people, although there are in-country predictions of about 30 million in PNG – more people than in Australia today. We can only guess at how the contest between the major powers such as China, India and the United States will impinge on us and the decisions we will need to make. We have an opportunity now to set right the ship of state by being highly analytical, ruthless in our judgement and focused always on better outcomes for the future. It will be a pity if our current circumstances fritter away Australia’s standing in the region. We have much to offer, but we desperately need to start turning our minds to what the next 30 years should look like. This is where the mobilisation review and documents like it present a good place to start, if only they could see the light of day. • Chris Barrie is a former Australian defence force chief.

"Beachcombing has long been a part of life for island communities. On the southwestern edge of Scarp, a small, treeless island off the coast of Harris in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides, the Mol Mòr (“big beach”) was where locals went to collect driftwood for repairing buildings and making furniture and coffins. Today there is still much driftwood, but as much or more plastic.  Scarp was abandoned in 1972. The island is now used only in summer by owners of a small number of holiday homes. But across Harris and the Hebrides, people continue to make practical and decorative use of beachcombed plastic items. Many homes will have a few buoys and trawler floats hanging on fences and gateposts. Black plastic PVC pipe, in plentiful supply from fish farms wrecked by storms, is often used for footpath drainage or filled with concrete and used as fence posts. Larger pipe can be split lengthways to make feeder troughs for the famously hardy highland cattle.  Rope and netting are used as windbreaks or to prevent ground erosion. Many islanders use fish boxes – large plastic crates washed ashore - for storage. And there is a small craft industry that repurposes found objects as tourist souvenirs, turning plastic tat into anything from bird feeders to buttons. But this beachcombing, recycling and re-use of larger plastic items does not even scratch the surface of the problem. The smaller fragments of plastic that are harder to collect are more likely to enter the food chain, or be drawn back into the sea. Storms cutting away at riverbanks often reveal an alarming plastic geology, with layers of plastic fragments in the soil several feet below the surface. Reports indicating the scale of plastic pollution of the world’s oceans have become widespread in the past ten years, with the final episode of the BBC’s Blue Planet II in 2017 with David Attenborough marking a high-water point of recognition of the problem. Estimates of the amount of plastic entering the oceans each year range from 8m tonnes to 12m tonnes, although there is no way of accurately measuring this.  It is not a new problem: one of the islanders who has spent 35 years holidaying on Scarp said that the variety of objects found on Mol Mòr had diminished since New York City stopped dumping rubbish at sea in 1994. But a reduction in diversity has been more than matched by an increase in quantity: the BBC Radio 4 programme Costing the Earth reported in 2010 that plastic litter on beaches had doubled since 1994. Growing awareness of ocean plastic has prompted local efforts to keep beaches clean. But the amount of discards collected poses the question of what to do with it. Ocean plastic photo-degenerates with long exposure to sunlight, sometimes making it difficult to identify, and difficult to recycle as it is contaminated with salt and often with sea life growing on its surface. Some recycling methods can be successful only with a maximum ratio of 10% ocean plastic to 90% plastic from domestic sources. Local groups sometimes work together to collect large amounts of plastic from the beaches, but for local authorities the challenge is how to deal with a problematic material that is hard or impossible to recycle. The alternative is landfill with an £80 per tonne fee. Lecturer and jewellery-maker Kathy Vones and I examined the potential to re-use ocean plastic as the raw material for 3D printers, known as filament. For example, polypropylene (PP) can be easily ground down and shaped, but has to be mixed 50:50 with polylactide (PLA) to maintain the consistency the printer requires. Mixing types of plastics like this is a step backwards, in the sense that they become more difficult to recycle, but as an investigation into new potential uses for the material, what we’ve learned might allow us to take two steps forward in the future. Other ocean plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethelene (HDPE) are also suitable. Another approach I looked at was to melt polypropylene rope over a bonfire and use it in an improvised injection moulding machine. But this technique had problems with accurately maintaining the correct temperature, and toxic fumes. The Dutch inventor Boyan Slat’s Ocean Clean Up project has been much more ambitious, aiming to retrieve 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years with a large net suspended from an inflatable boom that draws catches the plastic and draws it into a collection platform. However, the project has run into difficulties, and will in any case collect only larger fragments at the surface. It is estimated that the majority of ocean plastic is particles less than 1mm in size suspended in the water column, with yet more plastic sinking to the ocean floor.  These will require fresh solutions. Removing the vast quantities of plastic in the environment is a vexing problem that will be with us for centuries. We need conscientious joint efforts from politicians and industry and fresh ideas – all of which are currently lacking."

The world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non‐​Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.



Religious persecution is a global scourge. Many of the worst oppressors are Muslim nations. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Bahrain, Iraq and Egypt are all important international actors. All also mistreat, or acquiesce in the mistreatment of, anyone not a Muslim. A few of them even victimize Muslims — of the wrong variety.



Islamabad is another frequent offender. The State Department’s report on religious liberty in Pakistan noted that “The constitution and other laws and policies officially restrict religious freedom and, in practice, the government enforced many of these restrictions. The government’s respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom continued to be poor.”



Minority faiths face violent attack. Believers are killed, churches are bombed, buses are attacked, homes are destroyed, social gatherings are targeted. Warned the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in its recent report: “In the past year, conditions hit an all‐​time low due to chronic sectarian violence targeting mostly Shia Muslims but also Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus.” Last year the Commission cited a spike in violence against Shiites as well as “numerous attacks against innocent Pakistanis” of other religions.





Blasphemy laws threaten basic individual liberties around the globe.



Although Islamabad did not launch these assaults, it did little to prevent or redress them. Even when scores or more are killed at a time there often is no response. Indeed, top government officials have been gunned down for defending freedom of conscience with no one arrested, let alone convicted. Explained State: “The government’s limited capacity and will to investigate or prosecute the perpetrators of increasing extremist attacks against religious minorities and on members of the Muslim majority promoting tolerance, allowed the climate of impunity to continue.”



The most common tool of persecution may be a charge of blasphemy. Said USCIRF: “The country’s blasphemy laws, used predominantly in Punjab province, but also nationwide, target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and frequently result in imprisonment.” Two years ago a mentally handicapped 12‐​year‐​old Christian girl was charged; after an international outcry even the authorities became embarrassed and the case was dismissed, an unusual outcome.



The blasphemy laws are made for abuse. Explained the Commission, “The so‐​called crime carries the death penalty or life in prison, does not require proof of intent or evidence to be presented after allegations are made, and does not include penalties for false allegations.” In fact, courts hesitate to even hear evidence, lest doing so also be considered blasphemy. With evidence unnecessary, the charge has become a weapon routinely used in personal and business disputes, including a means to exact revenge for imagined offenses.



Between 1986 and 2006 695 people were charged with blasphemy. Today 16 people are on death row and another 20 are serving life sentences. Three Christians have been sentenced to death in the last few months. Many other Pakistanis are in prison waiting for trial, including English professor Junaid Hafeez, accused of blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. Penalties are not limited to the law. Explained the group Freedom House: “Regardless of the motives behind their charges and the outcome of their cases, those accused of blasphemy are subject to job discrimination, ostracism from their communities and neighborhoods, and even physical violence and murder at the hands of angry mobs, forcing many to live in fear.” Since 1990 at least 52 people charged with blasphemy have been killed before reaching trial.



Judges who acquitted defendants and politicians who talked of reforming the blasphemy laws also have been assassinated. In May gunmen killed Rashid Rehman, a human rights lawyer who was defending Hafeez. Previously fellow attorneys threatened Rehman, “You will not come to court next time because you will not exist any more.” A pamphlet circulated after the murder asserting that Rehman met his “rightful end.” He was the first defense lawyer killed. He probably won’t be the last.



Pakistan has jailed more people for blasphemy than any other nation, but it is not the only country which religious free speech. An incredible 14 of 20 countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa criminalize blasphemy. Nine of 50 in the Asia Pacific, seven of 45 in Europe and three of 48 in SubSaharan Africa also do so. Eleven of 35 nations in the Americas have blasphemy laws. In the U.S. several states, including Massachusetts and Michigan, retain blasphemy laws, though they do not enforce them.



The group Freedom House published a detailed report on the detrimental impact of blasphemy laws on human rights. Put simply, these measures “impose undue restrictions on freedom of expression” and are “prone to arbitrary or overly broad application, particularly in settings where there are no checks and balances in place to prevent abuses.” Freedom House highlighted Algeria, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Malaysia and Poland, as well as Pakistan.



In March the Commission made much the same point, issuing a special report entitled “Prisoners of Belief: Individuals Jailed Under Blasphemy Laws.” Victims include three atheist bloggers in Bangladesh, numerous Iranian Bahai’s, Christians and Sufi and Sunni Muslims, 63 Sunnis and Christians in Egypt, an atheist writer in Kazakhstan, scores of Indonesians and a Saudi blogger. Even Greece and Turkey have charged people with blasphemy.



The Arab Spring was supposed to bring liberty to the Mideast, but it had the opposite effect in many countries. For instance, in Kuwait, perhaps the most liberal Gulf State, the Islamist‐​dominated Assembly elected in early 2012 voted to impose the death penalty on Muslims convicted of blasphemy. The Emir blocked the law and later changed the election rules, resulting in a more moderate legislature.



Blasphemy prosecutions were initiated in post‐​revolution Egypt and even Tunisia, viewed as the most successful participant in the Arab Spring. USCIRF commissioners Zuhdi Jasser and Katrina Lantos Swett wrote: “Rather than giving rise to greater individual liberty, this trend could turn the Arab Spring into a repressive winter, with forces of intolerance and tyranny dashing hopes for genuine freedom and liberal democracy.”



Nevertheless, Pakistan remains a particular problem. The country’s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, emphasized the importance of religious liberty. But Pakistan became more Islamic over time, a process accelerated by dictator Mohammed Zia ul‐​Haq. His government not only criminalized blasphemy, but, noted Freedom House, enacted new laws which imposed “harsh Shari’a punishments for extramarital sex, theft and violations of the prohibition of alcohol.”



The impact of such laws fell most heavily on religious minorities and liberals. Discrimination, intolerance and violence have become pervasive. Noted Freedom House: “it is clear that Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are used politically and applied disproportionately to non‐​Muslims. Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” Intolerance has become the norm — in a strategically placed nation possessing nuclear weapons.



Unfortunately, there are spillover impacts from abusive blasphemy prosecutions. Warned Freedom House, in practice the blasphemy laws have led to “extended arbitrary detention.” The process also has undermined even limited due process, with convictions rendered on minimal to nonexistent evidence. Along the way defendants have suffered from official torture and private vigilante injustice.



Blasphemy laws threaten basic individual liberties around the globe. The measures are bad in Western nations. They are far worse in the Muslim world. The problem is particularly severe in Pakistan. Warned Freedom House: “Pakistan’s blasphemy laws foster an environment of intolerance and impunity, and lead to violations of a broad range of human rights, including the obvious rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, as well as freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to due process and a fair trial; freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; and the right to life and security of the person.”



Obviously, there is little the U.S. can do directly about policy in Pakistan. However, the International Religious Freedom Act allows the State Department to designate countries as Countries of Particular Concern. Noted USCIRF: “Pakistan represents the worst situation in the world for religious freedom for countries not currently designated” as CPCs. Unfortunately, in its latest designation announced last month State continued to leave Islamabad off of the list. The Obama administration should remedy that lapse.



For some, religious liberty is but an afterthought, an esoteric principle with little practical impact. However, the willingness of foreign governments to respect freedom of conscience acts as the famed canary in the mine. A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected. And a society in which life and dignity of the human person is not respected is more likely to become a hothouse to ideas and beliefs hostile to America.



As we see in Pakistan today. Rising religious extremism, exemplified by abusive blasphemy prosecutions, threatens the integrity of the Pakistani state — and the security of its nuclear program. Although Americans cannot control policy in Pakistan, they can help highlight a problem that threatens people in that nation and ultimately this one as well.

By Ed Caryl
We are all aware (or should be) of the warming that took place from the 1970’s to the 1990’s. The calamitologists are firmly convinced that this rise in temperature was due to rising CO2 in the same period. The lukewarmists think it was a combination of factors that perhaps contain some warming due to CO2. Then there is another group who think it was all due to the sun or ocean cycles.
This article will compare an ocean cycle, the Atlantic Multi-decadel Oscillation (AMO), and CO2 as temperature drivers over the last 133 years, since 1880. The annual temperature data is from GISS. The plots are scatter diagrams with temperature on the vertical axis and AMO index or CO2 atmospheric concentration on the horizontal axis.

Figures 1a and b are XY plots of temperature vs. AMO (1a) and temperature vs. CO2 (1b).
The period of 1880 to 1910 was a period of cooling. Unless CO2 was driving that cooling, it seems clear that ocean cycles (or some third forcing, such as solar) were responsible.

Figures 2a and b are XY plots of temperature vs. AMO (2a) and temperature vs. CO2 (2b).
The period from 1911 to 1936 was one of warming, on a similar scale to the recent warming. The amount of CO2 increase has been thought not to be responsible for the warming, and attributed to ocean cycles. Climate sensitivity is easy to calculate from the slope of the trend lines in the temperature versus CO2 plots. Simply multiply the “x” value by the minimum CO2 concentration. If the warming in this period was totally due to CO2, the associated climate sensitivity would be 8.3°C for CO2 doubling from 300 ppm, a value that all will agree is much too large. Again, CO2 isn’t providing the warming.

Figures 3a is a plot of temperature vs AMO and 3b a polot of temperature vs CO2.

Figure 3c below is a zoom in on 1937 to 1950, the near vertical line at the left in figure 3b where CO2 actually reversed slightly for a time:

This was a period of cooling, and it is obvious that CO2 had nothing to do with it. Climate sensitivity would have been a negative 0.465°C for CO2 doubling from 310 ppm. During the cooling 1937 to 1950 period, sensitivity would have to have been an astounding negative 82°C for CO2 doubling. Again, ocean cycles or some other forcing were responsible.

Figures 4a and b are XY plots of temperature vs AMO (4a) and temperature vs. CO2 (4b).
The years from 1970 to 2000 were warming years as can be seen on both plots. Note the R2 values for both plots. Was the warming due to CO2? Or was it ocean cycles? The R2 values are voting for ocean cycles, but it isn’t definitive. Remember that Salby and myself have made cases for temperature driving CO2, and not the other way around. The slope of the CO2 trend in this period (climate sensitivity) is 3.64°C for CO2 doubling. This is the only time period where the putative climate sensitivity is reasonable, and close to the theoretical IPCC approved number.

Figures 5a and b are XY plots of temperature vs. AMO (5a) and temperature vs. CO2 (5b).
Above is the recent past; the pause period. Not much is happening. The warming is so slight, that the computed climate sensitivity is 0.33°C for CO2 doubling from 370 ppm. The R2 value for CO2 is so low that it should be clear that something else besides CO2 is in charge. The slope on this AMO plot is positive, as it has been for all of the AMO vs temperature plots, but the points are clustered tightly and the R2 value is only 0.19.
In the 133 years since 1880, all the “CO2 is causing catastrophe” furor is based on one 30 year period in that long span. The remaining 103 years, where CO2 was obviously having no effect, are ignored, …are unexplained. Is this justified? Shouldn’t some effort be made to determine what has really happened? If CO2 is the driver of warming periods, and ocean cycles are driving cooling periods, then climate sensitivity was 8.3°C in the early 20th Century, 3.64°C in the late 20th Century, and 0.33°C now. If CO2 is assumed responsible for half the warming, as the IPCC suggests, and other greenhouse gases are responsible for the rest, the numbers then are: 4.15°C for the early 20th Century, 1.82°C for the late 20th Century, and 0.165°C for the last decade. This may be another indication that climate sensitivity has hit a low limit.
The numbers for CO2 become even lower if changes in solar radiation, solar magnetic effects, cosmic rays, aerosols, volcanic sulfate, soot, dust, water vapor, and changing cloud cover are thrown into the forcing mix. The problem is lack of data. We have good data from satellites only for the last 34 years for temperature, and less than that for many of these other factors. On this paucity of data we are betting our economic future on all kinds of ill-thought out “renewable solutions” that in the long run we will regret.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s worrisome enough that the German government itself recently issued a brochure singling out, naming, and defaming German and American climate science skeptics. Today we have one of Germany’s most prestigious science associations actively backing adolescent-level attacks on skeptics who have decided not to take part in the collective climate hysteria.
This morning on Twitter I happened to come across the following tweet:

Helmholtz Center’s Climate Service Center displays its ugly ideological side in defaming skeptics as deniers. Click here to view video.
Inhofe, Morano, Michaels, Bachmann labeled “deniers”
The above tweet comes from the Climate Service Center, which provides a link to an intolerant video called “The League of Deniers“, which was produced by Kickstarter.com. In summary the video portrays skeptics as “deniers”, claims that “the public is misinformed” and that skeptics’ words are “human foolishness”.
The Climate Service Center even uses the derogatory label “Leugner” (denier) to describe the skeptics in its tweet (my emphasis):
Interesting #Kickstarter project on #climate changel deniers https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/787934767/the-league-of-deniers-jokes-from-climate-change-de …“
So why is the Climate Service Center stooping to such sophomoric behavior and what organization is behind the Climate Service Center? The answer to the first question is purely the subject of speculation. The answer to the second question is clear, if not surprising: It is Germany’s prestigious Helmholtz Center Geesthacht.
At its website we learn that the main function of the Climate Service Center is to act as the communications “connection between science on one side and business and politics on the other side“. We have to wonder what it is that the center and the Helmholtz Center wish to communicate.
Obviously some activists at the Helmholtz Center’s communications arm are sending an activist, sophomoric message these days. They seem to have no idea of the importance skepticism has in science, and why there are even climate science skeptics at all. Skeptics in science? What for!
To help them understand why there are skeptics when it comes to climate science, below are some questions that us skeptics have been waiting 15 years to receive answers.

1. Why has there been no global warming for 17 years?
2. Why have 97% of the climate models failed to foresee this?
3. Why has Antarctic sea ice been well above normal for more than 2 years?
4. Why are northern hemispheric winters getting colder?
5. What makes the present warm period any different from that of the Medieval Warm Period?
6. Why is it that CO2 has been suddenly assumed to be the major climate factor and the rest like the sun and oceans are ignored?
7. If there is consensus on man-made climate change, then why is there so much controversy over it?
8. Do you think it’s not necessary to have skeptics in order for science to progress?
Perhaps instead of wasting taxpayer resources on the sophomoric defamation and ridicule of those who legitimately ask questions, the Helmholtz Center ought to focus on providing some clear answers for the above questions for once.
In the portrait video of the Climate Service Center featuring director Guy Brasseur, he tells us that the Climate Service Center’s job is to communicate science to society for the purpose of decision-making. Again, with its tweet, what message are they really trying to communicate by linking to defamatory Kickstarter video?

Climate Service Center director Guy Brasseur says they provide valuable information to re-insurance companies. Photo cropped from portrait video.
What was set up as a valuable communication organization, the Climate Service Center appears today to have devolved into a propaganda arm of a state-sponsored ideology – especially when one looks at the quality of the climate information they disseminate: Think for a minute, for example, how the Met Office has gotten 11 of the last 12 winter forecasts wrong and that 97% of the climate models have been wrong over the last 15 years. Is this really the information quality the public wants to have communicated to them? When information is that bad, and is packaged by ideologues with an agenda, then it is certainly not helping society. Rather it is harming it.
What’s really frightening is the seemingly close relationship that the Climate Service Center keeps with the re-insurance industry, as is exposed by the portrait video. For almost an entire segment Brasseur speaks of the valuable services they provide to the insurance industry and how important they are in helping them set their premiums! I kid you not. Brasseur proudly says:
And naturally they come to us and say, ‘Could you please tell us what we can expect in the future?'”
Wink, wink.
Gee, does anyone think there could be a conflict of interest there. This reminds us of how the Munich Re is very close to the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research (PIK). This is just explosive corruption waiting to happen. You produce the horror scenarios; we jack up the premiums!
A close look at the supervisory boards of the various institutes and insurance companies probably would yield some very interesting results and revelations. The undue influence and closeness that major reinsurance companies have with German scientific institutes is worrisome and the potential for corruption there is far too great.

Are we running out of resources? That’s been a hotly debated question since the publication of Paul Ehrlich’s _The Population Bomb_ in 1968. The Stanford University biologist warned that population growth would result in the exhaustion of resources and a global catastrophe. University of Maryland economist Julian Simon, in contrast, argued that humans would innovate their way out of resource shortages. He believed that people were the “ultimate resource” that would make other resources more plentiful.



In this paper, we revisit the main points of contention in the debate regarding availability of resources and their relationship with population growth. Using the latest price data for 50 foundational commodities covering energy, food, materials, and metals, we propose a new way of measuring resource availability based on four concepts.



First, the time‐​price of commodities allows us to measure the cost of resources in terms of human labor. We find that, in terms of global average hourly income, commodity prices fell by 64.7 percent between 1980 and 2017. Second, the price elasticity of population (PEP) allows us to measure sensitivity of resource availability to population growth. We find that the time‐​price of commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every 1 percent increase in the world’s population over the same time period. Third, we develop the Simon Abundance Framework, which uses the PEP values to distinguish between different degrees of resource abundance, from decreasing abundance at one end to superabundance at the other end. Considering that the time‐​price of commodities decreased at a faster proportional rate than population increased, we find that humanity is experiencing superabundance. Fourth, we create the Simon Abundance Index, which uses the timeprice of commodities and change in global population to estimate overall resource abundance. We find that the planet’s resources became 379.6 percent more abundant between 1980 and 2017.



On the basis of our analysis of the relationship between resource availability and population growth, we forecast that the time‐​price of commodities could fall by a further 29 percent over the next 37 years. Much will depend on policies and institutions that nations pursue. For the time‐​price of commodities to decline and resource abundance to increase, it is necessary for market incentives and the price mechanism to endure. When prices of commodities temporarily increase, people have an incentive to use resources more efficiently, increase their supply, and develop cheaper substitutes.



Humanity, the latest estimates suggest, is roughly 300,000 years old.1 For the first 99.9 percent of our time on Earth, _Homo sapiens_ lived a short and difficult life that ended, all too often, in violent death. We roamed the world afraid, cold, hungry, and sick. Remedies to ease our suffering were few. In the past 250 years or so, however, human fortunes dramatically improved. An accumulation of incremental technological, scientific, and ideological advances led to the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in an age of abundance.2



To get a sense of how far we have come, consider global life expectancy, which is a good proxy measure for health and nutrition. In 1820, people could expect to live a paltry 29 years. People today can expect to live 72 years—2.5 times longer than they used to.3 Between 1820 and 2010, average global real income per capita rose from $605 to $7,890.4 That’s an implied 12‐​fold increase in the standard of living. The world has also become less violent.5 In the early 1800s, the combined military and civilian death rate from conflicts was about 65 per 100,000 people. By 2000 that rate fell to about 2 per 100,000.6 Those improvements contributed to increasing the human population from 990 million in 1800 to 7.63 billion in 2018.7



Population growth and abundance seem to be connected. The Scottish philosopher Adam Smith noted that division of labor, or separation of the work process into distinct tasks, leads to faster growth. As workers “specialize,” they become more efficient at what they do. Productivity and wealth increase.8 Specialization, however, requires more workers. The population explosion and the globalization of production supplied plenty of those.9 The late University of Maryland economist Julian Simon noted that in addition to more labor, a growing population produces more ideas.10 More ideas lead to more innovations, and more innovations improve productivity.11 Finally, higher productivity translates to better standards of living.



Abundance requires the use of resources. Is that use of resources worth it? It would seem so. Most people prefer wealth to poverty and incur costs in the pursuit of a better life. Can the current state of abundance be sustained and even be improved on? We think it can. In this paper we show that population growth has not led to a shortage of resources. As Simon predicted, humanity has made resources more plentiful through greater efficiency of use, increased supply, and the development of substitutes.



Fifty years ago, Stanford University biology professor Paul R. Ehrlich published a highly influential book, _The Population Bomb_. The book went through a number of editions, sold millions of copies, and was translated into many languages. The early editions included the now‐​infamous statement:



The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.12



Ehrlich believed that population growth and the concomitant rise in consumption would lead to an environmental collapse, exhaustion of natural resources, food shortages, and mass starvation. He claimed that population control—including coerced sterilization and financial penalties for excessive fecundity—and consumption limits in rich countries would be needed to prevent catastrophe.



Simon rejected Ehrlich’s thesis. In his 1981 book _The Ultimate Resource_ , Simon argued that humans were intelligent beings, capable of innovating their way out of shortages through greater efficiency, increased supply, and the development of substitutes. He wrote:



There is no physical or economic reason why human resourcefulness and enterprise cannot forever continue to respond to impending shortages and existing problems with new expedients that, after an adjustment period, leave us better off than before the problem arose.… Adding more people will cause [short‐​run] problems, but at the same time there will be more people to solve these problems and leave us with the bonus of lower costs and less scarcity in the long run.… The ultimate resource is people—skilled, spirited, and hopeful people who will exert their wills and imaginations for their own benefit, and so, inevitably, for the benefit of us all.13



These were, to put it mildly, two very different visions of humanity’s future. Ehrlich’s gloomy view of humanity’s prospects, it should be noted here, was shared by other influential biologists. They included Garrett Hardin of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who developed the “tragedy of the commons” theory, and Jared Diamond of the University of California, Los Angeles, who penned such bestsellers as _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ and _Collapse_.14



Their analyses of human societies, noted Lester R. Brown of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C., were influenced by the notion of “the carrying capacity of natural systems.”15 In the animal world, a sudden increase in the availability of resources, such as grass after unusually plentiful rain, leads to an animal population explosion. The population explosion then leads to the exhaustion of resources. Finally, the exhaustion of resources leads to population collapse. Economists, as Brown explained, tend to be much more sanguine about humanity’s future prospects.16 Unlike other animals, humans have developed sophisticated forms of cooperation that increase their wealth and chances of survival. Consider, for example, trade and exchange. As the British writer Matt Ridley observed:



There is strikingly little use of barter in any other animal species. There is sharing within families, and there is food‐​for‐​sex exchange in many animals including insects and apes, but there are no cases in which one animal gives an unrelated animal one thing in exchange for a different thing.17



Trade is particularly important during famines, such as those feared by Ehrlich and other biologists. A country stricken by drought, for example, can purchase food from abroad. This is not an option available to other animals.



After intellectually sparring with one another in print for most of the 1970s, Simon finally challenged Ehrlich to a wager on resource depletion. Ehrlich would choose a “basket” of raw materials that he expected would become less abundant in the coming years and choose a time period of more than a year, during which those raw materials would become more expensive. At the end of that period, the inflation‐​adjusted price of those materials would be calculated. If the “real” price of the basket was higher at the end of the period than at the beginning, that would indicate the materials had become more precious and Ehrlich would win the wager; if the price was lower, Simon would win. The stakes would be the ultimate price difference of the basket at the beginning and end of the time period.



Ehrlich chose copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten. The bet was agreed to on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990, being the payoff date. In spite of a population increase of 873 million over those 10 years, Ehrlich lost the wager. All five commodities that he had selected declined in price by an average of 57.6 percent. Ehrlich mailed Simon a check for $576.07.18



Since the conclusion of the bet, Ehrlich’s supporters have argued that Simon got lucky: had the bet taken place over a different decade, the outcome might have been different.19 The debate continues to this day.20 In 2016, Southern Methodist University economists Michael Cox and Richard Alm revisited the Simon–Ehrlich wager and found that Ehrlich’s metals were 22.4 percent cheaper in 2015 than they had been in 1980.21



In an essay titled, “Onward and Upward! Bet on Capitalism—It Works,” Cox and Alm proposed a new methodology to evaluate Simon’s thesis. “The real price of everything,” as Adam Smith pointed out, “is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.… What is bought with money … is purchased by labour.”22 The cost of human labor, Cox and Alm note, tends to increase faster than inflation. From the perspective of average hourly wages in the United States, therefore, the real price of Ehrlich’s minerals fell by 41.8 percent between 1980 and 2015. According to Cox and Alm, in “work‐​hour terms, Simon wins The Bet [with Ehrlich] in every year from 1980 to 2015.”23



The outcome of the Simon–Ehrlich bet and subsequent developments—instead of a global catastrophe, the world has become unambiguously more prosperous—did not diminish the world’s appetite for apocalyptic predictions. That should not come as a surprise. As Harvard University psychology professor Steven Pinker points out, humanity suffers from a negativity bias, or “vigilance for bad things around us.”24



This bias may well be an innate trait, which came about as a result of natural selection. The Environment of Evolutionary Adeptness—a name that psychologists gave to a period of tens of thousands of years during which human brains developed—was much less hospitable to human beings than is the case today. “Our modern skulls house a stone age mind,” as University of California, Santa Barbara, anthropology professor John Tooby and psychology professor Leda Cosmides put it.25 Consequently, there will always be a market for purveyors of bad news, be they doomsayers who claim that overpopulation will cause mass starvation or scaremongers who claim that we are running out of natural resources.26



Thus, Ehrlich’s message continues to resonate. In 2013, he and his wife, Anne, revisited _The Population Bomb_ in an article titled “Can a Collapse of Global Civilization Be Avoided?” The pair warned that human civilization



is threatened with collapse by an array of environmental problems.… The human predicament is driven by overpopulation, overconsumption of natural resources … and socio‐​economic‐​political arrangements to service _Homo sapiens’_ aggregate consumption.27



In 2017, Ehrlich was invited to address a Vatican workshop on “Biological Extinction.” “You can’t go on growing forever on a finite planet. The biggest problem we face is the continued expansion of the human enterprise,” he said. “Perpetual growth is the creed of a cancer cell.… It’s the aggregate consumption that ruins the environment,” Ehrlich continued.28



Ehrlich was not the first thinker to worry about population growth. Confucius and his Chinese disciples wondered about the size of “optimum population,” thought that government should move people from “overpopulated to under‐​populated areas,” and identified food shortages as a source of population decline.29 The Greek philosopher Aristotle held that an “excessive number of inhabitants would breed poverty and social ills.” To “prevent an excessive population he mentioned child exposure and abortion.”30



Modern discourse concerning the interaction between population growth and resource depletion dates to the British cleric Thomas Malthus, whose immensely influential 1798 _Essay on the Principle of Population_ argued that unchecked population growth would result in widespread famine.31



Nor was Ehrlich alone in generating widespread panic over population growth. Consider, for example, the Club of Rome. Established in the same year that _The Population Bomb_ came out, the club “is an organisation of individuals who share a common concern for the future of humanity and strive to make a difference.… [Its] mission is to promote understanding of the global challenges facing humanity and to propose solutions through scientific analysis, communication and advocacy.”32



The club’s first major publication was its 1972 report _The Limits to Growth_. The report looked at the interplay between industrial development, population growth, malnutrition, the availability of nonrenewable resources, and the quality of the environment. It concluded,



If present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years.… The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity.… Given present resource consumption rates and the projected increase in these rates, the great majority of currently nonrenewable resources will be extremely expensive 100 years from now.33



The Club of Rome has revisited _The Limits to Growth_ on numerous occasions. In 2017, to give just one example, it published a new report titled, _Come On! Capitalism, Short‐​Termism, Population and the Destruction of the Planet_ , which insisted that “the Club of Rome’s warnings published in the book _Limits to Growth_ are still valid” and warned that the “current worldwide trends are not sustainable.”34



It was in this gloomy intellectual environment that Earth Day was born. As the _New York Times_ recalled on April 22, 2014:



When environmentalists proclaimed the first Earth Day, on this date in 1970, the air was filled with doomsday predictions. At the initial rallies to mark the day, people warned of overpopulation, a denuded planet, hundreds of millions of people starving to death, a new Ice Age or the greenhouse effect. Many—though not all, obviously—of those forecasts were off.35



The initial event was the brainchild of American peace activist John McConnell, who “proposed a global holiday to celebrate Earth’s life and beauty” at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization conference in San Francisco in October 1969.36 Like McConnell, we fully support sensible measures to protect the environment and join in celebration of the beauty of our planet. What we object to is the notion that human flourishing and well‐​being of the planet are incompatible.



In this paper, we look at the prices of commodities from a global perspective. Building on Cox and Alm’s methodology, we introduce a concept of “time‐​price,” which is the amount of time that an average human has to work in order to earn enough money to buy a commodity. The time‐​price then allows us to take a new look at Simon’s thesis, which states that population growth will result in “less scarcity in the long run.”37



The Earth is a closed system. One day, we might be able to replenish our resources from outer space by, for example, dragging a mineral‐​rich asteroid down to Earth. In the meantime, we have to make do with the resources we have. But what exactly do we have? We cannot be sure, for the full extent of our resources is not known. Consider the last crisis over the availability of natural resources and note the ingenious ways in which humanity tackled that particular problem.



In September 2010, a Chinese fishing trawler and a Japanese coast guard vessel collided in waters disputed by the two countries. The Japanese detained the captain of the Chinese vessel, and China responded by halting all shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan. The latter used the imported metals in a number of high‐​tech industries, including production of magnets and Toyota Priuses. At the time of the embargo, China accounted for 97 percent of the production of these rare earths and a large part of the processing business. Predictably, global panic ensued.



In the United States, where these rare elements are used in defense systems, wind turbines, and electric cars, the great and the good rang the alarm bells. Writing in the _New York Times_ , the Nobel Prize–winning economist Paul Krugman opined:



You really have to wonder why nobody raised an alarm while this was happening, if only on national security grounds. But policymakers simply stood by as the U.S. rare earth industry shut down.… The result was a monopoly position exceeding the wildest dreams of Middle Eastern oil‐​fueled tyrants. Couple the rare earth story with China’s behavior on other fronts—the state subsidies that help firms gain key contracts, the pressure on foreign companies to move production to China and, above all, that exchange‐​rate policy—and what you have is a portrait of a rogue economic superpower, unwilling to play by the rules. And the question is what the rest of us are going to do about it.38



In a 2014 Council on Foreign Relations report, Eugene Gholz, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, revisited the crisis and found that the Chinese embargo proved to be a bit of a dud. Some Chinese exporters got around the embargo by using legal loopholes, such as selling rare earths after combining them with other alloys. Others simply smuggled the elements out of China. Some companies found ways to make their products using smaller amounts of the elements, while others “remembered that they did not need the high performance of specialized rare earth[s].… [T]hey were merely using them because, at least until the 2010 episode, they were relatively inexpensive and convenient.”39



Another effect of the embargo was that companies around the world started raising money for new mining projects, ramped up existing plant capacities, and accelerated plans to recycle rare earths. The market response, then, diffused the immediate crisis. Prices of rare earths, which spiked in 2011, came down again.40 In the long run, the future looks brighter still.



In 2018, a team of 21 Japanese scientists discovered a 16‐​million‐​ton patch of mineral‐​rich deep‐​sea mud near Minami‐​Tori Island, which lies 790 miles off the coast of Japan. The patch appears to contain a wealth of rare earth elements, including 780 years’ worth of yttrium, 620 years’ worth of europium, 420 years’ worth of terbium, and 730 years’ worth of dysprosium. This find, the scientists concluded, “has the potential to supply these materials on a semi‐​infinite basis to the world.”41 It turns out that rare earths may not be so “rare” after all.42



Moreover, our resources are not fixed. Freshwater reserves, for example, have been declining for decades, leading many a writer to warn about future water shortages.43 But 71 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, mostly salty sea water. What’s needed in the areas most affected by drought, such as North Africa and the Middle East, is an affordable process of desalination that separates salt particles from water molecules. Israel has pioneered a desalination method that makes freshwater consumed by Israeli households 48 percent cheaper than that consumed by the people of Los Angeles. As Rowan Jacobsen wrote in _Scientific American_ :



Desal [desalinization] works by pushing saltwater into membranes containing microscopic pores. The water gets through, while the larger salt molecules are left behind. But microorganisms in seawater quickly colonize the membranes and block the pores, and controlling them requires periodic costly and chemical‐​intensive cleaning. But [Israeli scientist] Bar‐​Zeev and colleagues developed a chemical‐​free system using porous lava stone to capture the microorganisms before they reach the membranes. It’s just one of many breakthroughs in membrane technology that have made desalination much more efficient. Israel now gets 55 percent of its domestic water from desalination, and that has helped to turn one of the world’s driest countries into the unlikeliest of water giants.44



Similar stories can be told of all kinds of human endeavors. That’s because what matters is not the total number of atoms on Earth, but the infinite number of ways in which those atoms can be combined and recombined. As the Nobel Prize–winning New York University economics professor Paul Romer writes,



Every generation has perceived the limits to growth that finite resources and undesirable side effects would pose if no new recipes or ideas were discovered. And every generation has underestimated the potential for finding new recipes and ideas. We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered. The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding. Possibilities do not add up. They multiply.… To get some sense of how much scope there is for more such discoveries, we can calculate as follows. The periodic table contains about a hundred different types of atoms. If a recipe is simply an indication of whether an element is included or not, there will be 100 × 99 recipes like the one for bronze or steel that involve only two elements. For recipes that can have four elements, there are 100 × 99 × 98 × 97 recipes, which is more [than] 94 million. With up to 5 elements, more than 9 billion. Mathematicians call this increase in the number of combinations “combinatorial explosion.” Once you get to 10 elements, there are more recipes than seconds since the big bang created the universe. As you keep going, it becomes obvious that there have been too few people on earth and too little time since we showed up, for us to have tried more than a minuscule fraction of the all the possibilities.45



Figuring out the availability of resources, therefore, is not about measuring the quantity of resources, as engineers do. It is about looking at the prices of resources, as economists do. In a competitive economy, humanity’s knowledge about the value of something tends to be reflected in its price. As new knowledge emerges, prices change accordingly.



Markets, then, generate nominal or current prices of commodities, and those prices are the best proxies we have for understanding resource availability at any given time. There are a number of organizations that collect commodity prices. In this paper, we rely on data from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, D.C. The two institutions track nominal prices of an array of commodities, with some data going as far back as 1960.46



After some consolidation of the available data, a process that we describe at length in Appendix 1, we ended up with a basket of 50 commodities. All the items in the basket are weighted equally (i.e., 2 percent each) and can be divided into five categories. Food and beverages account for 48 percent of the overall composition of the basket, metals account for 20 percent, energy for 12 percent, raw materials for 14 percent, and precious metals for 6 percent (see Figure 1).



 **Figure 1: Commodity weighting and distribution**  




 **Source:** Authors' calculations, based on World Bank and IMF databases.



We started our analysis in 1980 because data for many of the commodities tracked by the World Bank and the IMF do not go back further than that. Coincidentally, 1980 also coincides with the launch date of the Simon–Ehrlich wager.



What did we find? Between 1980 and 2017, the nominal prices of 9 commodities fell, while the nominal prices of 41 commodities increased. The average nominal price of our basket of commodities rose by 62.7 percent (see Appendix 2).



To understand long-term trends in the availability of resources, which is what both Simon and Ehrlich were interested in, one must start by adjusting the nominal prices of commodities for inflation. The value of fiat money tends to decline every year, so it is possible for a commodity to “seem” to become more expensive even though its “real” price has declined or remained the same. To adjust our basket of commodities for inflation, we used the “Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator,” which is published by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.47



Between 1980 and 2017, the price level rose by 156 percent. Adjusted for inflation, 43 commodities declined in real price, two remained equally valuable, and five increased in real price. On average, the real price of our basket of commodities fell by 36.3 percent between 1980 and 2017 (see Appendix 2).



Income is a key variable in measurement of the availability of resources. When real commodity prices rise faster than real or inflation-adjusted income, the commodities become more expensive relative to income. All else being equal, when a commodity, such as gas, becomes dearer, people have less money left for other purchases, such as clothing. As a consequence, people are left worse off.



Conversely, when real commodity prices rise at a slower rate than real income, the commodities become cheaper relative to income. All else being equal, when a commodity, such as gas, becomes cheaper, people have more money left for other purchases, such as clothing. As a consequence, people are left better off. If real commodity prices fall while real incomes increase, people benefit to an even greater degree.



Thankfully, incomes tend to rise at a faster rate than inflation because humanity tends to become more productive over time. That’s true of our species as a whole (i.e., we are more productive than our Stone Age ancestors) and it’s true for individuals in their prime working age (i.e., up to a certain point, people tend to become more productive with age).



The rise in incomes, however, does not tell us everything we need to know about availability of resources because the average number of hours worked per worker changes over time. If, for example, people’s annual incomes remain the same but they work fewer hours, their hourly incomes actually increase. If people’s annual incomes increase even though they work fewer hours, their hourly incomes are greater still. Looking at annual income divided by annual hours worked, therefore, gives us a more precise hourly income rate.



The World Bank collects gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in current U.S. dollars.48 As was the case when we calculated the real price of commodities, we deflated world average GDP per capita in current U.S. dollars with the GDP deflator. We found that between 1980 and 2017, real average annual per capita income in the world rose from $6,431 to $10,495 (in 2017 U.S. dollars).49 That’s a 63.2 percent increase.



Over the same time period, the population-adjusted average annual hours worked per worker declined from 2,168 hours to 1,964 hours.50 That’s a 9.4 percent reduction.51 In other words, the real average hourly income in the world grew from $2.97 in 1980 to $5.34 in 2017.52 That’s an 80.1 percent increase. It is this average hourly rate that underpins the “time-price of resources” (see below).



Dividing the change in the real price of a commodity by the change in the real hourly rate of income per capita allows us to arrive at the time-price of a commodity, which is time that an average human has to work in order to earn enough money to buy a commodity. According to our methodology, if the real price of a commodity increases by 10 percent but the real hourly income rate increases by 20 percent, the time-price of a commodity falls by 8.3 percent.53



What did we find? As previously shown, the real price of our basket of commodities decreased by an average of 36.3 percent between 1980 and 2017. During the same time period, the global real hourly income rate per capita grew by 80.1 percent. The time-price of our basket of commodities has, therefore, fallen by 64.7 percent (see Figure 2).54



 **Figure 2: Percentage change in nominal, real, and time-price of a basket of commodities, 1980–2017**  




 **Sources:** “Commodity Price Data,” World Bank, http://www.worldbank.org/en/research/commodity-markets; International Monetary Fund, http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/commod/External_Data.xls; “Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator,” FRED Economic Data, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPDEF#0; “GDP per capita (current US$),” World Bank, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD; “Total Economy Database,” The Conference Board, https://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/.



A 64.7 percent drop in the time-price of commodities between 1980 and 2017 translates to an annual compounded rate of decline of 2.77 percent. That means that, should the current trend continue, commodities will become 50 percent cheaper every 26 years.



When it comes to the availability of resources, percentage changes are interesting, but multipliers can be even more illuminating. Saying that something has dropped in time-price by 50 percent is the same as saying that a person can now purchase two items for the same amount of time that it used to take to earn the money to purchase just one item. We call that the “time-price multiplier.”55



Before proceeding, note that declining prices result in exponential, not linear, gains. Thus, a 75 percent decline in price allows a person to purchase four items; a 90 percent decline results in 10 items; a 95 percent decline in 20 items; and a 96 percent decline in 25 items. A 1 percentage point change from 95 percent to 96 percent, in other words, enhances the gain by 25 percent.



Now, back to our time-price multiplier. The time it took to earn enough money to buy one unit in our basket of commodities in 1980 bought 2.83 units in 2017.56 Put differently, commodities that took 60 minutes of work to buy in 1980 took only 21 minutes of work to buy in 2017. Thus, whether one looks at percentages or multipliers, it is clear that Simon’s thesis holds. Commodities really did become less costly over time.



In Simon’s telling, commodities grow more plentiful not in spite of population growth, but because of it. With every hungry mouth comes a brain capable of reason and innovation. Was he correct? The _price elasticity of population_ (PEP) can help us answer that question.



In economics, elasticity is a measure of a variable’s sensitivity to a change in another variable. Consider, for example, the relationship between price and demand. If the price of a product increases by 50 percent and the purchases of that product fall by 25 percent, then we can say that for every percentage point increase in the price of a product, the demand for that product decreased by half a percentage point.57



Why is this concept important? If the PEP value ends up being positive, we will be able to infer that time-price of commodities increased in response to population growth. If the PEP value ends up being negative, we will be able to infer that time-price of commodities declined in response to population growth.58



Between 1980 and 2017, the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 64.7 percent. Over the same time period, the world’s population increased from 4.46 billion to 7.55 billion.59 That’s a 69.3 percent increase. The PEP indicates that the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every 1 percent increase in population.60



As noted, people often assume that population growth leads to resource depletion. We found the opposite. Over the past 37 years, every additional human being born on our planet appears to have made resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us.61



So far, we have avoided using the term “scarcity” except when quoting from Simon’s works. Simon, however, was responding to Ehrlich, who predicted scarcity of natural resources. In 1974, for example, Ehrlich wrote “that before 1985 mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity in which many things besides energy will be in short supply.”62 In Ehrlich’s telling, scarcity equals depletion of resources. As he noted in 1997:



Since natural resources are finite, increasing consumption obviously must “inevitably lead to depletion and scarcity.” Currently there are very large supplies of many mineral resources, including iron and coal. But when they become “depleted” or “scarce” will depend not simply on how much is in the ground but also on the rate at which they can be produced and the amount societies can afford to pay, in standard economic or environmental terms, for their extraction and use. For most resources, economic and environmental constraints will limit consumption while substantial quantities remain.… For others, however, global “depletion”—that is, decline to a point where worldwide demand can no longer be met economically—is already on the horizon. Petroleum is a textbook example of such a resource.63



In economics, in contrast, scarcity “is a relative rather than an absolute concept—water is scarcer in the desert and less scarce in the rainforest.”64 Economists, Simon included, see resource scarcity as a temporary challenge that can be solved through greater efficiency, increased supply, development of substitutes, and so on.



The relationship between prices and innovation is dynamic. Relative scarcity leads to higher prices, higher prices create incentives for innovations, and innovations lead to abundance. Scarcity gets converted to abundance through the price system. The price system functions as long as the economy is based on property rights, rule of law, and free exchange.



In relatively free economies, resources do not get depleted in the way that Ehrlich feared they would. In fact, resources tend to become more abundant. That is why, in recent years, scholars have started to write about the age of abundance, a state of affairs in which “technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standards of living for every man, woman, and child on the planet.”65



In this section, we use PEP values to propose four zones of resource abundance. These zones are demarcated by lines, which reflect the magnitude of the change in the time-price of commodities relative to population growth or PEP.66 We call this progression from scarcity to greater abundance the Simon Abundance Framework (see Table 1).



 **Table 1: The Simon Abundance Framework**  




 **Source:** Authors’ analysis.  
 **Note:** The Simon Abundance Framework assumes that population change is always positive.



The Nirvana Line separates accelerating abundance (i.e., time-price decreases as population increases) from superabundance (i.e., time-price decreases at a faster proportional rate than population increases). The Nirvana Line Equation (NLE) specifies the exact amount past which time-price must decline for abundance to increase at a faster rate than population growth.



Note that the relationship between time-price decline and population growth is nonlinear (see Figure 3). For example, if population increases by 50 percent, time-price must decline by 33 percent for abundance to continue to increase at a faster rate than population growth.67



 **Figure 3: Nirvana line**  




 **Source:** Authors’ calculations.  
 **Note:** PEP = price elasticity of population.



As noted, population increased by 69.3 percent between 1980 and 2017. To qualify for superabundance, therefore, the time-price of our basket of commodities has to fall by at least 40 percent.68



Considering that the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 64.7 percent, we can conclude that the world is experiencing superabundance. Should the time-price of our basket of commodities fall at a somewhat slower rate than the NLE determines in the future, the economy will revert to accelerating abundance.69



The Simon Abundance Index (SAI) measures the change in abundance of resources over a period of time. The SAI represents the ratio of the change in population over the change in the time-price, times 100. It has a base year of 1980 and a base value of 100. Between 1980 and 2017, resource availability increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.32 percent. That means that the Earth was 379.6 percent more abundant in 2017 than it was in 1980.70 In 2018, the value of the SAI stands at 479.6. Put differently, the Earth was 4.796 times as plentiful last year as it was when Ehrlich and Simon commenced their famous wager (see Figure 4).71



 **Figure 4: Simon Abundance Index 1980–2017**  




 **Source:** Authors’ analysis.



Simon foresaw greater resource abundance and predicted that cheaper commodities would translate into higher living standards.72 Indeed, incomes grew and commodities became cheaper between 1980 and 2017. But Simon also assumed that many people would remain oblivious to the positive changes around them. As he noted in an interview a year before he died, “This is my long-run forecast in brief: The material conditions of life will continue to get better for most people, in most countries, most of the time, indefinitely. . . . I also speculate, however, that many people will continue to _think and say_ that the conditions of life are getting _worse_.”73



Again, Simon was correct. Earlier this year, for example, a survey found that “American high school students are very worried about overpopulation.” The students answered a number of questions, including “How worried are you that an ever-increasing population will continue to use up the Earth’s limited reserves of freshwater, fertile soil, forests and fisheries?” In response to that question, 29 percent of students replied that they were very worried, and 38 percent replied that they were somewhat worried. Only 20 percent were not too worried, while 13 percent expressed no opinion.74 Such views are common.



Consequently, we propose Simon’s Rule, which states that “As population increases, the time-price of most commodities will get cheaper for most people, most of the time. Unfortunately, most people will assume the opposite.”



Our analysis covered 37 years, from 1980 to 2017. Population increased by 69.3 percent from 4.46 billion to 7.55 billion and the time-price of our basket of commodities decreased by 64.7 percent, suggesting that our planet has become 379.6 percent more abundant. According to the United Nations’ medium fertility variant estimates, the world’s population will increase by a further 32 percent over the next 37 years, rising from 7.55 billion in 2017 to 9.97 billion in 2054.75 What should we expect to happen to commodity prices?



We have calculated the PEP values for each year between 1980 and 2017. Our analysis indicates a mean PEP value of -1.530, with a minimum of -16.76 and a maximum of 11.00.76 The range between the two PEP values was 27.76.77 According to our analysis, over the past 37 years humanity experienced decreasing abundance 32 percent of the time and superabundance 54 percent of the time (see Table 2).



 **Table 2: Frequency of PEP values based on the Simon Abundance Framework zones, 1980–2017**  




 **Source:** Authors’ analysis.  
 **Note:** PEP = price elasticity of population.



We expect the annual PEP to be around−0.90 going forward.78 If population increases by 32 percent and the PEP coefficient remains around−0.90, then the time-price of our basket of commodities should decline by around 29 percent. Moreover, our planet will be 83 percent more abundant in 2054 than it was in 2017.



The NLE for a population increase of 32 percent indicates that the time-price of our basket of commodities will have to fall by at least 24 percent. Only then will abundance continue to increase at a faster rate than population growth. Considering that we estimate a further 29 percent decrease in the time-price of our basket of commodities, the world should continue to experience superabundance.



However, we do recognize the large variation in the PEP values. Thus, we expect to see a decreasing abundance indicator around 32.4 percent of the time. Simon, it should be remembered, predicted periods of higher commodity prices. But he expected that higher commodity prices would create incentives for innovation that would, ultimately, lead to greater resource abundance.



In this paper, we have revisited and updated the decades-long debate between Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon. The main point of contention between the biologist and the economist was the effect of population growth on the availability of natural resources. Ehrlich argued that humanity would deplete Earth’s resources, while Simon argued that humanity would make them more plentiful. The famous bet between the two resulted in Simon’s victory, although some researchers subsequently found that the win was partly the result of good luck. The Simon-Ehrlich wager lasted from 1980 to 1990. Our paper, which looked at data between 1980 and 2017, found that the real price of our basket of commodities decreased by 36.3 percent, while the time-price declined by 64.7 percent.



To arrive at the last number, we have developed a new price measure that we call time-price. Unlike resources, which can be made more abundant through greater efficiency, increased supply, and development of substitutes, time is finite. The more time we spend at work, the less time we have for other pursuits such as leisure. Time-price denotes the amount of time that people must spend working to earn enough money to buy something.



Considering that the real average hourly income per capita rose by 80.1 percent, the time it took to earn enough money to buy one unit in our basket of commodities in 1980 bought 2.83 units in 2017. Moreover, the 2.77 percent annual compounded rate of decline in the time-price of commodities suggests that commodities become 50 percent cheaper every 26 years. Finally, our data show that, using the time-price decline measure, Simon would have won his wager with Ehrlich each year between 1980 and 2017.



Furthermore, we have developed the concept of price elasticity of population, which allows us to estimate the effect of population growth on availability of resources. On the basis of a population increase of 69.3 percent and a time-price decline of 64.7 percent, we found that the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every 1 percent increase in population. That means that every additional human being born on our planet seems to be making resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us.



The PEP also allowed us to develop the Simon Abundance Framework, which describes progression from decreasing abundance at the one end to superabundance at the other end. The Nirvana Line Equation allowed us to conclude that humanity is experiencing superabundance with the time-price of commodities decreasing at a faster proportional rate than the population is increasing.



Finally, we have developed the Simon Abundance Index, which measures the overall change in the abundance of resources over a period of time. The 2017 SAI of 479.6 suggests that our planet was 379.6 percent more abundant in resources in 2017 than it was in 1980. Put differently, resources were 4.796 times as plentiful in 2017 as they were in 1980.



While few people would go as far as to compare population growth and the concomitant increase in consumption to “the creed of a cancer cell,” as Ehrlich did, many people continue to feel uneasy about overpopulation and overconsumption. These concerns have deep historical roots and may have been justified at a time when human and animal worlds were more similar than they are today. Back then, a sudden increase in population really could lead to overconsumption of resources, starvation, and death.79



Today’s world, however, is very different from that analyzed by Aristotle or Malthus. As American writer Jonah Goldberg put it in a recent book chronicling human progress, “Almost everything about modernity, progress, and enlightened society emerged in the last 300 years. If the last 200,000 years of humanity were one year, nearly all material progress came in the last 14 hours.”80



It is, in fact, much more difficult to compile a list of measures by which the world is worse off today than it was before science, reason, and humanism made us all healthier, better fed, safer, richer, and even happier.81 We are also much better educated, though old habits, such as our propensity toward pessimism, refuse to go away. Hence Simon’s Rule, which states that “As population increases, the time-price of most commodities will get cheaper for most people, most of the time. Unfortunately, most people will assume the opposite.”



Simon’s revolutionary insights with regard to the mutually beneficial interaction between population growth and availability of natural resources are counterintuitive, but they are real. The world is a closed system in the way that a piano is a closed system. The instrument has only 88 notes, but those notes can be played in a nearly infinite variety of ways. The same applies to our planet. The Earth’s atoms may be fixed, but the possible combinations of those atoms are infinite. What matters, then, is not the physical limits of our planet, but human freedom to experiment and reimagine the use of resources that we have.



To see what has been happening to world commodity prices, we looked at the World Bank’s commodity price data and the IMF primary commodity prices going back to 1980. Most commodities were tracked by both organizations, but a few commodities were tracked by only one or the other organization. The World Bank has been tracking data for a longer period of time and so, when both organizations tracked the same commodity, we relied on the World Bank data as our primary source. Overall, we ended up with 50 items. Forty-three came from the World Bank, and seven came from the IMF.



Our basket of commodities includes gold and silver. That’s not something that Simon would have been comfortable with. Simon was concerned with commodities that are used or consumed and for which relative scarcity is a concern. His analysis did not apply to commodities that moonlight as stores of value. One of us addressed that problem in a previous publication:



In addition to their commercial uses, such as serving as conductors of electricity in switches and cell phones, gold and silver are also stores of value or assets that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time. Historically, people of all income groups used gold and silver to hide their wealth from rapacious government officials and in the time of war. More recently, both metals rose in price during the inflationary 1970s, when many of the world’s most important currencies, including the U.S. dollar, were rapidly losing their value because of monetary mismanagement. They spiked again after the outbreak of the Great Recession and the subsequent uncertainty about the soundness of the financial system.83



In the end, we have decided to keep gold and silver in our basket of commodities for the following reasons. First, prices of many commodities, not just gold and silver, do not perfectly reflect global supply and demand. “For many decades, the oil market was partly shielded from competitive forces by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a cartel of oil-producing countries. The OPEC nations frequently colluded to restrict production of oil in order to keep its price artificially high. The extent to which OPEC was able to achieve its goal in the past is subject to much debate, but many experts have come to believe that OPEC’s ability to affect the future price of oil is in decline.”84 Prices of other commodities, including sugar and corn, may be artificially inflated by tariffs and subsidies.



Second, our aim is to be completely transparent with regard to our methodology and to avoid the charge of cherry-picking. Since gold and silver constitute parts of the World Bank’s database of commodities, we decided to include them. That said, we hope that this section will remind the readers that the prices of gold and silver are subjected to influences that most other commodities are not subject to. Finally, gold and silver together represent a mere 4 percent of the weight in our basket of commodities. Researchers are free to build their own indexes and reduce the weight of gold and silver to zero if they like.

4 These figures are in 1990 U.S. dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). Note that in our analysis we do not use figures adjusted for PPP. That’s because we look at global prices of commodities, which theoretically reflect the influences of all local conditions. A Big Mac costs much less in Ukraine, where labor and other inputs are cheaper, than in Switzerland, where labor and other inputs are more expensive. But the price of imported zinc will be very similar in both countries. For income data, see Jutta Bolt, Marcel Timmer, and Jan Luiten van Zanden, “GDP per Capita since 1820,” in _How Was Life?

In 1800, homicide rates in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany were 8.0, 4.7, and 2.4 per 100,000, respectively. By the early 2000s, those rates fell to 2.30, 0.60 and 0.58, respectively.

9 The Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton argues that population growth preceded the Great Enrichment of the last two centuries because of “the control of disease through public health measures. At first this took the form of improvements in sanitation and in water supplies. Eventually the science caught up with practice and the germ theory of disease was understood and gradually implemented, through more focused, scientifically based measures. These included routine vaccination against a range of diseases and the adoption of good practices of personal and public health based on the germ theory.” See Angus Deaton, _The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality_ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), p. 93.

17 Ridley continues, “I am not talking about swapping favors—any old primate can do that. There is plenty of ‘reciprocity’ in monkeys and apes: you scratch my back and I scratch yours. . . . Such reciprocity is an important human social glue, a source of cooperation and a habit inherited from the animal past that undoubtedly prepared human beings for exchange. But it is not the same thing as exchange. Reciprocity means giving each other the same thing (usually) at different times. Exchange—call it barter or trade if you like—means giving each other different things (usually) at the same time: simultaneously swapping two different objects.” Matt Ridley, _The Rational Optimist_ (New York: HarperCollins, 2010), pp. 56–57.

48 The World Bank’s “GDP per Capita in Current U.S. Dollars” data span the period between 1960 and 2016. We have imputed the 2017 value by computing the average rate of income appreciation between 1960 and 2016, which came to 3 percent. We added 3 percent to the 2016 figure of $10,192.

50 “Total Economy Database: Annual Hours Worked per Worker,” The Conference Board, https://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/.



51 The “Annual Hours Worked per Worker” dataset from The Conference Board covers 70 percent of the world’s population. We consider that to be a sufficient share of the world’s population to imply a global population–adjusted average annual hours worked per worker decline of 9.4 percent.



52 The relevant calculation for 1980 is GDP per capita of $6,431 ÷ 2,168 hours worked = $2.97 income per hour. The relevant calculation for 2017 is GDP per capita of $10,495 ÷ 1,964 hours worked = $5.34 income per hour. (All figures are in 2017 dollars.)



53 The relevant equation here is  
TP = [(1+ percentage change in price) ÷ (1 + the percentage change in income)] − 1  
TP = [1.10 ÷ 1.20] − 1  
TP = 0.917 – 1  
TP = −0.083 or −8.3 percent



54 The relevant equation here is  
TP = [(1+ percentage change in price) ÷ (1 + the percentage change in income)] − 1  
TP = [(1 − 0.363) ÷ (1 + 0.801)] − 1  
TP = [0.637 ÷ 1.801] − 1  
TP = 0.353 − 1   
TP = −0.647 or −64.7 percent



55 The relevant equation here is  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + percentage change in time-price)  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + (−0.50))  
TPM = 1 ÷ 0.5  
TPM = 2



56 The relevant equation here is  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + change in time-price)  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + (−0.647))  
TPM = 1 ÷ 0.353  
TPM = 2.83



57 Price elasticity of a product (P) = percentage change in the quantity of P purchased ÷ percentage change in price of P sold; price elasticity of P = (−25 percent ÷ 50 percent); price elasticity of P = −0.5.



58 The relevant equation here is: PEP = percentage change in time-price ÷ percentage change in population.



59 “World Population Prospects, 2017,” United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/.



60 The relevant equation here is  
PEP = percentage change in time-price ÷ percentage change in population  
PEP = -64.7 ÷ 69.3   
PEP = -0.934



61 Note that price elasticity of population is unlikely to be constant. The nearly direct link between population and time-price generated between 1980 and 2017 might not hold over the course of the next 37 years. For more discussion on this subject, see the “Forecasts” section of this paper.

66 Note that the PEP denominator will always be positive. That’s because we expect population to keep growing for the foreseeable future. The PEP does not deal with scenarios in which population remains constant or is declining. That’s consonant with the Simon–Ehrlich debate, since both scholars were concerned with the effect of population _growth_ on the availability of resources.



67 The relevant equation here is  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + percentage change in population)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + 0.50)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ 1.5] − 1  
NLE = 0.66 − 1  
NLE = −0.33 or −33 percent



68 The relevant equation here is  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + percentage change in population)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + 0.693)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ 1.693] − 1  
NLE = 0.59 − 1  
NLE = −0.41 or −41 percent

70 The relevant equation is  
SAI = [(1 + percentage change in population) ÷ (1 + percentage change in time-price)] × 100  
SAI = [(1 + 0.693) ÷ (1 − 0.647)] × 100  
SAI = [1.693 ÷ 0.353] × 100  
SAI = 4.796 × 100  
SAI = 479.6



71 Much of the contemporary discussion in academia and the popular press centers on the subject of income inequality. In this paper, we did not adjust our figures to indicate different resource availability for people of different income levels. That said, it is worth remembering that the Simon Index is composed of basic commodities, not yachts or Lamborghinis. The poor benefit most when basic commodities, including food, fall in price. Hundreds of millions of people, especially those in the developing world whose incomes remain relatively low, are escaping from absolute poverty because time-prices of commodities are getting cheaper. Other researchers might wish to examine spending patterns to determine the welfare implications of the falling time-price of commodities for different income groups.

76 The standard deviation was 5.71 and the standard error was 0.939. Assuming a normal distribution, the chance that the PEP average will exceed 1 (i.e., scarcity) is 2.69 standard deviations away from the mean. The probably of that occurring is 0.00355 percent.



77 Note that the PEP value for 1980–2017, which comes to -0.934, differs somewhat from the yearly average of -1.53. As such, our forecast of -0.90 errs on the side of caution.



78 A potential concern with our forecast is that innovation could, as Paul Romer put it, “peter out.” As humanity develops more ideas, finding enough good new ones to maintain the current level of productivity growth may require increasingly costly investments in human capital. Researchers may have to command a greater body of literature and solve increasingly difficult problems. Under this scenario, the cost of accumulating enough human capital to balance population growth with higher productivity may eventually become prohibitive, the PEP could move toward a positive value, and population growth could indeed presage decreasing abundance. Note that Romer does not endorse the “petering out” argument but merely gives that concept a useful name. Like Romer, we believe that, when it comes to innovation, there are reasons for optimism. As Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler put it in their 2012 book _Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think_ , “the advancement of new, transformational technologies—computational systems, networks and sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, biotechnology, bioinformatics, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, human-machine interfaces, and biomedical engineering—will soon enable the vast majority of humanity to experience what only the affluent have access to today.” See Paul Romer, “Endogenous Technological Change,” _Journal of Political Economy_ , 98, no. 5, pt. 2 (1990): S71–S102; and Diamandis and Kotler, _Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think_ , p. 10.

"Sana Mustafa considers herself “the privileged one” in the family. A    Syrian refugee who made it to the United States, she has a college degree and an apartment in a quiet,   village in the Hudson Valley. She speaks out, freely and without fear, about the rights of refugees like herself. “But I feel so much guilt,” she said. “My life is moving forward. Their life has been put on hold. ” She means her mother and younger sister, Ghena. They live as refugees in a border town in Turkey, fearful of saying too much. Ms. Mustafa’s father was picked up by the Syrian authorities nearly four years ago and hasn’t been heard from since. Her older sister, Wafa, fled to Germany. President Trump’s executive order freezing refugee resettlement also froze her family’s hopes of living together in the United States. The ensuing legal challenges to the order bring little clarity. About 2, 000 refugees are expected to come into the country over a   period that was to start on Monday. But there are thousands more waiting in line overseas to join family members who are already here, like Ms. Mustafa. These families remain suspended in a state of uncertainty  —   and those who were able to get out say they feel a gnawing sense of guilt. In Knoxville, Tenn. an Iraqi woman who arrived five months ago has no explanation to offer her    twin daughters, who are stranded back home. They cry every time she calls. In Clarkston, Ga. a Somali mother fears for her daughter, 20, who was supposed to come on Feb. 6, but remains in a refugee camp in Kenya. The family had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed their home and raped and killed another daughter. That memory only makes things worse. “I am unable to sleep or eat,” the mother, Habibo Abdikadir Mohamed, 38, said through an interpreter this past week. “I’m not sure she will be safe. I’ve already lost one daughter. I’m worried I will lose another. ” Exactly how many families are divided like these is not known. A United States government lawyer said Friday that 100, 000 visas had been revoked, while the State Department said the number was closer to 60, 000. The rules are changing so fast, it’s impossible to predict the fate of relatives left behind. On Jan. 27, Mr. Trump signed the order suspending the resettlement of refugees from any country for four months, adding that Syrians seeking asylum would be barred indefinitely. Syrians and nationals from six other   countries, including Iraq and Somalia, would be unable to visit even if they had valid visas. Then, federal judges quashed the ban, at least temporarily. The State Department said it would allow refugees who had already been approved to fly to the United States, until Feb. 17. There were nearly 20, 000 people in that category  —   vetted and screened by multiple government agencies  —   according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency that arranged travel for the refugees. It was scrambling to get about 10 percent of them on planes to the United States in the next 10 days. That didn’t bring much comfort to Meathaq Alaunaibi of Iraq. Her husband worked for 10 years as a translator for the United States Agency for International Development in Baghdad. Their home was shelled in 2006, an attack that she believes was done by militants because of his work with American officials. Her husband’s hand was burned by a car bomb in 2014. Still, it took four years for their visa application to be approved, and last summer, the couple, their    daughter and their    son landed in Knoxville. But there was a new wrinkle. Because the process took so long, their twin daughters, Aisha and Fatima, had just turned 18. They were told that they would have to be screened anew. One is in medical school in Baghdad the other is in dentistry school in Kirkuk. Ms. Alaunaibi calls them every day, even if only to tell them to wait. “They just cry. ‘Why this happened to us? We love the U. S. A. We want to live in the U. S. A. ,’” Ms. Alaunaibi, 45, said of their response. “You know, they are young, they are ambitious, they are smart and responsible. So this is a shock to them. ” Ms. Mohamed, the Somali mother in Clarkston, was waiting anxiously to hear whether her eldest daughter would be among those who could come. Ms. Mohamed’s family arrived in Georgia on Jan. 18, after 10 years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed her home and raped one of her daughters in front of her. Ms. Mohamed’s sister and    were killed, too, so she took in her sister’s two children, in addition to her own seven. The last of the family, Batulo Abdalla Ramadhan, 20, was scheduled to leave Kenya on Monday. But then came the ban last month. Her travel was canceled, she called to tell her parents. They could hear the grief in her voice. “She’s always asking us, ‘What do I do? ’” said Ms. Mohamed’s husband, Abdalla Ramadhan Munye. “She feels hurt that we left her behind. Only thing we can do is to listen to her and feel her pain. ” Mr. Munye said he wanted to deliver a message to the first lady, Melania Trump. “As a mother,” he said, “she knows how difficult it would be to be separated from a child. ” Sana Mustafa from Syria said her parents had encouraged her and her sister to get out of the country as soon as they could after the Syrian civil war began. Ms. Mustafa received a   fellowship funded by the State Department to visit Washington in the summer of 2013. “I applied, out of the blue, online, in the middle of the war,” she said. “My dad said, ‘Go. ’” That was one of her last conversations with him. A businessman known for his opposition to President Bashar  ’s government, her father was picked up in July 2013, while Ms. Mustafa was in Washington. Her plans changed immediately. There was no chance of going back to Syria. She slept on the sofas of strangers who took her in. She applied for political asylum in the United States, and quickly got it. To make ends meet, she worked as a hostess at a restaurant, then as a   babysitter. Through friends of friends, she landed a full scholarship at Bard College in upstate New York. She graduated last year. Her mother, Lamia Zreik, has not been as lucky. She fled with her other two daughters, Wafa and Ghena, after her husband was detained in 2013. They went to Gaziantep, Turkey  —   the border town now home to hundreds of thousands of Syrians  —   and in 2014, hoping to join Sana, applied for resettlement to the United States. They were interviewed four times  —   by United Nations officials, then by American officials. One year passed, then two. When Wafa, who had been supporting the family, got a chance to go to Germany, Ms. Zreik told her that she couldn’t possibly pass it up. “We had two options  —   either she stays or I work,” Ms. Zreik said by telephone from Gaziantep, where she works with Syrian children orphaned by the war. “And the first wasn’t really an option. ” In early January, the first bad news came: an email informing Ms. Zreik that she and her daughter would have to undergo more security screenings. Ms. Mustafa was visiting Gaziantep at the time. “Three years wasn’t enough for screening?” she said. “I was very devastated. I was actually very angry. ” For a while, neither of them told Ghena, 16, the bad news. Then came the executive order. Ms. Mustafa said Ghena had taken it the hardest. “She was very sad,” she said. “She said: ‘We’re not going anywhere. No one is taking us. ’” The family has applied for resettlement to France and Canada. Wafa, 26 and studying in Berlin, said she could not sponsor them to Germany until she could prove she could support them financially. Wafa’s own good fortune weighs on her. “I’m thinking about this every day,” she said. “I have to find a way to help my mom and my sister. ” For now, there’s no place they can be together. “I can’t express my deep anger,” Ms. Zreik said. “We are a small family. Without my husband, and each girl in a different country, we can’t see each other. ”"
"**Debenhams stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain.**
It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the chain's 124 shops cease trading.
The news comes just hours after Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.
Debenhams itself had been in administration since April. Hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder, JD Sports, withdrew.
Staff were told the news on Tuesday morning.
It's hard to see how. The department store chain had already gone into administration for a second time and is now set to enter liquidation, also known as winding-up, which means it will cease to exist as a company.
The 242-year-old retailer had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat.
However, the administrators said the outlook for a restructured operation was ""highly uncertain"" and they had therefore ""regretfully concluded"" that they should start winding up Debenhams UK, while continuing to seek offers for all or parts of the business.
There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams.
However, senior sources at Arcadia dismissed any link and told the BBC it was being blamed for the collapse of a deal that had never been agreed.
The 12,000 jobs at Debenhams are set to go over the coming months unless the administrators do a deal for all or parts of the business.
Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock.
Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them.
Geoff Rowley of FRP Advisory, joint administrator to Debenhams and Partner at FRP, said: ""All reasonable steps were taken to complete a transaction that would secure the future of Debenhams.
""However, the economic landscape is extremely challenging and, coupled with the uncertainty facing the UK retail industry, a viable deal could not be reached.""
With Debenhams to be wound down and Arcadia in administration, this is one of the blackest weeks for the British High Street and one that will have councils around the country pondering the future of their town centres.
Debenhams, which started as a single shop in central London in 1778, has withstood recessions, depression and world wars, but has succumbed finally to the twin threats of the internet and pandemic shutdowns.
It has been struggling financially since before the financial crisis, but successive restructurings have failed to find a winning formula.
In many town centres, Debenhams was one of the few sizeable anchor tenants left after the recent demise of BHS and others.
And this may not be the end of the bad news. If Arcadia were to go the way of Debenhams, it would mean another 13,000 jobs lost.
Shoppers are still able to buy items in stores and on the Debenhams website, until all the stock is sold.
Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during Black Friday, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them.
The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid.
However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund.
A supervisor who has worked at the Debenhams Bullring Birmingham store for five years said she had found out the news on a group call.
""The call was really sad. It genuinely felt like they had tried so hard and they had now lost the fight.
""Unfortunately the business is just outnumbered and the pandemic is something they, like all of us, could never have predicted,"" she told the BBC.
Retail trade union Usdaw said it was seeking urgent meetings with Debenhams' administrators and urged them to ""treat staff with fairness and dignity"".
Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said the company and its administrators had refused to engage with the union and accused them of treating staff ""appallingly"".
He added that the government needed ""a recovery plan to get the industry back on its feet"".
Former Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire told the BBC he felt ""desperately sorry"" for its employees.
He said that Debenhams had been ""caught in a straitjacket"" with too many High Street outlets on long leases.
Shoppers in Leeds raised concerns about what Debenhams stores closure would mean for the High Street.
""We won't have any shopping centres left, we'll have no town centres left if everyone shops online,"" said one shopper.
""It's been a long time coming, really,"" said another. ""It's been a long slow decline for Debenhams - it's not really changed with the times.""
In Edinburgh, one shopper said it was ""a shame"", adding: ""People are losing their jobs, It's a shop that's been there since I was born. All the girls bought their prom dresses there.""
Long-serving members of staff, or past workers, who were members of the company's two defined benefit pension schemes have been at risk for months of getting smaller pension payouts.
The two schemes - the Debenhams Retirement Scheme and the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan - have been assessed by the official rescue scheme called the Pension Protection Fund since April last year, affecting an estimated 11,000 members.
Those yet to retire, or who have retired early, could receive at least 10% less than they would have expected from their pension. If the schemes are found to be in a relatively strong financial position, they may not lose as much.
Others who have already reached pension age (thought to be about half of members) may see a smaller inflation-linked increase each year than they were promised.
More recent members of staff have a different type of pension, which they keep as a pension pot for retirement.

 _A climate skeptic answers the fiery rhetoric of the Left’s star propagandist_



[Note: Greta’s speech is reprinted below. My responses are in italics. If it turns out there were errors in transcription—as seems likely—I’ll try to update with corrections. I apologise for the snarky tone, but if a 17-year-old can dish it out, I think she can take it.]



“My message is that we’ll be watching you. This is all wrong, I shouldn’t be up here, I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.”



 _So in your first paragraph you confess that what you’re doing is wrong, and you shouldn’t be doing it. You note you should be back home and in school. OK, so far we’re 100% in agreement. Next?_



“Yet, you all come to us young people for hope, how dare you?”



 _Not sure where you’re getting your information. No sentient adult goes to young people “for hope” whether they’ve been “dared” to or otherwise. Normally, when adults consider young people like yourself, the operative word is “despair”. And if you’re unfamiliar with that word, it means “absence of hope”_.



“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words…”



 _Wow, you must have had very fragile dreams, and an even more precarious childhood, if mere empty words could steal them. Even words loaded with meaning shouldn’t be able to take down someone’s dreams that easily, if the dreams are even a little bit deeply held. But empty words? Greta, you need to find better dreams and cling to them with more determination. As for your stolen childhood, this makes me suspect you didn’t exactly win the lottery when it comes to parents, did you? Just sayin’._



“…and yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering, people are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.”



 _OK, sounds like someone’s been playing too much of the computer video game Civilization. Yes, in Sid Meier’s Civilization VI people are suffering, people are dying, and entire ecosystems are collapsing._



 _Meanwhile, back in reality, none of that is occurring. Well, none of it that is caused by human emissions of carbon dioxide at least. Greta, try to spend a few hours each day actually off your computer, so you can experience the world as it really is, not as your scary online world, and your handlers, are convincing you it must be._



“We are in the beginning of a mass extinction…”



 _Now it seems you’ve fallen into a time machine which has transported you back to the Yucatan Peninsula, sixty-five million years ago, when the comet was about to annihilate the dinosaurs. Either that or someone is doing a very good job of filling your head with utter nonsense. Shame on them, for scaring the socks off you. There is no evidence that we’re at the beginning of a mass extinction—certainly not of any life forms we care about._



“…and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?”



 _Um, did your speechwriter not know the audience you’d be addressing today? You’re speaking to diplomats in the United Nations General Assembly. There is probably no group of people on Earth less interested in economic growth than these folks. They don’t really care about money either, as they’re all on generous expense accounts and—thanks to diplomatic immunity—can park anywhere they want in Manhattan without worrying about being ticketed or towed. First rule of public speaking: Know your audience._



“For more than 30 years the science has been crystal-clear.”



 _Did you bother to look at any of that science? Thirty years ago they were saying Manhattan would be under water by now. Almost every prediction so called “climate scientists” have made during the past thirty years has failed to come true. This is not science being crystal-clear. It is shamanism being crystal-clear. You need to learn the difference. A science that is not able to make what are called “useful, non-obvious predictions” is not science. It’s religion. And I’m sorry, but you’ve become ensnared in the climate cult’s terrible clutches._



“How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.”



 _Another rule of effective speaking: don’t contradict yourself, especially within a single sentence. If the “politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight”, what exactly are you expecting these UN diplomats to do, beyond what they’re already doing? If the solutions are truly nowhere in sight, you’re certainly not going to get them from this crowd._



“You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil and that I refuse to believe.”



 _Greta, on this one, best go with “evil”. Again, you’re addressing the core members of the United Nations, arguably the most worthless organisation on the planet today. Even if they did believe something was an urgent problem, they’d not have the collective will to do anything about it. Actually, a better description than evil in this case would be “utterly f…..g worthless”. Remember, these are the very folks who commissioned the IPCC itself, and told it to make reports…every six years. You’d think if the world were about to end, reports of it happening could be slightly more frequent._



“The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. 50% may be acceptable to you but those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution, or the aspects of equity and climate justice, they also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So, a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us, we who have to live with the consequences.”



 _Are you aware that you’re quoting alarmist predictions from the very scientists who’ve yet to be right about any of their predictions? Does that not concern you?_



“How dare you pretend that this can be sold with just business as usual and some technical solutions with today’s emissions levels that remaining CO2 budgets will be entirely gone within less than 8 and a half years.”



 _Well, ignoring that the sentence itself is gibberish, what exactly are you wanting anyone to do? You just told us that there are no solutions anywhere in sight. You’re very good at saying what you’re angry about. But we haven’t yet heard the grand plan that will solve everything. If you don’t have it, do you really think these diplomats sitting in front of you do?_



“There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.”



 _Your rhetoric is slipping into the category of deranged, verbal nonsense, but I do find it interesting that you—a seventeen year old—“dare” (if we can borrow your favorite word) to tell an audience of people over twice your age, that they are insufficiently mature. Rarely does insulting your audience achieve desired results, in public speaking. Might be time to consider firing your speech writer._



“You are failing us but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now, is where we draw the line. The world is waking up and change is coming whether you like it or not.”



 _Well, if change is coming whether they like it or not, why are you even bothering to give this speech? And by the way, what change is coming? You’ve already confessed there are no solutions in sight. This would seem to suggest change is not coming, at least anytime soon. And as for the eyes of all future generations being on the UN General Assembly, good luck with that. Even the eyes of today’s generation aren’t on anything the UN General Assembly does—much less will be the eyes of all generations unto the end of time. But I’m sure the people you’re addressing right now wish they were that important._



 _Anyway, Greta, a word of advice. You’re clearly a very upset and angry young lady, with endless dedication to your goals. Rather than hurling hate-filled rhetoric at a room of old folks whom you rightly predict won’t do what you want them to do, why don’t you roll up your sleeves and try to make a difference yourself? I think we can all agree that public speaking is probably not your best contribution to the Cause. Go back to school, take some atmospheric physics, basic chemistry, and geology classes. Maybe dabble with the design of that machine that’s going to suck all the CO 2 out of the atmosphere. Trust me, it’s not yet on anyone’s drawing board. You can be the first!_



 _And a bonus. If you truly study this issue that has so captured your attention, pretty soon you’re going to learn that the whole thing is one gigantic hoax, the greatest hoax in human history, being perpetrated by the government-educational-industrial complex. You’re going to learn that pretty much everything that’s been indoctrinated into your head is false. You’re going to learn that real scientists, tens of thousands of them, have already learned this and have gone_[ _on record_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.petitionproject.org%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3UsCFXJTsqvj5gzruNYbqqB6-p1xt5Rzrgaw1mEeDxHhnr2vChWE4GKQA&h=AT1e72pu-bE2B8JgVqG90Zt8GxpNHJdc4wwgFMhKe7ws-hbXTE8K2n4hdkqpLtWC7lkUhxe_ikXgPsJRNQYaZR4hbq3omw40J4MPWuBlyOw_w71kWD-cNlwZKWtFnkYAOsETUM0PVXRMo8vf3dI) _as acknowledging it. You’re going to learn you’re being used by adults to turn you into a propagandist for shamanistic alarmism, and you’re going to realise that, because of it, you’ve been the victim of massive child abuse._



 _When you learn all this, I predict that your present anger is going to look like a calm, tranquil lake compared to how you will feel then. I predict at that point you’ll decide to write your own speech. And no matter who’s in the audience when you give it, I predict it will be scathing._

"That was fast. Two weeks after her “America First” fashion statement at the inauguration, Melania Trump emerged last weekend from the relative seclusion of her life in New York to join her husband at     a. k. a. the winter White   golf club in Florida. And as far as her sartorial language went, America was  —   well, pretty much last. On Friday, greeting the president as he disembarked from Air Force One in Palm Beach, the first lady wore a short red Givenchy cape dress. On Saturday, at a Red Cross ball, she wore a long   gown from Christian Dior (both brands connected, by the way, to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, the only foreign luxury mogul to have made a postelection pilgrimage to Trump Tower). But on Sunday, for a Super Bowl party at Trump International Golf Club, she wore leather pants from the Row, the brand of   Olsen and Ashley Olsen, and a thin knit sweater by Derek Lam, both names at New York Fashion Week. Does it matter? On one hand, Mrs. Trump has been explicit about her desire to eschew, at least for the moment, the Washington spotlight. Perhaps her clothes are a part of that, and thus the point was simply to look elegant and not to bother with more complicated billboarding. If so, she achieved that aim. However, Mrs. Trump has also said that she intends to meaningfully inhabit the role of first lady, and certainly this appearance was part of that goal. The choice of the red dress  —   which made for a compelling visual next to President Trump’s red tie as the two walked together along the tarmac  —   was consciously symbolic, according to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Mrs. Trump’s senior adviser, who said it was in honor of “National Wear Red Day, which is to highlight the importance and raise awareness about heart disease. ” So it’s not like they haven’t been thinking this through. Or that they aren’t aware of the symbolic value of dress, especially when it comes to a first lady who prefers to let her clothes do the talking. If so, there is a contradiction implicit in her choices of clothing, given her husband’s promise in his Inaugural Address that “Buy American” would be a tenet of his administration. But the    dress requirement for first ladies, historically held dear, was largely taken off the table during the Obama administration and transformed into a vehicle for   outreach. It was Mr. Trump who made it an issue again, and in a forum arguably more public, and permanent, than Twitter. When asked about the issue, Ms. Winston Wolkoff emailed the following statement: “Mrs. Trump is a proud and longtime supporter of American fashion. She appreciates fashion as art. As a former model, she has always been a patron of the world’s most distinguished designers both here and abroad. Mrs. Trump buys from an international mix of brands because that is what reflects her uniquely American life experience and style. She is more excited than ever to make a platform for American designers as she did on one of the most important weeks in history, the Inauguration, showcasing the extraordinary talents of American designers. ” In other words: Buying European is a reflection of the American shopping experience. For anyone who has walked down any main shopping street in a big American city  —   such as Fifth Avenue in New York, where Mrs. Trump lives  —   it’s hard to argue with that. Though it also seems like something of a contorted rationale, and one that could be exploited by companies seeking to relocate some factories overseas. That choice is, after all, also a part of the American industrial story. In any case, it’s worth noting that Givenchy and Dior have been playing possum since the weekend, another indication of fashion’s   relationship with Mrs. Trump. Neither fashion house issued the de rigueur news release trumpeting the first lady’s appearance in one of their dresses. Asked whether the brand had worked with the first lady on the red dress, a spokesman for Givenchy said that the company had no comment and that the dress had been purchased from a store, without any interpersonal discussion. (It is for sale on the Neiman Marcus website, among others, for $2, 095.) Dior simply did not respond. As for Mr. Lam, who in November told the fashion magazine WWD, “I really don’t see myself getting involved with the Trump presidency,” the situation pretty much shows the problem with that stance. After all, the first lady is free to buy his product, whether he wants to get involved or not. Which is another American story, of sorts."
"**Losing the Isle of Man TT is ""a massive nail in the coffin"" for the island's tourism industry, businesses have said.**
On Monday, the Manx government announced the 2021 TT Festival would not go ahead due to the ongoing pandemic.
It is the second time that Covid-19 has halted the event which is worth nearly Â£40m a year to the island's economy.
Hotelier Michael George said cancelling the festival had ""blown a hole"" in hopes the tourism sector might recover.
This year's TT event was also scrapped at the start of the pandemic to protect ""critical care services"".
In 2019, more than 46,000 people travelled to the island for the TT, spending Â£37.5m over the two weeks, a government survey found.
Guesthouse owner Gillian Salmon said next year's TT had been a ""beacon of hope"" that had been ""quashed"" by the announcement.
Hosting the event, which was due to take place from 29 May to 12 June, would have been a ""signal to the world that we are open for business"", she added.
Mr George said the decision to cancel the 2021 event was ""devastating news"" which had ""blown a bit of a hole"" into hopes that the tourism sector could start returning to normal.
Pub landlord Rob McAleer said losing the TT was a ""disaster"" but ""if we go back into a lockdown then we would be harder hit than those two weeks"".
Three support schemes for tourism businesses have been extended by a month to 30 April.
Government-backed loans have also been made available to help firms cope with the financial burden of refunding deposits.
The Manx border has been closed to most non-residents since March."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
England's month-long lockdown ends on Wednesday, with a ""three-tier system"" due to return following a vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.
All areas in the Eastern region were due to be in tier two - high alert, meaning people cannot socialise with other households indoors and the rule-of-six applies outdoors.
In Essex, the case rate in Basildon was the 16th highest in England in the week to 27 November and had risen week on week.
Essex County Council said the district was ""a growing concern"".
Data from the council suggested up to 40% of cases may be related to schools, but the authority said it did not know whether the infections occurred within school or the wider community.
The county council said testing kits will be offered to parents in neighbourhoods with the greatest number of cases to test their children.
Basildon Council's leader, Labour's Gavin Callaghan, has called for the district's schools to close from 11 December to curb infection rates.
Harlow has also seen its rate rise and it has the 55th highest case rate in England.
Thurrock, Castle Point and Epping Forest, where the rate has fallen, were all also above the England-wide average.
In Norfolk, all districts have seen rates fall, except Broadland and North Norfolk, which previously had one of the lowest in the country.
Ipswich continues to see a week-on-week rise in case rates, but all other districts in Suffolk continue to fall.
Below is a table showing the rate of cases per 100,000 people across council districts in Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk in the week to 27 November, and the figure at the same point a week ago.

Earlier this month, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced that it had broken up a ring that smuggled millions of packs of cigarettes from Virginia to New Jersey, where state officials estimate that bootleg cigarettes constitute 40 percent of the market.



“The trafficking of contraband tobacco is all about greed from the enormous profits that can be made by engaging in such criminal activity” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew Horace.



The illicit cigarette trade and the crime that accompanies it have plagued the Garden State for decades. Here’s a question for legislators considering hiking Minnesota’s cigarette tax: What do they think creates this problem?



It is taxes, of course. For years, New Jersey has levied one of the highest cigarette taxes in the country.



Today it is $2.70 per pack, near the level to which State Sen. Carla Nelson and state Rep. Mike Benson, both Republicans, have proposed hiking the Minnesota excise ($2.52).



At this rate, bootleggers would be able to earn more than $1 million on every truckload of cigarettes smuggled into the state.



Like New Jersey, Minnesota has long had problems with cigarette‐​tax evasion. Trouble began shortly after the state enacted its cigarette tax in 1947. Soon smokers began crossing into neighboring states to secure their nicotine fix.



Others began buying tax‐​exempt cigarettes at military bases and on American Indian lands. Still others purchased tax‐​free cigarettes via mail order. More ominously, criminals began to smuggle cigarettes into the state, mixing them into the retail market.



By the mid‐​1950s, official figures show, the sale of legal, tax‐​paid cigarettes had plunged 20 percent below the national level. Frustrated by the inability to collect the taxes due, the state’s chief cigarette tax administrator quipped that “even the attorneys who come into my office are smoking untaxed cigarettes.”



The state government’s response was to increase enforcement and try to discourage consumers from buying tax‐​free cigarettes, but nothing worked. In spite of this, lawmakers repeatedly hiked the tax, and by the mid‐​1970s, Minnesota had one of the highest cigarette excises in the country. Soon illegal cigarettes from as far away as Kentucky and North Carolina were pouring into the state.



Minnesota was far from alone in its battle with the illicit tobacco trade. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, high‐​tax states across the country were inundated with contraband, and in 1975, the federal government released a major report on cigarette bootlegging.



It described the smuggling problem in Minnesota as one of the worst in the country and estimated that nearly 15 percent of the cigarettes consumed in the state were the product of bootlegging.



Commenting on the report, then Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue Arthur Roemer noted that cigarette bootlegging deprived states of millions of dollars in tax revenue, corrupted government officials and encouraged a wide range of criminal activity.



The massive tax evasion and ancillary crime that came with it tempered legislators’ enthusiasm for additional tax hikes for much of the next decade, and by 1985 inflation had effectively lowered the cigarette excise to levels not seen in decades.



This reduced the incentive to evade the tax, and sales of legal cigarettes in Minnesota rose to record levels by mid‐​decade. Unfortunately, lawmakers’ memories are woefully short when it comes to the harmful effects of excessive cigarette taxes.



A series of hikes in the late 1980s and early 1990s raised the tax to 48 cents by 1992. Not surprisingly, taxed sales fell as smuggling and border‐​shopping surged.



The latest series of hikes, which began in 2005, have pushed the per pack tax to $1.58. A 2009 report commissioned by the Department of Revenue found that the state government loses millions of dollars annually to cigarette tax evasion.



These losses do not include those incurred by the private sector, such as those resulting from lost sales and increased thefts.



Nelson and Benson defend their proposal by arguing that the funds raised by hiking the cigarette tax will allow the government to improve education and the business climate in the state.



If such broad public benefit is possible, doesn’t tax equity call for the reliance on a broad‐​based tax — such as one on income, property or sales — rather than one that falls on just a small, relatively low‐​income subset of the population?



The history of cigarette taxation in Minnesota clearly shows that adherence to this simple principle would not only improve fairness, it would go a long way in improving tax administration and respect for the law in the state.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs much as an entire array of forces attempted to prevent it, the PRP special edition journal with its 12 peer-reviewed papers that offer an alternative explanation on what contributes to driving climate is coming out – and how!
Ironically, the intense efforts to silence the journal have backfired – the special edition has been receiving widespread exposure rather than being silenced.
Unsurprisingly the dubious attempts to silence the publication have met with loud and harsh objections, see here, here, here, here and here.
The problems began when 19 scientists declared that the special issue shedded “serious doubts” on the conclusions of the IPCC.
That didn’t sit well with publisher Copernicus director Martin Rasmussen, who had come under intense pressure from the climate establishment and took the unbelievable decision to close down the entire journal immediately and “without any discussion with the editors“.
“Inquisition and book burning”

Distinguished Swedish scientist Prof. Nils-Axel Mörner, the former head of the Paleogeophysics and Geodynamics department at Stockholm University, and the PRP special edition journal editor, has now issued a statement here (last page) on the events leading up to politically motivated cancellation of the journal.
By this decision, we were suddenly thrown back in the evolution of humanism and culture to the stage of inquisition and books burning. […]
To debate is a vital part of science. To forbid and even close down a journal because of an inevitable conclusion which “sheds serious doubts on the issue of a continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC” is most unscientific and unethical.
Copernicus has disgraced itself in this desperate act of trying to cover up for IPCC.”
Nils-Axel Mörner was also president of the International Union for Quaternary Research Commission on Neotectonics and has authored close to 600 peer-reviewed papers.
Entire special journal here. 
Now comes the journal’s real test. Let’s wait to see what the “real experts” say about it.

"The modern world depends on the smooth provision of vital services such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, food, water and healthcare. But the systems underpinning these sectors are increasingly complex and interdependent, interacting at a global scale – which makes them susceptible to potentially catastrophic failures when they come under stress. The recent blackout in the UK is a good example. While relatively brief, this outage – caused by the simultaneous failure of two generators, a gas-fired plant in Barford and the Hornsea offshore wind farm – left almost 1m people in England and Wales without power and caused widespread traffic disruption. In South America, 48m people were left without power in June after violent storms knocked out the network. In the US, the California Utility company is resorting to blackouts during high-risk periods to prevent wildfires after the recent loss of life, suggesting that the ageing electrical infrastructure was the cause of the wildfires. These events occurred against a backdrop of the inevitable changes in energy supply, which require changes in the way systems are monitored and managed. Earlier this year the UK government announced its plans for a revolution in offshore wind energy which aims to provide a third of all UK electricity by 2030. These new offshore wind farms will consist of larger wind turbines further offshore and 10-12 MW generators, and will become a significant contributor to the UK energy mix. Through this deal, the offshore wind industry plans to almost quadruple our wind energy generation capacity from 7.9 gigawatts to at least 30GW by 2030. The UK is already at the forefront of offshore wind, with more capacity than any other country, some of the biggest offshore wind farms and the most powerful turbines. Yet, as recent events showed, losing just two generators simultaneously can cause significant disruption. This underscores how much this development requires new techniques for lifetime management, monitoring and control of offshore wind assets. It also shows the need for novel “demand-side response” techniques – that is, ways of using electricity intelligently during periods of high demand. Researchers in a variety of disciplines have an important role to play in supporting this vision. We are the academic lead for the UK’s largest whole system and energy system integration project, called Reflex (Responsive Flexibility). This seeks to explore how we can create a resilient, sustainable and low-carbon energy infrastructure that supports society’s vital services.  To connect offshore renewable generation to the mainland grid, we require an expensive network of subsea power cables. For example, the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) NorthConnect project required an investment of over £1.2 bn for a single subsea power cable installation. Clearly, the expense of these assets limits our ability to factor in elements often present in power networks, such as installing back-up cables in case the main power link fails. So how do we safeguard our energy infrastructure with so much emphasis on offshore wind? We believe the solution will involve a partnership between people, Artificial Intelligence and robotics. We need robotics to improve our ability to monitor and maintain these assets which in the future will be achieved through persistent autonomy. This means robots being left in-situ with the ability to monitor and maintain themselves and offshore wind farms. With unprecedented levels of data from a variety of sources such as structural monitoring systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, environmental monitoring and so on, the need for advanced AI to support critical operational decision making is vital. In this situation, human beings would simply become overwhelmed by the volume of data and information at their disposal. But people working in tandem with robot and AI assistants will be a core feature of how we manage our future offshore infrastructure during this transition to an energy supply dominated by wind. One example of how we are doing this relates to our research in dolphin-inspired low-frequency sonar to support autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in assessing the integrity of subsea power. The AUV removes the need to deploy human divers in this dangerous environment, and the low-frequency sonar analysis provides critical measurements that complement the AI assistant on land, so that it can accurately forecast the condition of the power cable. In the future we foresee widespread integration of subsea docking stations as well as floating command and control centres, where the security of our subsea and surface wind turbine infrastructure is maintained by patrolling robotic platforms capable of inspection and repair. AI and robotics have advanced significantly in recent years and in collaboration with human operators they can enable us to be more responsive so that we can adapt to rare events such as extreme weather conditions or the threat of sabotage or interference to subsea cables. The challenge will be in how we intelligently manage these remote assets in order to keep the costs down and the lights on."

More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday if the plans are approved.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he recognised restrictions needed to continue, but he was ""far from convinced"" the new system will work, and economic help for firms was ""nowhere near sufficient"".
But, defending his decision to order his MPs to abstain, meaning they will not vote for or against, he said it was ""not in the national interest"" for his party to join Tory rebels and vote against the new tiers.
Votes in the Commons need a bit of mathsâ¦
Ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said he recognised hospitality had ""borne a disproportionate share of the burden"" during the crisis, and confirmed an extra Â£40m for some pubs in tiers two and three.
The money will be distributed via councils to so-called ""wet pubs"" - those that don't serve food and so are the most affected by the highest levels of coronavirus restrictions.
The prime minister told MPs that the government could not ""move too quickly"" to end restrictions before a working vaccine is available.
He said he appreciated the ""feeling of injustice"" many feel at their tier allocation, and pledged to ""look in granular detail"" at the ""human geography"" of the virus when the tiers are reviewed in two weeks' time.
The government has promised MPs the chance to vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February.
The government announced last week that its tougher three tiers to tackle the virus would come into force when England's current lockdown ends in the early hours of Wednesday.
It will allow ministers to place areas into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - but the majority of the population will face the higher range of restrictions.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, is among those to confirm he will vote against the new tiers later.
He told MPs the government had made ""no serious attempt"" to forecast the economic effects of the restrictions, and his Altrincham and Sale constituency, which is in Greater Manchester, had been ""unfairly"" put in tier 3.
And Damian Green, the MP for Ashford in Kent, expressed concerns about the UK's plan to loosen restrictions for five days over Christmas, saying the country must avoid exchanging a ""weekend of fun for a long winter of regret"".
Several Labour MPs, including Richard Burgon, Emma Lewell-Buck, and Graham Stringer, have said they will defy Sir Keir's orders and vote against the system.
Mr Johnson and the government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, addressed a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs - including members of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) - about an hour before the vote.
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the PM made a plea for unity, but did not offer any concessions on calls for county or borough-level restrictions, rather than tiers covering whole regions.
The PM was also pressed on how genuine the review of tiers promised on 16 December would be, added our correspondent.
Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh said he would vote with the government with ""deep reluctance,"" calling the tier system a ""compromise"".
""How can I vote against this measure tonight when there is no alternative plan, when the result of my vote tonight is that frail and vulnerable people will die,"" he asked.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs.
The SNP said it would abstain as the measures only affect England but the DUP's Sammy Wilson said he would vote against, describing the government's approach as ""Project Fear on steroids"".
The Federation of Small Businesses said the support for pubs was totally inadequate as it would only cover the cost of 200 pints or roughly a single keg of beer.
On Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 603 people in the UK have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, bringing the official total to 59,051.
Government figures also show that as of 9am on Tuesday, there have been a further 13,430 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK."
"**A large gathering of vehicles in Merthyr Tydfil is being investigated by police.**
Officers from South Wales Police went to the Leisure Village on Sunday evening to move the vehicles on and disperse the crowd.
They are now reviewing footage captured on body-worn cameras to identify those who attended.
Anyone identified faces a Section 59 warning, a fixed penalty notice and risks having their vehicle seized.
Insp Jonathan Duckham, from the local policing team, said: ""The large gathering caused a significant amount of concern for residents and disrupted local roads.
""What happened was a blatant disregard for the current restrictions which prevent people gathering in that manner and anybody identified will be appropriately dealt with.
""We will be increasing patrols and monitoring the area and will not hesitate to take action should any further incidents occur."""

The legacy of Franklin Roosevelt is harming American science.



At the end of World War II, President Roosevelt asked Vannevar Bush, who oversaw the explosively successful Manhattan Project, if there was a way that the horde of scientists recruited to produce The Bomb could somehow be kept in government employment.



Within eight months, Bush sketched out a blueprint in which the Universities, not the government, would be the employers, but that the pay, either for faculty or for hired researchers, would actually originate from federal science agencies, cabinet departments, or the clandestines.



The consequences were obvious. Universities charge 50 percent overhead on federal grants, using these profitable science Department monies to pay for unprofitable Art and Music Departments. The seeds of political correctness—which requires big, expensive, expansive government—were planted as the schools became addicted to federal welfare.





The search for knowledge has become the search for funding, and funding agencies tend to frown upon negative results.



Under unforgiving competition to secure funding for their institutions (and promotion for themselves) some scientists are behaving badly.



Last week, a technical publication, _Journal of Vibration and Control_ , retracted _sixty_ papers, after an internal investigation revealed a fraudulent “peer review and citation process” that greased the skids for a small number of authors to have an enormous number of citations in what is a prestigious engineering specialty. At least one of the authors even managed to review his own papers under an alias.



That’s symptomatic of a larger sickness raging in what should be our most sacrosanct of institutions. If we can no longer trust science, what do we have as the basis for knowledge?



It is a fact that the policy world—particularly the environmental policy world—claims to base policies on “science,” such as the reports of United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s periodical “National Assessments” of the impact of climate change on our country.



These influential documents are essentially large reviews of a voluminous scientific literature. The tragedy is that literature is being insidiously poisoned by the incentive structure for science itself.



The evidence is increasingly compelling. University of Montreal’s Danielle Fanelli has written several comprehensive reviews of the content of published science and he found, in the last twenty years, that the number of “positive” results is increasing dramatically. That’s when the data confirm a proposed hypothesis rather than suggesting rejection or modification.



In a real world where scientists are answering real questions, that would be impossible. People have not suddenly become smarter, except, perhaps at how to advance in academia. There, candidates for promotion in the sciences are basically asked two questions: What did you publish, and how much taxpayer money did you bring in to support your research?



If an Assistant Professor, up for tenure, answers either insufficiently, he’s likely to be looking for another job. It’s amazing how many of these wind up staffing Congressional Committees, or better yet, on programmatic committees for the big science agencies.



The money part is of paramount importance. At a tier‐​one University, to publish the requisite number of papers for promotion in, say, the Environmental Sciences, probably requires a minimum of $2.5 million. That’s a lot of overhead for the Germanic Languages Department.



Does anyone seriously think that a young researcher is going to get that kind of funding by going to federal agencies with a proposal that global warming’s amount and effects have been dramatically overblown (as they have)? The mere proposal threatens to derail everyone else’s gravy train. It won’t get funded, and the researcher soon won’t be paid.



Dr. John Loannidis, now at Stanford, may have been the first person to detect the illness when he wrote, in 2005, a then‐​iconoclastic paper, “Why most Published Research Findings are False”. His thesis is the demands to publish and get funding are so strong that many studies are poorly designed in order to force a positive result and rapid publication.



Since then, the number of retracted papers has gone through the roof. The winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Randy Scheckman—on the eve of his award—wrote a _Guardian_ op‐​ed, “How journals like Nature, Cell and Science are damaging science”, and he vowed to never send them another manuscript.



Scheckman noted that publishing in _Nature_ and _Science_ is a ticket to tenure and enhanced research funding, but that these two magazines—the most “impactful” science magazines on earth, gravitate towards “flashy” science to draw attention themselves (and thereby inflating their “impact factors”). This is done at the expense the day‐​to‐​day grind science that is perhaps more important, but won’t land you on CNN. Knowing this, people will gravitate towards flashy fields, like global warming, at the expense of others, and burning our scientific talent for a mess of pottage.



So the search for knowledge has become the search for funding, and funding agencies tend to frown upon negative results. Who is seriously going to get a federal grant that can ultimately diminish the power of the federal government? No, instead we read in the recent _National Assessment_ , silly positive associations, like global warming is associated with more mental illness. This can only mean that people in Richmond are loonier than here in Washington DC, and that they must be crazy in Miami.



That makes about as much sense as compromising science to serve the federal funding behemoth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the online Spiegel here, science journalist Axel Bojanowski writes about the 15-year pause in global warming, which Nature here calls “the biggest mystery in climate science.”
Bojanowski describes a situation where scientists have been taken aback by the unexpected pause, and are now scrambling for a way to explain it, or to deny that it even exists. Some “sense a campaign” behind the claims of a warming pause and say the media is overhyping it. The warming continues, some scientists insist. There’s been “a breakdown in the communication” of the science, Spiegel quotes other warmist scientists.
The problem that Spiegel describes seems to be one where the observed data was allowed to speak for itself to the public before the scientists ever got the chance to repackage it to their liking.
Spiegel writes, quoting Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading:
Since 1990 in its 5 reports the UN IPCC failed somewhat to provide clear details over the possibilities of a slowdown in warming. Studies on this were ‘first published after the pause’.”
Bojanowski looks into why this is so. In a nutshell: That a slowdown in warming was possible never even occurred to the scientists. Reality caught them with their pants down.

He writes:
Climate models had never expected the pause: Only 3 of 114 climate simulations were able to reproduce the trend of the past years, the IPCC concludes in its latest report. The reason for the deviation between models and observations is unclear.”
Bojanowski then presents some of the explanations now being floated for the “pause”: volcanoes, Pacific trade winds, heat hidden deep in the ocean, PDO, solar activity, Chinese air pollution, and even “faulty” methodology for computing the global temperature (it’s warming after all).
At the end he quotes University of Colorado environmental sociologist Maxwell Boykoff, who offers climate scientists a little advice on communicating the science:
Our studies have shown which strategies promise no success: vindictive, condescending and dogmatic lecturings.”

Jacinda’s reception at the UN this year was not as starlit as it was in 2018. She was a novelty last year. The gloss does seem to be wearing off nowadays for Jacinda, as she pursues pet projects such as trying to control the internet, which nobody other than her, thinks has any realistic chance of succeeding. She has also been put in charge of a climate committee, which would probably be considered as a huge honour if it were not for the fact that the other countries on the committee are… well… either small fry or hypocrites.



You decide.



What a triumph – no, what a joke this woman is!!



But Matthew Hooton in his weekly article in our favourite newspaper has called for Jacinda to return to earth and deal with some of the problems back home.



Tuesday’s Herald Mood of the Boardroom survey suggests a business community much glummer than recent data justifies.



Even though most indicators are heading in the wrong direction, NZIER’s consensus forecasts are still far from dire. Growth is expected to remain in the 2-3 per cent range for the next three years, unemployment will sit around 4 per cent and wages will rise faster than inflation, which will stay low but above zero.



Hooton takes a very optimistic approach to the economy in the short term. With the business policies of this government and the uncertain global position, it is quite likely that growth will fall away much more rapidly than he seems to think.



Despite this, the Mood of the Boardroom indicates the lowest business confidence since the global financial crisis. This is consistent with ANZ’s August business confidence survey, down another 8 points to negative 52 per cent, with firms’ own expectations also falling into negative territory.



Employment, investment and export intentions are all dismal. Even consumer confidence, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern believes is more important, languishes below its historic average.



Consumer confidence does not always fall immediately, and with interest rates at historic lows, some confidence will be found in the fact that money has never been cheaper. But consumer confidence can turn on a dime.



The prevailing negative mood demands another explanation.



Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr and his Monetary Policy Committee must be among the villains. As the Mood of the Boardroom indicated, August’s surprise 0.50 per cut in the Official Cash Rate (OCR) to a mere 1 per cent was meant to boost the economy but ended up spooking investors.



Interest rates have fallen too low for further cuts to mean anything real. Besides, most people understand that very low interest rates do not indicate a healthy economy. They may be a nice-to-have, but they are not a sign of good times ahead. 



Most rowdily, farmers feel under attack on multiple fronts including the proposed Zero Carbon Bill, the planned inclusion of agriculture in the Emissions Trading Scheme and David Parker’s radical water quality reforms.  
This rural revolt has plunged agricultural confidence down to a horrifying negative 68 per cent even though farmers are the most positive group about their own activity. 



Similarly, the oil, gas and wider minerals industries may be completely wrong that August’s draft Government Resources Strategy and Cabinet paper on the review of the Crown Minerals Act indicates Ardern wants an end to all extractive industries in the very near future. 



Is Matthew Hooton being a touch sardonic here, do you think?



**The Government’s own recklessness is the chief cause of negative sentiment taking hold in these two major export earners.**



Got it in one.



For Ardern, the Mood of the Boardroom suggests the abject failure of KiwiBuild and the sluggishness of infrastructure projects have had a wider effect. Even the Government’s failure to shift the tax burden away from wages and operating profits towards capital gains sent an adverse message about competence.



Ardern should be concerned that junior minister Kris Faafoi, is ranked her Government’s top performer. While Faafoi has done a perfectly adequate job, what does his ranking suggest about the competence of the rest?



We all know the answer to that. They are a bunch of incompetent fools.



This matters. According to another leading polling firm, CT New Zealand, only 9 per cent of New Zealanders are very confident that Ardern’s team could competently manage a major economic downturn if — as seems likely — one is on its way from abroad. Nothing better explains the degree of economic disquiet. 



9%. Really? I am surprised that so many think her government is capable of anything.



Once again, Ardern has done a superb job on the world stage this week, charming even Trump. She urgently needs to apply those skills to instil a sense in New Zealand that her Government knows what it is doing domestically.



This is not primarily about her re-election, although it is of course linked. The real problem is that if Ardern can’t get New Zealand business out of the dumps, a dangerous decline in the actual economic outlook looks certain.



  
I don’t think she has done a superb job on the world stage this week. I think she was overshadowed by Greta Thunberg, which must hurt Jacinda badly. But it is time for Jacinda to focus on domestic issues. Building houses. Ihumateo. The flailing economy. Homelessness. **The Labour sex scandal.** There is plenty for her to focus on at home.



But as we all know, Jacinda is the mistress of nothing more than photoshoots. She is incapable of doing anything real. Even at the UN this year, she has been downgraded from person of interest to minor celebrity.



It is true that Jacinda needs to deal with problems at home, but there is little chance of her doing it. She is simply incapable of doing anything real. She has no idea how to solve any of the problems that we are beset with today.

"São Paulo – the largest city in the western hemisphere – was recently plunged into darkness in the middle of the day due to smoke from the Amazon rainforest burning more than 2,700km (1,700 miles) away. These fires have brought global attention to the forests of South America, but the crisis surrounding them has deep roots. To understand what is happening in the Amazon today, it’s necessary to understand how deeply exploitation of the forest, and the Indigenous peoples who live within it, are ingrained in the global economy.   The first Portuguese explorers arrived in Brazil on April 22 1500. The region didn’t at first appear to offer the gold or silver that was to make Central America a tempting target for colonisers, but it did present a more obvious asset: vast forests with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of timber.

      Amazon in flames: Brazil's Huni Kuin indigenous people count the social costs of fire and conflict


 The region’s Brasilwood trees produced a valuable red dye, and with the colour red in fashion in the French court, Brazil’s forests quickly became a target for profit-minded Europeans. Brasilwood was so prevalent before colonisation that it lent its name to the country. But after centuries of overharvesting, these trees are now a highly endangered species. Indigenous peoples were initially incentivised to help harvest timber in exchange for European goods. But eventually the native peoples were enslaved and made to destroy the forests which had provided the wood for their homes and the game and plants for their diet. Once cleared of trees, land was turned into plantations to grow labour-hungry cash crops such as sugar, encouraging the enslavement of yet more Indigenous people. When they proved too few in number, vast numbers of people were taken from Africa and forced into slavery alongside them. The Mata Atlântica, a vast tropical forest which stretched down the east coast of the country and well into its interior, was an obvious target for the seafaring colonisers, who needed to ensure the materials they harvested could be easily transported to overseas markets.   But the environmental cost of this process was massive. As much as 92% of the Mata Atlântica has been destroyed over the past 500 years, erasing the places in which hundreds of distinct cultures evolved over the preceding millennia. Vast numbers of species disappeared along with it. In the 19th century, the British cleared yet more forest to establish rubber plantations. Despite officially being keen to encourage the abolition of slavery, the British-owned Peruvian Amazon Company violently forced Indigenous people into servitude. The anthropologist Wade Davis would later comment that The horrendous atrocities that were unleashed on the Indian people of the Amazon during the height of the rubber boom were like nothing that had been seen since the first days of the Spanish Conquest. The American industrialist Henry Ford founded a rubber-producing town deep in the Amazon rainforest in 1928. He hoped to “develop that wonderful and fertile land” to produce the rubber his company needed for car tires, valves and gaskets. Fordlândia, as it became known, was abandoned in 1934. By the middle of the 20th century, the size of the Indigenous population first encountered by the Portuguese had shrunk by 80-90%. Meanwhile, the global demand for beef accelerated the destruction of South American forests to free up new grazing land. Global brands, such as McDonalds, have been linked with Brazilian beef, half of which is produced on lands which were once rainforest. Just as demand for sugar and rubber fuelled historic slavery, the global appetite for beef drives deforestation and displaces Indigenous people today. The current crisis in the Amazon began with illegal gold miners, loggers, and farmers setting fires to clear lands for new enterprises. This process has been promoted and celebrated by the government of Jair Bolsonaro and the country’s powerful agribusiness sector. Already dislocated people face an increasingly grave situation. This is especially true for uncontacted groups who’ve yet to cultivate biological resistance to the diseases which outsiders can introduce, or develop the cultural experience necessary to navigate today’s complex political landscape. Many of Brazil’s Indigenous cultures are completely oriented around their forests. In the modern era, their belief systems endure in groups such as the Kaingang, a part of the Gê peoples who occupied the southern parts of the Amazon rainforest and lived throughout the Mata Atlântica. They must actively nurture and protect these beliefs in the face of tremendous outside pressure. Unlike in the US, dense forests and unmapped locations, not to mention uncontacted peoples, ensure continuity between the earliest days of European colonisation and modern Brazil. Indigenous peoples have shown remarkable strength and resilience against more than 500 years of colonialist attack. But they remain vulnerable to an insatiable global economy which profits from the destruction of South American forests and the people who live within them. The recent fires are simply the most recent chapter in a much longer story."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the MS Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel firmly embedded in ice and costs of the mammoth rescue effort mounting, the “scientific” Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE) led by Professor Chris Turney has morphed into a debacle that has put dozens of lives and property at risk. In under-estimating the world’s harshest environment and through slipshod planning and short cuts taken in a bid to keep costs down, expedition organizers may have recklessly and negligently put the lives of the 74 passengers in jeopardy. 
The purpose of the AAE expedition was to take a science team of 36 women and men south to discover just how much change has taken place at Mawson Station over 100 years. The expedition was also intended to replicate the original AAE led by explorer Sir Douglas Mawson a century ago, in 1913. The new expedition was to be led by Prof. Chris Turney, a publicity-hungry professor of climate change at Australia’s University of New South Wales.

Source: AAE
Also the expedition was designed to generate lots of publicity. Along the scientists and ship’s crew were 4 journalists from leading media outlets who would feed news regularly, and later report extensively on the results and findings. All this in turn would bring loads of attention to a region that is said to be threatened by global warming. The AAE’s donation website even states that the expedition’s purpose is to collect data and that the findings are “to reach the public and policy makers as soon as possible“.
But expeditions of this type are expensive and funding is not always easy to come by. Costs can run in the millions as special equipment is needed to handle the extremely harsh conditions of the South Pole. Downplaying the conditions to justify cost-cutting by using lower grade equipment rapidly jeopardizes safety.
Inadequate, bargain-price research vessel
The first error expedition leaders made was under-estimating the prevailing sea ice conditions at Mawson Station, their destination. The scientists seemed to be convinced that Antarctica was a warmer place today than it had been 100 years earlier, and thus perhaps they could expect less sea ice there. This in turn would allow them to charter a lighter, cheaper vessel.
This seems to be the case judging by their choice of seafaring vessel. They chartered a Russian vessel MS Akademik Shokalskiy, an ice-strengthened ship built in Finland in 1982. According to Wikipedia the ship has two passenger decks, with dining rooms, a bar, a library, and a sauna, and accommodates 54 passengers and a crew of up to 30. Though it is ice-reinforced, it is not an ice-breaker. This is a rather surprising selection for an expedition to Antarctica, especially in view that the AAE website itself expected to travel through areas that even icebreakers at times are unable to penetrate, as we are now vividly witnessing. Perhaps the price for chartering the Russian vessel was too good to pass up.
Luring naïve tourists as a source of cash
What made the expedition even more dubious is that Turney and his team brought on paying tourists in what appears to have been an attempt to help defray the expedition’s costs and to be a source of cheap labor. According to the AAE website, the expedition was costed at US$1.5 million, which included the charter of the Akademik Shokalskiy to access the remote locations. “The site berths on board are available for purchase.” Prices start at $8000!
The expedition brought with it 4 journalists, 26 paying tourists.
Here it seems that the obvious risks and hazards of bringing tourists to the world’s harshest environment in a budget-priced vessel unable to handle ice-breaking may have been brushed aside, or at least played down. Was this reckless on the part of the expedition? That Antarctica is a harsh environment was in fact known to expedition leader Chris Turney: Bild online here quotes Turney: “In the Antarctic the conditions are so extreme that you can never make forecasts.” Is this an environment you’d want to bring unfamiliar tourists in – on a vessel that cannot even break ice?
As an expedition to Antarctica is nothing less than an extreme adventure in every sense, employing guides who are highly trained professionals would seem a must when tourists are involved. Scientists are not tour guides. Many of the passengers were there for the very first time and had zero experience with the region’s conditions. It seems reckless to me.
“Polar Party-Ship”
Signs showing the crew didn’t understand the region’s harshness
The 5-week expedition started off relatively smoothly, but by Christmas Eve events turned for the worse and took the scientists by surprise. A thick layer of sea ice is claimed to have come out from nowhere and trapped the Akademik Shokalskiy after departure.

At times it appeared Turney tried to deny the trouble he was in, even putting on a festive face. At times he pretended the weather was fine and that it was warm outside. Moreover, the media was on Turney’s side, and they actively provided a fog to hide the debacle from the public.
Even as costs for the rescue efforts ran up and international rescue teams scrambled, putting their own lives and limbs at risk, Turney and the passengers partied like it was spring break. German Bild here describes an eerily manic atmosphere, calling it the “Party Polar Ship“:
Things are going so fantastically well here that I’ve already made a million photos“, said Alicia Guerrero. “The mood on board is fantastic; we’re dancing on the ice.“
Bild adds:
It seems like nothing absolutely matters to them, being trapped in bitter cold nowhere.”
Defying reality, Turney insists Antarctic sea ice is shrinking
Why the vessel got trapped in the first place may be because Turney never bothered to look at sea ice charts, which showed near record high levels of sea ice surrounding Antarctica. Also, Turney even denied that the overall sea ice trend was expanding around the continent. Fox News writes:

Turney said it was ‘silly’ to suggest he and 73 others aboard the MV Akademic Shokalskiy were trapped in ice they’d sought to prove had melted. He remained adamant that sea ice is melting, even as the boat remained trapped in frozen seas.”
Did he expect to find less ice than Mawson did 100 years earlier? This appears to be what he expected, given his expedition’s planning.
Lacked reliable weather forecasting?
Moreover it seems they lacked competent weather forecasting services. Why wasn’t it possible to see the massive sea ice coming? In the harshest environment on the planet one would think expert local weather forecasting is absolutely essential. There was no one on board who could give weather and sea ice forecasts?
It begins to dawn on Turney
By December 30, having been stuck in 3-meter thick sea ice for almost a week, Turney seemed to be coming to terms with the dire reality and that his expedition had seriously underestimated the conditions, putting his team and the tourists in jeopardy.
At the Spirit of Mawson website here he posted:
It has been a sobering week. At the time we were initially caught by the sea ice, the Shokalskiy was just 2 to 4 nautical miles from open water. Now the sea ice distance has become even greater with the continued winds from the east, putting our nearest point of exit at some 16 nautical miles.”
Later on, rather than blaming shoddy planning, Turney blames iceberg calving from the continent colliding with the extended tongue of the Mertz Glacier for changing the sea ice conditions in the region.

Failure to forecast ice movement. Chart: AAD/ACE CRC Sea Ice Group in Hobart
He writes:
This has been revealed by new satellite imagery which arrived today from the AAD/ACE CRC Sea Ice Group in Hobart, Tasmania.”
It’s as if this was the first satellite image of ice they had looked at. It’s a mystery how there was no one was on board to monitor sea ice activity and that no one saw it coming. Turney also told FoxNews.com:
We were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
That sort of thing normally happens to those who neglect monitoring weather forecasts, sea ice charts and real conditions.  They can predict the climate for the year 2100 but not tomorrow’s wind and sea ice motion?
Turney likes having it both ways
And when the Australian icebreaker gave up trying to reach the research vessel because of a snowstorm, he called the storm “shocking” – as if it were something he had never experienced. Clearly Turney likes having it both ways: On one hand, depending on the occasion, things are warming and comfy in Antarctica and so it’s no problem bringing tourists along on joy ride in a regular ship, but on the other hand, when things go wrong, it’s always because of “extreme, unpredictable conditions” and so it isn’t his fault.
In way over his head
When operating in the world’s most hazardous regions, there’s no excuse for not working doubly diligently. Clearly Turney’s expedition completely underestimated the task at hand and he now finds himself in it way over his head. Though he tries to put on a festive face, his troubles in fact may be only beginning.
My guess is that he’s going to have lots of explaining to do and with lots of tough questions coming from some really tough people. We’re talking about having put the lives of dozens of people’s and property at risk – never mind the tab for the international rescue efforts with heavy equipment. Was it a good idea to travel in ship in a region that clearly even icebreakers are at times unable to navigate? Can scientists be expected to babysit tourists and half-witted journalists while doing their work? Why was there no competent weather forecasting? Can you blame the unexpected for every thing that goes wrong? Was the focus too much on publicity, and not enough on safety?
Out of the ice – and now in hot water
In private industry the CEO responsible for such a costly debacle would be in tons of hot water by now. The fine print in the contracts now becomes important: Who was responsible for what? There are some big bills to pay.
Turney and the expedition would be well-advised to find competent legal counsel very quickly. His websites and entries are rich in excuses, denials and admissions. There are going to be lots of big bills to settle. More importantly, hopefully fundamental measures will be implemented in the future so that such similar life-threatening fiascos don’t happen again.
Sweeping the matter under the rug and attempting to laugh it off is an invitation for the next debacle. If Turney-like expeditions are allowed to continue, the Antarctic will soon turn into a junkyard of sunken ships and toxic waste.

"The Australian government has told parliament it does not intend to increase its climate change commitment before the next major international meeting, and is not due to set a new target until 2025. The statement was made after the British host of the meeting, Boris Johnson, and United Nations secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, urged all countries to lift their targets to include net zero emissions by 2050, noting 121 nations had already done so.  Labor’s Pat Conroy asked Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, in February whether Australia was due under the Paris agreement to submit a new or updated commitment this year and, if not, when it was expected. In a written response on May 12, Taylor said the government planned to “recommunicate” its current commitment – known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC) – before a UN climate conference in Glasgow, which has been postponed until next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Taylor said Australia’s next commitment, including a target for 2035 or 2040, was not due until 2025. Analyses have found Australia’s commitment – a 26% to 28% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels – is not enough to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. The government received advice in 2015 from the Climate Change Authority that its fair share under a meaningful global deal over that time would be a 45% to 63% cut. Mark Butler, Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, said the answer showed the Morrison government was not serious about the Paris agreement or protecting Australians from the dangerous impacts of climate change. “Their climate policy is still centred around funnelling billions of taxpayers dollars to big polluters and they are still arguing for the construction of a new coal-fired power station,” he said. “If they were serious about action on climate change, they would take the advice of scientists, the international community, experts, industry and business, who have called for a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Having a target would frame policy decisions and give investors confidence.” In a statement on Monday night, a spokesman for Taylor said the government was working on its “re-communication” of its current commitment. “This will outline the real and meaningful action Australia is taking to reduce emissions. It won’t change our 2030 target, which is set,” he said. The spokesman said to date only four countries had formally submitted a net zero emissions target to the UN. The government has promised a long-term emissions reduction strategy, which it says will be released before the Glasgow meeting and build on a technology investment roadmap. While the prime minister, Scott Morrison, last year agreed at the Pacific Island Forum that Australia’s plans may include commitments and strategies to reach net zero by 2050, Taylor now says that is not the government’s policy. In response to other questions from Labor, Taylor conceded Australia was expected to emit more between 2021 and 2030 than would be expected to meet its Paris target. He said it was estimated the country would emit 5,169m tonnes of carbon dioxide over that time, when under the target it could emit only between 4,710m and 4,777m tonnes. He said this did not take into account Australia’s “overachievement against previous targets” – a reference to the government’s controversial plan to count carbon credits from a different climate agreement against its Paris goal – or cuts from policies still being developed, including a promised electric vehicle strategy. Labor has supports net zero emissions for Australia by 2050, but said it would review its mid-term target – which had been a 45% cut by 2030 – after losing last year’s election. The Paris agreement says countries will put forward a commitment every five years. A related agreement asks countries that initially set targets for 2025 to submit a new one by 2020, and those that used a 2030 timeframe to “communicate or update” their commitment by 2020. The agreement also “notes with concern” that existing commitments for 2025 and 2030 are not enough to limit average global heating to less than 2C, a headline goal of the Paris agreement, and that much deeper cuts will be needed to avoid that mark. It commits countries to act in accordance with “best available science”. The meeting asked the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to report on what would be needed to limit heating to 1.5C. The IPCC found it demanded a global 45% cut between 2010 and 2030, and carbon dioxide emissions to reach net zero by about 2050. Despite this, Taylor and other government MPs have described the Paris agreement as requiring net zero emissions “in the second half of the century”. Bill Hare, head of science and policy thinktank Climate Analytics and a long-term adviser to developing countries at UN climate negotiations, said he believed there was a legal obligation on all countries to increase their ambition. He said the term “recommunicate” did not appear anywhere in the Paris agreement or related documents, and Australia’s current target was “transparently inadequate”. “This represents a very legalistic cherry-picking of language that ignores the ultimate purpose of the agreement and its enabling decisions, and in effect sets aside scientific knowledge and advice about the increasing urgency of action,” Hare said. Dean Bialek, a former Australian diplomat to the UN, now working with the Mission 2020 campaign led by ex-UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said the confirmation that Australia intended to submit the same “very weak” target it took to Paris revealed two things. “First, the government remains deaf to the widespread calls from business, banks and bushfire-ravaged communities that we need to be heading for a much safer climate future,” he said. “Second, despite the crystal clear science, and the green energy bonanza on the horizon, there is no real government plan to reduce emissions, rather an obsession with a gas-led recovery and a CCS [carbon capture and storage] lifeline to a coal industry in steep decline.” John Connor, the executive director of the team that ran a 2017 UN climate conference hosted by Fiji, now head of the Carbon Market Institute, said the expectation of the global community, and particularly Pacific nations, was that countries would review and update their commitments before Glasgow. He said climate targets for 2035 would be an issue at the next election, which was likely to roughly coincide with the conference in Scotland. “It will rightly be a focus, and the government elected then will essentially determine the next commitment,” Connor said."

Winston is the longest survivor in the gladiatorial palace we call parliament, but the last week has shown that he is not invincible. Although clearly not done for yet, questions are now being asked about how much longer he is likely to survive, and also what will happen to NZ First when he does finally hang up his hat.



Peters has still not managed to build a party that would confidently survive without him, although Shane Jones remains the only potential successor who could come within cooee of getting there.



Monday marks two years since the last election, which gave New Zealand First the balance of power.



It has one more year to enhance its chances of survival and it seems likely to do that by targeting three groups: drawing farmer support away from National, blue collar and male support away from Labour and maintaining a reasonable level of the seniors’ vote from the baby boomers.



Peters has returned with a sharper focus on his party’s survival and growth.



In spite of him defending Labour’s handling of the sex scandal, Winston knows what damage such things can do. He will be well aware that Labour’s polling is falling, and might want to take the opportunity to rebuild his own numbers to benefit from it.



There have been many Labour MPs who have quietly applauded Peters piling into the issue this week, even though it can be seen as undue interference in another party’s business.



There are probably even more people in National’s wider support base whose views have not been reflected by deputy leader Paula Bennett, a confidant of the complainants, and who will also have been applauding Peters this week.



For the seniors, Peters has already signalled a SuperGold card enhancement next week while he is Acting Prime Minister.



That will please some of his voters, but I wonder if Winston has simply broken too many electoral promises for anyone to ever believe him again?



He has a more complex relationship with the rural sector. 



There is growing disquiet over the plans, first to get agriculture into the Emissions Trading Scheme; set methane reduction targets in the Zero Carbon Bill; and to improve freshwater standard five years faster than before and to a higher standard.  
The sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by hints from the Australian banks to slow down rural lending if greater capital requirement are imposed by the Reserve Bank. 



With capital gains tax, Winston showed that he can flex his muscles and call anything he wants. That is the beauty of being kingmaker. Exactly why he is allowing the onslaught against the rural sector to continue is beyond me.



National has not had to try hard to paint New Zealand First as part of the problem, not the solution. After all the proposals have come from the Coalition Government.



But blaming New Zealand First may be a harder position to maintain as each of the issues is settled – the first of which may come as early as next week when Peters is still acting Prime Minister.



Announcements are expected soon on how and when agriculture will join the emissions trading scheme.



Under the terms of New Zealand First’s coalition agreement with Labour, it would have to accept pollution charges on 5 per cent of agricultural emissions – and it could have been enacted this term.



The final outcome is likely to be less onerous – and more along the lines of the plan for a farm-based levy for methane and nitrous oxide emissions from 2025, proposed by the industry itself in the Primary Sector Climate Change Commitment. 



If he is to survive politically, Winston simply cannot send farmers entirely into the arms of National; it would be political suicide for him. But how exactly can he separate himself from a government with a strong Green arm that seems to want to do permanent damage to our primary industries? He put this government in place after all.



The Zero Carbon Bill is more trouble for the Green Party than any other party and it has got itself into a pickle over it by its failure to count.



Having worked with National from the early development of the bill, Green Party co-leader and Climate Change Minister James Shaw ditched the Nats at the behest of New Zealand First.



With New Zealand First now putting its foot down, National is again being sounded out for a compromise.



The bill proposes ridiculous targets to reduce biogenic methane by 24 to 47 per cent 2050 but it requires the support of either New Zealand First or National to get them through.  
It may keep the near-term target to lower biogenic methane by 10 per cent on 2017 levels by 2030.  
But Shaw will be forced to refine and lower the 2050 target to 24 per cent or, more likely, drop it altogether. 



It won’t get support from National, but Audrey Young is suggesting it won’t get support from NZ First either. 



If the 24 to 47 per cent target was put there to appease the Green Party’s constituency, it was dumb because it will have raised false expectations in its members who will end up being more disappointed.



  
Shane Jones was heralded as a champion of the regions and has plenty of money to splash around with no projects to spend it on. So far, NZ First has not exactly been a champion of the rural sector, but I expect that to change. Winston will either water down or completely destroy the Zero Carbon Bill because his own political future depends on it. While I feel only relief at the prospect, it may not be enough to save Winston. But one thing is for sure. He has absolutely no chance of making it back into parliament if the Zero Carbon Bill goes ahead.

"Catastrophic fires in the Amazon rainforest made global headlines, but since then NASA has noted that right now there are actually many more fires in parts of Africa than in Brazil.  This has led some to question whether double standards are being applied – are we either ignoring an even larger environmental disaster in Africa, or are the Amazon fires being highlighted as a handy way to criticise a Brazilian leader already unpopular among environmentalists? I’ve studied the ecological impacts of fires in East Africa for more than a decade, along with colleagues from around the world. So, are these fires an Amazon-style disaster? The first thing to know is that the impact of a wildfire depends more on where and what it is burning, than on how big it is, or indeed how many fires there are.  The vast majority of the African fires currently burning seem to be in grasslands, in exactly the places we expect to see fires at this time of year. These fires are usually lit by cattle farmers as part of their traditional management of the savannahs where their animals graze. Some fires are started to stimulate new growth of nutritious grass for their animals, others are used to control the numbers of parasitic ticks or manage the growth of thorny scrub.  Without fires, many savannahs (and the animals they support) wouldn’t exist, and lighting them is a key management activity in many of the iconic protected areas of Africa. For instance the Serengeti in Tanzania is known worldwide for its safari animals and awe-inspiring wildebeest migration – and our work shows that around half of its grasslands burn each year. I’m often asked whether these fires in Africa are natural, and if they should be part of a conservation management plan. I usually answer with a question of my own: what is “natural” in a continent where hominins – our ancestors and closest relatives – have been lighting fires for a million years?  The savannah has co-evolved with hominins lighting fires, probably first to encourage grass to attract animals which they could hunt, then later as pastoralists for their own animals to graze. Animals and plants of the savannah are adapted not only to survive these events, but some actually need them: the beautiful Temminck’s Courser is a bird with ash-black eggs that nests only in recently burned grasslands.  Last year, I led research which helped show how important fire is to biodiversity in these areas. We looked at those parts of the savannah that had a lot of different types of fires – some big, some small, some hot, some cool and sometimes no fire at all – and found they had up to 30% more diverse mammal communities and 40% more diverse bird communities.  And equally importantly, fires in the savannah burn mainly dry grasses that regrow each year: the CO₂ released by fires in grasslands is reabsorbed by the growth of new grass the next year, meaning such fires are nearly carbon-neutral within a year. In contrast to savannah fires, forest fires are a real problem whether in Africa or the Amazon. Tropical forests are usually warm, wet places with no dry grass to carry fires, so they don’t usually burn. However, if they are dried out, either by drought or by deforestation creating sharp edges that allows drying wind into them, they can burn catastrophically.  As the plants and animals of these forests are not fire adapted, many die and the ecosystem may take decades to recover. Equally, and in stark contrast to fires in grassland ecosystems, the carbon released by the fires will take decades to be re-absorbed, meaning forest fires have a huge impact on global emissions. Although there probably are fires in African forests at the moment (there are always some) there isn’t an obvious increase in forest fires in the continent – while all the evidence suggests forest fires in the Amazon are much more abundant this year than previously. Unfortunately, it seems that in contrast to Africa’s fires, the fires in the Amazon are burning in forest areas where the cost to biodiversity, indigenous people and carbon is likely to be extremely high. There also seems to be good evidence that there is more burning this year than previously – and there has been no drought, so it probably reflects increased efforts by people setting fires in these regions.  This can’t be entirely down to signals coming from Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro of course, as the fires are burning in more countries than just Brazil, but it seems clear the story in the Amazon is the real one, while outrage over fires in Africa may just be a distraction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIPCC 1990: “No convincing evidence that sea level rise accelerated in the 20th century”
By Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited and condensed by P Gosselin)
In recent posts we examined sea level rise, and in our last segment here we will look at the current sea level rise from a historical context and projections for the future.
Last 180 million years
On a geological scale, sea level over the last 180 million years was higher than it is today about half of the time (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Seal level over the last 180 million years. Source: David Middleton.
The last 12,000 years
Since the end of the last ice age, we see a rapid rise of more than 10 mm per year until about 8000 years ago. Then came a slowdown 4000 years ago (Figure 2). Today’s sea level rise of 1-3 mm per year is what we are seeing at the end phase of this interglacial period.

Figure 2: Sea level rise over the last 14,000 years. Source: David Middleton.
Today we find ourselves deep into a post-ice age interglacial warm period. During the last ice age the sea level was 120 m lower than today’s level. During the last interglacial, the Eem interglacial of 126,000 to 115,000 years before present, sea level was up to 9 m higher than today – without any help from man. This has been shown by a number of studies (Dutton & Lambeck 2012 in Science, Muhs et al. 2012 in Quaternary Research, O’Leary et al. 2013 in Nature Geoscience).
Last 300 years
The overall general trend shows cyclic behavior that follows the rhythm of warm and cold periods. Ice increased during the Little Ice Age, and so sea level rise stopped (Figure 3). During the transition to the current Modern Warm Period, which began around 1850, sea level began to rise once again and reached its top speed by 1920. The overall speed has not changed in the last 100 years, and thus it is difficult to see any evidence of a man-made impact in this development. There was a rapid increase from 1860 to 1879, but because industrialsation was barely beginning, the cause cannot be man-made. Today’s rate of rise is similar. In fact man-made global CO2 emissions did not begin in earnest until 50 years ago.

Figure 3: Sea level over the last 300 years. Source: Roger Andrews.
Although we keep hearing media reports of an accelerated sea level rise, hard measurement data show that it is merely a resumption of the post little Ice Age rise. Interestingly the IPCC in its first 1990 assessment viewed this similarly. There they wrote:

Excerpt from the IPCC first assessment report of 1990 concerning sea level development. Thanks to Climate Depot.
The estimate of the IPCC from 1990 is still solidly based – as Judith Curry confirmed at Climate Etc. in 2012:
The evidence for accelerating anthropogenic sea level rise is pretty weak, and lost in the noise of natural variability.”
And when one looks at the approximately 200 existing coastal datasets with long measurement periods, one comes up with an average rise of only 1.1 mm per year. This is much less than the values from satellites, which are more than 3 mm. One reason may be calibration problems. Satellite data has been corrected upwards as the versions from 2004 and 2013 show (Figure 4).

Currently the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA is investigating possible sources of error in satellite sea level measurement.
The last decades
We observe that sea level rise is pulsing with an about 60-year cycle (Figure 5), which we have discussed on several occasions in the past. This has to do with the PDO, AMO and NAO ocean cycles (see our blog article: Forscherteam der University of Colorado Boulder: Ozeanzyklen haben Meeresspiegelanstieg in den letzten 20 Jahren verstärkt).
The impact of ocean cycles was recently examined by a team led by Benjamin Hamlington of the University of Colorado in Boulder. The authors reported in an article appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters October 2013: “Contribution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation to global mean sea level trends”. According to the authors, over the last 20 years the PDO contributed about 0.5 mm per year to the observed sea level rise. The scientists say that the PDO’s contribution have to be taken into consideration over the long term and taken into account in prognoses. The PDO will act to reduce the long-term rise, the scientists write.

Figure 5: Sea level rise over the last 90 years. Source: David Middleton.
In January 2014 a group of scientists led by Xianyao Chen published an analysis of global sea level trends based on satellite data in the journal Global and Planetary Change. Here they detected a deceleration in sea level rise, from 3.2 mm in the period 1993 – 2003, to only 1.8 mm per year in 2008. The reason: Pacific ocean cycles.

Figure 6: Sea level development over the last 20 years based on satellite data in comparison to prognoses from the Rahmstorf group.
Under the bottom line: sea level rise has been pretty much constant over the last 80 years. Using the same rate, sea level can be projected to rise only 20 – 30 cm by the year 2100.
Spectacular sea level rise projections unscientific
The IPCC bases its 1-meter plus sea level rise on assumptions that sea level rise will accelerate in the future (Figure 7).

Figure 7: Sea level rise over the last 100 years and prognoses for the coming 85 years. Source: Roger Andrews.
The apocalyptic scenarios come from a group of scientists led by Stefan Rahmstorf. Interestingly Rahmstorf and his colleagues even float prognoses of 2.3 meters by 2300, even though the figure scientifically cannot be taken seriously. Forecasts for the year 2100 or 2300 can never be verified and so those making projections will never have be held accountable. So easily can spectacular projections be made.
Sea level rise far below earlier projections
Things are different for near and mid-term prognoses. Here as time goes by, earlier projections can be compared to observations. In its first report in 1990, the IPCC predicted a sea level rise of 120 mm by 2014. Today, 24 years later, we are able to see how accurate that 1990 prediction really was: It turns out to be only about one fifth of what was projected. In a nutshell: the IPCC 1990 projection was off by a mile.
Scientists made a number of false assumptions, according to Alberto Boretti of the University of Ballarat in Australia. In a study in the journal of Coastal Engineering, Boretti expressed deep doubts over the models from the Rahmstorf group. Overly simplistic models were also criticized by a group of 18 scientists led by Jonathan Gregory of the University of Reading in an article appearing in the Journal of Climate, July 2013. Gregory and his team found no accelerated glacial melting over the last decades. More info on this at The Hockey Schtick. The abstract reads:
Semiempirical methods for projecting global-mean sea level rise (GMSLR) depend on the existence of a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR, but the implication of the authors’ closure of the budget is that such a relationship is weak or absent during the twentieth century. 
To sum it up, the following seafaring saying aptly applies in the current climate discussion:

"Groundwater reserves in Africa are estimated to be 20 times larger than the water stored in lakes and reservoirs above ground. These are the freshwater stores that flow in rocks and sediment beneath the Earth’s surface. They are a vital source of drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa, where groundwater is often the only year-round supply of fresh water in rural areas. Increasingly it is being used in towns and cities as well.  Accessed through wells, boreholes and springs, groundwater is so valuable because it can be found almost anywhere and is generally high quality. It’s often a more reliable source during drought than other water sources. As climate change affects the reliability of water supplies at the surface, more freshwater will likely be drawn from beneath the ground to support rising populations and to irrigate crops. The big question is how much groundwater can be used sustainably as the climate changes? Despite its obvious importance, surprisingly little is known about how groundwater in sub-Saharan Africa is replenished and how resilient it is to climate change. The main reason for this is that, until now, scientists haven’t had access to groundwater level records that go far enough back to see how the climate and groundwater are linked. So regional assessments of groundwater have, to date, relied on computer simulations that aren’t tested by groundwater data.

      Water: underground source for billions could take more than a century to respond fully to climate change


 Since 2014, scientists from across Africa and the world have compiled and analysed decades of groundwater and rainfall records from across sub-Saharan Africa. The aim is to understand how the amount of water stored underground varies from place to place according to the climate and the geology. The team found 14 long-term records from nine countries, with environments ranging from very dry deserts to humid areas with more rainfall and vegetation. Groundwater levels are determined by the relative balance between recharge – the process by which groundwater is replenished – and discharge – the flow of groundwater to springs, streams, wetlands and the sea. The withdrawals people make, for irrigation or drinking water, also contribute to reducing the amount of stored groundwater. By analysing long records of groundwater level and rainfall, our team showed that in wetter parts of Africa groundwater is mostly replenished by rainfall that trickles down through the soil to the water table, and that this occurs consistently over large areas. But in drier regions, groundwater is mostly recharged locally by water leaking into it from temporary streams and ponds, which only flow after particularly heavy rainfall. This finding is important because previous studies have ignored how much leaking streams and ponds contribute to groundwater, and so are likely to have underestimated how well groundwater can be replenished in dry regions. This has profound implications for our understanding of how resilient groundwater in Africa will be to climate change. It reveals that groundwater recharge is very sensitive to the intensity of rainfall, not just the overall amount of rain. This is especially true in the most naturally water scarce parts of sub-Saharan Africa.  These findings challenge predictions from computer models that freshwater will become scarcer in African drylands as climate change reduces rainfall. Instead, global warming is making rainfall come in fewer but heavier bursts – that could actually be good for increasing groundwater recharge overall. Heavy rainfall and floods are often caused by weather patterns such as El Niño and La Niña. These are predictable up to nine months in advance. So, groundwater recharge could be enhanced by capturing a portion of flood water and storing it underground where it can later be withdrawn for drinking or irrigation during dry periods. In some areas, the land surface might not be able to accept all of the potential replenishment that is available from rainfall. This happens when rocks are not very porous and unable to store much water, or in wetter areas where the water table is shallow. Pumping groundwater in such areas could create more “room” to accommodate greater seasonal replenishment. The World Health Organisation estimated in 2015 that 319m people in sub-Saharan Africa still lacked access to safe water. This is also the only region in the world where per capita food production fell over the 20th century. As populations here grow, people will need to be able to withdraw more freshwater to drink and grow food in the face of more frequent droughts. Crop irrigation fed by groundwater could be an important solution. This new research helps to show when and where groundwater could provide drinking water and be used to irrigate crops in a sustainable way, so that the stores of groundwater will still be there for future generations. For this, monitoring of groundwater levels should continue and be expanded across Africa. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt write here how German online flagship daily Die Welt here published an alarming article about Antarctic sea ice melt some two weeks ago. Die Welt wrote:
Giant Antarctic glacier melting unstoppably
The Pine Island Glacier in the Antarctic is melting irreversibly according to a study. Scientists expect that sea level will rise enormously because of the melting of this glacier. […] International scientists from the University of Grenoble expect the shrinking glacier could allow the sea level to rise 1 centimeter in 20 years. The shrinking of the glacier is ‘irreversible’. The glacier is located in western Antarctica. Since the beginning of this century it has gotten about 10 km shorter, the scientists of the Institute for Glacier Research and Geophysics write. The melting has accelerated over the last decades. On average for the years 1992 to 2011 20 billion tonnes of ice have melted. In total until today the western Antarctic ice sheet has reduced about 20 percent.”
All of course this sounds quite dramatic and alarming.
But unfortunately, the media neglect to mention another study appearing in the Journal of Geophysical Research. In it a team of scientists led by L.H. Beem of the University of California in Santa Cruz studied another Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) glacier: the Whillans ice stream Ice Plain. Much to their surprise, the scientists discovered that the melting of the glacier actually had decelerated over the last 50 years.
Die Welt also could have checked another study from the Geophysical Research Letters from October 2013 titled: “A 308 year record of climate variability in West Antarctica”. The study’s authors discovered that the warming rate seen at the Pine island Glacier since 1950 was nothing different from what had been observed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Elizabeth Thomas told the press:
“The new record captures climate variability in this globally important region and suggests that the warming observed here since the 1950s is not the largest in the past 300 years.”
The abstract states:

The record shows that this region has warmed since the late 1950s, at a similar magnitude to that observed in the Antarctic Peninsula and central West Antarctica; however, this warming trend is not unique. More dramatic isotopic warming (and cooling) trends occurred in the mid-nineteenth and eighteenth centuries, suggesting that at present, the effect of anthropogenic climate drivers at this location has not exceeded the natural range of climate variability in the context of the past ~300 years.”
In February 2014 yet another study led by Alexandra Witus of Rice University appearing in the Quaternary Science Reviews found three episodes where ice had melted rapidly at the Pine Island Glacier over the last 10,000 years. In summary: the melt that has taken place over the last decades at the WAIS is nothing new, and it even now appears to be decelerating.
So what does all this say about the wild claims made by Die Welt that a “dramatic” ice melt is taking place at the Pine Island Glacier, i.e. 20 billion cubic meters per year resulting in a 20% ice mass reduction? Die kalte Sonne checks the numbers, which I’ve corrected using figures from Wikipedia:
1) West Antarctica Ice Shelf (WAIS) has an estimated volume of 2.2 million cubic kilometers.
3) When 20 billion tonnes has melted every year over the last 20 years, it means a total of 400 billion cubic meters (400 cubic kilometers) has melted.
3) So what percent is 400 cubic km from the total of 2.2 million? It’s certainly not 20% – rather it is only 0.0182%. Less than the concentration of trace gas CO2 in our atmosphere!
We know that alarmists love to announce exaggerated disasters, but Die Welt really overdid it this time. Die Welt exaggerated the ice melt by a factor of 1100!

They might not be practicing the world’s oldest profession, but lawyers have been always with us. In America political losers increasingly go to court, hoping to convince judges to trump the democratic process. The result has been a rise in dubious judge‐​made “rights” which infringe on the basic liberties of the rest of us.



The same trend threatens on the world scene. The latest vehicle for potential litigation is the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST), which the U.N.’s Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea explained “is not… a static instrument, but rather a dynamic and evolving body of law that must be vigorously safeguarded and its implementation aggressively advanced.”



Three decades ago President Ronald Reagan rejected LOST, an omnibus agreement which would have redistributed wealth from Western industrialized democracies to Third World dictatorships. The so‐​called G-77, or developing state lobby, hoped to create a new International Seabed Authority (ISA) to control seabed resources and mulct private mining operations.



Then the larger push for a “New International Economic Order” collapsed as the Soviet Union and its allied “socialist bloc” headed toward history’s trashbin. Even Third World governments came to admit that President Reagan had been right about LOST.



Washington should have pushed to sever the seabed regulations from more broadly supported treaty provisions governing navigation and other issues. However, treaties attract State Department diplomats like flames attract moths. The Bush and Clinton administrations decided to “fix” the seabed provisions by renegotiating LOST. The resulting compromise eliminated some of the convention’s most obnoxious rules but preserved the overall Rube Goldberg structure of organizations, committees, commissions, chambers, and more unchanged.



Worse, the revised text left regulatory landmines buried throughout. For instance, one of LOST’s biggest failings was the mandatory transfer of proprietary technology to Third World states as well as the Enterprise, which was to mine the seabed for the Third World‐​controlled ISA. The LOST “fix” only deleted one of two sections governing technology transfer.



Left intact was the requirement that the Authority “promote and encourage the transfer to developing States of such technology and scientific knowledge.” The Authority and member governments also were directed to “initiate and promote” programs “for the transfer of technology to the Enterprise and to developing states,” including “facilitating the access of the Enterprise and of developing States to the relevant technology.”



The revised text even added a new requirement: “If the Enterprise or developing States are unable to obtain deep seabed mining technology, the Authority may request all or any of the contractors and their respective sponsoring State or States to cooperate with it in facilitating the acquisition of deep seabed mining technology.” The Authority could use this language to recreate the mandatory technology transfer requirement.



Other regulatory ghosts haunt the revised text. The original treaty perversely limited mineral production; ambiguous language in the new version could yield the same outcome, despite claims that the accord now is market‐​friendly. Such controversies could end up in international court.



Although LOST focuses on the high seas, it includes language covering domestic pollution. The provisions are surprisingly expansive, or “stunning in their breadth and depth,” as Steven Groves of the Heritage Foundation observed in a new study. A decade ago Ireland relied on LOST to sue Great Britain over the commissioning of a mixed oxide plant because of the latter’s alleged impact on the Irish Sea. The plant had been approved not only by Britain, but also the European Union (EU). Ireland dropped the suit, but only because the EU sued Ireland for not filing its case in the European Court of Justice.



Many environmentalists believe that LOST could be used against the U.S. in the same way. A few years ago an environmental activist mistakenly sent me an email after our debate on the treaty. He acknowledged that it might be difficult to convince Americans that the treaty would not similarly bind America when the World Wildlife Federation and Citizens for Global Solutions were promoting LOST by claiming that the convention would stop Russia from polluting the Arctic. He worried that this inconsistency suggested that the treaty was in fact “some kind of green Trojan Horse.”



It is. Groves noted that “Some environmental activist groups have already demonstrated a propensity for supporting, participating in, and in some cases actually filing climate change lawsuits against U.S. targets, as well as taking other legal actions relating to the marine environment in U.S. courts and international forums.”



LOST also incorporates the so‐​called “no harm” rule, which obligates countries to regulate activities in order to avoid negatively impacting neighboring states. The duty makes sense as a guiding principle in designing domestic regulations and undertaking specific international obligations. But, warned Groves, approving LOST would transform “a sensible principle to regulate conduct between two neighboring countries into a seemingly unconstrained doctrine to impute global liability for alleged acts of atmospheric pollution.” Unaccountable international legal forums then would enforce the rule.



Worse, the debate over climate change has opened up grand new litigation vistas. And treaty enthusiasts are anxious to take advantage. William C.G. Burns of the Monterey Institute of International Studies exulted that LOST “may prove to be one of the primary battlegrounds for climate change issues in the future.”



He pointed to the Treaty’s expansive definition of marine pollution: “the potential impacts of rising sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels, and changes in ocean pH as a consequence of rising levels of carbon dioxide in sea water” all could “give rise to actions under the Convention’s marine pollution provisions.” Even if the litigation did not succeed, he suggested that “the specter of litigation may help to deepen the commitment of States” to legislate on the issue.



Two decades ago environmental lawyers Durwood Zaelke and James Cameron wrote about the possibility of low‐​lying islands suing industrialized states over rising sea levels. Unfortunately, the prospect of international lawsuits is more than the gleam of an academic’s eye.



The Pacific island state of Palau announced last September that it would seek a ruling from the International Court of Justice barring nations from allowing emissions from their territory to cause climate change affecting other countries. Palau indicated that it would rely on LOST as well as the Kyoto Protocol. A decade ago Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu, also Pacific islands, threatened to sue under LOST, though as yet have not filed. Groves suggested that mountainous nations could similarly sue over shrinking glaciers. One could imagine other states claiming damages based on drought, desertification, or other alleged consequences of global warming.



The issue of climate change is extraordinarily complex. The best evidence is that the planet is warming, but the role of human activity and impact on the environment are far less certain and remain highly controverted. Nor is it possible to demonstrate causation between any particular emission and any particular consequence. There may be good political reasons to mitigate the distress of island countries, but such matters belong in international negotiations, not international courts.



However, as Groves warned, acceding to the treaty “would expose the U.S. to lawsuits on virtually any maritime activity, such as alleged pollution of the marine environment from a land‐​based source or even through the atmosphere. Regardless of the case’s merits, the U.S. would be forced to defend itself against every such lawsuit at great expense.”



Litigation could occur in several venues: the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International Court of Justice, an arbitral tribunal, and a “special” arbitral tribunal. There would be no appeals and all suffer from political elements which would interfere with the delivery of genuine “justice.” Indeed, noted Groves, the U.S. “has suffered adverse judgments in high‐​profile international lawsuits in the past.”



LOST would reinforce the litigation danger by creating obligations directly enforceable by U.S. courts. Annex III, Article 21(2) of the treaty states that tribunal decisions “shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.” In a 2008 case Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens contrasted another treaty with LOST, which, he wrote, did “incorporate international judgments into international law.” As a result, U.S. judges would become international enforcers.



There is a role for international litigation, but not for resolving important and complicated policy issues. Domestic politics and international diplomacy are messy and imperfect, but remain the proper forums. Ultimately environmental issues are too important to debate without involving those who would do the paying.



Treaty advocates recognize that the American people aren’t likely to favor buying a pig in a poke. So treaty negotiator Bernard Oxman suggested silence. Back in 1996 he admitted that the text “is amply endowed with indeterminate principles, mind‐​numbing cross‐​references, institutional redundancies, exasperating opacity and inelegant drafting.” Thus, he recommended “restraint in speculating on the meaning of the convention.” After all, he added, “it is essential to measure what we say in terms of its effect on the goal. Experienced international lawyers know where many of the sensitive nerve endings of governments are. Where possible, they should try to avoid irritating them.”



What should irritate Americans even more, however, is the knowledge that LOST proponents are attempting to hide their ambitions.



LOST is a complicated issue, far more so than proponents publicly acknowledge. Perhaps the treaty’s most dangerous aspect is creating a “dynamic and evolving body of law.” America already is paying the price for far too much and too expansive litigation domestically. The U.S. Senate should say no to LOST.

"Imagine a rainforest at dawn – the tall canopy laden with dripping ferns and orchids, tree trunks covered in spongy mosses and lichens, and the morning mist only slowly burning away as the sun rises. While there is fuel everywhere, it seems unimaginable that such humid ecosystems could ever catch fire. And without human intervention, they don’t. The charcoal record points towards infrequent fires in the Amazon even during periods of pre-Columbian human settlement, and the 8,000 or more Amazonian tree species have none of the evolutionary adaptations to fire found in their savanna or boreal cousins.  But, with thousands of fires currently burning across the Amazon, it’s worth looking at how these wildfires behave. In this context, a “wildfire” is one which has gone out of control, even if started by humans. What do they mean for a forest that hasn’t evolved with fire? And what is needed to prevent further damage? Contrary to many images circulated online depicting blazing canopies, wildfires in previously undisturbed tropical forests do not appear as ecosystem changing events. Flames advance just 200 to 300 metres a day and rarely exceed 30cm in height, burning only leaf litter and fallen wood. Most mobile animals are able to flee, and firefighters – if present – can bring it to a halt by raking simple fire breaks. Indeed, the humble trails of leaf cutter ants were sufficient to stop forest fires in an experiment in the southern Amazon. But the intensity of a fire does not necessarily predict its severity. The lack of natural adaptation to deal with wildfires make rainforest species incredibly sensitive. Even a low intensity wildfire can kill half the trees. While small trees are initially most susceptible, larger ones often die in subsequent years leading to an eventual loss of more than half of the forest’s carbon stocks. These large trees hold the most carbon, and subsequent regrowth of pioneer species is no compensation – once-burned, forests hold 25% less carbon than unburned forests even after three decades of regrowth.  With such a devastating impact on the trees, it is not surprising that forest-dependent animals and people are also affected. Primates are less abundant in burned forests and many specialist insectivorous birds disappear altogether. And local people, who use forests for game, building materials and medicines, lose one of their most important safety nets. All this happens when a forest burns for the first time. However, the situation is very different when forests suffer recurrent fires. Then, fuel from previous tree mortality creates a veritable bonfire, tinderbox dry under an open canopy. Flame heights in these forests often reach the treetops, causing the death of almost all remaining trees.  Such a scenario has been likened to “savannization” – but while the resulting scrub and sparse trees may share superficial similarities with fire-dependent tropical grasslands, they contain none of their unique biodiversity or cultural values. Instead, recurrent wildfires are more likely to hasten the Amazon’s transition to a low diversity and low carbon ecosystem with a fraction of its current social and ecological value.  We know that forest fires are not a natural process in Amazonia, so why are so many fires happening now? Unfortunately, it is not yet clear exactly what has been burning – satellites detecting active fires and smoke are imprecise guides, and we will only get greater clarity when burn scars are accurately mapped across all land uses. But the current increase is likely to be a mix of three different fire types.  Some of the fires are related to a recent spike in deforestation, when the cut vegetation is burned to create cattle ranches and support land claims. Others will be agricultural burns, when fires are used in rotational agriculture or to clear encroaching scrub from existing pasture. Alarmingly, and even though this dry season is considered normal, there is evidence that these intentional fires have led to wildfires in standing forests, including in indigenous reserves.  Addressing these fires is complex as many of the activities are illegal or politically motivated. For example, there was a marked increase in fire detection during the recent “day of fire”, and loggers or land speculators have previously been implicated in causing wildfires in indigenous reserves. Furthermore, it is important to separate these illegal fires from the small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture used by Amazonia’s traditional and indigenous people. Although these fires can escape into forests, they are also essential for maintaining the livelihoods of some of the Amazon’s poorest people. When fires do enter the forest, they can be fought with low-tech approaches such as fire breaks. Yet effective combat remains rare, and in most cases help is either delayed or fails to arrive at all. Under Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, funds for the Brazilian environmental protection agency IBAMA have been cut by 95%. This has resulted in a R$17.5m reduction in funds for fire fighting that have been exacerbated by the loss of an Amazon Fund from Norway and Germany. Reducing wildfires requires going beyond addressing the ignition sources and fighting the flames themselves, and also encouraging actions that limit forest flammability. Tackling deforestation remains key as it exposes forest edges to the hotter and drier microclimate of agricultural land, and contributes to regional reductions in rainfall.  Selective logging also plays a key role in making tropical forests more flammable. Walking in a selectively logged forest in the dry season, you feel the sun’s heat directly on your face and the leaf litter crackles and crunches underfoot. In contrast, unlogged primary forests are a shadier world where the leaf litter remains moist.  Fire prevention needs to be a key condition of long-term forest stewardship. This will only work if widespread illegal logging is effectively controlled, as cheaper timber undermines the viability of best-practice forest management. Finally, climate change itself is making dry seasons longer and forests more flammable. Increased temperatures are also resulting in more frequent tropical forest fires in non-drought years. And climate change may also be driving the increasing frequency and intensity of climate anomalies, such as El Niño events that affect fire season intensity across Amazonia.  Addressing these challenges requires integrated national and global actions, collaboration between scientists and policy makers, and long-term funding – approaches that the current Brazilian administration seems intent on destroying."
"**People with learning disabilities have been ""at the back of the queue"" during the coronavirus pandemic, a panel of MPs has been told.**
Those living in supported accommodation were left waiting weeks for guidance on testing and visits.
MPs were also told long-term social factors were likely to be more important than biology when it came to ethnic divides in the virus's impact.
The panel focused on what lessons could be learned.
James O'Rourke's brother Tony lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in a block of supported-living accommodation.
He said the family had been unable to visit him, even though people living alone in the wider community are allowed to form a support bubble with another household.
Mr O'Rourke said this was because guidance had been tailored towards large residential care homes and failed to account for people in his brother's situation.
He was giving evidence to a joint hearing of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee.
This sentiment was echoed by Steve Scown, who runs Dimensions UK, a major provider of supported accommodation for adults with learning disabilities and autism.
""Consistently, the government guidance for registered care homes has been issued weeks in advance of guidance for supportive-living services,"" he said.
""There's been a focus on large registered care homes for older people.""
While the government's focus on older people was ""understandable"", these delays meant his service was still waiting for guidance on testing residents.
And in other cases, constantly changing guidance had left staff and residents confused.
Ann McCallum, who has a learning disability and advocates for others who do, said she had struggled to understand certain guidelines.
""It's not been in easy language for people to understand,"" she said.
""Politicians need to really not use jargon and give better instructions on all the rules that they want us to follow"".
Language around ""tiers"", for example, was confusing, Ms McCallum added.
Mr Scown said life-expectancy figures - between 14 and 18 years lower for people with learning disabilities - were evidence they were not valued ""as equal members of the community"".
And he cited ""frankly, disgraceful"" instances during the pandemic of medics placing do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) orders on patients with learning disabilities' files without consulting their families .
The MPs also heard evidence from experts about the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on people belonging to ethnic minorities.
Public Health England London regional director Prof Kevin Fenton said he was concerned about the availability of data on the impact of testing and contact-tracing among different ethnic communities and whether people were taking up testing and being reached by tracers.
A number of reasons have been given for why Covid disproportionately affects people belonging to ethnic minorities.
These factors are often linked.
Prof Fenton cautioned against ""looking for simple or easy solutions for what are very, very complex and difficult issues"".
But he said ""social and structural conditions have a much greater impact on your overall health and wellbeing"" than biological factors.
And that included housing, employment and the impacts of discrimination and stigma, which were ""much bigger determinants of wellbeing than, for example, your access to care or genetic profile""."
"MOSCOW  —   A Russian court on Wednesday effectively derailed a presidential run by Aleksei A. Navalny  —   the only opposition candidate with a broad, enthusiastic popular following  —   by reviving a    criminal conviction. The decision by the district court was widely viewed as a move by President Vladimir V. Putin to eliminate his only viable rival in an election scheduled for March 2018. Although Mr. Putin has been coy about his decision to run for a fourth term, there is little question that he will. Some observers had speculated that the president would want a weighty opponent to lend legitimacy to his next victory. The best chance for a competitive race came to a screeching halt on Wednesday, however, when a district court in the small city of Kirov, nearly 500 miles northeast of Moscow, pronounced Mr. Navalny guilty of defrauding a state company. Russian law bars anyone with a criminal conviction from seeking elected office. Since he first came to power in January 2000, Mr. Putin and his allies have gone to great lengths to silence or undermine all critical voices in Russia. It has been almost two years since the   assassination of Boris Nemtsov, another charismatic opposition figure, on the doorstep of the Kremlin. His is the most recent in a string of killings of prominent critics  —   politicians, journalists and human rights activists  —   that remain unsolved. Russian television is largely back under government control, as it was during Soviet times, along with most formerly independent news agencies. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations working on issues including the environment, civic education and fighting the spread of AIDS have been declared “foreign agents,” forcing many to close. Mr. Navalny was the driving force behind large street protests in 2011, 2012 and 2013 that unnerved Mr. Putin. He has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption, exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary. In recent years, Mr. Navalny became the prime example of how the government would use the courts to entangle critics. In addition to the conviction revived on Wednesday, he has been accused of defrauding a French perfume company and stealing a nearly worthless piece of street art, and he was caught up in yet another case involving the death of an elk. While he spent much of 2014 under house arrest, his younger brother Oleg was sent to jail for three and a half years. Mr. Navalny, who called the Kirov fraud charges baseless and politically motivated, responded to the latest judgment against him with defiance. “Putin and his gang of thieves are afraid to face us in elections,” he wrote on Twitter. “Rightly so: We will win. ” In a longer statement, he vowed to continue his presidential run. “We do not recognize this verdict. It will be overturned,” he said. “According to the Constitution, I have a full right to take part in elections, and I will do this. I will continue to represent the interests of people who want to see Russia as a normal, honest, uncorrupt country. ” The Kirov court’s ruling followed almost verbatim the judgment issued against Mr. Navalny in the same case in 2013, which resulted in a   suspended sentence. That verdict was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, and Russia’s Supreme Court ordered a new trial in December. Although the retrial was organized unusually quickly for Russia, Mr. Navalny announced that he was running for president before his latest conviction. Russian political analysts suggested that the prospect of Mr. Navalny’s gaining a national platform to further criticize Mr. Putin had proved too much for the Kremlin hierarchy to tolerate. “The danger associated with Mr. Navalny is easy to explain,” Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email. “If allowed to run, he will disseminate his corruption findings more widely than ever  —   and this disturbs very much Mr. Putin and his gang. ” Officials figured a predictable campaign against impotent opposition was a safer bet, analysts said. Some Kremlin insiders were concerned that letting Mr. Navalny run now would improve his standing for the presidential race in 2024, when Mr. Putin cannot run under current laws, analysts said. Mr. Navalny, 40, is a handsome, telegenic figure with a model family, much more approachable than the usually dour apparatchiks churned out by the Kremlin bureaucratic mill. Despite his earlier conviction, Mr. Navalny was allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2013. He garnered 27. 2 percent of the vote, just short of the threshold needed to force the   candidate into a runoff  —   and enough to feed the Kremlin’s fears. Mr. Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, announced that he would appeal the verdict and file complaints with Russia’s Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The European Union issued a statement criticizing the latest verdict, noting that its human rights court had already found that Mr. Navalny did not get a fair trial in 2013. “This latest decision, which effectively excludes Mr. Navalny from the political arena, further constrains political pluralism in Russia and raises serious questions as to the fairness of democratic processes in Russia,” the statement said. Mr. Navalny and his team pointed out that there was a conflict between the electoral law and the Constitution, which does not list a criminal conviction among the specific reasons to bar a candidate. Legal analysts said that, just as in the fraud case, any rulings in the other cases against Mr. Navalny would undoubtedly favor the Kremlin. “You can complain about this, but the result will be clear,” said Andrei Y. Buzin, an expert at Golos, an independent election monitor. “The Constitutional Court will say that lawmakers have the right to impose the restrictions it deems necessary to protect the freedoms of other citizens. ” In the Kirov case, the court convicted Mr. Navalny of embezzling 16 million rubles, worth about $500, 000 at the time, by purchasing timber from a   company at   rates and then reselling it at market value. The investigators said Mr. Navalny had used his position at the time as an aide to the Kirov regional governor to persuade the company to sign the contract. Mr. Navalny said the timber was bought at market rates. As the judge, Aleksei Vtyurin, droned through the familiar decision in a barely audible monotone, reading from nearly the same verdict as four years ago, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter to mock the proceedings. “This is page 40 now, and there are 77 of them. It’s comfortable to have the verdict in hand,” Mr. Navalny said from the courtroom. Even before the verdict was announced, the government moved to shut down the logistics for his presidential run. On Tuesday, Russia’s leading information technology company, Yandex, unplugged the online account that Mr. Navalny had used to collect money from supporters."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

It is said that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold.



Let us hope that the American left’s recent publication of its “Green New Deal” (GND) won’t be contagious enough to infect Labour here.



Just over a week ago, Jeremy Corbyn had an in‐​depth phone conversation with Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez, the rising socialist congresswoman. The aim, it was said, was to “build a movement to take on the billionaires, polluters, and migrant baiters”.



US politics is generally considered to sit to the right of the UK landscape. But Ocasio-Cortez’s GND makes the 2017 Labour manifesto look like Thatcherism on steroids.





Labour hasn’t succumbed to the allure of this model just yet. But the mood is shifting.



Consider how radical Labour’s proposed policies seemed just two years’ ago. The party pledged rail, energy and water sector nationalisation, and to reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail.



It would have reintroduced or strengthened price controls, with an energy price cap, a £10 minimum wage by 2020, and private sector rent regulation. In energy, it would have banned fracking, but invested in nuclear and supported renewables to hit existing carbon emissions targets.



Now consider the GND, endorsed — unbelievably — by declared Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand. It would put the US on a national war footing to collectively achieve a net zero emissions society within one decade.



That requires gargantuan public investment to ensure that power demand is met 100 per cent by renewables within 10 years. The domestic transport system would be completely electrified, new high‐​speed rail built, flight availability curbed, and research programmes into sustainability and renewable technology funded.



Not content with this energy transformation to a near carbon‐​free utopia, the GND pledges a social transformation too. Vital in the fight against climate change, apparently, is free healthcare and higher education, a jobs guarantee for all who want to work, economic security for those who don’t, family leave, extra resources for pensioners, and a family living wage.



One could well think of the GND’s emissions‐​reducing veneer as a Trojan Horse for a progressive social policy wet dream.



The document is, for want of a better term, bonkers. But it is being treated as a serious proposal that must be assessed on its merits. The branding helps to insulate it from well‐​deserved criticism: if you’re opposed to the “Green New Deal”, then you want to kill the planet.



The truth though is that the GND goes far beyond reasonable carbon mitigation, completely denying the existence of trade‐​offs or the costs of programmes that it recommends.



While Labour’s 2017 election manifesto would be supremely damaging to the UK economy, at least there was some economic reasoning in justifying Corbyn’s ideas. With this radical new breed of Democrat, there is no acknowledgement that nationalising vast swathes of the economy could adversely affect growth by crowding out private activity. In fact, we are told the opposite, that it would make the economy stronger as well as greener.



Could such a programme ever gain traction here? One would hope not, but the lock on this radical worldview is currently being picked at by the British left.



Ocasio‐​Cortez and her cohorts are disciples of a new macroeconomic worldview called “Modern Monetary Theory” (MMT).



This postulates that governments with sovereign currencies face no financing constraints, and can spend as much as they like through new printed money. The only real constraint on spending levels is the capacity of the economy.



Even academic MMT‐​ers admit that if you pump in too much money when the economy is at full employment, inflation will rise, and will need to be choked off by higher taxes or spending cuts.



But political proponents of this kooky theory downplay this implication. In fact, they circumvent it, by claiming that, despite low unemployment, our economies are running significantly below their potential. This allows them to say that huge new spending could be financed by money printing without requiring higher taxes or resulting in rising inflation.



Labour hasn’t succumbed to the allure of this model just yet. But the mood is shifting. Last week, John McDonnell’s more mainstream fiscal rule — which would require a future Labour government to balance day‐​to‐​day spending over time — was sharply criticised by British leftists.



If Labour becomes starry‐​eyed about a GND‐​type agenda, there may well be a scramble to subscribe to a theory that promises to allow much more government spending without unpopular tax hikes.



For now, though, count your blessings. Unlike Ocasio‐​Cortez, Labour is not invoking climate change as the new Hitler to be defeated, nor promising to print money for social policy on a hunch that the economy is below capacity.



While reading the Democrats’ Green New Deal, an alien emotion swept over me. For once, I was grateful for Corbyn and McDonnell’s relative moderation.

"A cross-society collection of groups – representing business, the energy industry, property owners, unions, major investors, disadvantaged people and the environment – have banded together to warn that Australia’s prosperity depends on eradicating greenhouse gas emissions. In a letter to the national cabinet, federal and state energy ministers and Nev Power, Scott Morrison’s handpicked Covid-19 recovery chairman, the 14 organisations have called for government support in the wake of the pandemic to urgently stimulate job growth and rebuild a “sustainable and strong economy”.  They say it should include measures to cut emissions and accelerate a transition to clean energy across all regions and economic sectors, and recommend a focus on fixing inefficient homes and buildings. Signatories to the letter, sent on 15 May, include the heads of the Business Council, the Property Council, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Industry Group, the ACTU, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Australian Conservation Foundation. “Australia faces a public health emergency with immediate economic impacts as well as longer-lasting global economic pain. Beyond the pandemic, Australian prosperity also depends on dealing with other long-term challenges, including the transition to net zero emissions,” the letter says. It can bee seen as part of a growing global call for governments to respond to the economic shock of the pandemic with policies that also help tackle the climate crisis. The federal government continues to reject a 2050 target of net zero emissions and is developing a roadmap for emissions reduction that suggests a major role for gas, a fossil fuel, alongside hydrogen, renewable energy and, potentially, nuclear power. The National Covid-19 Coordination Commission is heavily backing gas to drive the economic recovery. The groups say there are many opportunities to cut emissions, but single out energy efficiency and management. They call for government support for upgrades across private and public housing, commercial, community and government buildings and industrial facilities. Suggested improvements include more efficient and controllable appliances and equipment, improved “thermal envelopes” – walls, roofs, floors and windows – and shading, introducing smart meters to better manage electricity use across the day and an expanded roll-out of solar panels and home batteries. The letter cites the International Energy Agency as highlighting that energy efficiency upgrades are “job-intensive and strongly support economic stimulus goals”. “In Australia, a major drive to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and industry could deliver over 120,000 job-years of employment,” it says. “If done well, these investments would durably lower energy bills; ease strains on a rapidly changing energy system; improve health and safety during increasingly hot summers; boost the competitiveness of local manufacturers, whose value to Australia is clearer than ever; enable deeper emissions cuts – and sustain activity across a broad range of trades and industries.” A report released last month by ClimateWorks Australia on how to decarbonise the country found the technology for zero-emissions buildings already existed, and much of it was simple. Steps would or could involve improving insulation and draught sealing, installing LED lighting, solar hot water and better appliances and introducing passive house design standards. It would require shifting from gas-fired heating and cooking to running on clean energy. A separate study by Beyond Zero Emissions, another not-for-profit group, has estimated there could be more than 300,000 jobs in a national “deep energy retrofit” drive to improve the efficiency of 3m buildings across the country, starting with social housing, low-income homes, schools and hospitals, to a point where they no longer face quarterly electricity or gas bills. The letter to governments says potential templates for publicly funded efficiency drives include the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s support for the construction of hundreds of 7-star affordable housing units in Sydney, and a 2017 energy upgrade that cut energy use at the MCG by 24%, saving enough power to run more than 1,800 homes. It says governments should look for other climate-friendly options that can support economic recovery and energy transition, including integrating recovery plans with long-term emissions reduction strategies and plans for modernising power grids, carbon farming and bushfire recovery. Other signatories are the heads of WWF, the Energy Users Association, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Carbon Market Institute and the Energy Efficiency Council."
"Temperatures in some California cities this week broke decades-old records. The heatwave that cooked Las Vegas over the past few days brought temperatures over 100F. And in Phoenix, highs this weekend are expected to approach or exceed 110F.  This year is on track to be one of the hottest on record, and public health officials worry that in cities across the US, summer heatwaves will collide with the coronavirus pandemic, with deadly consequences for poor, minority and older populations.   Even before the pandemic hit, heat was killing more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. People who live in cities are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because of a phenomenon called the “urban heat island effect” – cities with populations of 1 million or more can be up to 5F hotter than surrounding areas due to high population density, a lack of greenery and shade, and because materials like steel, concrete and asphalt tend to absorb more heat.  Analyses have also found that cities’ poorest neighborhoods tend to be hotter, and that many low-income families have been struggling to cope for years. In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, up to a third or more of households lack air conditioning. Due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many more are unable to pay to run their ACs. And even as cities begin reopening after lockdown, many of the malls, public libraries and recreation centers where overheated Americans traditionally went to cool down remain risky, especially for older people and others with a heightened risk of dying from Covid-19.  Throughout the country, public health officials told the Guardian they were scrambling to find ways to protect the most vulnerable from the dual threats of heat and coronavirus. “This summer is definitely not going to be like any other summer,” said Deanne Criswell, the commissioner of New York City Emergency Management. “We’re not going to have the same level of facilities open that New Yorkers typically go to all the time to stay cool. It’s a big concern.”  New York is in the process of installing 74,000 air conditioners in the homes of low-income seniors, according to Criswell. The city is also seeking to help more people pay for electricity this summer, as the unemployment crisis leaves thousands of New Yorkers without the means to make rent and utilities. Other cities across the US have asked utility companies not to shut off service this summer, even if customers can’t pay bills, so that they have access to water, cooling and refrigeration through the hottest days.  “Every summer we worry about the heat when it ramps up – especially in April and May before people have a chance to acclimatize,” said Carolyn Levering, the emergency management administrator for Las Vegas. “I think it just gives us extra concern this year because of the pandemic.” In Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, officials are keeping some cooling centers – designated public buildings where residents come for cold water and a respite from the heat – open, at a reduced capacity so people can maintain social distancing while seeking relief from the heat. At five cooling centers in LA, anyone who enters has their temperature checked and is required to wear a mask and remain 6ft away from other people. In Nevada’s Clark county, which includes Las Vegas, four cooling centers stayed open during the most recent heatwave.  But none of these solutions are broad enough to catch everyone at risk of dying from heatstroke, advocates say. “Hell no, it isn’t enough,” said Jonathan Parfrey, the executive director of the LA-based non-profit Climate Resolve. “This is just a staggering problem.”  In South LA, where 64% of residents fall below the poverty line, more than 40% of households lack air conditioning, according to a study published this month by researchers at the University of Southern California who analyzed data from the electrical meters of nearly 180,500 households. “Poverty was a better predictor of whether or not people had AC than even how hot or cool it was in a neighborhood,” said Kelly Sanders, one of study’s authors. The vast majority of these heat-related deaths in cities occur inside homes that aren’t air-conditioned, said New York’s Criswell. “That ain’t going to be me this year,” said Collette McCoy-Douglas, 67, a retired nurse who lives in a public housing facility for seniors in Chicago. McCoy-Douglas said her building turned on the central air conditioning a day early, after residents complained during the heatwave over Memorial Day weekend. But the system, which only cools each apartment’s living room, “felt warm when I touched it,” she said. Her thermostat read 100F. “So I’ve poured ice on my head twice today – it messed up my hair, but it helped,” she laughed. A spokesperson for Chicago Housing Authority said it was not aware of any air conditioning issues at senior housing facilities.  Although McCoy-Douglas considered looking for someplace cool she could go, she decided against it. “I’ve got an autoimmune disease, I have asthma, I have stents,” she said. “I’m more skeptical against the coronavirus.” Unable to cool down, she eventually picked up a neighbor, an older woman with cerebral palsy, and they drove around for a bit in McCoy-Douglas’s air-conditioned car. Chicago’s infamous 1995 heatwave, which killed more than 700 people, was on the minds of both women.  “You know, in my apartment, we have people with mental illness and disabilities. They can’t even leave the building,” said McCoy-Douglas, who also knew of two neighbors who had died of Covid-19. “It just breaks my heart. It’s just inhuman.” "

THIS WEEK:

Climate Realism: In an essay posted by American Thinker, Fred Singer explains his motivation for engaging in an exchange with noted economist William Nordhaus that was published in the New York Review of Books. Please see Article # 1.

******************
Svalbard Again: The small Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (about the size of West Virginia) has become popular again this week. Svalbard is located at 76 and 80 degrees N, about 450 miles north of Norway, between Norway and the North Pole and between Norway and the northern part of the east coast of Greenland. Although the climate is classified as arctic, it is tempered by the (comparatively) warm North Atlantic Current which flows along the western and northern coasts of Spitsbergen, the main island, keeping water open and navigable most of the year. CIA Fact Book: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sv.html
It is the warm North Atlantic Current that may be misleading some in interpreting recent research of a lake in Svalbard. In an apparent update of a study published in May, researchers from Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory concluded that the lake is warmer today than any time in the past 1800 years, including the Medieval Warm Period, and that the Little Ice Age was mild.
Alarmist headlines quickly committed the logical fallacy of composition – that which applies to Svalbard applies to all of the Arctic. However, as even the press release of the research states:
“Evidence from tree rings and ice cores shows that southern Greenland and parts of North America were warmer from 950 to 1250 than today, with the Vikings taking advantage of ice-free waters to settle Greenland.” The temperatures in Svalbard may be an aberration from changing North Atlantic Current rather than any broad trend. Please see links under Seeking a Common Ground.
******************
Methane Emissions: One of the popular refrains by global warming alarmists is that if carbon dioxide (CO2) causes significant warming it will be amplified by the release of methane from the deep ocean. An international research effort exploring the sea bed of Spitsbergen (part of Svalbard) found methane seeps where microbes have been feasting for hundreds of years – no evidence of anything new. It would be interesting to see a cataloguing of these microbes as to any relationship with the microbes that feasted so heavily during the BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
******************
Circumpolar Vortex: New research indicates that changes in the northern circumpolar vortex,
strong winds that circulate clockwise (east to west) generally centered on the North Pole, may significantly influence the North Atlantic Oscillation, and thereby affect climate change. Writings by H.H. Lamb in the 1970s and 1980s brought out the importance of the circumpolar vortex in affecting weather and climate. These were systematically ignored in later reports by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), particularly in its Summary for Policymakers.
The new research links the changes in the stratosphere at altitudes up to 30 miles with changes in the ocean currents. Unfortunately, as all too common, the writing in the press release is overblown, which detracts from findings. It remains to be seen if the research is a significant new contribution. The authors try to link changes in vortex to changes in stratospheric ozone and CO2. However, as Lamb pointed out, changes in the vortex can be used to explain part of weather and climate change long before ozone and CO2 became an issue. Please see links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
******************
Wind Power: There has been a blow-up in England where two researchers challenged a study by Gordon Hughes stating that using wind turbines in place of coal or natural gas power plants does not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The response from Hughes was swift and deadly. No doubt such controversies will continue as more citizens are questioning the wisdom of wind power, which is driving up electricity costs.
If one accepts that increase atmospheric carbon dioxide is a benefit to plants and to humanity, the arguments are moot. Consumers want reliable electricity, which can illuminate their homes at the flick of a switch and heat their homes on cold, still nights. Reliable power should be considered the primary source and unreliable power a secondary source. Economically, it makes no sense to add an unreliable source, such as solar or wind, unless the secondary reduces overall costs. Increasingly, experience in Germany, England, Spain, US, etc, are showing that these unreliable secondary sources are increasing overall costs, not reducing them. Therefore, they are an unneeded luxury good. Adding into this mix, General Electric announced a new gas fired turbine that can be more readily adjusted to the erratic nature of wind. However, if it does not reduce overall costs, it is yet another expensive toy. Please see links under Questioning European Green and Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind.
******************
Electric Vehicles: All-electric vehicles and gas-battery hybrids took another public hit this week with Toyota announcing it will not put into production a new all-electric car, and with continuing poor sales of gas-battery hybrids. But, perhaps the most damning statement came from the widely-respected Consumers Report review on the Fisker gas-battery hybrid called Karma. Combined, the US Federal Government and the State of Delaware have given Fisker two hundred million dollars in subsidies, ostensively to build a car in Delaware. The Karma is built in Finland and a second car, to be built in Delaware, is no longer considered viable. As to the review: “Most Karmas are going to be bought by the rich and famous,” said the Consumer Reports reviewer. “That’s good, because they can afford another car to drive if their Fisker’s in the shop.” Who knew the somber Consumers Report had a sense of humor? Please see links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles and Below the Bottom Line.
******************
Taxes on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Although US Congress is out campaigning, the possibility of taxing carbon dioxide emissions continues to be discussed by the Washington establishment. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) produced a report re-stating a prior study that about one-half of the massive Federal Government deficits can be covered by 2020 with taxes on carbon dioxide emissions of $20 per metric ton starting in 2012 and increasing 5.6% annually to about $31 per metric ton by 2020. Since 2009, the deficits have been running over $1 Trillion per fiscal year.
The report seems to be competently done, but the impacts of economic dislocations are probably understated and the question of use of the new revenues is a major issue. It must be remembered that after using its computer models to evaluate the stimulus bill, the CRS predicted that the bill would keep unemployment from exceeding 8% and it would be down to about 5.5% by mid 2012. Unemployment has not been as low as 8% since the passage of the bill and, using the size of the labor force of 2009, it stands above 11%. Please see links under Cap and Trade and Carbon Taxes.
******************
Silent Spring: This week marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of the book Silent Spring, which marked the transformation of conservationism and prudent environmentalism (wise use) to radical environmentalism. The book falsely asserted that virtually all forms of cancer have environmental causes. Thus, cancer can be virtually eliminated by eliminating all forms of human “pollution”, no matter what or how benign or beneficial the activities may be. This unscientific legacy continues in the EPA and other government agencies.
Probably, the worst form of neo-colonialism that ever took place was driven by radical environmentalism following the EPA banning the use of DDT on the unsubstantiated claim that it may cause cancer. (Wise use would have been more appropriate.)
By the early 1950s, tropical doctors demonstrated that indoor spraying of huts was a safe, highly effective way of drastically reducing malaria in humans. The EPA ban was used to make the world-wide banning of DDT a condition for foreign aid. As a result, in tropical countries, tens of millions died and hundreds of millions suffer from reoccurring bouts with malaria, largely preventable by the indoor spraying of huts with DDT. This is not a proud moment in American or Western civilization. Please see links under Environmental Industry.
******************
Energy Independence? The concept that North America may become independent of the rest of the world for fossil fuels continues to stir controversy. The US and North America are largely independent in coal and, thanks to hydraulic fracturing, in natural gas. In 2011 the top three oil producers were ranked, in order, as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/top-5-oil-producing-countries-in-
2011.aspx#axzz27yXosbru Preliminary 2012 data indicates that the rankings may change to Saudi Arabia, the US, and Russia for 2012.
Significant infrastructure investments must be made before the US or North America can become independent in oil. Such investments require that the production of “tight oil”, that released by hydraulic fracturing of shale, be sustained and that international prices of crude oil remain above historic levels. Further, deepwater oil developments require high prices. Several analysts suggest that prices must remain above $70 a barrel. As stated in prior TWTWs, the budgets of the primary exporting countries require that the world price remains above $70 per barrel.
There is a lack of historic knowledge on the productive life of tight oil, as well as deepwater oil. The standards used to evaluate traditional sources may no longer apply to these sources. Also, the non-traditional sources continue to undergo innovation that may result in lower production costs. Please see links under Energy Issues and Oil and Natural Gas, The Past or the Future?
******************
Number of the Week: Over 18,000 in a few days. As mentioned last week, the Public
Broadcasting System (PBS) had a one-hour segment on climate change that featured self- proclaimed former skeptic Richard Muller and included others such as Judith Curry and (horrors!) Anthony Watts. Immediately, certain web sites sprung into action and within a few days delivered a petition signed by over 18,000 people censoring PBS for including Anthony Watts. [In her comments on the program, Judith Curry stated that Watts appeared to be more a lukewarmer than she.]
The ombudsman of PBS publically stated that this program was not the finest hour for PBS, to which Curry agrees, but for other reasons. In his explanation of the program, it was not the finest hour of the ombudsman. No doubt those who make exaggerated claims of the difficulties global warming alarmists face with a hostile public will systematically ignore this episode of PBS.

1. Climate Realism
By S. Fred Singer, American Thinker, Sep 26, 2012
http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/climate_realism.html
Even with the Kyoto Protocol due to expire at the end of this year, Obama persists in giving highest priority to climate change policy if re-elected. Does the U.S. really want to lead the world in committing economic suicide? It pays to look at the rapidly disappearing scientific rationale for trying to mitigate a putative future global warming.
In an essay “Why the Global Warming Skeptics are Wrong” in the New York Review of Books of Feb. 22, 2012, Yale professor William D. Nordhaus attempts to counter the arguments of a group of 16 prominent scientists who published an essay, “No Need to Panic about Global Warming,” in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 27, 2012.
Two crucial points may have been overlooked in the debate:
**Evidence for anthropogenic global warming (AGW) is problematic.
**A modest warming is likely to be beneficial — not damaging.
First, some background: I have known Bill Nordhaus for about 40 years; he certainly is no wild- eyed alarmist, but rather a highly respected specialist in environmental economics. Through his association with the U.N. climate-science panel, he is familiar with the main arguments supporting the IPCC’s contention that human activities, mainly rising carbon dioxide levels from energy generation, have been responsible for much of past warming. He does not question this IPCC claim; however, I have no reason to believe that he supports any of the drastic CO2-mitigation schemes — be they carbon sequestration or alternative “green” energy projects — or that he has illusions about the efficacy of the Kyoto Protocol or similar measures of international control.
So I will simply try to address questions Prof. Nordhaus posed in his NYRB essay, to which I responded in a (Aug. 16) letter in the NYRB. I wanted my response to reach NYRB readers, typically liberal academics, lawyers, and teachers.
1. Is the planet in fact warming? This crucial question cannot be answered honestly unless one specifies the time interval referred to. Clearly, the climate has warmed since the last Ice Age. It has also warmed since about 1850, in recovering from the Little Ice Age (roughly 1400-1800 AD). But is has not warmed since the Medieval Warm Period of 1,000 years ago, or since the Holocene Optimum, which reached even higher temperatures 5,000-8,000 years ago. Nor has it warmed during the past decade.
Coming closer to the present, we see a warming between 1910 and 1940, which is real but not caused by human activities. Most would agree that the Earth’s surface cooled slightly between 1940 and 1975 — even though carbon dioxide, a greenhouse (GH) gas, had been steadily increasing during this period. Temperature data show a sudden, unexplained jump around 1976- 1977. Surface weather stations then report a modest increase in temperature up to the year 2000 –  although different analyses disagree on details and have been frequently revised. Many people, including Nordhaus, tend to identify this reported increase as caused by the almost parallel increase in CO2. In its Summary, the latest IPCC report (2007) states explicitly that this reported (surface) warming trend is sure (>90%) evidence for anthropogenic global warming (AGW).
**We note, however, that the atmosphere, both over land and ocean, did not warm during this same post-1978 period — even though atmospheric theory and every climate model predicts that the tropical atmosphere should warm nearly twice as rapidly as the surface. This atmospheric evidence comes from instruments in weather satellites, producing the only truly global data — and, independently, from thermometers in balloon-borne radiosondes.
**In 2000, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences assembled a team of distinguished scientists to discuss the puzzle of surface warming in the absence of an atmospheric warming trend. However, their report, “Reconciling observations of global temperature change,” could not reconcile the disparity.
**I note that an analysis of ocean data has shown no significant warming during the period of 1978 -2000. Independent non-thermometer data (so-called proxies, like tree rings, ice cores, ocean sediments, stalagmites, etc.) also show no warming trend between 1978 and 2000. Significantly, there has been no warming for the past decade. All this, in spite of constantly rising CO2 levels.
The inescapable conclusion — or perhaps I should say suspicion — is that land-based weather stations may be reporting just local temperature increases but that there is negligible global warming. If correct, this surmise would remove the main evidence for the IPCC’s claim about the existence of appreciable AGW.
2. Are human influences an important contributor to warming? Obviously, the answer must be no — if one accepts the evidence about the nonexistence of recent warming. Nevertheless, it should be stated that since CO2 is a GH, and since most if not all of its increase is human-caused, there must be some minor human contribution to climate change. The real scientific puzzle, not mentioned by Nordhaus, is why the observed temperature trends are so much smaller than what models calculate.
3. Is carbon dioxide a pollutant? Lawyers might say, Yes, this is what the Supreme Court ruled in 2007, but scientists are not so sure. A pollutant, by definition, must produce harmful effects. CO2 is a natural constituent of the atmosphere, non-toxic, invisible, having no physiological effects we know of — even at high concentrations. Its definition as a pollutant relies entirely on its alleged causation of significant global warming and on the additional assumption that a warmer climate is damaging.
(We should take note that CO2 is Nature’s plant fertilizer. The world’s important crop plants developed when CO2 levels were much greater than today’s. Innumerable experiments have demonstrated that higher CO2 concentrations are beneficial for plant growth and therefore benefit global agriculture. Plants not only grow faster, but require less water. All of this is well-known to agricultural experts and to the owners of commercial greenhouses, who often raise CO2 levels artificially to increase productivity. Perhaps we should be grateful to China, the world’s largest emitter of CO2.)
However, before considering CO2 as a “criteria pollutant” subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, the Supreme Court ruling requires the EPA to demonstrate by independent research that higher levels of CO2 are damaging to “human health and welfare.” But the EPA’s Endangerment Finding and supporting Technical Support Document (TSD) have been attacked by a large number of plaintiffs. The case was lost before the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia; it is likely that it will return to the Supreme Court, which may get a chance to modify its 2007 decision.
4. Are we seeing a regime of fear for skeptical climate scientists? Being fairly senior, I am not much affected by the animosity towards skeptics, revealed by the leaked e-mails from Climategate. However, I seem to have lost friends in the academic community and have had considerable difficulty in getting technical papers published in journals whose editors have openly expressed their bias. My real concern is for younger scientists who are just trying to establish their professional careers.
5. Are the views of mainstream climate scientists driven primarily by the desire for financial gain? This is a leading question; I would assume that scientific curiosity is the main driving force. Financial gain may be only one of several additional factors, along with prestige and academic advancement, invitations to important conferences, prizes, etc. However, I would point to the large sums, about $20 billion during the past decade, that the government has spent on climate research, of which only a tiny fraction has gone to skeptics. I also note the multi-million-dollar grants to “mainstream” climate scientists by private foundations, and even by oil companies such as Exxon and BP. Not surprisingly, the number of scientific publications is roughly proportional to this level of financial support.
6. Is it true that more carbon dioxide and additional warming will be beneficial? Briefly, my answer is yes.
First, Nordhaus correctly states that net benefits (benefits minus costs) should be maximized. This is mathematically equivalent to the well-known result that one should increase pollution control as long as marginal benefits exceed marginal costs. As an expert economist, however, Nordhaus should expand his discussion of more important points:
**The discount rate plays a crucial role in the present case, where costs are incurred today, while benefits may be realized 100 years hence. Nordhaus himself uses realistic discount rates of 4%, but he should be more critical of others, like Lord Nicholas Stern, who use discount rates close to zero, which severely skews any cost-benefit analysis by greatly over-estimating the present dollar-value of benefits.
**Further, one must ask if there is really any net damage at all from a warmer climate. I wonder why Professor Nordhaus never mentions the work of Yale resource economist Robert Mendelsohn and his 23 economist-colleagues, whose acclaimed book concludes that a modest warming and higher CO2 levels would actually enhance GDP-raising average income, prosperity, and general welfare. True, there are also respected economists who hold a different view; the 1996 report of the IPCC lists results of several of their analyses. While these agree surprisingly well on the total amount of damage, I found that they strongly disagree on individual sectors (like agriculture and others) that make up these totals. And they all assign large economic damage to sea-level rise — even though there is no observational evidence for an influence of short-term (decadal) temperature changes on the rate of rise of sea level.
Finally, it should be obvious, perhaps, but needs to be stated explicitly that if a warmer climate produces positive net benefits rather than damages, then, in principle, one cannot even conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Nor should one try to mitigate emissions of CO2 in any way; our current policies are simply misguided.

2. What Arctic Foxes Know About Global Warming
By Matt Ridley, WSJ, Sep 21, 2012 [H/t William Readdy]
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444450004578002500275382408.html?KEYWORDS=Arctic+fox+global+warming
This week probably saw the Arctic Ocean’s sea ice reach its minimum extent for the year and begin to expand again, as it usually does in mid-September. Given that the retreat of Arctic ice has become a key piece of evidence for those who take a more alarmed view of global warming, it’s newsworthy that 2012’s melt was the greatest since records began in 1979, with sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere shrinking to about 1.3 million square miles, or about half the 1979-2008 average.
As this column has sometimes pointed out ways in which the effects of global warming are happening more slowly than predicted, it is fair to record that this rate of decline in Arctic sea ice is faster than many predicted. Although an entirely ice-free Arctic Ocean during at least one week a year is still several decades away at this rate, we are halfway there after just three decades.
Arctic melts on this scale have happened before, however. Svend Funder of the Danish Museum of Natural History and his colleagues recently studied the northern coast of Greenland, where the land-fast sea ice never breaks up, even in a year like this. Yet evidence of wave action in the past (indicating open waters) and waterlogged driftwood show that for 2,500 years in the “Holocene Optimum” period, when Arctic summer temperatures were two to four degrees Celsius warmer than today, the summer melt of the Arctic Ocean routinely left half as much ice as this year.
Another study, by Jørgen Berge and colleagues from the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway, and other institutions, discovered a downward migration of egg-carrying amphipod crustaceans that enables them to recolonize Arctic ice from ice-free areas using deep currents. They say this implies that some animals are well adapted to the seasonal loss of ice.
In the Holocene Optimum there was no collapse of the polar-bear population or “point of no return.” The extent of Arctic summer sea ice then increased steadily, reaching a maximum during the very recent so-called Little Ice Age of 1500-1850. Potential confirmation that this was an unusually icy epoch comes from a newly published study by Durham University (in Britain) of the genetics of Arctic foxes on Iceland.
Greger Larson and his colleagues found that the remains of 17 Arctic foxes in Iceland from the ninth to the 12th centuries shared a single genetic signature, while the modern Icelandic fox population has five different genetic types. During the cold centuries, they infer, genetically diverse Arctic foxes from the Eurasian continent apparently reached Iceland via sea ice.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the extent of summer Arctic sea ice then shrank after 1850, before expanding in the 1960s. Clearly, the Arctic Ocean’s sea ice is both more variable and more vulnerable to warming than expected. But is the current rapid retreat caused only by warming? At least some of it might be caused by soot from dirty, coal-fired power stations. Some scientists have noticed that the decline in Arctic sea ice correlates better with the rapid growth of coal consumption in China than it does with global temperature. As the argument goes: Soot falling on white ice darkens it, which results in faster melting in summer sun.
Correlation does not always mean causation, but if soot is contributing to sea-ice melt, then it is moderately good news, because cleaning up soot emissions from power stations could be both cheaper and quicker than cutting carbon-dioxide emissions.
There’s also the puzzling fact that Antarctic sea ice shows no sign of summer retreat, and the current winter’s peak extent is well above average. The sea-dominated Southern Hemisphere is certainly warming more slowly than the land-dominated Northern Hemisphere, but it has still been warming. If warming is supposed to be “global,” shouldn’t sea ice retreat at both ends of the world?

3. Power Plants Aim to Curb Their Thirst By Rebecca Smith, WSJ, Sep 21, 2012 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444433504577649914114390298.html?mod=IT P_pageone_1
The drought that parched more than 30 states this summer is forcing the power industry to rethink its heavy use of water and adopt technology to use less of it.
Electricity generation is the biggest single user of water in the U.S., according to an analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey, which found that power plants account for nearly half of all water withdrawn from American rivers, lakes and seashores each day—more than 200 million gallons worth.
The water, which surpasses by far the amount used for irrigation, is converted to steam to turn turbines, and is used to cool equipment at many kinds of plants, including nuclear, coal and gas units. Much of it later is put back, though in heated form.
This summer, however, some power plants had to cut electricity production because of low water levels or because water was too warm to cool nuclear reactors. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the period from August 2011 through July 2012 was the hottest 12-month period on record in the U.S. since 1895.
Low water levels remain a concern for both power companies and the agencies that operate electric grids across the country, the federal Energy Information Administration said earlier this month.
“The power industry is all over this issue,” said John Moura, associate director of reliability assessments for National Electric Reliability Corp., the federal organization responsible for electric-grid dependability. “The net result is going to be a reduction in water use by the power industry.”
The federal Bureau of Reclamation, the second-biggest producer of hydroelectric power in the country with dams across the western U.S., said electricity output in the drought-stricken Colorado River system is down 16% from a decade ago. To cope with persistently low water, the agency is installing new turbines that can generate electricity with lower flows in places like the Hoover Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border.
“We’re just getting started,” said Kerry McCalman, senior hydropower adviser, “but results are good so far.”
Rising water temperatures also are causing trouble. In July, Exelon Corp.’s EXC -0.33% Braidwood nuclear plant in Illinois had to get special permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue running when the plant’s cooling-pond temperature reached 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
Operators of the Millstone nuclear-power plant in Connecticut shut down one of two reactors when the temperature of Long Island Sound reached 75 degrees in early August. Plant spokesman Kenneth Holt said the two-week shutdown resulted in 255,000 megawatt hours of lost power production worth several million dollars.
Dominion Resources Inc., D -0.24% Millstone’s operator, is conducting a study it hopes will convince regulators that the plant is safe to run even if water temperatures are high.
Some companies are replacing coal-fired plants, which use a lot of water, with less-thirsty natural-gas plants. In Salem, Mass., Footprint Power LLC got community support to do just that, in part because of the water savings.
The existing Salem Harbor coal plant was allowed to withdraw as much as 670 million gallons of seawater each day and discharge water that was as much as 28 degrees hotter, changing the ecology of the harbor. The new gas-fired plant, which the company hopes to have in operation in 2016, will use no seawater, said Peter Furniss, the chief executive of Footprint Power, which recently bought the site from Dominion.
Mr. Furniss said the reduction in water use is key to garnering regulatory approvals in Massachusetts.
AES Corp. AES -0.98% wants to build new gas-fired units at its existing plant site in Huntington Beach, Calif., which will use a $30 million air condenser instead of relying on seawater for cooling. Currently, the Huntington Beach plant uses an average of 270 million gallons of seawater and 260,000 gallons of fresh water each day. If AES gets permission to build the new gas-fired units and finds a buyer for the power, it plans to stop using seawater and cut fresh-water use to 41,000 gallons a day.
“Huntington Beach is surf city,” said Stephen O’Kane, program engineer for AES, which is based in Arlington, Va. “When they heard we were proposing to eliminate using ocean water for cooling, that was a huge plus” in generating public support for the plan.

"WASHINGTON  —   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump’s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president’s criticism of independent judges “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” The remarks by Judge Gorsuch,  chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation’s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings “disgraceful” and described the courts as “so political. ” Those remarks followed Mr. Trump’s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a “  judge” whose “ridiculous” ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump’s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “a bad high school student would understand. ” “This is highly unusual,” said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. “Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity. ” Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued. Mr. Trump’s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump’s comments “extremely   and  ” because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump. “Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it’s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,” said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush. Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law. “But those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it’s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,” Mr. Rosen said. “Judicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,” he added, “and it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes. ” Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation. “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right. ” Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched “in amazement” Tuesday night as a   federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security. “I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s sad. I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. ” His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing  —   the audio of which was carried live on national television  —   during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump’s order. Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday. Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, “I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge. ” The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama. “If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they’d do what they should be doing,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s so sad. ” By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. “Right on  —   they were perfect,” Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton’s comments. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections. John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history  —   the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake  —   on an insignificant matter. “I hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,” said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “President Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency. ” Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts’ legitimacy. “It’s not illegal, it’s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it’s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,” Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, “I always cringed. ” Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with “very evil intentions,” to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect. That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump’s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans. “Believe me, I’ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’re going to take care of it. We’re going to win. ”"

Apparently Mr. Connolley has edited 5428 Wikipedia articles, most about climate. Die Kalte Sonne:
Unbelievable but true: The Wikipedia umpire on Climate Change was a member of the UK Green Party and openly sympathized with the views of the controversial IPCC. So it was not a referee, but the 12th Man of the IPCC team.
I’m not sure how accurate the translation is, but it suggests he was somehow part of the IPCC “short list” team. See it here at Die Kalte Sonne via this Google Translate link:

With over 5000 articles he’s edited, it makes you wonder if Mr. Connolley was employed by someone or some organization specifically for the task.

"**Teachers, pupils and parents are waiting to find out if next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams are going to be held next May.**
The Scottish government has already cancelled National 5s, the more junior exams, and originally said it planned to hold Highers in as normal a way as possible.
However, the government has now said it is looking at the issue of disruption to education around self-isolation periods for Covid-19 and some key meetings are taking place this week that could help ministers make their decision.
John Swinney announced the cancellation of the National 5s in October.
The education secretary made a statement to parliament in which he said holding a full exam diet in 2021 was ""too big a risk"" due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
National 5s will now be decided by ""teacher judgement supported by assessment"". Schools are still waiting for the full guidance on how to carry this out.
The Scottish Qualifications Authority said plans were currently continuing in preparation for Higher and Advanced Higher exams starting on 10 May 2021.
A spokesman added: ""A clear contingency plan is being developed as part of the work being undertaken by the National Qualifications Group 2021, including key checkpoints up to the February break to assess public health advice and its impact on the plans for exams.""
The education secretary said he would make a final decision on what was happening with Highers and Advanced Highers by the February break and a ""contingency plan"" was in place should they need to be called off, which would see the grades awarded on teacher judgement.
As the BBC has been reporting, Covid-19 has meant tens of thousands of pupils have had to isolate at home since schools returned full time in August and particularly since they came back after the October break. The year groups most affected by these absences tend to be S3-S5.
The worst hit areas are in the central belt, where we have heard from several students who have had multiple periods of isolation through being identified as a contact of someone with Covid-19.
Scotland's exams were cancelled in 2020 - for the first time in history - due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Results were initially decided using teacher estimated grades which the Scottish Qualifications Authority then moderated based on different schools' past performances.
There was an outcry and protests were held when it emerged that 125,000 of those teacher estimates were downgraded, with claims the system was unfair to children at schools with worse records in exams.
The Scottish government then agreed to accept just the teacher estimates. It also commissioned a review into the issue.
Prof Mark Priestly's report subsequently recommended cancelling the final exams for National 5s next year.
Wales has cancelled all GCSE and A-level exams in 2021. Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for pupils due to the Covid pandemic. Grades will be decided using classroom assessments.
In England, A-levels and GCSEs are due to go ahead next summer, starting three weeks later than usual. Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week.
Northern Ireland is planning to hold all exams in 2021, with its education minister, Peter Weir, saying they represented the ""fairest way of judging students"".
This week, John Swinney told MSPs at Holyrood that he appreciated ""the necessity for early decision making"".
He said the evidence suggested that about 75% of S4-S6 pupils ""have experienced no disruption to their learning in sense of having to self-isolate"".
He added: ""I am very acutely focused on the issue of equityâ¦it's material to my decision making around the Highers and Advanced Highers.
""I have to be satisfied that every young person, no matter their experience of Covid, is able to have the full opportunities for learning and teaching and therefore position themselves to be in the best place to be able to perform in any exam diet in the spring.""
The Scottish government's education recovery group, made up of education bodies, teaching unions, college and university representatives, will meet on Wednesday and is expected to discuss exams.
On Friday, there is a planned meeting of the qualifications contingency group, which the government's website states is ""invoked in circumstances where there is a system-wide risk to the delivery of the exam diet and the awarding of qualifications."" It last met on 5 October.
Neither of these groups are decision-making bodies. They are used to gather information and opinions across education. Ultimately the decision on Highers will be made by Mr Swinney and it is likely that he will inform parliament first if a decision is reached.
It would be very difficult politically for the government to cancel exams five months in advance - the amount of disruption nationally to schooling is broadly in line with the amount that could have been anticipated.
However, there is the very real question of fairness to candidates whose courses have been disrupted.
Would changing the format of exams to allow a greater choice of questions be sufficient? An appeals system could be used to support candidates who had to self-isolate or any candidates who lost out because their teachers had to stay off work.
Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, is calling for a decision to be made sooner rather than later.
General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Given the growing inequities in teaching time and the ongoing threat to an exam diet, the EIS believes it is prudent to make an early decision to switch to an alternative assessment model, although there are clear workload implications which would require to be addressed."""
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family’s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage  —   not his own family’s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump’s products  —   a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores  —   the president took to Twitter to complain that “Ivanka has been treated so unfairly” by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then   it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump’s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president’s tweet was not about business but about “an attack on his daughter. ” “For people to take out their concern about his actions, or his executive orders, on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family,” Mr. Spicer said. It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name, or to some political motive by Nordstrom. After the president temporarily barred people from seven   countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order. On Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer’s comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump’s products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” the Nordstrom statement said. “We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. ” As Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts, who nonetheless called it inappropriate. “It is a total misuse of presidential power,” said Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and formerly the top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission. “He is really bringing to bear the whole weight of the office of president on a business decision. Take another company that is considering whether or not to drop her line  —   they obviously are going to ask themselves if they want to be attacked by the president. ” Mr. Trump’s blast at Nordstrom came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit that described her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. And Mr. Spicer, the White House spokesman, has urged people to visit the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened late last year. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a group that promotes ethics in government, said Mr. Trump’s swipe at Nordstrom was not a major issue in itself. But Mr. Weissman said it demonstrates that as president, Mr. Trump continues to have multiple conflicts of interest with his own and his family’s business interests. Mr. Trump refuses to sell his assets or put them into a blind trust, but he has said that he has ceded operation of his businesses to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. “He has committed to severing himself from the family business operations,” Mr. Weissman said. “That is obviously not the case. ” Ivanka Trump has no formal role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with foreign officials and business leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. After years as a business executive, Ms. Trump has suddenly found herself without a clear path to walk as she adjusts to life in Washington. She has expressed frustration to a number of associates with Nordstrom’s decision, describing it as a political move and maintaining that the sales of her brand had not sagged. While she is no longer involved in the management of her business, she is said to be acutely aware of the controversies surrounding her product line. The Trump presidency is forcing retailers to rethink their relationships with Trump product lines, weighing how well they sell and what actions will anger or placate the largest number of customers. After Nordstrom said it was dropping Ivanka Trump’s merchandise, Trump supporters on social media began calling for a boycott of the stores. Last week, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores sent a note to employees  —   a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  —   telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into” the racks where most products hang, the note read. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded. ” The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise, “not to remove it from the sales floor,” said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers’ parent corporation. “We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,” she said. Ms. Thompson did not respond directly to questions about whether instructing stores to discard signs was unusual. But an employee at one of the company’s stores, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said she had not received such a request during her several years working there. Neiman Marcus recently stopped selling Ms. Trump’s jewelry and accessories through its website, but her clothes are still sold at Macy’s, the nation’s largest department store chain, as well as its sister company Bloomingdale’s, where her shoes and handbags are available online. In August, Bloomingdale’s committed to selling her clothes in seven of its stores, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Keating. “I think they all have probably been looking closely at Ivanka’s sales numbers and weighing whether they’re worth all the problems she’s brought them,” said Shannon Coulter, who helped found #GrabYourWallet, an online campaign to boycott Trump products."

In Australia we find a true warrior of free speech in Queensland Senator George Brandis, who has come out blasting what he sees as the “sheer authoritarianism” rampant in the global climate change movement, where anyone who challenges the science is labeled a despicable “denier”.
He calls the extremely intolerant approach of the global warming alarmists approach “ignorant” and “medieval” and adds that they suffer from “The Debate Is Over” syndrome and that the movement represents “a new and illiberal climate of anti-intellectualism.”

Website Spiked Online here presents a portrayal of the Australian Senator, who once was a believer in man-made global warming and thought something had to be done about it quickly.
Brandis believes that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA) is and authoritarian attempt by the state to curb free speech and thus should be repealed and that there needs to be greater freedom of expression. Accordng to the Spiked Online report:
…there were two recent, specific things that made him realise just what a mortal threat freedom of speech faces in the modern era and that he would have to dust down his Mill, reread his Voltaire, and up the ante in his war of words against, as he puts it, the transformation of the state into ‘the arbiter of what might be thought’. The first thing was the climate-change debate; and the second is what is known down here as The Andrew Bolt Case.”
He views climate change as a cult religion that “has become a gospel truth that you deny or mock at your peril” and that it attempts to “delegitimise the views of those who disagree rather than engaging with them intellectually and showing them why they are wrong“.

Steven Joyce may not be popular, but no one can deny his economic ability. Those who disliked him in the past obviously had no idea how inept and incompetent the next government was going to be. Steven Joyce belongs to an era, only recently ended, where we expected skill and ability from our politicians. How I miss those days.



Steven Joyce was Finance Minister for a short time, but he knows what makes our economy successful, and if he were still in that position, we would not be going backwards, as we are now.



It was [confirmed this week ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/115813023/economy-loses-some-steam-as-gdp-growth-slips-to-05pc)that New Zealand is now running at little more than half speed.  
From growing at rates of 3½ to 4 per cent three years ago our economy at the end of June was only 2.1 per cent larger than it was the previous June.  
That’s a problem firstly because our population is growing at about 1.6 per cent a year, so if our economy grows at 2 per cent then the amount of additional wellbeing per person (to coin a phrase) is three fifths of not very much. 



Never underestimate the effect of a growing population. It is conveniently forgotten in most current discussions about our economy.



The second problem is that our terms of trade (the prices of our exports versus our imports) are still very strong so [we should still be cranking along](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115915004/new-zealands-slowing-gdp-economic-vandalism-or-business-as-usual). It’s a problem if we are slowing down when the world really wants to buy what we are selling. What happens if the world actually falls out of bed? 



The world situation is volatile, but not very bad as yet. This may change, but if it does, it will simply mean that our economy is affected more than it needs to be. We could still be growing at 4% if this government had half a clue.



But they don’t.



The government has been quick to blame the world economy for our lower growth rate this week, but our terms of trade put the lie to that.



The third problem is that there is no sign of anything on the horizon that will lead to much of an upturn, and in fact all the signs are that we are going to slow further. Our businesses are in a funk because of what is known as regulatory overhang. In short, they are too fearful to invest because the government is making lots of rule changes that could mean they don’t get much of a return for the risk they take.



Uncertainty changes everything. The fact that our exports are still holding up is a good thing, but if government policy was more business-friendly, we could be rocking along as we did during the GFC when most countries were struggling. What exactly was it that made the difference back then?



We had a competent government with a business-friendly attitude. 



The fourth problem is that lower growth means less to go around. If we were still growing as fast as we were then in real terms our economy would be around $5 billion bigger this year than it is. That means more money for higher pay and more jobs, and of course about 30 per cent of it goes into the government coffers – which would pay for a lot more cancer drugs, teachers or electric vehicle subsidies. 



Oh dear. What can I say?



Its time to rein in some of his [the Minister of Finance] ministerial colleagues who are wreaking havoc with business confidence.



For example he should suggest the Minister of Immigration sort out his portfolio so that [horticulturists can find seasonal workers ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/115922923/growers-warn-of-jobs-losses-unless-immigration-decision-comes-soon)and the international education sector can get up off its knees. He should tell the Minister for the Environment to come up with a more reasonable plan for [water quality improvements](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/113949705/do-new-zealands-climate-change-plans-live-up-to-the-hype) and methane emissions reductions so farmers step back from the cliff edge, and the Minister of Education to stop stuffing about with the apprenticeship system.



He should encourage the Reserve Bank Governor to be less heroic on [bank capital requirements](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/111226761/economist-bank-capital-changes-would-add-thousands-to-borrowers-bills?rm=m), persuade his colleagues to do a backtrack on gas exploration now it is proven the ban is simply value destroying and does nothing for climate change, overrule the Greens to permit some gold mining, and stop taxing tourists more so the tourism sector starts growing again. He should cancel the return to industry-wide pay bargaining given that NZ First are never going to vote for it anyway, tell the Transport Minister to get on with building at least some of the stalled roading projects, particularly given that light rail is years away, and reverse at least one of the petrol tax increases.  
Then he could watch the economy recover and start thinking about how he’s going to allocate the increased government revenues. And New Zealand will be in much better shape if the world economy does get worse. 



Some may disagree, but I feel that Adrian Orr’s policy of dropping interest rates to zero per cent (yes, he will) while forcing a more conservative policy on capital held by banks cancel each other out. Banks are under more pressure to hang on to your money, while interest rates are so low that they are ineffective. None of this is working in any positive way.



Unfortunately none of that is likely to happen this year, which means as a country we will be poorer and there will be less rather than more to go around. The Government has outsourced economic policy to the Reserve Bank Governor so interest rates will keep dropping, which brings its own risks, and the government will simply cross its fingers and hope the world keeps growing.



 **It’s a massive missed opportunity. Our country should be doing so much better.**



We could be doing so much better if we had a competent government. But we don’t.



I miss Steven Joyce. And John Key and Bill English. Yes, some may have disliked them as politicians, but they knew what they were doing. Can you say that of the current government?



No. You can’t. And we will all suffer as a result of their ineptitude.

"**The rules for licensed venues have been turned on their head by the first minister following his announcement on Monday of**sweeping restrictions **to the hospitality trade. Let's take a closer look.**
From Friday at 18:00, licensed pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will have to stop serving alcohol on their premises. Those with an off-licence can sell alcoholic drinks to be taken away.
They will have to close at 18:00 every day until further notice. They can operate a takeaway service for food and drink after 18:00.
The regulations will be reviewed on 17 December.
In a word, yes. Some people have questioned whether this is fair on pubs, but as stated above, pubs which have the correct licence can provide ""off-sales"", ie alcohol to take away.
According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the majority of pubs tend to have an off-licence as part of their trading conditions anyway. But under the Business and Planning Act 2020, all premises have now been given temporary extensions to their licences allowing off-sales until September 2021.
It's important to be clear that alcohol sales are not banned in pubs - you just can't drink it there. This is not Prohibition Mark II.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said they had considered bringing in a 18:00 cut-off time for alcohol sales in shops but had decided people would just stock up before that time, so it would have been ""an action without a consequence"".
We're a land of wine (and beer), (bar-)women and song apparently, with 2,190 pubs in Wales, according to House of Commons figures from May.
This means Wales has the second-highest number of pubs per population in the UK, at 70 per 100,000. Only the south west of England has more.
The accommodation and food sector in Wales employs 106,400 people according to the latest statistics. It accounts for 3.2% of all industries and is worth Â£2.1bn to the Welsh economy.
Of those jobs 27,400 are in Wales' 1,200 cafes and 1,500 restaurants, according to UK Hospitality.
Beyond that, the food and drink supply chain employs 229,500 people in Wales, including in catering, retail and wholesale, agriculture and fisheries, and manufacturing and packaging.
The news is already having a big impact. Wales' largest brewer, Brains, is closing 100 of its managed pubs on Friday and putting 1,500 staff on furlough. Not much Christmas cheer or singing there.
It's bad news for a sector which was already in trouble prior to Covid striking. Despite that high per capita figure for pubs, Wales had the biggest proportionate decline in pubs in the UK, with 1% closing even as pub numbers were increasing across the UK as a whole.
Good question. It's not entirely certain who has the answer to that.
In the briefing, Mr Drakeford said the evidence ""was there"" that the virus was spreading in hospitality venues, and that with cases rising, without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter.
However, when asked for this evidence, the Welsh Government initially pointed back to a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) report from September which said there was ""moderate impact"" from taking action on pubs.
This is what the advice said: ""Potential reduction in Rt [reproduction number] of 0.1-0.2, though precise estimation very difficult. Environmental risk in bars, pubs etc is likely to be higher than many other indoor settings due to close proximity of people, long duration of exposure, no wearing of face coverings by customers, loud talking that can generate more aerosols.
""Some venues are poorly ventilated, especially in winter. Consumption of alcohol impacts on behaviour.""
But - and it is quite a big but - this was talking about the impact if you close pubs entirely. Not the impact of stopping serving alcohol, although that is referenced, and crucially, not closing them early.
In fact the advice goes on to say: ""Curfews likely to have a marginal impact. Low confidence [in the outcome].""
So is it ho, ho, hogwash?
When asked for more specifics, the Welsh Government then referred to another Sage report which it said had concluded that measures being taken in Scotland's level three and England's tier three coronavirus restrictions were effective.
England's measures once again involve closing hospitality venues entirely, which is like comparing apples with pears.
However, Scotland's - finally - do apply the same measures as Wales will be taking, namely venues closing at 18:00, and no alcohol being served.
However, these restrictions were only brought in on 2 November, and it is worth bearing in mind that many of the areas now in Level 3 or 4 had previously been under restrictions which had seen pubs closed entirely.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We know that as the consumption of alcohol increases, social distancing and the perception of risk decreases.
""Wherever people mix, there's a risk of coronavirus being passed on."""
"I have travelled from Plymouth to the UN headquarters in New York many times, often to discuss how to protect the oceans from climate change. The deeply uncomfortable irony was that the carbon emitted on my fossil fuel-powered journey directly contributed to the problem I was there to solve. Greta Thunberg’s decision to travel the exact same journey to the UN Climate Action Summit on state-of-the-art sailing boat Malizia II shows that there are principled alternatives. But is there a way for the rest of us to cross the Atlantic without taking to the skies? Thunberg’s 14-day voyage was significantly faster than the typical sail time of three to four weeks, but that’s still not for anyone in a rush. Speed comes at the cost of comfort, too. Pictures from inside Malizia II show a pared-down interior, even lacking a functional toilet on board. Such extreme measures are unlikely to interest most travellers and, at any rate, hopping on one of the world’s fastest wind-powered yachts isn’t an option for most of us. But sailing is a more feasible option than you might think. Private boats cross the ocean constantly. New online services that match boat owners with travellers mean that hitching a ride is more plausible than ever. For those with the right skills, this could be as a member of the boat’s crew or for those without, as a passenger. Some boats require payment, others don’t. The market is changing, too. Companies such as UK-based VoyageVert are actively exploring  opportunities to develop sail-powered oceanic travel for groups of up to 200 people and envisage a fleet of transoceanic sail-powered passenger vessels. Travelling in such a way would drastically cut the carbon cost of crossing the Atlantic – though it’s not likely to be cheap. For climate-conscious travelers with time – and probably money – to spare, sailing is the only way to travel. But what about travel for the masses? A potentially quicker and more cost-effective alternative would be to take a ferry. Many countries are connected by ferries, but a transatlantic ferry service does not yet exist – largely because of plentiful, faster and cheaper flights. The closest alternative is to take a seven-day voyage in a cruise ship, which would set you back around £1,700 for a basic cabin and a return ticket.

 This isn’t exactly cheap either – and nor will it save much on your carbon footprint. Cruise vessels are one of the most energy-intensive of all tourism activities, emitting significant quantities of greenhouse gases and health-damaging pollutants including nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter. In fact, perhaps unexpectedly, the carbon dioxide generated per passenger in a standard class cabin on a seven-day cruise on board a large modern vessel is approximately 1.5 times that of a single economy flight between London and New York. Admittedly, some of these emissions will be from the many activities on the ship rather than fuel and basic power consumption. An alternative ferry service with many of the luxuries of the cruise ship experience stripped away would be more climate-friendly, though by how much is difficult to say as ferry companies don’t routinely disclose carbon emissions. And the isolation of a seven-day oceanic journey with few activities may not appeal to many travellers. But the carbon cost of these journeys should come down significantly in the next 20 years. The traditional reliance of vessels on heavy fuel oil, which creates air pollution and contributes to climate heating, is reducing. Thanks to new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulations to substantially reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions from ships in the next decade, greener fuels are slowly coming into use. Like cars, hybrid vessels combining conventional engines with batteries are also becoming increasingly common. Cruise companies are considering even greater use of battery power in response to the new 2020 regulations, as well as to minimise pollution in the sensitive environments many of their boats disturb, such as coral reefs and fjords. Other technologies such as solar collectors, conventional sails and keel-mounted turbines are also increasingly contributing to the propulsion, electricity and heating of ships. My estimate is that collectively, these technologies could reduce carbon emissions by as much as 50% over the next 20 years.

 But while these innovations will reduce both carbon emissions and damaging air pollution from vessels, if anything they’re likely to increase travel time. As such, transatlantic surface travel is likely to remain of limited appeal, even if prices become more affordable. Hydrofoil technology that lifts a vessel’s hull out of water – thereby reducing drag and increasing speed – does have the potential to significantly reduce journey times. But for this to affect transatlantic crossings, the size and weight of ocean-going vessels would need to tumble, which means using much lighter materials that either don’t yet exist or are cost-prohibitive. Until then, journey time will remain the primary barrier to low-carbon ocean travel. For now, the only answer for most of us wanting to minimise our impact on the planet is to minimise how much we travel across it – especially when it comes to crossing vast expanses of water.

"“It’s hard to believe, isn’t it, that we had a heatwave just last week?” Those words were spoken by a BBC news presenter, in front of graphic images of fire service rescues, as heavy rain caused floods and landslides which closed many roads and railway lines. In recent days there have dramatic floods across the north of England, particularly around Manchester, the Peak District and Yorkshire.   For me, this is personal, as I am from the worst affected area. I went to high school where people spent the night in their Civic Hall. Three miles away from where I grew up, a dam holding back Toddbrook Reservoir has been at risk of collapse and the town of Whaley Bridge was evacuated. But I’m not surprised that we are seeing flash flooding and I expect it to get worse in the future. I am a professor at Newcastle University, where I lead a large research group focused on understanding changes to intense rainfall events and flash floods. Over the past eight years we’ve been working closely with colleagues at the UK Met Office to develop new very high-resolution climate models that can simulate these very intense summer storms and therefore predict what might happen in a warming climate.  Our models tell us that by 2080 summers in the UK will be much hotter and drier. Heatwaves will be more common. In fact a report released by the Met Office on the same day as the latest flash floods tells us that heatwaves are already happening more often. When Cambridge recently hit 38.7℃, the UK became one of 12 countries to break its national temperature record this year. The world is warming. But although UK average summer rainfall is predicted to decrease, our models tell us that when it does rain it will be more intense than has been the case. Flash flooding in the UK is generally caused by intense rainstorms, where more than 30mm falls in an hour. Climate models predict these will happen five times more often by 2080.  Part of the reason for this is the simple fact that warmer air can hold more moisture. But that’s too simple: the availability of moisture also increases in areas close to warm oceans – warmer sea surface temperatures cause more moisture to be evaporated into the atmosphere, providing additional fuel for these intense storms. And here’s the scary bit: the Atlantic Ocean provides a vast source of moisture for storms in the UK. But that’s not the whole story. Heavy, short rain storms are intensifying more rapidly than would be expected with global warming (what we call the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship). Research also suggests that more intense storms can themselves grow bigger, and with both the intensity of the rainfall and the spatial footprint of the storm increasing, the total rainfall in an “event” could double.  What’s more, the larger storms seem to have an ability to draw in more moisture from the surrounding area and become even more intense: the additional energy (heating) fuelling the uplift of air within the storm’s core draws in even more moisture from the surface, allowing them to grow even larger, with more potential for flooding. These also provide the perfect ingredients for large hail storms. So, it is entirely consistent that we might expect both more heatwaves and more intense summer thunderstorms in a warmer climate. We also know which areas of the country are already susceptible to these flash floods from our analysis of historical records of flooding. Newspapers have reported on the dramatic impacts of these floods for centuries and this has allowed my team to reconstruct a flash-flooding history of the UK.  Certain parts of the country are highly vulnerable as their rivers respond quickly to rainstorms. These rivers tend to be found in steep, upland catchments underlain by non-permeable rocks, mainly in the north and west of the UK. High-risk catchments also include urban areas where the ground is also non-permeable, for entirely different reasons. Many of the towns reported to have suffered “biblical” flooding recently have suffered repeated flooding through history, but perhaps not within living memory. For example, Whaley Bridge is mentioned twice in the flood chronologies for events in June 1872 and July 1881:  On 19th [June 1872] the Goyt was 12 to 14 feet above its normal level. At Whaley Bridge houses near the river were completely flooded and people were taken into the chapel and inns … in Macclesfield a woman and child were drowned when the river Bollin overflowed. Two reservoirs burst in the vicinity. This rich archive of knowledge, including the prevalence of flooding in certain towns, even specific roads, is something we should draw upon in planning both the emergency response to these flash floods and for reducing their future impact. We can learn a lot from the past in how to manage the greater risks of flooding the future will bring."
"Senior officials have pledged that the European Union’s recovery plan will “do no harm” to the bloc’s landmark goals to tackle the climate crisis and threats to the natural world. Following the unveiling of a €750bn (£671bn) recovery plan to pull EU economies out of the deep economic downturn caused by coronavirus, the European commission announced further details of green spending on Thursday. The commission argues it can raise €150bn in public and private money, up from a pre-crisis goal of €100bn, to help fund greener transport, cleaner industry and renovated homes. At the heart of the plan, the EU proposes to more than quadruple to €40bn a “just transition fund” aimed at moving coal-dependent regions away from fossil fuels. The biggest beneficiaries would be large coal-producing countries, such as Poland, which could get €8bn in grants, Germany (€5.2bn) and Romania (€4.5bn). Frans Timmermans, the European commission vice-president who oversees the European green deal, said the EU needed to ensure it was not putting money into the industries of the past.  “For many regions and companies including those relying on coal production and carbon-intensive industrial processes, this economic crisis has raised an existential question,” he told journalists. “Do we rebuild what we have before or do we seize the opportunity to restructure and create different and new jobs?” “In all the actions we are going to take, we apply the ‘do no harm’ principle so you can’t have investment that takes us in a different direction.”  Accompanying the €750bn coronavirus recovery plan, the commission has also announced a revamped proposal for a €1.1tn EU budget for 2021-2027. That plan preserves a promise that 25% of EU spending would be dedicated to climate policy, which campaign groups say is not enough. European governments have been wrangling over the long-term budget for two years, leaving the EU institutions with the daunting task of finding agreement on the overall €1.85tn spending plans over the summer.  Green campaigners said the €750bn recovery plan lacked conditions to prevent governments from spending funds on fossil-fuel industries. “It’s right for the EU to act in solidarity injecting billions to resuscitate our economies while emphasising a green recovery,” said Jagoda Munic, the director of Friends of the Earth Europe. “But it’s ludicrous not to put any conditions on these funds. Our common future will be shaped by how this money is spent, and allowing strings-free handouts to polluting industries, or corporations who dodge tax or have poor labour practices, will not rebuild the sustainable, fair, caring world we need.” William Todts, the director of the NGO Transport and Environment, said that there was “a worrying lack of detail” on what green investment actually meant. “This plan leaves the door wide open for polluting engines and even aeroplanes to get stimulus money. That’s completely unacceptable.”  The commission rejected those claims. “It is completely clear that the greening of the projects and the objective of the green economy is present throughout the whole management of the funds,” said Elisa Ferreira, the EU commissioner in charge of distributing funds to less well-off regions. "

From Stanford University , the first carbon sequestration project that makes energy. I wonder, will Al Gore say the electricity produced by a carbon solar cell is “dirty energy”? Somewhere, off in the distance, I hear Joe Romm’s head exploding.
Stanford scientists build the first all-carbon solar cell

Stanford University scientists have built the first solar cell made entirely of carbon, a promising alternative to the expensive materials used in photovoltaic devices today.
The results are published in the Oct. 31 online edition of the journal ACS Nano.
“Carbon has the potential to deliver high performance at a low cost,” said study senior author Zhenan Bao, a professor of chemical engineering at Stanford. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a working solar cell that has all of the components made of carbon. This study builds on previous work done in our lab.”

Unlike rigid silicon solar panels that adorn many rooftops, Stanford’s thin film prototype is made of carbon materials that can be coated from solution. “Perhaps in the future we can look at alternative markets where flexible carbon solar cells are coated on the surface of buildings, on windows or on cars to generate electricity,” Bao said.
The coating technique also has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, said Stanford graduate student Michael Vosgueritchian, co-lead author of the study with postdoctoral researcher Marc Ramuz.
“Processing silicon-based solar cells requires a lot of steps,” Vosgueritchian explained. “But our entire device can be built using simple coating methods that don’t require expensive tools and machines.”
Carbon nanomaterials
The Bao group’s experimental solar cell consists of a photoactive layer, which absorbs sunlight, sandwiched between two electrodes. In a typical thin film solar cell, the electrodes are made of conductive metals and indium tin oxide (ITO). “Materials like indium are scarce and becoming more expensive as the demand for solar cells, touchscreen panels and other electronic devices grows,” Bao said. “Carbon, on the other hand, is low cost and Earth-abundant.”
For the study, Bao and her colleagues replaced the silver and ITO used in conventional electrodes with graphene – sheets of carbon that are one atom thick –and single-walled carbon nanotubes that are 10,000 times narrower than a human hair. “Carbon nanotubes have extraordinary electrical conductivity and light-absorption properties,” Bao said.
For the active layer, the scientists used material made of carbon nanotubes and “buckyballs” – soccer ball-shaped carbon molecules just one nanometer in diameter. The research team recently filed a patent for the entire device.
“Every component in our solar cell, from top to bottom, is made of carbon materials,” Vosgueritchian said. “Other groups have reported making all-carbon solar cells, but they were referring to just the active layer in the middle, not the electrodes.”
One drawback of the all-carbon prototype is that it primarily absorbs near-infrared wavelengths of light, contributing to a laboratory efficiency of less than 1 percent – much lower than commercially available solar cells. “We clearly have a long way to go on efficiency,” Bao said. “But with better materials and better processing techniques, we expect that the efficiency will go up quite dramatically.”
Improving efficiency
The Stanford team is looking at a variety of ways to improve efficiency. “Roughness can short-circuit the device and make it hard to collect the current,” Bao said. “We have to figure out how to make each layer very smooth by stacking the nanomaterials really well.”
The researchers are also experimenting with carbon nanomaterials that can absorb more light in a broader range of wavelengths, including the visible spectrum.
“Materials made of carbon are very robust,” Bao said. “They remain stable in air temperatures of nearly 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.”
The ability of carbon solar cells to out-perform conventional devices under extreme conditions could overcome the need for greater efficiency, according to Vosgueritchian. “We believe that all-carbon solar cells could be used in extreme environments, such as at high temperatures or at high physical stress,” he said. “But obviously we want the highest efficiency possible and are working on ways to improve our device.”
“Photovoltaics will definitely be a very important source of power that we will tap into in the future,” Bao said. “We have a lot of available sunlight. We’ve got to figure out some way to use this natural resource that is given to us.”

"Is climate change making spiders more aggressive? A recent scientific study suggests so, as the researchers link aggressiveness to tropical cyclones, events that are expected to become more frequent and powerful with climate change. Unsurprisingly, the findings got considerable media coverage. After all, it matches justified fears of catastrophic climate change impacts, with the unjustified fear many people have of harmless spiders.  However, I have studied these arachnids for more than 15 years and I am not too concerned about tropical cyclones making them more aggressive. It is worth worrying about spiders themselves though.  People who dislike spiders will of course be alarmed by any news of them getting more aggressive or even bigger due to climate change. But beyond the headlines, it is important to note that they might be getting bigger for a number of reasons, and that these are localised studies made on target species. Therefore warming temperatures are unlikely to impact the recorded 48,359 species globally in the same way. In any case, a study foundthat people who fear spiders are more likely to view them as larger than people who do not. And as I write this article at the end of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, one of the biggest common spiders in Europe (the garden-orb-weaver, or Araneus diadematus)) is now reaching maturity, so you might just come across “large” spiders in the middle of their webs more often at this time of year. As for aggression, the study that reportedly shows an increase with climate change only actually looked at the impact of tropical cyclones on a single species: the group-living spider (Anelosimus studiosus). Also known as the communal spider, these are often found alone or in groups of up to a few hundred individuals, and each individual is born with either an “aggressive” or “docile” behavioural type (the new study showed that after cyclones the ratio between the two would consistently change towards more aggressive colonies).  Communal behaviour is fairly rare in spiders, which is why this species is so interesting to study. But it is also what makes it less representative of other spiders behaviour, and not the best model to understand climate change impact on spiders globally. But what if you’re still worried about that one harmless species, smaller than a centimetre, potentially becoming more aggressive? In that case, it might be useful to note that aggressiveness in this context was measured as speed and number of spiders that respond to prey (who wouldn’t run to food if they were really hungry), prey-sharing efficiency and reduce wastage (aka, want not waste not), tendency to cannibalise males and eggs (desperate times call for desperate measures) and less susceptibility to infiltration by foreign spiders (aka, when the going gets tough, the tough don’t like sharing). Therefore, if you are not an insect, there is no cause for alarm – their “aggression” is not aimed at humans. But, although there is no reason to be concerned about their size or aggressiveness, you should be worried about spider survival under climate change. To take one example, just last year I was researching the beautiful ladybird spider in the western Asian highlands (I’m keeping the location secret as these animals are sought after by the illegal pet trade). Where I observed the males maturing much earlier in the year than they would normally do, thanks to an unusual hot period in winter.  For them, this was a disaster. These male ladybird spiders usually leave their nests in spring to find suitable females, but this time they would emerge into the wider world only to find no females yet available to mate, as females appear to depend on food intake to reach sexual maturity rather than wait for environmental cues, such as temperature. Like Romeo, these males died without their Juliet. You should care about all this because spiders eat an astronomical amount of insects, many of which are agricultural pests or the carries of human diseases, their loss will become ours as it impacts future ecosystems. Furthermore, although unappreciated and understudied, spiders have untapped potential to help us develop new medicine or materials with their venom or silk. You should also care because this type of impact might be particularly dire in desert dwelling animals, which already live at the threshold of what they can tolerate, so even small temperature increases and more frequent heat waves, can wipe entire populations and drastically change those ecosystems. Which is more likely to happen in regions where losing key biocontrol agents such as spiders, might put even more pressure on crops and on the human populations disproportionately affected by climate change. If we continue to disregard the value of these animals, not only will our fear likely cause disruption or put us in actual danger, but ignoring them now might drive them to disappear forever.  In the famous aeroplane analogy, species are compared with losing a couple of bolts that still allow the plane to fly, but as you lose more and more parts, you’re getting dangerously close to crashing. Well, spiders are part of the engine in this analogy. Wouldn’t you be worried if the aeroplane you are flying in, the spaceship we are all in, was losing engine parts in front of your eyes?"

Normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun.
The NHS says people should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if they are spending a lot of time indoors.
Scottish and Welsh governments and Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency issued similar advice during lockdown.
Before the pandemic, people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements from October to March.
Public Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if:
People with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement.
There is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus.
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults.
There are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections.
Some studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help when we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent.
The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) says studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this.
A review of research by NICE suggests there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat coronavirus.
But experts think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic to keep people as nutritionally fit as possible.
Some researchers have suggested that vitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes if someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making it hard to draw conclusions.
Prof Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and some research suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses.
This could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients, where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory state in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed.
No. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run.
If you choose to take vitamin D supplements:
Higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency.
Some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D.
Vitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet.
The ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3, the one made by your skin. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants.
Vitamin drops are available for babies.
Although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels.
It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone.
Eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even outside a pandemic.
It can include vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D.
Although you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun.
Cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage.
The advice is:
The dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women. A higher dose may be recommended for pregnant women with dark skin or with high-risk pregnancies."
"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

There is no trend whatsoever in US hurricane strength – this graph proves it. Click for story.
(via CFACT) The latest round of climate talks began this week in Doha, Qatar in the usual fashion – namely, with alarmist claims that the world is being imperiled by manmade global warming and it’s time for “action.”
Naturally, the U.S. is being chided to join the crowd, especially since it failed to do so last time by refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. To pressure Uncle Sam into getting-with-the-program, some nations, like Gambia, have shamelessly stooped to using Hurricane Sandy and the outcome of our presidential election as a prod.
On Tuesday, the representative from Gambia said: 
“We hope that the year with a monster storm . . . as well as the re-elected leadership will lead the U.S. to be more active and will no longer be a disinterested bystander in this process.”
To address this matter, CFACT’s Marc Morano recently appeared on Fox News’ Neil Cavuto show and said that using storms as a poster child for global warming is devoid of science.
Watch the complete interview below.

Stated Morano:
“We have gone the longest period since the Civil War without a major landfalling category 3 or larger hurricane to hit the United States. If anything, global warming would prevent — at least Atlantic hurricanes — from making landfall.”
These facts have not deterred the Green activists and negotiators in Doha, however. Over the next few days, I and my CFACT team will be arriving in Doha to hold the UN’s feet to the fire.
As we proved in Durban last year, when the UN scuttled plans for an International Climate Court after we broke the story, CFACT knows how to be effective at UN conferences.

Musk is splashing the cash trying to show the world that the Tesla S is better than the electric Porsche, so he has sent a Tesla S to Germany to try for the Nürburgring record. 



The nearest charging point is in the nearby town but it is not a “supercharger” so would take too long to recharge the car.



The simple solution for Musk was to install a supercharger at the circuit … powered by a hunking big diesel generator he brought with him in a container from the US.



Together with the Tesla a container from America arrived at the ring. Its content: a large diesel engine. This generates the power to charge the Model S. **Since it is noisy day and night, it has already attracted the annoyance of local residents.** However, Tesla has reacted and unceremoniously installed a Supercharger on the ring. However, he obviously first of all serves his own needs as he stands in the area of ??the rollercoaster behind a locked gate immediately next to the start and finish straight of the GP course. So not accessible to Tesla customers. 



  
Behind the ‘clean, green’ image there is always another story. Whether it is on the Nürburgring, the Ngauranga Gorge or the Northern Motorway, the dirty truth for virtue-signalling electric car drivers is that the energy has to come from somewhere. 



Currently, it appears a diesel generator is powering one Tesla at the Nürburgring track.

"The fires that caused 33 deaths, destroyed more than 3,000 homes, and burned more than 10m hectares of bushland were accurately predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology and in line with predictions Australia’s peak scientific body laid down 30 years ago. And according to evidence given in the first day of public hearings in the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements on Monday, fires of that scale will occur with greater frequency as the climate continues to heat.  “This isn’t a one-off event that we’re looking at here,” the Bureau of Meteorology’s head of climate monitoring, Dr Karl Braganza, told the hearing. “Really since the Canberra 2003 fires, every jurisdiction in Australia has seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.” Climate change was the focus of the hearing, despite prime minister Scott Morrison saying in February that the inquiry would focus on mitigation and adaptation, including to “changing climatic conditions” but would not consider the climate emergency. Braganza said both climate and weather forecasts were able to accurately predict the severity of a fire season, and that forecast was made available to fire agencies and governments in the middle of the year. Asked by the chief commissioner, retired Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, whether the forecasts in mid-2019 accurately predicted the conditions seen that summer, Braganza said yes. “Things really played out the way our forecast models, both in climate and weather, suggested they would,” he said. Dr Helen Cleugh, a senior principal research scientist with the CSIRO, said that the frequency of extreme El Niño, La Niña and Indian Ocean dipole events under global heating meant Australia would experience more extreme weather events in future, and that those events would not be able to be mitigated, or their severity predicted, by looking at what had occurred in the past. “Climate change means that the past is no longer a guide to future climate-related impacts and risks,” she said. Cleugh said modelling conducted by the CSIRO in 1992 was “very consistent” with the changes in climate that had occurred in the 28 years since. “The key point I want to make here is that these climate projections are credible and salient, and most importantly they are still current in 2020,” she said. Braganza said the bushfire season in New South Wales and parts of Victoria now began in August, three months earlier than in the 1950s. The fire season in Victoria has also extended one month further in autumn. Dr Ryan Crompton, a specialist in climate and natural hazards modelling and general manager of Risk Frontiers, told the hearing that better urban planning could play a role in mitigating property loss, even in a heating climate. He said that 38% of houses lost on the NSW south coast over summer were within one metre of bushland, and 80% were within 100m. Crompton said the 2019-20 summer was “comparable to the most damaging seasons” for property loss recorded since 1925. NSW lost 2.5 times more houses than in the next-worst fire season. Binskin and fellow commissioners, Dr Annabelle Bennett, a former federal court judge and chancellor of Bond University, and Prof Andrew Macintosh, an environmental law and policy expert from the Australian National University, will hear from 50 witnesses over the next two weeks. The inquiry has received more than 1,700 public submissions and 16,589 documents, totalling more than 200,000 pages. A further 159 notices to produce information or documents have not yet been answered, including from state and territory governments. Senior counsel assisting, Dominique Hogan-Doran SC, said the delay in producing documents “has influenced our choice and sequencing of topics for public hearing.” The inquiry is due to produce its final report and recommendations for managing the upcoming bushfire season by the end of August."
"While much of the world now recognises the need for immediate action, there are still those who question the scientific consensus on climate change and deter efforts to tackle it. As might be expected, they have the attention of US President Donald Trump and his Republican administration. The Heartland Institute’s International Conference on Climate Change was held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC on July 25 2019. The Heartland Institute considers itself one of “the world’s leading free market think-tanks”, which “promotes free market solutions to social and economic problems”. It’s perhaps best known for its climate scepticism.  Discussions at the annual event include disputing scientific observations on climate change, criticising “climate alarmists” and promoting fossil fuels. As the choice of venue might suggest, the arguments made here seem to overlap with what the president and the ruling Republican Party has previously said on climate change.  From my background studying criminal behaviour, I found something striking about the way Trump justifies inaction on climate change. Through his own words, the president’s arguments mimic patterns in criminal behaviour that criminologists call “techniques of neutralisation”. Criminologists contend that criminals use techniques of neutralisation to help deny or justify a crime they have committed. These five techniques were first defined in 1964 from the types of arguments given by young people in the criminal justice system when justifying their actions.  Denial of responsibility – it is not the offender’s fault. Denial of injury of harm – the crime does not cause significant harm or may have positive results. Denial of victim – there is no clear victim. Condemnation of the condemner – the offender criticises the criminal justice system to avoid criticism of the offender. Appeal to higher loyalties – deviant behaviour was in aid of a greater good or to benefit someone else. When we flip the context from petty criminals to powerful politicians and lobbyists, it’s not hard to see the same pattern emerging. Denial of responsibility – climate change is happening, but humans aren’t the cause. Denial of injury or harm – there’s no significant harm caused by human action and there may even be some benefits. Denial of victim – there’s no climate change and so no victims, but if such victims of climate change victims existed, they’d deserve to be victimised. Condemnation of the condemner – climate change research is misrepresented by scientists, and manipulated by the media, politicians and environmentalists. Appeal to higher loyalties – economic progress and development are more important than preventing climate change. This will help protect us from energy poverty and allow developing nations to prosper. How can a criminologist’s perspective help us understand how President Trump and climate deniers obscure the scientific consensus on climate change? I believe it helps us see their statements in a new light. Rather than being ill-informed interventions on the topic, Trump’s words reflect a deliberate attempt to shift blame, erase the plight of those already suffering from climate change and turn the fire on climate scientists who study the problem. In tweets, speeches, and in conversations with journalists, these patterns appear to play out. When denying responsibility for tackling the climate problem, external competitors like China make for a useful scapegoat. Trump’s comments on climate change often deflect blame, but they may just as often question if it’s happening at all. This ambivalence helps to undermine concerns that climate change will cause a great deal of harm to people in the US and worldwide. I believe that there’s a change in weather and I think it changes both ways …. There’s no credible possibility that climate change isn’t happening, but by engineering a false sense of uncertainty about the science, Trump can condemn those condemning him for inaction – the climate scientists themselves. Don’t forget, it used to be called global warming, that wasn’t working, then it was called climate change, now it’s actually called extreme weather because with extreme weather you can’t miss. The poorest are predicted to suffer the worst consequences of climate change in the US, but by withdrawing the world’s largest economy from the Paris Climate Accords, Trump argues he is standing up for these people by acting in their best interest. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers – who I love – and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. Given the grave consequences of the US doing nothing on climate change, should deflecting blame, sowing uncertainty and condemning experts on such a scale be labelled criminal? I believe that these perceived similarities – between how offenders justify their behaviour to the criminal justice system and how Trump justifies his position on climate change to the world – are no coincidence. We shouldn’t always read ignorance in what Trump says – it might suit him and climate deniers more than we think. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

I’ll bet the next AGW claim we’ll see will be “tropical storms last longer”.
This infrared image was created from AIRS data on Sept. 28 at 0441 UTC (12:41 a.m. EDT) when Nadine was a strengthening tropical storm.

NASA Sees Stubborn Nadine Intensify into a Hurricane Again

Infrared data from NASA’s Aqua satellite today, Sept. 28, revealed strong convection and thunderstorms have built up again in Tropical Storm Nadine as it moved over warm waters in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. That convection strengthened Nadine back into a hurricane today. Nadine has lasted over two weeks, but is nowhere near breaking the record for longest-lived tropical cyclone.

NASA’s Aqua satellite passed over long-lived Nadine on Sept. 28 at 0441 UTC (12:41 a.m. EDT) when it was still a tropical storm and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument captured an infrared image of the storm. A large area of strong thunderstorms developed around the center of circulation with very cold cloud top temperatures colder than -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius).
On Sept. 27, when NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite passed overhead, convection was limited, and rainfall was light around the storm. The TRMM rainfall image showed Nadine had light rainfall surrounding most of the center of circulation. The heaviest intensity of about 20 mm/hour (~0.8 inches) appeared to be located just northeast of the center. That has changed 24 hours later as thunderstorms have re-developed and heavier rainfall appeared in a larger area of the storm.
At 11 a.m. on Sept. 28 Hurricane Nadine’s maximum sustained winds had climbed back up to hurricane strength and were near 75 mph (120 kmh). Twenty-four hours before, Nadine’s maximum sustained winds near 60 mph (95 kmh). Nadine is currently located near latitude 29.6 north and longitude 34.7 west, about 730 miles (1,175 km) southwest of the Azores Islands. Nadine is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 kmh) and is expected to turn north-northwest over the next day.
Hurricane Nadine marked its seventeenth day of life today, Sept. 28, and is expected to continue lingering through the weekend of Sept. 29 and 30.
Nadine has a long way to go before breaking the record for longest life of a tropical cyclone. According to NOAA, in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Ginger lasted 28 days in 1971. The Pacific Ocean holds the record, though as Hurricane/Typhoon John lasted 31 days. John was “born” in the Eastern North Pacific, crossed the International Dateline and moved through the Western North Pacific over 31 days during August and September 1994. Nadine, however, is in the top 50 longest-lasting tropical cyclones in either ocean basin.

You’ve seen those photographs from space of the Earth at night with cities lit up like Christmas trees. Imagine that scene with a hurricane added.

NASA/NOAA’s Suomi NPP Captures Night-time View of Sandy’s Landfall
As Hurricane Sandy made a historic landfall on the New Jersey coast during the night of Oct. 29, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on NASA/NOAA’s Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite captured this night-time view of the storm. This image provided by University of Wisconsin-Madison is a composite of several satellite passes over North America taken 16 to18 hours before Sandy’s landfall.
The storm was captured by a special “day-night band,” which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as auroras, airglow, gas flares, city lights, fires and reflected moonlight. City lights in the south and mid-section of the United States are visible in the image.
William Straka, associate researcher at Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, explains that since there was a full moon there was the maximum illumination of the clouds.
“You can see that Sandy is pulling energy both from Canada as well as off in the eastern part of the Atlantic,” Straka said. “Typically forecasters use only the infrared bands at night to look at the structure of the storm. However, using images from the new day/night band sensor in addition to the thermal channels can provide a more complete and unique view of hurricanes at night.”
VIIRS is one of five instruments onboard Suomi NPP. The mission is the result of a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Department of Defense.
On Monday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. EDT, Hurricane Sandy made landfall 5 miles (10 km) south of Atlantic City, N.J., near 39 degrees 24 minutes north latitude and 74 degrees 30 minutes west longitude. At the time of landfall, Sandy’s maximum sustained winds were near 80 mph (130 kph) and it was moving to the west-northwest at 23 mph (37 kph). According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds extended outward to 175 miles (280 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended 485 miles (780 km). Sandy’s minimum central pressure at the time of landfall was 946 millibars or 27.93 inches.
Suomi NPP was launched on Oct. 28, 2011, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. One year later, Suomi NPP has orbited Earth more than 5,000 times and begun returning images and data that provide critical weather and climate measurements of complex Earth systems.
Suomi NPP observes Earth’s surface twice every 24-hour day, once in daylight and once at night. NPP flies 512 miles (824 kilometers) above the surface in a polar orbit, circling the planet about 14 times a day. NPP sends its data once an orbit to the ground station in Svalbard, Norway, and continuously to local direct broadcast users.

"Marissa Alexander no longer wears an ankle monitor. She is now free to go to the park and play basketball with her children in her Jacksonville, Fla. neighborhood. She can ride a bicycle and stroll on the beach, which she dreamed about in prison. “I didn’t carry an umbrella when I first got home,” she said, “because I wanted to feel the rain drops on my skin. ” Ms. Alexander, 36, spent almost a   years either locked in prison or confined to her house after she was convicted of aggravated assault charges in 2012 for firing a warning shot at her husband, who she said had abused her. According to her account in court documents, he had threatened her nine days after she gave birth to their daughter. Ms. Alexander was finally freed on Jan. 27. She plans to take up the fight for domestic abuse victims and push for a change in what advocates have called the uneven application of Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. She will advocate amending the law in order to take the burden of proof off defendants who have to demonstrate in pretrial hearings that they acted in   and deserve immunity from trial. In Florida, the law allows for the use of deadly force in   with no duty to retreat when a violent intruder breaks into a home or car. That shield was denied her in 2011, when a judge in a pretrial hearing rejected her attempt to use the law, saying she did not meet the burden of proof because there was a “factual dispute” on her Stand Your Ground defense. That led to her trial and ultimate conviction, said Faith E. Gay, one of Ms. Alexander’s lawyers. “Here is a black woman who had a history of abuse against her and tried to use Stand Your Ground and ended up with a   sentence,” Bruce Zimet, one Ms. Alexander’s lawyers, said in a telephone interview. Ms. Alexander said of how she believed the court viewed her defense, “It was a crime from the jump,” adding, the Stand Your Ground law “was never considered. ” On Thursday, she plans to speak before a Florida Senate committee meeting in support of that proposed amendment to the law. If enacted, it would shift the burden of proof from defendants to prosecutors. State Senator Rob Bradley, a sponsor of the bill, said, “I think it is important that anybody who feels that the criminal system has affected them shares their stories. ” In the years since the shooting, Ms. Alexander has become the face of efforts to challenge laws, like the state’s   rules, that can have an impact on   cases. The events that sent Ms. Alexander down a path to prison began in August 2010. She and her husband began arguing, according to court records, and Ms. Alexander said she fired at him in  . But prosecutors noted that the bullet went into the wall behind her husband rather than into the ceiling, and they asserted that she had fired “out of anger,” Mr. Zimet, her lawyer, said. Ms. Alexander was convicted and, because of the sentencing laws, initially received 20 years in prison, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Her husband at the time, Rico Gray Sr. acknowledged in a hearing that there had been previous instances of violence, and the trial judge allowed the testimony to be introduced as evidence, court documents and Ms. Gay said. Mr. Gray could not be reached for comment. But the lawyer who represented him, Richard R. Kuritz, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that Mr. Gray cooperated with prosecutors because he wanted the case resolved so as not to put his children through the process. “People have lost sight of the fact that he was standing with his son when she came back into the house with the gun,’’ Mr. Kuritz said. “He was unarmed and she shot at him. ” In 2013, Ms. Alexander’s conviction was overturned on appeal. As she was awaiting a new trial, she negotiated a plea agreement that allowed her to serve three years in prison and two years confined to her house. Some have compared her case to another, more prominent, one in Florida: that of George Zimmerman, who was tried and cleared in 2012 in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. Although the Stand Your Ground law was not a factor in Mr. Zimmerman’s defense  —   his lawyers argued he shot in    —   it was part of the jury’s instructions and played a role in the way the police approached the initial investigation. Protesters have demanded changes to the law, which some prosecutors and police officers say is vague and has been misused by people to avoid prosecution. “It was highly controversial because it encourages vigilantism, but it seems to have not been applied evenly,” Ms. Gay said. Florida was the first state to pass a Stand Your Ground law, in 2005, with strong support from the National Rifle Association. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 23 other states have such laws. In Louisiana, the authorities invoked the state’s own version of the laws to defend the pace of their investigation into the shooting death of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight and their treatment of the suspect, Ronald Gasser Jr. who was freed initially. The sheriff said officials needed time to build a better case. Eventually, Mr. Gasser was indicted on a   murder charge last week. The Miami Herald also reported that last month defense lawyers invoked the state law to try to have charges dismissed against a Louisiana man accused of shooting three people outside a Key West strip club in 2016. Ms. Alexander’s case also became part of the debate over the state’s mandatory sentencing laws, which require 10 years, 20 years or life in prison in cases involving someone firing warning shots and the possession or use of a firearm. Some have argued that the guidelines take discretion out of judges’ hands. “It is pure ” Ms. Gay said. Florida lawmakers eventually removed the charge of aggravated assault  —   the same charge Ms. Alexander was given. Ms. Alexander served her sentence in Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocala, Fla. Her time in prison took her away from her job at a payroll processing company, as well as from her three children. Now, she is doing consulting work for an elementary school and has established a nonprofit called the Marissa Alexander Justice Project, which will provide advocacy in cases of domestic violence, as well as promote policy reform. Free Marissa Now, an alliance of activists that had campaigned for Ms. Alexander’s release, said in a statement  that there were many more such cases, and it linked to those compiled by Survived and Punished advocates that involve abused women caught up in the system after being charged, or in prison or immigration detention. Ms. Alexander said: “I have had another opportunity, a second chance, and I believe everybody deserves that. So I am going to live my best life going forward. ”"

Vancouver was once the mecca for foreign money, which resulted in skyrocketing home prices, a bit like Auckland was until the foreign buyer ban. However, the worm has turned and now real estate developers are panicking as homes go unsold. Sounds like Kiwibuild, except the developers here had Phil and, now, Megan standing by with chequebook in hand to buy the unsold properties.



So here is a novel way for Megan to move the properties on and keep Genter happy at the same time.



“For every home you purchase we’re going to include a free Tesla,” said Celia Chiu, sales manager for Viridian Homes. 



Developer Century Group is offering a Model 3 Tesla base model with each of the remaining 10 homes in its [Viridian](https://viridianhomes.ca/) development overlooking the Nicomekl River.



The Teslas being offered are valued at CA$55,000. The promotion will be available starting Saturday, and it will continue until Oct. 31 or until the final 10 units in the development are sold. 



Chiu said the remaining homes have been on the market for the last year, but the entire community has “been around for two years and with a market having kind of a subtle stall, we wanted to take it to the next level.”



The townhouse project contains 57 total units, each one featuring more than 2,000 square feet of living space and a pricetag starting at just over CA$1 million. […]



“An incentive like this does have to have a wow factor,” Chiu added.



Each of the remaining units comes equipped with an electric vehicle charging station, something Century Group president Sean Hodgins said in a release reflects the project’s “innovative design with energy-efficient capabilities.”[…]



Go on, Megan – we taxpayers would be overjoyed to fund this as well as the Kiwifail houses.

His paper warns that the earth may see little ice age conditions by 2030. No wonder the climate establishment mobilized to shut down the PRP special edition! The peer-review uproar is nothing but a diversion.
The paper, titled Planetary beat and solar-terrestrial responses, looks at the sun’s well-documented cyclical behavior and the mechanisms that could be driving solar cycles, which have a proven impact on the Earth’s climate. The paper’s abstract concludes:
The centennial changes between grand solar maxima and minima imply that we will soon be in a new solar minimum and, in analogy with past events, probably also in Little Ice Age climatic conditions.”
In the paper, Mörner also adds:
At around 2030–2050, we will be in a new grand minimum situation (as evidenced by a large number of authors: e.g. Mörner, 2010, 2011; Cionco and Compagnucci, 2012; Casey and Humlum, 2013; Salvador, 2013). The driving forces seem to be the planetary beat and its effects on the solar activity, and the effects of the solar wind upon the Earth (Fig. 6). During previous solar minima, the Earth experienced Little Ice Age climatic conditions. Therefore, we may once again experience such climatic conditions when the new grand minimum occurs.”
In the paper’s conclusion he reiterates the warning:
At the next solar minimum, to occur around 2030–2050, there might be a return to Little Ice Age climatic conditions (as was the case during the Dalton, Maunder and Spörer minima).”
Mörner’s paper looks at the sun’s impacts on the Earth’s climate through solar cycles, whose history has been reconstructed for the entire Holocene through the analysis of 10Be and 14C isotopes. The impacts of solar cycles on the Earth’s climate is very well documented. It is undeniable.
For example there’s a strong link between solar activity and European winters, see here. Also NoTricksZone recently listed over 120 recent papers showing that solar activity have a clear impact on the earth’s climate. The body of scientific literature out there is massive.
So what causes the sun to undergo cyclic changes? In his paper Mörner asks what could be driving the cyclic changes in the sun, and theorizes that it is the planetary motion and the gravitational forces exerted through the planets on the sun’s dynamic mass. The idea is not new, and there is a growing body of scientific literature that evidences it.
Mörner’s paper writes:

Solar activity changes with time in a cyclic pattern. The origin of those changes may be caused by planetary motion around the Sun, affecting the position of the Sun’s motion with respect to the centre of mass and subjecting the Sun to changes in angular momentum and gravitational tidal forces. […]
Abreu et al. (2012; cf. Steinhilber et al., 2007) were able to show that there is an “excellent spectral agreement between the planetary tidal effects acting on the tachocline and the solar magnetic activity”. This is illustrated in Fig. 3. It implies a benchmark in the planetary–solar research. The planetary hypothesis took an important step towards a planetary theory.”

This is plausible because something connected to the sun has to be causing the sun’s cyclic activity. And what more obvious explanation could there be than the 8 planets (plus Pluto) orbiting around the sun? All planets exert a gravitational force on the sun that is hardly negligible. Mörner writes:
The multi-body interaction of the planetary motions on the Sun’s motion is so large that the Sun’s motion around the centre of mass is perturbed by up to about 1 solar radius. The planetary beat also includes the transfer of angular momentum and tidal forces.”
This all has an impact on the sun’s interior and hence its cycles.
Mörner is not alone in claiming we are headed for a low-solar-activity induced cooling. He joins a growing number of scientists who warn the earth should prepare for cooling, and not warming.
Nils-Axel Mörner completed his Ph.D at Stockholm University in Sweden with postdoctoral studies at Western University in London, Canada. He was the head of Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics at Stockholm University. He was an IPCC author and has published more than 500 papers in reputed journals and several books. He has presented some 550 papers at international conferences. He is a world expert on sea level changes.

So much for Endurance…

From Louise Gray at The Telegraph:
Wind turbine collapses in high wind
A controversial 115ft wind turbine has collapsed after being hit by heavy winds.

The £250,000 tower, which stood as tall as a ten storey building, was hit by gale force gusts of 50mph.


The structure then collapsed at a farm in Bradworth, Devon, leaving a “mangled wreck”.


Margaret Coles, Chairwoman of Bradworthy District Council, said hail storms and strong winds have hit the area and the turbine, installed just three years ago, simply could not withstand the wind.  


“The bolts on the base could not withstand the wind and as we are a very windy part of the country they [the energy company] have egg on their face,” she said. “There are concerns about safety.”
The Bradworthy Parish Council, who opposed the turbine, expressed concern that there was “nothing exceptional” in the speed of the winds.
Installed by renewable energy company Dulas it was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years.
Full story here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/9837026/Wind-turbine-collapses-in-high-wind.html
==============================================================
Of course, Ms. Gray calls a 50 mph wind a “high wind”, but that sort of wind isn’t an unusual event for the area. Besides, the specs for the Endurance E-3120 wind turbine say:

Given its, ahem, endurance, one wonders if the council will allow it to be reconstructed. I’m thinking no.

NOTE: see video below, where you can watch the entire 2012 hurricane season on satellite time-lapse, way cool. – Anthony

Busy 2012 hurricane season continues decades-long high activity era in the Atlantic
Four U.S. land-falling storms include devastating Sandy and Isaac
November 30 marks the end of the 2012 Atlantic Hurricane season, one that produced 19 named storms, of which 10 became hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The number of named storms is well above the average of 12. The number of hurricanes is also above the average of six, but the number of major hurricanes is below the average of three.
Based on the combined number, intensity, and duration of all tropical storms and hurricanes, NOAA classifies the season as above-normal. 2012 was an active year, but not exceptionally so as there were 10 busier years in the last three decades.

This season marks the second consecutive year that the mid-Atlantic and Northeast suffered devastating impacts from a named storm. Sandy, and Irene last year, caused fatalities, injuries, and tremendous destruction from coastal storm surge, heavy rainfall, inland flooding, and wind. Storms struck many parts of the country this year, including tropical storms Beryl and Debby in Florida, Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana, and post-tropical Cyclone Sandy in New Jersey.
“This year proved that it’s wrong to think that only major hurricanes can ruin lives and impact local economies,” said Laura Furgione, acting director of NOAA’s National Weather Service. “We are hopeful that after the 2012 hurricane season, more families and businesses all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts become more “weather ready” by understanding the risks associated with living near the coastline. Each storm carries a unique set of threats that can be deadly and destructive. Mother Nature reminded us again this year of how important it is to be prepared and vigilant.”
An interesting aspect of the season was its early start, with two tropical storms, Alberto and Beryl, developing in May before the season officially began. Also, this is the seventh consecutive year that no major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5) have hit the United States. The only major hurricane this season was Hurricane Michael, a Category 3 storm that stayed over the open Atlantic.
Several storms this year were short in duration, weak in intensity, and went largely unnoticed by the general public because they stayed out over the Atlantic. A persistent jet stream pattern over the eastern portion of the nation helped steer many of this season’s storms away from the United States. The number of named storms and hurricanes was higher than predicted in NOAA’s pre-season outlook, in large part because El Niño – which likely would have suppressed overall storm activity – never materialized as predicted by many climate models.
Hurricane forecasters remind us that a well-established climate pattern puts us in an ongoing era of high activity for Atlantic hurricanes that began in 1995. Since that time, more than 70 percent of seasons have been above normal, including 2012. Historically, Atlantic high-activity eras have lasted 25 to 40 years, with the previous one occurring from the mid-1930s until 1970. Several inter-related atmospheric and oceanic factors contribute to these high activity years, including warmer Atlantic Ocean temperatures, an enhanced West African monsoon, and reduced vertical wind shear.
NOAA will release its pre-season outlook for the 2013 hurricane season in May.

Could the U.S.-Japan alliance founder as a result of alcohol? Apparently. At least, that’s the implication of the U.S. Navy’s ban on drinking by personnel stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa.



It would be far better to phase out America’s military presence on Okinawa, turning U.S. bases back to the Japanese government. More than seven decades after the end of World War II, Japan’s defense should be the responsibility of Tokyo, not Washington.



The independent Ryukyu Islands were conquered by Imperial Japan in the late 19th century. Residents were never considered fully Japanese by the rest of the country, but they suffered disproportionately when the allies invaded the island of Okinawa in April 1945. Nearly 100,000 civilians died in the bitter three‐​month battle. Afterward the U.S. government loaded Okinawa with bases, returning the island to Japan only in 1972.



America retained its facilities, however. Despite Japan’s dramatic recovery, the U.S. remained responsible for that country’s defense. In return, Japan’s duty only was to be defended by America. At the time the status quo satisfied most everyone, including Tokyo’s neighbors. Marine Corps Gen. Henry Stackpole famously explained that U.S. troops were the “cap in the bottle” to stop Japanese remilitarization. Decades later this arrangement has lost its raison d’etre.



Washington currently maintains 85 military bases and some 53,000 troops in Japan (plus 43,000 dependents and 5,000 civilian workers). Roughly 40 percent of those facilities, half the people, and three‐​quarters of the base area are located on Okinawa, with just .6 percent of Japan’s land mass, in the southernmost and poorest prefecture. About a fifth of the island is under U.S. control: Homes abut runways, prime beaches are off‐​limits to Okinawans, and island life is dramatically inconvenienced.



Nevertheless, there is little political will for change. U.S. officials desire that America remain the region’s “essential power,” despite Japan’s ability to take over its own defense, and retain advanced bases in the Asia‐​Pacific. Tokyo wants to rely on America’s security guarantee, despite Japan’s great military potential, while incurring the least political inconvenience from hosting U.S. forces. Both governments benefit from ignoring Okinawa’s complaints and filling the island with American military facilities and largely young, male service personnel.



What could possibly go wrong?





More than seven decades after the end of World War II, Japan’s defense should be the responsibility of Tokyo, not Washington.



Local anger exploded in 1995 after three American service members raped a 12‐​year‐​old girl, followed by insensitive comments from military brass. Protests raged and the Japanese government sought to placate islanders with financial transfers and plans to move Futenma airbase and relocate U.S. Marines to Guam. These schemes failed to satisfy, however. In 2009 the Democratic Party of Japan took power with proposals for a more independent, Asia‐​centric foreign policy and promises to address Okinawans’ concerns. However, the ineffectual DPJ government failed to achieve its objectives. Far from helping, the Obama administration actively thwarted Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama’s efforts to address Okinawans’ plight.



His successors cared less about achieving justice for their countrymen and more about expanding support from U.S. officials. Fear of North Korea, which continued to develop nuclear weapons and missiles, and China, which adopted increasingly confrontational tactics to advance its territorial claims in surrounding waters, encouraged a tighter Japanese embrace of Washington. Taking a more independent approach to its defense was not considered.



But base opponents, bolstered by the 2014 gubernatorial victory of Takeshi Onaga, continued to resist. Declared Onaga: “The new military base will not be built.” Although the national government pushed ahead, the new governor attempted to revoke the necessary building permits. In elections last weekend his allies took firm control of the Prefectural Assembly, bolstering his efforts to delay construction of new facilities.



Fueling popular anger has been a seeming spate of high‐​profile offenses committed by U.S. military personnel (who, in fact, have a lower crime rate than locals). Last month a sailor pled guilty to rape. Also last month a contractor and former Marine was detained in a murder case. The latter prompted the military to set a curfew and prohibit drinking off‐​base.



Then last weekend an apparently intoxicated sailor crashed, injuring two Okinawans. The navy confined all personnel to base except for essential travel and banned drinking on or off U.S. facilities. Explained Rear Adm. Matthew Carter: “For decades, we have enjoyed a strong relationship with the people of Japan. It is imperative that each sailor understand how our actions affect that relationship, and the U.S.–Japan alliance as a whole.”



Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely ignored the Okinawa question as he sought to bolster Tokyo’s military capabilities. He pushed to revise the so‐​called “peace constitution,” Article 9 of which technically forbids Tokyo from maintaining any military; update the so‐​called Self‐​Defense Force’s 1997 “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Cooperation,” which barred the SDF aiding U.S. forces even if the latter were coming to Japan’s aid; and increase military outlays, which never got much above one percent of GDP. The U.S. has applauded his efforts, but progress has been minimal.



Observed Emma Chanlett‐​Avery and Ian Rinehart of the Congressional Research Service, “constitutional, legal, fiscal, and political barriers exist to significantly expanded defense cooperation. Many of Abe’s initiatives have faced opposition from the public and from political parties.” Less than a quarter of Japanese said they wanted their government to do more militarily. Last year large demonstrations targeted even modest legislative measures which would have received barely a second glance in the U.S.



Although Chanlett‐​Avery and Rinehart spoke of Abe’s efforts resulting in “momentum [which] has created new energy in the alliance,” that is true only measured against decades of Tokyo doing little at home and nothing abroad. First, the constitution remains unchanged, so Abe has adopted the U.S. tactic of elastic construction: like his predecessors he simply interpreted the nation’s fundamental law as he wished it had been written.



Military outlays have risen only modestly since Abe took power in 2012. They went up just two percent in 2015, when Japan devoted about $41 billion to defense (actually down in dollars due to a falling yen). Although expenditures have been enough for Japan to assemble a capable military, the amount falls far short of the roughly $180 billion China, Tokyo’s main potential nemesis, spends annually. Indeed, between 2004 and 2013 Chinese defense spending rose 270 percent—compared to _falling_ five percent in Japan.



Moreover, Japan’s expenditures remains an anemic one percent of GDP, compared to around three percent for Beijing and about 3.5 percent for the U.S., which Japan expects to make up its deficiencies. Critics may see Abe as a dangerous nationalist, but his government’s military budget doesn’t reflect such ambitions.



Last year Tokyo adjusted the defense guidelines so that its forces could join collective security operations and assist the U.S. when the latter aided Japan. But the changes were marginal. Tokyo’s previous participation in international non‐​combat activities had been quite limited. In Iraq, for instance, Japanese personnel were forbidden to defend themselves; other nations’ soldiers had to act as de facto bodyguards.



Thus, it won’t be hard for Tokyo to do more in the future. In speaking to the U.S. Congress last year Abe cited his nation’s “proactive contribution to peace based on the principle of international cooperation.” Japan, he said, would confront “terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters and climate change.” However worthy such endeavors, they are largely irrelevant to the U.S.-Japan alliance. Even the “security” activities cited by the guidelines remain resolutely non‐​combat: cyber warfare, logistics, mine‐​sweeping, reconnaissance. Thus, Tokyo’s new role will do little to reduce America’s military duties.



Moreover, the revised standards merely allow Japan to better defend Japan, not assist the U.S. For instance, the guidelines highlight “emerging threats to Japan’s peace and security” and “an armed attack against Japan.” American interests are an afterthought, subsumed in a short section on “cooperation for regional and global peace and security.”



Most Americans probably never realized that until last year—under a supposedly bilateral military alliance—a Japanese ship on patrol with an American vessel could not assist if the latter was attacked. Now the Japanese vessel can act, _but only if it too is threatened_. And Japanese analysts warn against expecting Tokyo to allow such situations to occur. Explained Japanese scholar Jun Okumura, “We will wait a long time before a destroyer is conveniently nearby when the Chinese [navy] attacks the U.S. 7th Fleet.” Some alliance.



Of course, Prime Minister Abe told the Congress that he wanted to “make the cooperation between the U.S. military and Japan’s Self‐​Defense forces even stronger, and the alliance still more solid.” By that he meant tying Washington even more tightly to Japan’s interests, including territorial disputes with China. The U.S. remains responsible for Japan’s defense including, as before, all the heavy lifting—meaning anything really dangerous and expensive.



In fact, the new guidelines appear to envision an even stronger U.S. guarantee for Tokyo. Said President Barack Obama: “I want to reiterate that our treaty commitment to Japan’s security is absolute, and that Article 5 covers all territories under Japan’s administration, including Senkakus Islands.” Which means, in theory, that the U.S. is prepared to risk Los Angeles to safeguard Japan’s disputed title to a few worthless, unpopulated pieces of rock.



There’s more. The Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee reported that officials from both governments “confirmed the strategic importance of deploying the most modern and advanced U.S. capabilities to Japan”; “welcomed the deployment” of American aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ships; and “stressed the importance of sustained cooperation in enhancing Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities” with additional U.S. weapons deployments. Under the “bilateral” treaty Washington’s obligations apparently only increase.



How can this be to America’s benefit? The U.S. has an obvious interest in Japan’s continued independence, but Japan’s interest in its own security is even greater. If Tokyo believes it faces serious threats, it should do more, much more to defend itself.



In fact, no one expects a Chinese armada to show up in Tokyo Bay. Nor the Chinese navy to interdict Japanese commerce. If conflict erupts, it likely will be over disputed Senkaku/​Diaoyu Islands. Only Tokyo can decide how much it is prepared to spend and risk defending its claims. But nothing at stake is worth war, at least for America.



Of course, Beijing is not justified in using force there or elsewhere. But the Abe government refuses to even acknowledge an issue, despite legitimate Chinese territorial claims. A seeming blank check from the world’s superpower apparently has discouraged Tokyo from considering negotiation and compromise.



A serious Japanese military build‐​up is opposed by some of its neighbors, especially those needlessly antagonized by Tokyo over the years. But other countries, most notably the Philippines, now welcome a larger Japanese role in the region. In any case, no one seriously suggests that Japan is about to embark upon a new round of imperial conquests, especially against nuclear‐​armed China. More than seven decades after World War II Japan should finally act like a normal country—defending itself, guarding its region, and ending its dependence on America for its security.



The U.S. should turn its security guarantee to Japan into a framework for future cooperation. That should include potential assistance if a genuine hegemonic threat arises in Asia. But Beijing does not pose such a danger today and hopefully never will. In the meantime Tokyo should take the lead in confronting day‐​to‐​day security challenges in its region.



Which means the U.S. should leave Japan to decide on its own defense and foreign policies, without hectoring or pressure. No doubt the debate in Tokyo would be sharp. Some Japanese are pressing their government to do more because they worry about foreign threats and recognize that the U.S. might back down from a confrontation with China. Other Japanese dismiss such fears and uphold the country’s post‐​war pacifist heritage. The decision is up to Japan.



As American forces returned home Okinawa’s bases would empty. What came next—use by the SDF, turnover to the Okinawa government, return to private owners—would be up to the Japanese, especially those living on the island. The latter above all deserve to enjoy the peace that the bases long were supposed to help guarantee. And American military personnel could continue to enjoy a drink … back home in their own country.

"**People living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas if the visitors test negative for Covid-19, the government has said.**
More than a million coronavirus tests will be sent to care homes over the next month to allow safe indoor visits.
Visits will be allowed across all tiers of coronavirus restrictions.
The health secretary said the move was possible due to ""unprecedented strides"" in testing technology and capacity.
Matt Hancock said: ""The separation has been painful, but has protected residents and staff from this deadly virus.
""I'm so pleased we are now able to help reunite families and more safely allow people to have meaningful contact with their loved ones by Christmas.""
Strict restrictions have been placed on visits to care homes during the last eight months because of the pandemic.
In new guidance, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says the ""default position"" is now that visits should be enabled to go ahead in all tiers - unless there is an outbreak in the care home.
It adds that hand holding and hugging may be possible if other infection control measures are followed.
It stresses the importance of visitors minimising contact as much as possible and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to help protect their loved ones.
Care homes will manage the number of visits that take place, which must be arranged in advance, with visitors urged to be mindful of the additional workload for the care home.
Each care home is responsible for setting the visiting policy in that home, it says.
This will be welcome news for families in England who have waited a long time to be given the chance to visit loved ones and friends inside care homes, rather than trying to communicate through windows or on video calls.
But therein lies the problem.
The danger is that expectations will be raised of visits before Christmas which cannot all be fulfilled.
The biggest care home operators have been sent rapid testing kits but the smaller providers have not yet heard details about how they can obtain them.
One told me that, while welcoming the initiative, he was concerned at the level of administration which would be required to book in visits and organise the testing and this might mean taking on more staff.
Some doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the rapid testing technology with a relatively high number of false negatives if administered by less-trained staff.
The scheme will not be fully rolled out by Christmas but officials hope it will be more accessible to the wider public early in the new year.
More than a million quick-turnaround or ""lateral flow"" tests, which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab, are being sent out to England's 385 biggest care homes as part of the first phase of the rollout.
The guidance says the number of test kits will allow up to two visitors per resident, based on them visiting twice a week, by Christmas.
As well as the tests, an extra 46 million items of PPE will be sent to Care Quality Commission (CQC)-registered care home providers.
The Alzheimer's Society urged the government to ensure care homes do not struggle with extra administrative costs so that visits can continue.
The National Care Forum, a member association for not-for-profit social care providers, applauded the announcement, calling it a ""game-changing moment for visits"".
But executive director Vic Rayner said recognition of what the sector needs to put the policy into practice ""remains an inherent weakness"".
She added: ""It is essential that the government addresses this immediately, or else risks setting in train huge expectations around visiting, with no meaningful ability for care homes to deliver at the scale and pace required to make visiting a reality for all by Christmas.""
And Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said it was good news that the government has ""significantly shifted"" its position on care home visiting.
But she cautioned: ""The government has promised that everyone will be able to visit their loved one by Christmas and, while this is a laudable aim, it is also very ambitious, so we remain worried that practical difficulties of various kinds could get in the way for some.""
Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England - the largest representative body for independent care providers - said: ""In order for these promising plans to land successfully, the sector must now be adequately supported by the government.
""We appreciate the continued risks associated with visits, but this represents a positive step forwards.""
Separately, the government has published new guidance that may allow for some residents under the age of 65 to spend time with their families at Christmas outside of care homes \- if their provider agrees and carries out risk assessments."
"Donna Hubbard, a flight attendant who lives outside Atlanta, has no problem speaking forcefully about the issue of human trafficking in the United States. But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life  —   how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. “For many years, I couldn’t talk about being an addict,” she said. “I couldn’t talk about being imprisoned. I couldn’t talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. ” She paused to fight back tears. “I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. ” But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. “We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the   personnel,” Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year  —   the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a   partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris’s chief executive. “We don’t necessarily want to give the impression that just because we’re learning about more cases, the crime is increasing,” Mr. Myles said. “It’s actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. ” Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being “bought and sold, traded and bartered. ” “Usually, the traffickers play on people’s ignorance and naïveté,” she said. “Traffickers exploit people who are vulnerable. ” That is part of the lesson she imparts to airline personnel, along with practical advice on how to spot people who may be traveling against their will  —   often young passengers who look disoriented, refuse to make eye contact or act oddly subservient to a traveling companion. American Airlines, Ms. Rivard’s former employer, offers free miles to the volunteers of Airline Ambassadors International. American’s employees already undergo training on human trafficking, led by the Department of Homeland Security, according to a company representative. Ms. Rivard said airlines’ existing programs are not enough. She cited instances in which she said airline staff failed to take signs of trafficking seriously, and added that she wished more resources were available to her organization. “It doesn’t cost much. We try to raise about $3, 000 per training” from individual donors, she said. An Airline Ambassadors International training session in late January in Houston, just before the Super Bowl there, was filled to capacity. “It was an amazing event,” Ms. Hubbard said. “I give kudos to the city of Houston and to the agencies that are doing the work on the ground. ” Though human trafficking gets more attention during major sporting events like the Super Bowl, there is little hard evidence  —   from Polaris or elsewhere  —   to suggest a major spike in trafficking during large events. “We don’t think it’s useful to somehow give the impression that there are new victims and new types of trafficking that only happen around that time,” Mr. Myles said, though he added that major events might lure criminals who were already operating in other areas. The Houston Police Department has been revamping its approach to human trafficking for years, said Capt. Dan Harris, of the department’s vice division. It now offers training on human trafficking for officers as well as assistance for survivors. “We had the processes, the procedures and the relationships already in place,” Captain Harris said. “The only thing we really did for the Super Bowl was work more hours in order to go after, mainly, the johns. ” While law enforcement agencies and charities work to address the problem on the ground, Ms. Hubbard and other flight attendants plan to keep an eye on things in the air. “If someone is being held against their will, then a crime is being committed inside my airplane,” she said. “So it is my responsibility to make sure that these people  —   whose lives are in my hands while they’re on board my aircraft  —   are safe. ”"

Somewhere, weepy Bill McKibben is weeping and Al Gore is raging, because they won’t be able to say “2012, the hottest year ever, caused more tornadoes” So much for “dirty weather” Heh.
The NOAA Storm Prediction Center just updated their 2012 tornado count graph to the end of November. While the year is not over, the average number of 25 tornadoes expected in December (or lower if the below normal trend holds) would suggest that 2012 will end with well below normal tornado activity.

After a busy start, tornado events in the U.S. in 2012 have dropped well below the expected norm. The preliminary total of 886 tornadoes through 30 November 2012 is nearly 400 tornadoes below what might be expected in a “normal” year.


The chart above shows that at this time in 2011, the annual running total was about 400 tornadoes *above* normal; a mirror opposite of 2012.
The chart is meant to depict the dramatic variability that can occur in tornado numbers from one year to the next. On average about 25 tornadoes occur during the month of December based on data from the last 30 years. Click for full image or see the detailed written summary to date below.

"I am a scientist who researches climate hazards. This week I have published research on the potential for a catastrophic cyclone-heatwave combo in the global south. Yet over the past few days I have been approached by various media outlets to talk not about that hazard, but about the unfolding UK heatwave and climate change. It is always satisfying to respond to public interest around weather extremes, but there is a danger that key messages about extreme heat globally are not receiving enough airtime. It is by now very well established that hot extremes are more likely in the changed climate we are living in. Yet there is a seemingly unquenchable thirst for this story to be retold every time the UK sweats. Narratives around such acute, local events detract from critical messages about the global challenges from extreme heat. Make no mistake, maximum temperatures of 35°C or more are hot by UK standards, but such conditions are familiar to around 80% of the world’s population. The headline-grabbing 46°C recently experienced by Britain’s neighbours in France is indeed unusual, but still falls short of the 50°C recorded in India earlier this summer, and is somewhat temperate relative to the 54°C confirmed for both Pakistan (in 2017) and Kuwait (in 2016). People in these hotter climates are better at coping with high temperatures, yet such heat still kills. Deadly heatwaves are, of course, no stranger to Europeans. The infamous 2003 event claimed as many as 70,000 lives, and 2010 saw more than 50,000 fatalities in western Russia. Fortunately, lessons were learned and authorities are now much better prepared when heat-health alerts are issued. But spare a thought for less fortunate communities who are routinely experiencing extraordinary temperatures. In places like South Asia and the Persian Gulf, the human body, despite all its remarkable thermal efficiencies, is often operating close to its limits. And yes, there is a limit. When the air temperature exceeds 35°C, the body relies on the evaporation of water – mainly through sweating – to keep core temperature at a safe level. This system works until the “wetbulb” temperature reaches 35°C. The wetbulb temperature includes the cooling effect of water evaporating from the thermometer, and so is normally much lower than the normal (“drybulb”) temperature reported in weather forecasts. Once this wetbulb temperature threshold is crossed, the air is so full of water vapour that sweat no longer evaporates. Without the means to dissipate heat, our core temperature rises, irrespective of how much water we drink, how much shade we seek, or how much rest we take. Without respite, death follows – soonest for the very young, elderly or those with pre-existing medical conditions. Wetbulb temperatures of 35°C have not yet been widely reported, but there is some evidence that they are starting to occur in Southwest Asia. Climate change then offers the prospect that some of the most densely populated regions on Earth could pass this threshold by the end of the century, with the Persian Gulf, South Asia, and most recently the North China Plain on the front line. These regions are, together, home to billions of people. As the climate warms in places like the UK, people can take sensible precautions against heat – slowing down, drinking more water, and seeking cool refuges. Air conditioning is one of the last lines of defence but comes with its own problems such as very high energy demands. By 2050, cooling systems are expected to increase electricity demand by an amount equivalent to the present capacity of the US, EU, and Japan combined. Provided that electricity supplies can be maintained, living in chronically heat-stressed climates of the future may be viable. But with such dependence on this life-support system, a sustained power outage could be catastrophic.  So what would happen if we combined massive blackouts with extreme heat? Two colleagues and I recently investigated the possibility of such a “grey swan” event – foreseeable but not yet fully experienced – in a global study of storms and heat, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. We looked at tropical cyclones, which have already caused the biggest blackouts on Earth, with the months-long power failure in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria among the most serious. We found that as the climate warms it becomes ever more likely that these powerful cyclones would be followed by dangerous heat, and that such compound hazards would be expected every year if global warming reaches 4°C. During the emergency response to a tropical cyclone, keeping people cool would have to be as much a priority as providing clean drinking water. The UK is moving into new territory when it comes to managing extreme heat. But the places that are already heat stressed will see the largest absolute increases in humid-heat with the smallest safety margin before reaching physical limits, and they are often least-equipped to adapt to the hazard. It is therefore hardly surprising that extreme heat drives migration. Such mass displacement makes extreme heat a worldwide issue. Little Britain will feel the consequence of conditions far away from its temperate shores. The challenges ahead are stark. Adaptation has its limits. We must therefore maintain our global perspective on heat and pursue a global response, slashing greenhouse gas emissions to keep to the Paris warming limits. In this way, we have the greatest chance of averting deadly heat – home and abroad. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"Adele and Beyoncé, should you happen to read this, consider including the following name in your acceptance speeches on Grammy night: John Billings. He’s not an engineer, producer or video director. But he has had a hand in every Grammy  —   literally  —   for the past four decades. Known as “the Grammy man,” Mr. Billings, 70, is a master mold maker who has been designing, crafting and delivering the awards to the academy for more than half of his life. “I’ve been around them forever,” he said in a telephone interview. “Every year they become more and more special to me. I’ve always been a music fan, and the Grammys have always turned me on to so much I wouldn’t hear if I just sat and listened to a radio station. ” For this year’s ceremony, airing on Sunday night on CBS, 350 trophies were made. And yes, they were all created equal. “When we’re making Grammys, we don’t know whose Grammy that’s going to be, so we don’t have one favorite,” Mr. Billings said, adding: “They’re all just like children. I really never try to question why someone is getting an award I do sometimes question why someone is not. ” Before artists can hoist the   award onstage in front of their peers, a lot of work must be done, which starts when the nomination list comes in. Mr. Billings and his team review it and estimate the number of Grammys that need to be cast to cover the nominees receiving the awards. In his    Ridgway, Colo. studio, the whirring of a polishing wheel and tapping of a hammer provide the soundtrack for his team of three, who tinker five days a week,  . “We really don’t have an average day,” Mr. Billings said of the   process needed to complete each trophy. “The guys who work with me really know what they’re doing. We don’t look at the clock, we don’t rush these things. ” The awards are made of a custom metal alloy called grammium (yes, really) and are cast from three molds: one for the base, one for the gramophone cabinet and one for the tone arm, which holds the bell. After the pieces are cast, they go through a series of filing, sanding and polishing processes, and the gramophone cabinet and tone arm are plated in   gold. Once dry, the three pieces are assembled, and each award is   with a unique serial number for authenticity. The Grammys used during the television broadcast are for show Mr. Billings and his team engrave the names of winners onto plates after the event. Mr. Billings’s relationship with the award began when he was 12, upon seeing his friend’s father, Bob Graves, make the first one in his garage. In 1976 Mr. Billings became Mr. Graves’s apprentice he took over production in 1983 after his mentor’s death. “It means a great deal to us  —   John is part of the family,” said Bill Freimuth, the vice president for awards at the Recording Academy. “It’s that personal service it’s not dealing with some sort of an anonymous corporation. It’s dealing with a person who is   who deals with making these beautiful works of art many times over. ” Over time the trophy, like the Grammy Awards show itself, has evolved. Since the first ceremony, in 1959, five different designs have been created the last major   came in the early 1990s, when Mr. Billings said he spent a year sketching and a few months fashioning three prototypes from scrap metal in his studio. The goal was simple: to keep the gramophone and its Art Deco influences but rework the tone arm, which was prone to breaking because of its thinness. Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Billings said he remains content with his design. “I think it’s going to stay exactly where it is,” he said of the current Grammy. “I don’t see a reason to change it. It’s become very iconic. People recognize it and understand what it symbolizes. ” Once Mr. Billings and his team have made the finishing touches on each set of Grammys, it’s time to send them to Los Angeles  —   but not via FedEx or U. P. S. “I’ve always just   them,” he said. “I just think it would be a nightmare to try and ship these. In the old days, there weren’t so many Grammys, so I would put them in my truck and make several trips. ” These days, Mr. Billings attaches a cargo trailer to his truck for the     journey. When the last Grammy is packed away and the trailer is locked, the team takes a moment to pause. “We open a bottle of champagne and write a date on the bottle and how many Grammys were made for that year,” he said. “That caps it off  —   the Grammys are done, now they’re on their way. Then we start making them all over again. ”"

History — of the U.S., Europe, the U.K. and its former dominions — repeatedly shows that environmental protection is a luxury good. When per‐​capita income reaches some threshold, the citizenry tire of opaque air and sleazy waters, various agencies and permanent bureaucracies sprout, and, as long as times are good, regulation is good.



Our friends in the U.K. and Europe are especially green. Just hop off the plane in London and pick up the papers. Global warming is everywhere, and, for decades, the religion’s been that carbon dioxide reductions are fine, virtuous, and they’re going to make everyone rich. I have a social security system I would like to sell them.



This all splatters to a halt when economies go south. And the crash can be especially jarring if greenness is one of the causes. Thanks in no small part to the debacle in Europe, in a very few recent weeks, we have witnessed the great green crack‐​up.



Admittedly, the first glimmers showed up a couple of years ago in Spain, which suffered the malady of economic miasma brought on by environmental populism. The government — which our president cited as his environmental role model in his last presidential bid — sought to buy support with outrageous subsidies, in the form of power purchases, to anyone who put a solar panel on his roof in sunny Seville. The government spent much more than it took in, sold bonds it couldn’t back, and pretty soon your portfolio is going to pay the price.



(I’m not so bullish on the notion that the president is going to be touting Spain and solar power this time around).



The United Kingdom followed suit, but instead required that electric utilities pay the price, which is far more expensive than their coal (or gas) power. As occurred in Spain, people know a good handout when they see one and, just last month, there were over 15,000 new installations. Nevermind that the U.K. is one of the cloudiest nations on earth — we’re talking Prince Charles here.



At the same time, consumers got an extra bill to support wind farms that, because of the inconstancy of the wind, operate at 25% of their capacity (figure from the British Wind Energy Association) or 8% (according to E.on, a large operator of UK wind farms).



Guess what? Electricity prices have gone through the roof. The average U.K. household bill is a tad under $200 per month, and so the thermostat goes down. It’s pretty chilly there for much of the year, and a cold house has consequences. A study just came out today on the health costs of what they call “fuel poverty”, commissioned by the Energy and Climate Change Secretary (don’t we need one of those?), Chris Huhne. Bottom line: the chill from green taxes is now killing more Brits per year than car crashes.



London has suddenly awoken to the costs of indiscriminate greenness and is proposing to reduce the solar subsidies and — this is big — now threatens the multibillion dollar subsidies for its massive (and massively ugly) wind power scam.



That’s just the tip of the iceberg that the green Titanic has run into. Just this week:



This last one has an additional feedback: by dropping the price of permits, there’s little incentive to invest in wind and solar, from whom the permits can be bought.



And so, as history teaches us, when times are good, green is great, and when economies crash, green cracks up.

"Thousands of years ago, every lake was like Great Bear Lake. So pure you could lower a cup into the water and drink it. So beautiful that people composed love songs to it. So mysterious that many believed it was alive. Today, of the 10 largest lakes in the world, it is the last one that remains essentially primeval. Great Bear Lake straddles the Arctic Circle in the remote Northwest Territories of Canada. At just over 12, 000 square miles, the lake is the eighth largest in the world. It is bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior, and it is covered in ice and snow most of the year. The surrounding area is wilderness too  —   a sprawling land of untouched boreal forest and tundra, rivers and mountains. The only human settlement on its shores is the town of Deline, population 503. This isolated community is mostly Sahtuto’ine, meaning the Bear Lake People. They are as connected to the lake as the name implies, and for practical, cultural, historic and even prophetic reasons, they are determined to keep it pristine. Their efforts paid off in 2016. In March, the Great Bear Lake watershed was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. Called the Tsá Tué Biosphere Reserve, it is the largest in North America, and the first in the world to be led by an indigenous community. Several months later, the Canadian government granted Deline   ensuring local control in areas like language and education. It is the first time that an aboriginal government in Canada will represent everyone in the community, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. Taken together, the Unesco and   announcements reinforce Deline’s ability to control what happens to Great Bear Lake. David Livingstone, now retired after decades of working on environmental issues for the Canadian government in the far north, helped Deline apply for Unesco designation. To the Sahtuto’ine, Great Bear Lake is “not just a body of water it’s fundamental to their culture,” he said. “The folks in Deline consider the lake to be a living thing. ” Great Bear Lake is important to Mr. Livingstone as well. “It is the last great lake of its size and quality on the planet,” he said. “It’s like the Mona Lisa  —   a world treasure. ” I had spent an hour or two in Deline back in 2014, as an American diplomat posted to Canada. It was July and the lake was   endless and flat to the horizon. During my   tour, it was the sole time I needed a translator, because many Deline elders speak only their own language, North Slavey. This past November, I returned to Deline to learn more about the community’s relationship with the lake, to witness the interplay of culture, language, wilderness and isolation that makes this area so distinct. It was late afternoon when the small plane dipped through a thick,   cloud layer and I saw boreal forest  —   part of a vast biome that stretches across northern North America and Eurasia  —   as far as the eye could see. The plane descended toward a slender strip covered in white, Deline’s single runway. It was a short drive from the airport to the hotel where I was staying, the   Grey Goose Lodge. For such a tiny community, Deline has more tourist infrastructure than I expected, including a small handicrafts store in the hotel and an ambition to welcome the growing number of tourists who travel to Canada’s north for a winter and wilderness experience. The evening I arrived, I met with Morris Neyelle, a member of the new governing council, the K’aowedo Ke, as well as Danny Gaudet, a local businessman who was Deline’s lead negotiator for  . Sworn in on Sept. 1, the new Deline Got’ine Government is responsible for delivering an array of local programs and services. Mr. Neyelle, 65, tall and   switches easily between English and North Slavey. He said   allowed the residents of Deline to preserve their way of life and to use these traditions to tackle modern problems. In the past, Mr. Gaudet added, people would look only to the national and provincial government for help. Now, Deline would decide what was best for its people. This included making their own decisions about economic development, such as elevating cultural tourism through the   Destination Deline program. “Just on tourism alone, we think we can probably put everyone to work in this town,” Mr. Gaudet said. Protecting the lake, however, is not just about   and increased tourism. For the Sahtuto’ine, Mr. Neyelle and Mr. Gaudet explained, the lake was a powerful force in the world: a place critical to the survival of the human species. This belief is based on the prophecies of a Sahtuto’ine elder named Eht’se Ayah, who died in 1940. Some believe Mr. Ayah’s prophecies are literal, others believe they are allegory. Mr. Ayah foretold that in the future, people from the south would come to Great Bear Lake because it would be one of the few places left with water to drink and fish to eat. He said so many boats would come that you could walk from one to another without entering the water. Simply put, Great Bear Lake would be a last refuge for humanity. Mr. Gaudet said the predictions were a big reason the new government pushed to have authority over everyone in the area, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. If “hundreds of thousands of people” come because of the prophecies and because “we have the freshest water in the world,” he said, then “you have to live under our rules. ” People in Deline told me that the weather had been changing in recent years, and that the summer season was getting longer. The lake is taking longer to freeze, and it’s melting earlier. Mr. Neyelle said climate change added a note of urgency to the prophecies they may come true sooner than expected. “Maybe we’re in that era now where everything is changing,” he said, and people from the south “are going to come. ” Late that evening, I walked along Deline’s main street and tried to imagine hundreds of thousands of people coming to the area. It was hard to do. The night sky was overcast, and the temperature had dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius). Specks of ice from the   of Great Bear Lake filled the air. The flecks caused outdoor lights to reflect upward, creating optical illusions called light pillars that made it seem as if each light had become a searchlight aimed at the sky. I walked off the road and into a thicket of boreal forest. Hoarfrost from the lake clung to every surface of the trees and bushes. It covered even the undersides of spruce needles. I was hundreds of feet from the shoreline, yet Great Bear Lake was everywhere  —   in the air, on the ground and in the trees. At 8 the next morning, I awoke to darkness. From November until January, Deline gets less than five hours of sun each day, although it makes up for that between May and July, when it gets over 22 hours daily. Eventually, I saw a glimmer of predawn on the horizon, but it was not until 10:30 a. m. that the first rays of sun peeked out. I walked outside and headed toward the church for Sunday Mass. The round,   structure was in town, on the shore of Great Bear Lake. Chunks and shards of ice lay heaped on the shoreline, while farther out, the surface of the lake was   alternately skimmed white with snow or glistening with ice that froze overnight. A wedge of open water was visible just offshore. It looked turbulent, straining and frothing where it encountered the surface ice, as if it were determined not to freeze. Deline is predominantly Roman Catholic. Inside the church, I witnessed the community’s focus on preserving North Slavey. An elder was leading the congregation in the rosary. His call was in North Slavey, and the response was in a mix of Slavey and English. During the Mass, the Gospel and the homily were in English, followed by an    translation into North Slavey. The language is spoken everywhere  —   in church, on the streets and at home  —   as part of a concerted effort to keep it alive. The 2011 Canadian census counted only 225 people who identified the language as their mother tongue. But North Slavey is an official language of the Deline Got’ine Government and of the Northwest Territories. For the moment, North Slavey is not on the verge of extinction. It belongs to a family of North American indigenous languages that includes Apache and Navajo. Children in Deline’s primary school are taught the language this year, an elder began to teach North Slavey to high school students. Mr. Neyelle said the new government wanted to make acquiring and passing on the language a priority because it believed speaking North Slavey was crucial to preserving the culture. “Slavey is ours,” he said. “That’s where our powers lay. ” He said his descriptions in Slavey had more depth and color than those in English, even though he was fluent in both. Teenagers I spoke to echoed this thought. They said jokes were funnier in Slavey. After Mass, I walked over to Great Bear Lake, curious about the little skein of open water I had seen hours earlier. To my surprise, it had disappeared. Thinking I was turned around, I kept searching, but saw only the reflective surface of new ice and beyond that, a large field of older,   ice. Mr. Neyelle confirmed that the water had frozen over during the time I was in church. He was not surprised it had happened so quickly. Sometimes, he said, you could actually see ice creeping across open water. His description made it seem like a fox or wolf stalking its prey. We drove to Ski Hill, a gathering place for the community perched on top of a cleared rise near town. The sun had been up for three hours, but already it was getting dark. Several pickup trucks were parked close together, next to a recently built hut with a blazing fire pit in the middle. Children were sledding (despite the name of the hill, no one actually skis there) and some of the adults were   a new snowmobile with a powerful engine. Strips of lake trout along with moose meat and hot dogs cooked on top of barrel grills. The atmosphere was festive, perhaps because it seemed as if Great Bear Lake was finally freezing over. This meant access to the entire lake, better fishing and, eventually, an ice road that would temporarily connect Deline to the outside world. Or perhaps it was festive because these were friends gathering on a Sunday to enjoy the sunset, grilled food and conversation in North Slavey and in English. It reminded me that despite the groundbreaking nature of Deline’s   and Unesco status, it was still a small town. The type of town where the phone directory is a piece of paper taped to the wall. One elder I met there was Charlie Neyelle, 72, Morris Neyelle’s older brother and the elders’ representative on the K’aowedo Ke. Charlie Neyelle is a spiritual and mental health guide for the community, and pushed for   and preservation of Great Bear Lake. I asked him a question I had posed to many people during my time in Deline: What does Great Bear Lake mean to you? In response, Mr. Neyelle told me the   story, about a Sahtuto’ine ancestor who lived around Great Bear Lake, in an area called Caribou Point. One day the fisherman set out four hooks. When the fisherman returned to check on them, a lake trout had broken one of the lines and taken the hook. This bothered the fisherman, because in those days, hooks were extremely valuable. So that night, he transformed himself into a losch, also known as burbot, a freshwater version of cod. The fisherman swam down to the middle of the lake to look for the hook and heard a booming sound. There, at the bottom, he saw a gigantic beating heart. All the species of fish  —   trout, whitefish, pickerel, herring, suckers  —   faced the heart, surrounding and protecting it. He swam back to shore after seeing this, and the following morning when he went to check on his three hooks, he found three trout. One of them had the hook he had lost the day before dangling from its mouth. When the fisherman saw the   he realized Great Bear Lake was alive, Mr. Neyelle said. “The lake gives life to the universal: grass, insects, willow, everything. ” Some in Deline believe that the   at the bottom of the lake gives life to all of the lakes, oceans and rivers in the world. For the Sahtuto’ine, this belief underscores not only why Great Bear Lake must be protected, but also why its protection is of global importance. Toward the end of our conversation, Mr. Neyelle also mentioned Eht’se Ayah’s prophecy. “When there is no food or water all around the world, many will come to Great Bear Lake,” he said. “It will be one of the last places that has both. ” No matter how many times I heard this apocalyptic prediction, it was jarring to hear, especially when inserted into conversations about Great Bear Lake’s beauty and providence. The regular evocation of this prophecy reminded me of what happened on the other side of the lake in the 1940s, in Port Radium. The site of a large uranium ore mine, it was the most significant industrial development in Great Bear Lake’s history. During World War II, uranium from Port Radium was sent to the United States for the war effort, where it provided much of the material for the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although it stopped producing uranium in 1960 and is now abandoned, Port Radium was at its peak larger than Deline. Irene Kodakin was born near Port Radium in 1952, when the mine was still in operation. Now living in Deline, she describes Port Radium as a thriving community of aboriginal and nonaboriginal workers brought to work in the mines. Ms. Kodakin has happy memories of her childhood, in stark contrast to her experience in a residential school in Inuvik, a town more than 400 miles away. For much of the 20th century, the Canadian government forced many aboriginal children into these schools, with the goal of assimilating them into Canadian culture. “They would put their hand in our mouths and just press our bottom lips to our teeth until it bleeds” if you speak Slavey, she said. When she returned home, she could no longer speak North Slavey. Her older sister had to translate when Ms. Kodakin spoke to her own father. A generation of Sahtuto’ine lived and worked at Port Radium. Although it was known at the time that exposure to uranium was dangerous, this warning did not reach them. Long after the mine closed, Sahtuto’ine who had been in Port Radium began to die of various cancers. Ms. Kodakin’s father, George Kodakin, who had become a respected    chief in Deline, died of cancer at age 64. Ms. Kodakin’s older sister, aunts and uncles also died of it, and she believes the mine was the cause. Ms. Kodakin’s belief is shared by many in the community, including Gina Beyha, a coordinator for the Unesco Biosphere Reserve who was a nurse in Deline for 15 years. While researching links between cancer and Port Radium, Ms. Beyha and others discovered that uranium taken from the sacred Great Bear Lake was most likely used in the bombs that detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many people, especially the elders, were aghast, Ms. Beyha said. In 1998, Deline sent a delegation to Japan for the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony. It was a gesture of atonement as well as a way to start healing, particularly for the widows of men who had worked at Port Radium, who made traditional gifts that the delegation presented to the Japanese. During my time in Deline, the legacies of Port Radium and the residential schools were among many reasons people gave for protecting Great Bear Lake and for negotiating  . The others: to preserve Sahtuto’ine culture, to develop tourism, to honor elders and ancestors, and to prepare for the realization of Eht’se Ayah’s prophecies. After a week of talking with many Deline residents, these reasons all seemed tightly connected and at the core of the community’s identity. Those not living on Great Bear Lake, however, gave another reason that was perhaps the simplest of all. The lake, like the Mona Lisa, is magnificent. It draws the gaze as an ocean does. The slate blue ice and white snow merge seamlessly into the sky so that when you leave the shoreline, with brittle tiles of ice cracking underfoot, it feels like stepping into a cloud. And in the brief moments when the wind dies down, the silence is as deep and enormous as the lake itself. During my last days in the area, I went exploring with a Deline resident, Leeroy Andre, his wife, Diane, and his    daughter, Whitney. We would leave at sunrise and plunge into the boreal forest, following trails and old seismic lines. In the distance lay the frozen sheet of Great Bear Lake, and beyond, thick rolls of mist rose toward the sun, evidence of open water at the edge of the horizon. In North Slavey, this mist is called  . It is a land of ptarmigan and marten, musk ox, caribou, moose, wolf and bear. One day, after we had been out four hours, we came across a huge abandoned beaver lodge at least six feet high and twice as long. Around then, despite my wearing several layers, a parka and other gear, the cold started after me. It crept up from the ground onto my snowmobile. It cracked the rubber of my boots and shouldered inside. If I concentrated, I could feel ice crystals forming in my toes. When we started moving again, the cold took on the shape of a blanket and patiently tried to cover my shoulders and back. At sunset, the moon appeared like a slender comma above the trees, glowing in the   sky. We drove through marshmallow mounds: berry bushes covered in snow and hoarfrost for most of the year before they emerge in the summer and grow leaves and berries as fast as they can. Dark came quickly, and we sped across yet another small lake connected to Great Bear Lake. The snowmobile’s headlight illuminated a blizzard of snowflakes as shiny as diamonds, as if the land were showing what true wealth looked like. The northern lights appeared like a hallucination across the   sky. For hours they moved in slow motion above me, as the land seemed to recede and I faced the cosmos. If a recent scientific theory proves correct, somewhere out in space is the origin of the earth’s water, which fills Great Bear Lake and gives us life. This connected with something I was told when I first arrived in Deline. To the Sahtuto’ine, Great Bear Lake is not just a lake. They are part of it and it is part of them. No longer does this seem like a belief unique to their culture  —   it sounds like a universal truth. The water from Great Bear Lake flows in our veins, too."

The clownshow that is Tasmanian politics careens on, honking and hooting, overstuffed with idiots playing to the children in the crowd. Launceston City Council, which is the political equivalent of being appointed General Manager of your local Bunnings sausage sizzle, is going all-out to cement Tasmania’s status of capital of virtue-signalling numpties.



Launceston will shift its citizenship ceremonies and awards to January 25, shunning Australia Day for its links to Aboriginal dispossession.



The Launceston City Council on Thursday unanimously voted to shift the January 26 ceremonies to the preceding day.



We in the north of the island used to pride ourselves on being the sensible half of the state, leaving all that “woke” business to Sandy Bay wankers in Hobart and nosey-nanna Boomers in their Glamorgan retirement villages. Not any more, unfortunately.



Never mind that Launceston’s CBD is a wasteland of empty shopfronts, local roads are potholed and gridlocked, and the northern campus of UTAS is shedding students at a rate of knots, this muppet-collective of watermelons and theolibs have got the really **important** stuff to deal with. After all, they’ve already saved the planet by declaring a “climate emergency”.



Of course, there’s no clownshow in Tasmania without Punch. Competing with Sue Hickey for the dubious distinction of being the biggest pimple on the arse of Tasmanian politics is professional whinger extraordinaire, Michael Mansell.



“They are trying to be inclusive and to represent all people in their jurisdiction, not just white people, and their decision is full of common sense,” said veteran Aboriginal activist Michael Mansell.



With his race-blinkered vision, Mansell apparently fails to notice the scores of Australians of all ethnicities and colours who joyfully celebrate their national day on 26 January every year.



He urged the federal government to stop threatening councils who shifted citizenship ceremonies from January 26, claiming it was losing the battle.



“The federal government is saying ‘there’s no freedom of speech here — you will do it our way or you will be punished’,” he said. “That approach is doomed to fail because you can’t make 24 million people abide by something that is irrational.”



That’s never stopped Mansell before. Despite his bluster, 24 million Australians completely disagree with him. That’s the number of Australians whom recent polls consistently show are opposed to changing the date of Australia Day. **This isn’t about “freedom of speech”, either.** No-one’s stopping these cretins babbling whatever they like about Australia Day. The government is simply under no obligation to alter a gazetted public holiday because of it.



Tasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz accused the Launceston council of putting “virtue signalling” ahead of the wishes of the majority of ratepayers.



“It is out of touch with the ratepayers — we know that 75 per cent of Australians support Australia Day on the 26th of January,” Senator Abetz told The Australian. “Why on earth do you pick the 25th of January? What’s the tradition? What’s the historical reason for it?’



“The only rationale that can be offered is that it’s not the 26th of January. That’s hardly the basis to make a considered decision.”



I’m not a huge fan of Eric, either, but he’s bang on the money, here.



In the end though, the council will have to reckon with the Commonwealth, who actually hold responsibility for Australia Day. Hopefully, Scott Morrison will give them the thick ear they deserve.



“If some councils, as we’ve seen, want to play games, well, you don’t have to run citizenship ceremonies, other arrangements will be made,” the prime minister said. “But we will not undermine Australia’s national day […] I’m a prime minister for standards.”

"In 2014, we travelled to the northern boreal forests of Canada to set experimental fires that would help us understand the effect of wildfires on the global carbon cycle. Sadly, we never got the chance to set those fires, because the firefighters enlisted to help us were busy dealing with an area the size of Belgium that was already burning. That wildfire season was the most severe on record in the region, which itself forms part of the wider boreal ecosystem that engulfs much of the Northern Hemisphere’s subarctic lands with coniferous forests shaped by fire.  Thanks in part to the carbon-hungry soils and peatlands they contain, they punch well above their weight as carbon sinks, covering 10% of the world’s land, but storing one-third of the land’s carbon.

      How to fight wildfires and climate change with wetlands


 According to a new study examining the impacts of Canada’s 2014 wildfires, that stored carbon is under threat. Wildfires are becoming so frequent and intense that they are already turning some boreal forest areas from carbon sinks into net emitters. Most of the carbon in these ecosystems isn’t stored in the trees, but in the soils below. In the cold and often waterlogged boreal landscapes, organisms living in the soil aren’t able to “eat” dead organic matter that falls onto the forest floor as quickly as in warmer, dryer climates. This allows the soils to accumulate carbon over millennia, making boreal ecosystems some of the most important carbon sinks in the world. Wildfires, mostly started naturally by lightning, interrupt this accumulation process by burning the trees and the top layer of this organic soil – the latter accounting on average for three times as much of the CO2 released during burning as from the trees themselves. As part of the natural carbon cycle, the lost carbon is stored again by new trees that use CO2 from the air to grow, as well as by the dead plants, leaves and branches that accumulate in the soil. It can take many decades until all the carbon that was emitted during a fire is recaptured by the ecosystem but – as long as the time between two fires is longer than the time required to recapture that lost carbon – boreal forests remain a carbon sink. By sampling more than 200 locations, the new research found that more than a quarter of this Canadian forest burned in the 2014 fires was not more than 60 years old – much younger than the average historic time period between fires of one to two centuries in this region. They used a clever carbon dating approach to show that, for around half of the area of this young forest burnt in 2014, the soil had lost more carbon in the 2014 fire than had accumulated since the previous fire in the 1960s. In other words, the interval between fires was so short that the fire also burned into organic layers that contained “legacy carbon” that was accumulated before the 1960s. Thus, half of the young forest soil had transformed from a carbon sink to a carbon source in this fire-recovery cycle. Climate change is shortening the interval between fires in boreal regions, leaving less time for forests to regrow. It’s also increasing the intensity of individual fires, allowing them to burn deeper into the soil. These factors mean that more and more of an ecosystem on which we rely so much to remove carbon from the atmosphere could soon fall on the opposite side of the carbon ledger.

      Huge wildfires in the Arctic and far North send a planetary warning


 That’s true not just for North American boreal forests, but also the vast forests in Russia, China, and other sub-arctic regions covered by the sprawling ecosystem.  We’re currently studying boreal forests in little-researched north-eastern China, where worried forest managers are reporting decreased snow cover and burning of an intensity and extent they have not experienced before. So what can we do to protect the boreal carbon sink? Given the vast size and remoteness of most boreal fires, comprehensive firefighting measures would require astronomical resources – as has been highlighted by Russian authorities in response to the extensive fires in Siberia this summer.  A better option would be to protect healthy peatlands and restore drained ones, as they can be very effective natural fire breaks – and if they do catch fire they recover carbon relatively fast. But the reality is that we are powerless to substantially alter the effect of wildfires on the boreal forest system – other than by swiftly cutting our carbon emissions. It’s time for renewable energy to spread like wildfire. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"Energy is the lifeblood of all societies. But the production of energy from the burning of fossil fuels produces carbon emissions that are released into the atmosphere on a grand scale. The energy sector accounts for more than 70% of these emissions, which are driving climate change worldwide. Reducing carbon emissions from the energy sector has a direct and positive impact on climate protection. So there needs to be a transition from the current energy system that relies heavily on fossil fuels to a system that uses renewable energy sources that do not emit carbon, such as wind and solar. We also need to look at things like the electrification of transport and embrace a circular economy that seeks to reduce waste and the demand for energy. This process has already begun, but we need to speed it up – we’ve been dragging our heels for too long and now things are critical.  This will not happen by itself; it requires policy choices. These must be global, involving all states. It’s no good changing the energy sector of just one country. Energy has long been considered to fall within the domain of domestic policy. Yet international climate action is driving the transition to a low-carbon energy economy, on the basis of scientific evidence that highlights the importance of reducing energy consumption for the climate.  This must be done as quickly as possible. Some countries are more committed than others, but the extent of how much is actually being achieved (or not) must be monitored. This can only happen through the cooperation of all states under international law. Cooperative regulation of energy demands innovative, flexible organisation and law-making at international and the regional level.  The United Nations (UN) is at the forefront of this international cooperation. In 2015, the General Assembly adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that set out the progress the global community wants to make by 2030 on the most pressing challenges, from proverty reduction to climate change and energy transition. SDG 7 relates to ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for all. It contains indicators of progress on renewables, access to electricity and energy efficiency. SDG 13 relates to urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. These two goals work in tandem to encourage all states – developed and developing – to collaborate to make energy sustainable (meaning low-carbon), while ensuring access for all in every country by 2030. That means international climate action equals energy action. The UN High-Level Political Forum is the place states get together to discuss progress on the SGDs, and where consensus is being (re)affirmed continuously. SGDs 7 and 13 have been established and reinforced through the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. This is a binding treaty under international law adopted through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, by which the UN first addressed climate change in 1992. The agreement is the key international legal framework through which states aim to keep the increase in the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere to well below 2℃, and ideally limiting it to 1.5℃ by the end of the century. Almost all states have ratified the Paris Agreement and so must abide by it. If any intends to withdraw from it, they must abide by the legal rules of the agreement. So the US would only be able to withdraw – as Donald Trump insists – after the next presidential election. In the meantime, his administration continues to abide by the Paris Agreement rules and actually takes a very active role in the negotiations. Domestic action is necessary to implement the promises of the Paris Agreement. Every state is obliged to submit “nationally determined contributions” that set the scene for the most ambitious climate protection plan at the national level. These national plans on climate protection have a strong influence on energy regulation at the domestic level. The “Katowice package” (the Paris rule book), adopted in 2018, provides further guidance. For developed countries, the Paris Agreement stipulates that they adopt eceonomy-wide greenhouse gas emission targets. These targets can only be achieved if the entire economy, including the energy sector, is “decarbonised”. That means that the use of fossil fuels has to end and be replaced by sustainable (renewable) energy. Developing countries receive support under the Paris Agreement so that they too can move over time to economy-wide reduction targets. Only by acting together will the international community achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, driven by the European Union and like-minded states, is emerging as the basis of transcontinental energy governance in Europe, Asia and Africa. This treaty covers energy investments, trade, freedom of energy transit, efficiency, and resolution of disputes. It is now modernising to support the energy transition.  Cooperative energy regulation also occurs on a regional level, and that is the case in Europe as well as Asia and Africa. The EU has adopted a frontrunner position with a strategy precisely based on the Paris Agreement till 2080, driving the transition of the continent’s energy system. Called the Clean Energy Package, it will create a transboundary, continent-wide energy system that better integrates renewables, improves efficiency and empowers consumer choice. Even after Brexit, the UK will likely remain connected to this market, as both the EU and the UK share the objective of achieving net zero carbon by 2050  If humanity is to achieve its goal of fully and speedily transitioning to low-carbon energy while ensuring affordable access for all, then we must stay focused and committed and continue to cooperate internationally. The future of the generations that follow depends on it."

As more Australian states succumb to the lobbying of euthanasia advocates, objections are continually hand-waved away by sneering elites. As always happens with these social justice fads, not only is contrary evidence ignored, advocates insist that there is absolutely no slippery slope.



Then this happens…



A 74-year-old Dutch woman with dementia was euthanized by a doctor who drugged the patient’s coffee without her knowledge and then had family members physically restrain her for the final lethal injection.



At the same time, Swedish scientists are urging [cannibalism as a solution to climate change](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/newsweek-a-swedish-scientist-and-the-cannibalism-apologists). We are officially living in a science-fiction dystopia: _Logan’s Run_ , meet _Soylent Green_.



The Netherlands is the poster-child for the creeping death-cult of “assisted dying”. Their “safeguards” have been steadily eroded to the point that children, depressed teenagers (a tautology?), are being put down like so many unwanted kittens. Now they’re holding down grandma and shooting poison into her veins.



 **All absolutely legally.**



The doctor, who has not been publicly named, was cleared of all wrongdoing by a court in the Netherlands on Wednesday, “clarifying” the country’s euthanasia law enacted in 2002 […]Patients with dementia can now be killed by their doctors even if they strongly object to euthanasia at the time, so long as they have previously given consent for the fatal procedure. In other words, if a patient were to change their mind about the assisted suicide, a doctor could still legally kill them against their will.



Now, it might fairly be argued that people with dementia can express a will to die while they’re still “of sound mind”, and be unable to do so as their disease progresses. Chillingly, though, that’s not at all what happened here.



In the case of this specific Dutch woman with dementia, she never once gave an express request to be euthanized. In her will, which was renewed about a year before her death, the woman said she would like to be euthanized “whenever I think the time is right.” And when she was asked if she wanted to be euthanized, she reiterated multiple times that her suffering was not bad enough to where she wanted to be killed:



“The 74-year-old woman had renewed her living will about a year before she died, writing that she wanted to be euthanized ‘whenever I think the time is right.’ Later, the patient said several times in response to being asked if she wanted to die: ‘But not just now, it’s not so bad yet!’ according to a report from the Dutch regional euthanasia review committee.”



She was killed, anyway.



Like the Dutch state, the doctor has something of a track record.



“A panel had previously cleared the doctor of ethical violations by saying she ‘acted in good faith,'” but that decision was overturned by the Regional Euthanasia Review Committees. On Wednesday, the doctor was again cleared of wrongdoing.



  
The Netherlands is fast becoming a killing factory for unwanted humans. In 2017, 15 human beings a day were legally killed by doctors. Psychiatrists are rushing to catch up, too. Just 12 mentally ill patients were killed in 2012. Two years later, the number was 43. By 2017, that had nearly doubled again, to 83.

"A fiery meteor streaked across the Midwest sky early Monday morning, seen as far west as Nebraska and as far east as New York. Unfortunately for scientists who would like to study where it came from and how it got here (although perhaps fortunately for people living in the vicinity) all of the surviving bits of rock plopped into Lake Michigan. The American Meteor Society has received more than 350 reports from witnesses of the green fireball, which occurred around 1:25 a. m. local time. William B. Cook, a NASA meteor expert, reported in a email to NASA headquarters that the fireball originated about 60 miles above West Bend, Wis. moving about 38, 000 miles an hour toward the northeast before disintegrating about 21 miles above Lake Michigan. As the meteor fell apart, it emitted   sounds that were recorded in the Canadian province of Manitoba, about 600 miles away. The blast released energy that was equal to at least 10 tons of TNT, Dr. Cook said, suggesting that the object that entered the atmosphere was at least 600 pounds and two feet in diameter. Most of the reports came from Wisconsin and Illinois. Michael Hankey of the American Meteor Society said such fireballs happen every day somewhere, but only rarely  —   perhaps four a year  —   do they occur over populated areas of the United States where the light show can be captured by dashboard cameras, security cameras and night owls carrying cellphones. “There were just a ton of videos,” Mr. Hankey said. “That was unique. ” Marc D. Fries, another NASA scientist, said that weather radar captured the shower of meteorites and that he was analyzing the data to estimate the masses of the meteorites and where they fell. From the multitude of reports, scientists should be able to calculate the trajectory of the object, which most likely originated in the asteroid belt. (An asteroid is a rock orbiting in the inner solar system, usually between Mars and Jupiter. A meteor is the streak of light as an asteroid enters the atmosphere. A meteorite is an asteroid remnant that makes it to the ground.) Philipp R. Heck, a scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said the fireball seemed comparable to one that fell over a southern suburb of Chicago in 2003. Meteorites as heavy as several pounds hit the ground, some damaging homes. With the asteroid remnants, scientists could study the mineralogy in detail, even estimating how many million years it took for the asteroid to cross paths with Earth. But it is unlikely that anyone will find pieces of Monday’s meteor. Mr. Hankey said the biggest meteorites were probably the size of baseballs, sunk in the sediments at the bottom of Lake Michigan. “Good luck finding that,” he said."

My greener friends are increasingly troubled by the lack of a rise in recent global surface temperatures. Using monthly data measured as the departure from long‐​term averages, there’s been no significant warming trend since the fall of 1996. In other words, we are now in our 17th year of flat temperatures.



Since 1900, the world has seen one other period of similar temperature stagnation (actually a slight cooling) that lasted for 30 years and ended around 1976. The current one is happening with much more putative warming “pressure,” because the atmosphere’s carbon‐​dioxide content is much higher than it was in mid‐​century.



From the Industrial Revolution to 1950, atmospheric carbon‐​dioxide concentrations rose by about 15 percent. Today, the increase is up to 41 percent, making long periods without warming either 1) increasingly unlikely, or 2) the natural result of simply overestimating how “sensitive” surface temperature is to carbon dioxide. My money is on the latter.



Now, just for fun, let’s assume that on Jan. 1, another warming trend began, at the same rate that was observed in the last such period, from 1977 through 1998, or 0.17 C per decade.





People are beginning, cautiously, to dial back 21st century warming because there has been none. 



Running a large experimental sample reveals that, on average, the rate of warming will have to continue through 2020 before a statistically significant trend emerges in the post‐​1996 data. (Remember that a “trend” that does not meet the normal grounds for significance is one that cannot scientifically be distinguished from “no trend.”)



In other words, it’s a pretty good bet that we are going to go nearly a quarter of a century without warming.



In response, the climate establishment is becoming increasingly polarized, with a growing number of researchers calculating less warming this century, while the apocalyptics, such as NASA’s James Hansen, simply edge out further on increasingly thin limbs.



This is quite a change. In 2002, I published a paper, “Revised 21st Century Temperature Projections,” which used a variety of independent sources and generally predicted a range of 21st century warming of 1.0 to 3.0 C. In response, the 2009 “Climategate” emails revealed a number of surreptitious attempts and schemes to either get the paper removed, get the esteemed geographer who was the relevant editor of the journal Climate Research fired from his University of Auckland professorship, or, if all else failed, destroy the journal itself.



Formally, the “climate sensitivity” is the total amount of warming projected for a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide. In their last climate compendium, published in 2007, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave a “likely” range for the sensitivity of “2 C to 4.5 C with a best estimate of about 3.0 C.” Since then, it appears that a new “consensus” is lowering the forecast. The reason I’m betting that the sensitivity of temperature to dreaded carbon dioxide has been overestimated is the number of recent publications saying just that. Here’s a partial list:



Richard Lindzen gives a range of 0.6 to 1.0 C (Asia‐​Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 2011); Andreas Schmittner, 1.4 to 2.8 C (Science, 2011); James Annan, using two techniques, 1.2 to 3.6 C and 1.3 to 4.2 C (Climatic Change, 2011); J.H. van Hateren, 1.5 to 2.5 C (Climate Dynamics, 2012); Michael Ring, 1.5 to 2.0 C (Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, 2012); and Julia Hargreaves, including cooling from dust, 0.2 to 4.0 C and 0.8 to 3.6 C (Geophysical Research Letters, 2012). Each of these has lower and higher limits below those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.



What commonly occurs when weather forecasts begin to go bad? As every child knows, if the forecast starts out calling for a foot of snow, and then is cut to six inches, that usually results in about three.



Similarly, as projections for warming are lowered, don’t be surprised if planetary temperature finally settles in the bottom half of the newly predicted ranges.



Science historians have repeatedly documented that we are particularly reluctant to abandon widely held views, or scientific paradigms. When professional advancement (i.e., research money) is particularly dependent upon a certain view (we wouldn’t spend billions on climate research unless it was important, right?), it’s even harder to let go, but that is what we may be seeing.



People are beginning, cautiously, to dial back 21st century warming because there has been none. Because dreaded sea‐​level rise is also proportional, those estimates are going to have to come down, too.



One of these years, the upcoming end of the world from global warming is going to be officially canceled, to be replaced by a new apocalypse, which I predict will be called “acid oceans,” or something like that.

Any entity seeking to have an impact on the course of foreign policy in Washington D.C. should have an orientating position paper--a take on the currents of national strategy. All too often the national security community has ceded the intellectual ground to policymakers and professors alike. One camp might give us evidence for action with little context for implementation (the academics). Another may give us a desired means of achieving a goal, but little consideration for feasibility (policymakers). In _Building a Modern Military_, released on May 26, 2020, the Cato Institute’s defense and foreign policy team seeks to provide an orientating guide to the future of U.S. national security policy with a strong concern for feasibility and the implementation of our ideas.



We began work on _Building a Modern Military_ in the summer of last year. The goal was to produce a yearly budget analysis document. Over time this project evolved into so much more. While the budget is a big part of our project, we are more concerned with overall strategy and the strategic challenges that might upset United States’ standing in the world.



After we had written _Building the Modern Military_ at the turn of the year, perhaps the greatest national security challenge United States has ever faced since World War II occurred: COVID-19. We considered scrapping everything we had done and reorienting ourselves for the challenge of global health. We found, though, that the words written last year were still prescient. We never predicted a global pandemic, but we did push for budget adjustments, military innovation, and a realignment of strategic deterrence. All three of these issues remain relevant.



Moving forward we have a deeper challenge to re-conceptualize just what security might mean in the age of COVID-19. The topics we tackle next year will have to morph and change with the times. We will still advocate a restraint-based strategy that considers the priority of national defense and enabling our allies as opposed to a global geostrategic umbrella that defends neither the homeland nor our allies. But just how we defend the homeland and what we spend to do so will have to change.



Some future challenges are already known. How do we enable defenses against cyber threats and information operations given that we are more dependent now than ever before on digital connectivity? How do we ensure that global repression is not a common outgrowth of the rise of the surveillance state to support health initiatives? How do we move on from legacy technologies that no longer serve a strategic purpose?



Moving forward, budget cuts are going to have to be drastically more intense than ever due to the pandemic's prolonged economic harm. We will be required to make tough choices. The United States is a country built on tough choices and has endured for generations. It will meet the coming challenge of global pandemics, climate change, and the rise of near peer competitors, but it will not change American values and intentions. Our goal is stability while maintaining security, moving beyond the failures of leadership and coordination that the United States recently witnessed.



As we eventually move past the pandemic and think about recovery, we must also remember what we have lost during this period of turbulence. The significant amount of lives lost, the resulting loss of prestige and position internationally as a global leader in health, and the economic harm the United States will experience will reverberate for generations. How we meet this challenge and move forward as a resilient nation will shape how the United States engages with the world for many years to come.

"WASHINGTON  —   Senator Jeff Sessions was confirmed on Wednesday as President Trump’s attorney general, capping a bitter and racially charged nomination battle that crested with the procedural silencing of a leading Democrat, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, survived a    vote, 52 to 47, in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Mr. Trump strains to install his cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation’s top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate. But the confirmation process  —   ferocious even by the standards of moldering decorum that have defined the body’s recent years  —   laid bare the Senate’s deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency. At the same time, the treatment of Ms. Warren, who was forced to stop speaking late Tuesday after criticizing Mr. Sessions from the Senate floor, rekindled the   politics that animated the presidential election and the women’s march protesting Mr. Trump the day after his inauguration last month. Mr. Sessions cast his final vote as a senator to note that he was present for Wednesday’s tally. His confirmation was met by applause from his colleagues, including a few Democrats, on the Senate floor. “I can’t express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time,” Mr. Sessions said shortly after the vote. “By your vote tonight, I have been given a real challenge. I’ll do my best to be worthy of it. ” Democrats spent the hours before the vote on Wednesday seething over the rebuke of Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, who had been barred from speaking on the floor the previous night. Late Tuesday, Republicans voted to formally silence Ms. Warren after she read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Mr. Sessions for using “the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens” while serving as a United States attorney in Alabama. Since Mr. Trump announced his choice for attorney general, Mr. Sessions’s history with issues of race had assumed center stage. A committee hearing on his nomination included searing indictments from black Democratic lawmakers like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who broke with Senate tradition to testify against a peer. For weeks, Republicans rejected suggestions that Mr. Sessions could not be trusted on civil rights, arguing that he had been tarnished unfairly over accusations of racial insensitivity that have dogged him since the 1980s. “Everybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle,” Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said during the debate on Wednesday afternoon. The “twisting” of Mr. Sessions’s record offended him, he said, even as Democrats continued their attacks on the nominee. As the 84th attorney general, Mr. Sessions brings a sharply conservative bent to the Justice Department and its 113, 000 employees. A former prosecutor, he promises a focus aligned with Mr. Trump in pushing a “law and order” agenda that includes tougher enforcement of laws on immigration, drugs and gun trafficking. Civil rights advocates worry, however, that he will reverse steps taken by the Obama administration in the last eight years to bring more accountability to police departments, state and local governments, and employers. Advocates point to his history of votes against various civil rights measures, as well as the accusations of racial insensitivity. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, said on Wednesday that on civil rights, immigration, abortion, criminal sentencing guidelines and a range of other issues, Mr. Sessions had been far outside the mainstream and had pushed “extreme policies” often targeting minorities. That criticism peaked with Tuesday night’s rebuke of Ms. Warren, based on an arcane Senate rule that prevents members from impugning the character of a fellow senator, as she read the letter from Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mrs. King wrote the letter in response to Mr. Sessions’s 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship, for which he was ultimately rejected in part because of accusations that he had been insensitive to minorities as a prosecutor. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, led the objection against Ms. Warren. His explanation afterward  —   “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted”  —   instantly became a liberal rallying cry,   Ms. Warren as a leading voice of Democratic resistance to Mr. Trump. “What hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,” Ms. Warren told a group of civil rights leaders on Wednesday at the Capitol. “It’s about trying to shut people up. It’s about saying: ‘No, no, no. Just go ahead and vote. ’” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday that the censure was “totally, totally  ” and that it reflected an “   attitude” emanating from the White House. He and other Democrats said it served to mute legitimate criticism of Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights and racial issues  —   one of their main avenues of attack at his contentious nomination hearing last month. The vote on Mr. Sessions came a day after Senate Republicans broke through a bottleneck in Mr. Trump’s nominees by approving Betsy DeVos, the embattled Republican donor, as education secretary with the help of a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. With Mr. Sessions’s confirmation, votes are expected in coming days on the nominations of Representative Tom Price of Georgia for secretary of health and human services and Steven T. Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mr. Sessions’s path to confirmation hit another snag that riled Democrats and energized opponents of his nomination: Mr. Trump’s dramatic firing of the acting leader of the Justice Department. Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, setting off a fierce backlash from Democrats against Mr. Sessions’s nomination to fill her job permanently. Ms. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, had refused to defend Mr. Trump’s controversial order barring travel by some foreigners, which is now tied up in litigation in federal courts. Democrats seized on her firing to say that Mr. Sessions is too close to the president to be independent or stand up to him. As the first senator to support Mr. Trump’s   bid for president last year, Mr. Sessions became an influential campaign adviser. While he pledged repeatedly not to be “a mere rubber stamp” for the White House, Democrats asserted that he would not be willing to challenge legally questionable policies like the travel ban or the president’s threats to reinstitute the use of torture on terrorism suspects. The arguments failed to sway any Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted, 11 to 9, along party lines last week to approve Mr. Sessions’s nomination. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed confidence that Mr. Sessions would be a “fair and evenhanded” attorney general and would make good on his pledges to enforce even the laws he voted against in the Senate. “There should be no question,” Mr. Grassley said, “that he is more than qualified to be the nation’s top law enforcement officer. ”"

Government spending must be cut. The national debt exceeds the annual GDP. Total unfunded liabilities are 14 times as much, more than $200 trillion. Government spending once again must be cut.



Unfortunately, the biggest pots of money have the largest number of dedicated guardians. Interest on the national debt must be paid, unless Uncle Sam is prepared to default, like Greece. Seniors form a phalanx around Social Security and Medicare. Medicaid already ill serves the poor and underpays doctors. The military‐​industrial complex fights as hard for weapons spending today as it did against communism during the Cold War.



About all that’s left is domestic discretionary spending, roughly 15 percent of the budget. Most everyone in Washington talks about freezing or cutting these outlays, but nothing ever happens. Politicians want pork to distribute and interest groups want grants, loans, loan guarantees, tax preferences, and all manner of other privileges funded by government. Whether Republicans or Democrats are in control, the taxpayers’ money continues to be wasted.



Last year the deficit was $1.3 trillion. That means every “discretionary” outlay effectively came from borrowed money. Loans that must be repaid. By taxpayers in a weak economy made permanently smaller by the diversion of otherwise productive resources to political projects.



If Congress doesn’t have the courage to cut even these expenditures, then what hope is there that it will bring the nation back from hundreds of trillions in future overspending?



Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) is a rarity on Capitol Hill, a scourge of the wasteful foolishness which emanates from the Potomac. In his view “perhaps there was no bigger waste of the taxpayers’ money in 2011 than Congress itself.” Lots of people talk about “waste,” but few do anything about it. Sen. Coburn identified 100 really dumb projects and collected them in the “2011 Wastebook: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful and Low Priority Government Spending of 2011.” It is a great place to start cutting unnecessary government.



Number one is obvious with the approach of another presidential election. As of November Presidential Election Campaign Fund contained $35.38 million. What could be dumber than forcing the American people to pay for the campaigns and conventions of the very politicians who created today’s mess? At least President Barack Obama is helping to destroy the system by eschewing public funding.



The 99 other examples of waste? The U.S. Agency for International Development (U.S. AID) spent $30 million to spur mango production and sales in Pakistan — and failed utterly. The Air Force spent $14 million to switch three radar stations to wind power; poor planning forced cancellation of one turbine and consideration of the same for the other two. The Federal Aviation Administration devoted $6 million to subsidize air service at small, underused airports.



A federal grant for $765,828 went to — I am not making this up, to quote Dave Barry — bring an International House of Pancakes franchise to Washington, D.C. Although the famed “Bridge to Nowhere” might never be built, Uncle Sam still shelled out $15.3 million in project costs, including a 14‐​minute promotional video, on top of $50 million already absorbed by the Knik Arm Bridge. The Office of Personnel Management sent $120 million to dead federal employees (actually, they probably did less harm than the live ones!).



The Department of Transportation spent $529.689 to create the fourth visitor center around the 54 mile Talimena Scenic Drive between Oklahoma and Arkansas. A check for $113,277 was cut to help the International Center for the History of Electronic Games to preserve “historic” video games. Washington helpfully gave almost $18 million in foreign aid to China — money effectively borrowed from China. The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided a $484,000 grant to build a “Mellow Mushroom Pizza Bakers” restaurant in Texas.



Uncle Sam sent $100,000 to the Washington State Fruit Commission to stage a “celebrity chef fruit promotion road show” in Indonesia. U.S. AID gave $10 million to an arts organization in Pakistan — a country threatened with disintegration — to produce local episodes of Sesame Street. Then there was $150,000 for the American Museum of Magic in Marshall, Michigan. Another HUD grant, this one for $1 million, went to a foreign architectural firm to move its headquarters from Santa Monica to Los Angeles. The federal government cut a check for $550,000 to underwrite a documentary on the impact of rock and roll on the collapse of communism.



The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided a $702,558 grant for the study of the impact of televisions and gas generators on villages in Vietnam. Hawaii’s annual Chocolate Festival collected $48,700 from Washington. People who didn’t own homes, such as children and prisoners, claimed as much as a billion dollars in tax credits for promoting energy efficiency in their homes. The Department of Commerce gave $936,818 to create a web TV soap opera on single moms to spur adoption of broadband.



Michigan received $75,000 to promote Christmas trees and poinsettias. The State Department spent $350,000 to underwrite an arts festival in Venice, Italy. NIH gave the University of Kentucky $175,587 to study the impact of cocaine on the sex drive of Japanese quail. A grant for $2 million went to Washington State’s Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center.



The Department of Agriculture spent $200 million — still not real money in the nation’s capital — to promote industry groups, cooperatives, and corporations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spent $385,005 to survey what bus riders thought of HIV videos. Maine collected $95,000 to purchase iPads for kindergarteners. The Agency for Health Research and Quality spent more than $1 million to get people to visit its website. The National Science Foundation (NSF) used $200,000 to see what the public thinks of politicians and climate change.



The Federal Highway Administration (FHA) gave $916,567 to underwrite horse‐​drawn carriage exhibits and survey shipwrecks in Wisconsin. The Veterans Administration spent $221,540 on a conference on disability ratings. NSF spent $300,000 for tourism podcasts in Alaska. The IRS used $862,000 to store unused furniture and equipment. NSF (again!) spent nearly a half million dollars to study whether people trust Tweets from Twitter. U.S. AID devoted $12 million to help the hapless Pakistanis use less energy.



The Oregon Cheese Guild received $50,400 to promote cheese. HUD gave $168 million, still pocket change in Washington, to the federally chartered Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, deemed unnecessary and duplicative by the Congressional Budget Office. The Agriculture Department, another multiple offender, spent $73,824 to encourage bed and breakfasts to use local produce. New Hampshire’s Museum on the History of Skiing received $86,000.



Fraud and waste in wartime contracting may have cost about $4.4 billion. Now that’s real money!



Uncle Sam spent $111,000 to send brewery experts to conduct classes in China. A grant for $24,632 went for the Milwaukee Public Museum to produce a 3-D virtual mummy unwrapping. NSF (won’t they ever stop?) provided $149,990 for production of a guppy‐​to‐​fish video game. The Department of Agriculture spent $9.49 million on a duplicative program in management of foreign forests which even the White House wants to eliminate. Washington used $697,006 to beautify Las Vegas highways.



The ubiquitous NSF spent $764,825 to study student social networking. The equally wastral Agriculture Department devoted $171,050 for a farm marketing effort in Vermont. The federal government paid $136,555 so teachers could retrace the steps of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. The Energy Department’s $231 million weatherization program was inefficient, wasteful and duplicative.



U.S. AID underwrote a $1.35 million “entrepreneurship initiative” in Barbados. The Coast Guard spent $24,450 on a float in the Mardi Gras. NSF (yet again!) spent $126,242 on a study of campaign websites. Salt Lake City received $150,000 to renovate a carriage house. The Department of Transportation spent $8.3 million to preserve covered bridges. Wine promotion benefited from $62,000 in federal promotional funds. Another $206,214 went to develop games to promote nutrition. Uncle Sam cut a check for $60,000 to count trees in Henderson, Nevada.



More than $22 million went for the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Program at the CDC, which duplicated similar efforts at the Department of Agriculture. The latter gave $181,966 for Tennessee to develop a smart phone app for special crop producers. NSF provided $300,000 to study the effectiveness of leaders of the European Parliament. A grant for $100,000 went to help the Massachusetts video game industry.



The Department of Defense spent $207 million on a duplicative second engine design for the F-35 fighter. NIH, also a repeat offender, spent $55,382 to study hookah smoking in Jordan. The Department of Homeland Security used $6,279 to purchase Snow Cone ice‐​making machines for emergency services in Michigan. The Agriculture Department, a perpetual waster, gave Oklahoma $93,000 to promote specialty crops. The ever busy NSF devoted $300,000 to developing a dance program to illustrate the origins of matter.



The National Institute for Aging paid researchers $610,908 to survey well‐​being around the world. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) provided $50,000 for a self‐​guided art tour in Wisconsin. The Technology Innovation Program spent $45 million subsidizing the research of numerous large, profit‐​making corporations. The Department of State spent $30,000 to send a New York City dance company to Indonesia. NSF — they never stop! — devoted a half million dollars to studying “information dissemination” on the Web.



The Department of Agriculture spent $12 million on a duplicative energy assistance program which both the Bush and Obama administrations proposed closing. U.S. AID consumed $156,273 celebrating its 50th anniversary of spending lots of money with little positive effect. The Agriculture Department — yet again! — devoted $15 million to repairing privately‐​owned rental property for low income people. The Rural Business Enterprise Grant program gave the Kriemhild Dairy Farms $55,660 to buy a new butter packing machine. NEA provided $50,000 to underwrite an international film festival in San Francisco.



The ever‐​busy NSF gave nearly a half million dollars for a children’s chemistry theater. Some $50 million went for retrofitting diesel engines as part of an Environmental Protection Agency program which even the Obama administration wanted to kill. The Air Force Academy spent $51,474 to construct an outdoor worship center for “earth‐​based” religions. NSF provided $425,642 to study information dissemination and Indian politicians. A Missouri museum collected $300,000 for an exhibit on the history of transportation.



The National Endowment for Humanities paid $159,865 to send 16 university professors to Rome for five weeks. The duplicative Rail Line Relocation Program collected $10.5 million despite President Obama’s attempt to end the outlay. The Department of State used $306,000 to bring European college students to America to learn civic activism. Columbia University collected $606,000 for a study of online dating. Uncle Sam gave $74,470 to a Utah museum to teach puppetry. The Appalachian Regional Commission, one of four “economic development” agencies, spent $68 million despite having no measurable effect on economic development.



NSF, ye gods!, used $198,195 to study what people expect from social media. Washington devoted $25,000 to transcribe a traditional love ballad in the Maldives. U.S. AID, another unrepentant recidivist, spent $15 million in a program permeated by waste and fraud to help Afghan war victims. NIH devoted $592,527 to study why chimpanzees throw objects. NSF used $130,987 to review the use of robots to promote language skills in preschoolers. The Transportation Department gave Louisiana $5.18 million to build the Steamboat Overlook Interpretive Center.



The never idle NSF gave $338,998 for researchers to, I am not making this up, study the impact of women on the Icelandic textile industry. The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering received $50,000 from Washington. The Agriculture Department devoted $742,907 to study using “targeted sheep grazing” against weeds. The Federal Highway Administration gave Washington, D.C. $83,000 to upgrade planter boxes in the median of a major street.



The Treasury Department spent $184 million to keep the paper dollar bill in circulation. NSF gave PBS $130,000 to redesign the website for one of its shows. Nearly half a million dollars went to the Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation, which no president has supported since its creation two decades ago, to promote activities “for the benefit of mankind.”



It’s quite a list of silly and frivolous government expenditures. But it is only a small beginning.



Save all the money from killing these programs and America still would be going broke. Much more needs to be cut.



However, Sen. Coburn has provided a good starting point. Legislators of both parties insist that outlays must be reduced. Here is their chance.



If they won’t get rid of ridiculous programs like these, they won’t take on serious programs like Social Security and the Pentagon. And if they won’t do that, then Uncle Sam might as well start filling out his papers to declare bankruptcy.

There is another climate jolly in the wings. All the movers and shakers need to urgently fly to New York for a talkfest at the UN Climate Action Summit. Also, there are the climate activists and school children who are going to bunk off school for a climate strike later this month.



Something needs to be done to get the word out so more than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries – with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people – have signed on to a pledge to produce climate panic stories to strengthen media coverage of the climate crisis. (As if it wasn’t bad enough already.)



 _Stuff_ and _TVNZ_ _RNZ_ , _Newshub_ , _NZ Herald_ , _Newsroom_ etc (all the usual suspects) are leading the charge here in New Zealand.



The whole initiative was founded earlier this year by _Columbia Journalism Review_ and _the Nation_ because they felt there was an urgent need for stronger climate coverage. 



The Covering Climate Now partners have pledged to increase the volume and visibility of their climate coverage in the first large-scale collaboration of the partnership. 



“First large-scale collaboration”? Yeah, right. They have all been singing from the same song-sheet for years.



One good thing is that by printing a list of “collaborators” (sounds like those in France who helped the Jerries), they have given us a handy guide of outlets to ignore it you want any climate truth.



The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. Earlier this year, The Guardian [updated its style guide](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/17/why-the-guardian-is-changing-the-language-it-uses-about-the-environment) to introduce new terms that **more accurately** describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favoUrs the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” over “climate change.”



“We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,” said the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a **catastrophe** for humanity.”



The Guardian also began putting global CO2 levels in the **daily weather forecast** in its print publication earlier this year.



 **“At a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster,** climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media,” [organisers] wrote. “Especially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time.”

Greta Thunberg’s diatribe at the UN was religious fervour on steroids. Her dedication to warning that we are on the brink of annihilation, and governments are to blame for man-made climate change, is totally nuts, but even crazier is the adoration poured on this errant 16-year-old who is as far from a normal 16-year-old as you could get. 



“This week, [in April this year] she was named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time Magazine. She has briefly met the Pope, who encouraged her to “Keep doing what you’re doing.” She has received numerous awards, including, most recently, the German Golden Camera award. She has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.”



Well this is backwards. The Nobel _Peace_ Prize for encouraging rebellious children to skip school. But Greta Thunberg is a product of progressive parenting. After Greta’s appearance at the UN this week, Emily Brooke, writing for _Stuff_ , is sipping the same progressive parenting Koolaid.



“How would you feel if your teenager skipped school? Disagreed openly with her elders? Tried to persuade you to change your lifestyle? Led other children to copy her rebellious behaviour? 



**If my daughter was Greta Thunberg, I’d be proud as hell.”**



  
Brooke is nuts too, and before sending her own child over the cliff with the rest of the lemmings, she should think about the dysfunctional Thunberg family, which is a case study in how not to raise your kids. Brooke admits she already elevates her three-year-old daughter to parent status. 



**“The time for unquestioningly obeying your elders is done.**



 **We don’t need a generation of polite rule-keepers.** We need a generation of critical thinkers, of agitators, of dissidents. Young people who throw paint at the status quo and aren’t afraid to fight for what they believe in. We need a generation of activists, or we’re all doomed.”



Brooke has child raising completely backwards. Future generations are not doomed by a lack of activists, they are doomed by a lack of good parenting.



Kids should be allowed to be kids and taught to trust their parents with the decision making. Progressive parenting absolves the adult from parental responsibility including refusing to say “no” to their child and foisting on them life choices which they are ill-equipped to make. Little wonder the Thunberg children are self-destructing.



Greta’s mother, Marlena Ernman, in her 2018 book “Scenes From the Heart”, gives heartbreaking insights into her tragic family.



“We are offered a story of “a family in crisis and a planet in crisis”—two phenomena that are presented as inextricably linked. 



The book posits that oppression of women, minorities, and people with disabilities stem from the same overarching root problem as climate change: **an unsustainable way of life.**



 **The family’s private crisis and the global climate crisis, the authors argue, are simply symptoms of the same systemic disorder**.”



Their family life is certainly unsustainable because this is a family in crisis. The children are living through hell on earth simply because the parents refused to establish parental authority in the home as soon as the child started questioning it. 



“Greta is eleven years old and has gone two months without eating. Her heart rate and blood pressure show clear signs of starvation. She has stopped speaking to anyone but her parents and younger sister, Beata. 



**After years of depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks** , she finally receives a medical diagnosis: Asperger’s syndrome, high-functioning autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism—which explains why she sometimes can’t speak to anyone outside her closest family. When she wants to tell a climate researcher that she plans a school strike on behalf of the environment, she speaks through her father.” 



At eleven years old Greta was struggling with basic life skills and showing permanent physical effects of her poor choices, and her sister is exactly the same.



“Her sister Beata, who was 12 when the book was written, lives with ADHD, Asperger’s syndrome, and OCD. She is prone to sudden outbursts of anger, during which she screams obscenities at her mother.



What would normally be a 10-minute walk to dance class takes almost an hour because Beata insists on walking with her left foot in front, refuses to step on certain parts of the sidewalk, and **demands that her mother** walk the same way. 



She also **insists that her mother** wait outside during class—she isn’t allowed to move, even to go to the bathroom. The child still ends up weeping in her mother’s arms.” 



This mother is a progressive parent letting her errant children call the shots to the detriment of their long term health and well being.



“In Scenes from the Heart, when Greta eventually starts eating again, she only allows herself certain foods. 



**Her mother has to** prepare the same food every day for Greta to bring to school and keep in the school refrigerator: pancakes filled with rice. 



Greta will eat them only if there is no sticker with her name on the container: stickers, paper and newspapers trigger Greta’s OCD against eating.”



This crazy role reversal in child-raising exonerates the parents and destroys the kids. Sadly, it is a tragedy so easily avoided. 



Authority is confused with destructive authoritarianism when they are not the same thing at all. Traditional child raising clearly defines the role of the parent and the child and establishes boundaries that, far from hindering a child, enable learning and development in a safe environment. Which is something the Thunberg children desperately need.

"Geologists have dubbed Earth’s middle age the “boring billion”. Occurring some 1,800 to 800 million years ago, it has long been considered a period when little happened on Earth in terms of biological evolution, climate, or the chemistry of the oceans and atmosphere. But emerging evidence now suggests that the “boring billion” may have been far more dynamic than that. Our planet has been shaped by many monumental events. From the Cambrian explosion around 540 million years ago, when most animal forms appeared, to the rise and fall of the dinosaurs, the dramatic course of biological evolution is well documented by the fossil record. Similarly, from the glaciations of the most recent ice age, to much earlier “snowball Earth” periods, when the entire planet may have frozen over for millions of years, climate change has left a clear imprint on the geological record. But then we come to the “boring billion”, where the rocks appear to give us startling evidence for, well, not much really. At first glance, the Earth seems to have been stuck in perpetual stasis across this billion year interval. The planet was likely somewhat warmer than today, but there is zero evidence in the rocks for any dramatic change in climate. Oxygen in the atmosphere was stuck at a level much lower than we have today, and indeed much of the global ocean was entirely devoid of oxygen, leading to inhospitable seas that were rich in either iron or toxic hydrogen sulphide (the smelly gas released by rotten eggs).  While the first eukaryotes (cells with a nucleus) had already evolved, the pace of biological evolution appeared to have stalled. Until recently, the most advanced traces of life found at any time through this interval were tiny organic microfossils in aquatic environments, and if you went back in time on safari, you would be confronted by entirely barren landscapes. All of this led the ever-mischievous scientist Roger Buick, in a seminal 1995 publication, to paraphrase Winston Churchill with the immortal line “never in the course of Earth’s history did so little happen to so much for so long”. Apparently inspired, the late palaeontologist Martin Brasier then coined the term “boring billion”, and it is this soundbite that has since become firmly embedded in geological consciousness. But geologists have recently shown renewed interest in this time period (which forms part of what we call the Proterozoic Eon), and I would now argue that the “boring billion” is every bit as exciting and important to understand as anything that happened in the past 500m years of Earth history. If we do not understand periods of relative stasis, then what hope do we have for understanding times of monumental change?  So how does a scientist first get interested in all this? As is often the case, it happened almost by accident. While a PhD student, I spent my time thinking about mud at the bottom of the modern ocean, which tends to be full of the toxic hydrogen sulphide mentioned above. At about the same time, Don Canfield of the University of Southern Denmark started writing about stagnant, stinking, hydrogen sulphide-rich oceans during the “boring billion”. The idea captured my imagination.  So, when an opportunity arose to work with Don I seized the moment and started to attack 1.8 billion year old rocks from the north shore of Lake Superior with some of the tools we were using to understand mud in the modern ocean. The results were cool – we did indeed find clear evidence for widespread stinking oceans devoid of oxygen. But this was just the start. Since then it has become clear that oxygen levels were not static at all during the “boring billion”, and in fact geologists have found clear evidence for intervals of increased oxygen. (Why didn’t this prompt evolution on the scale of the Cambrian? Partly because we are still talking about relatively low levels. But there’s also huge argument among scientists over whether oxygen spurred early animal evolution, or whether the evolution of animals allowed oxygen levels to rise). Paleontologists have also recently begun to identify a much richer tapestry of life across the interval, which includes an increase in the size of seaweed-like algae coincident with rising levels of oxygen. These fossils might not appear as dramatic as the early animals of the Cambrian explosion, but they provide a crucial window into the course of biological evolution on Earth, and help fuel the debate over the importance of oxygen in early evolution. Against the backdrop of these advances, it is also clear that we have only just begun to piece together the enigmatic history of this fascinating time period. We need to look at the rocks with new techniques and new eyes to unravel the subtle clues that they hide. Likewise, new locations housing spectacular fossils are sure to be found. It is fair to expect that in 10 or 20 years we will have a profoundly different perception of the so-called “boring billion”."
"Damien Chazelle, the writer and director of the musical “La La Land,” never had any doubts about Los Angeles as an artistic canvas. From the film’s opening, with commuters dancing and singing on a congested freeway exit ramp, to the visually stunning final sequence, the city is depicted as a place where dreamers may struggle but where optimism also abounds. Growing up in New Jersey, Mr. Chazelle said, “I had some negative conceptions of Los Angeles, but I was willing to try something other than the East Coast because I wanted to do movies. ” He added: “For a few years, there were ups and downs, but I slowly became smitten. I had never lived in a city with palm trees, and now I’ve been here for almost nine and a half years. ” His debut directorial film, “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” was first shown in 2009, followed by the drama “Whiplash” in 2014. Mr. Chazelle, who recently won the 2016 Golden Globe Award for best director for “La La Land,” recently discussed his current film, Los Angeles and some of his travel forays. Below are edited excerpts from that conversation. Q. In famously   Southern California, what logistical issues did you face with the opening scene of “La La Land”? A. After searching for a filming location, we decided on the FasTrak ramp that connects Interstate 105 to Interstate 110, since it would be easier for the city to shut down. We rehearsed in parking lots, and were able to shut down the ramp to film on a Saturday and a Sunday. On both days, there was a heat wave. In the film, Mia and Sebastian, played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, visit the beloved Griffith Observatory. What was it like to shoot there? We were able to film there on a Monday, which is the only day that they’re closed, but you can’t change or touch anything. Filming isn’t allowed in the planetarium at the Griffith, so professional designers built a replica of the actual planetarium on a sound stage. However, we could light the Observatory on the outside. What’s the story behind the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena, where Mia and Sebastian watch the James Dean classic “Rebel Without a Cause”? The theater is used for special events, but it hasn’t been a functioning commercial movie theater in a while. [The Rialto closed in 2007.] It’s a beautiful old structure, inside and outside. What led you to film in nearby Pasadena? Pasadena is really wonderful. The city is one the best places for architecture in the Los Angeles area since so much has been preserved there. The Colorado Street Bridge [which features a scene with Mia and Sebastian] is one of those places. There are also the homes of silent movie stars. Pasadena seemed far away from where I was living. What has traveling been like since you’ve been promoting the movie internationally? There’s been a fair amount of travel. I’ve had a mini East Asia tour the film opens in China and Japan in February. I’d never been to Japan and had been dying to go there forever. My father is French, so I have a lot of relatives in Paris and France, which is nice. France is like a third home. When you’re headed out of town, what do you usually bring? Ever since I was a kid, I have been fond of long train trips. I like the idea of forced sitting time. I always bring a couple of books and headphones, and weigh down a backpack. If I have something to read and music to listen to, I’m fine."

Transcribing the part-time PM’s interviews can be a nightmare. When she is feeling the pressure, words come out rapid fire, which combined with her characteristic sloppy diction makes her very hard to understand. She is also rewriting the English language as we know it, and this guide will help you interpret what she really means.



Ardern invariably goes into attack mode when replying to awkward questions that have the potential to damage her position as leader of the Labour Party, or the party itself. 



The following words and phrases are littered throughout her interviews as hackneyed words and phrases trotted out to bat away awkward questions. The use of them is an indication that she is feeling the pressure. 



Top of the list are the words “again” and “clear.” They are her “go to” phrases in a conversation to gain a few seconds to prepare her railroading defence.



 **“Again” and “As I said”** are common diversions away from incriminating content and also a slur that the interviewer has already asked that question even when they haven’t. 



_Translation: “You weren’t listening to me the first time, were you?”_



 **“Just to be clear”, “I’ve been very clear on this”, “I just want to bring clarity” and “for clarity”.** A diversion used to avoid directly answering a question, and questions the interviewer’s ability to follow the conversation.



 _Translation: “Why are you such an idiot that I have to repeat myself?” and “You are not listening to me”._



 **“Information in the public domain.”** Reminding the interviewer that Ardern is party to information that is not available to us, and as such she gets a get out of jail free card for not being open and transparent. It is used to signal to the interviewer that, “unfortunately”, she is not free to talk about everything. 



_Translation: “Let’s keep talking about this for as long as possible because this is old news where I can’t possibly get into trouble.”_



 **“There is a process in place.”** Another diversion and an attempt to convince the listener of both her importance and capability. It always relates to delegation of duties, which Ardern is expert in. 



_Translation: “Give it a rest, why don’t you, I have this under control.”_ (Actually, she doesn’t and neither does anyone else.)

A neat little legal term rolled out when the proverbial hits the fan but the blame is easily attributed to someone else.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



PNAS has struck again. That’s the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,_ which, according to bibliographic metrics, is the second‐​most influential science journal published in the U.S. _Science_ , from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, is in first place. 



As I have discussed previously (http://​www​.forbes​.com/​s​i​t​e​s​/​p​a​t​r​i​c​k​m​i​c​h​a​e​l​s​/​2​0​1​1​/​0​6​/​1​6​/​p​e​e​r​-​r​e​v​i​e​w​-and-…) the procedures for publishing in PNAS are not those typically associated with rigorous peer‐​review, and much more resemble “pal review”. As a result, sometimes some rather strange papers appear.



A textbook example is this paper by Antonella Zanobetti, Marie O’Neill, Carina Gronlund, and Joel Schwartz.



Zanobetti, from Harvard, and her colleagues attempt to answer the question as to whether or not summer temperature _variability_ —not temperature itself—is associated with an increase in mortality in elderly people with chronic disease.



While the accepted wisdom is that heat waves can lead to elevated mortality (for those unprepared), what is not so widely known, but nonetheless obvious to those who think in economic terms, is that the more frequent high temperature extremes are, the lower the overall rate of heat‐​related mortality becomes. Pure and simple, people adapt.



(The EPA, in its zeal to regulate carbon dioxide, has it completely wrong on this association, claiming that increased heat wave frequency and magnitude constitute endangerment to the public health and welfare, when, in actuality, the data clearly show that more heat leads to a lower heat‐​related morality rate.)



This is obvious from Figure 1, which is taken from some heat‐​related mortality research that I was involved in (Davis et al., 2003). The heat‐​related mortality rate in each of 28 cities across the country for three different decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s) is represented in Figure 1 by a set of three bars plotted at each city’s location on the map. The higher the bars, the greater the heat‐​related mortality.



Note that the cities along the southern tier of the U.S.—the ones with the hottest summers—have much lower rates of heat‐​related mortality than do the cooler cities in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. Where people are used to very high temperatures, they are adept at dealing with them. In the Midwest and the Northeast, where heat waves are rare, more people die.



Note also that the height of the bars in virtually every city is declining with time. In other words, more people died from heat waves in the 1970s than did so in the 1990s—in spite of generally rising summer time temperatures during that period (the mortality trend is indicated by the “+” or “-“ sign below each set of bars). In fact, in many cities across the southern and central portion of the country, there is no bar at all during the 1990s, indicating that heat‐​related mortality was statistically undetectable during that decade. Taken as a whole, the heat‐​related mortality in major U.S. cities declined by 75% across the last decades of the 20th century, despite rising summer temperatures. Clearly, we are adapting well to increased frequency and intensity of heat waves.



The one exception, which proves the adaptational rule, is Seattle—which has the coolest average summers and shows an increase in mortality.









_Figure 1. Annual heat‐​related mortality rates (excess deaths per standard million population on days in which the decadal‐​varying threshold apparent temperature (AT) is equaled or exceeded) by city and decade, and long‐​term trend in summer afternoon AT. Each histogram bar indicates a different decade: from left to right, 1960s‐​1970s, 1980–1989, and 1990–1998. Decades without histogram bars exhibit no threshold ATs and no heat‐​related mortality. Decades with gray bars have mortality rates that are statistically significantly different from the decades indicated by black bars. The average excess deaths across all 28 cities is shown at the lower left. AT trends are indicated beneath each city abbreviation (Davis et al., 2003)._



But there were some interesting questions raised concerning the interpretation of our results—in particular, about the role of temperature variability in shaping our findings. We noted (Davis et al., 2003):



“One current hypothesis is that individuals are stressed during the summer by significant temperature changes, particularly minimum temperatures. High minimum temperature variability has been linked to higher mortality rates in northeastern and northern interior cities.… This observation could partially account for the spatial pattern of decadal mortality declines across the United States, because mortality rates in the 1990s remain elevated in the Northeast and West Coast, where summer temperature variability typically is higher because of air mass changes associated with more frequent frontal passages.



So the idea that temperature variability may give rise to some of the patterns of heat‐​related mortality in the U.S. (also noted in the new Zanobetti paper) is not a new one.



In our work, we did a cursory examination as to whether changes in summer temperature variability over our study period may have influenced our results. But we found that in only three of the 28 cities we examined, was there a statistically significant trend in temperature variability (an increasing trend in two cities and a decreasing trend in another) over our study period (the early 1960s to the late 1990s). Thus we concluded that changes in temperature variability were largely absent in our data and therefore “played little role in the observed mortality declines.”



Zanobetti and colleagues report otherwise.



They used a fairly complicated methodology to determine that there is an association between high intraseason temperature variability and the survivorship of a cohort of elderly, previously ill persons. Greater day‐​to‐​day temperature variability during the summer led to more mortality in their subset of the elderly population.



However, Zanobetti et al. found that the association was only statistically significant in the portions of the country with the lowest average summer season day‐​to‐​day temperature variability (typically the southern portions of the country—their zones 4 and 5 in Figure 2).









_Figure 2. Climate zones (in colors) used by Zanobetti et al. and the level of day‐​to‐​day variability in summer temperatures in each city studied (the degree of shading in each circle). Open circles indicate lower degrees of temperature variability than darkly shaded circles (from Zanobetti et al., 2012)._



Table 1 is a breakdown of their results for the different climate zones when the temperature variability for a particular summer is 1°C above normal. “HR is the “hazard ratio”, including the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the HR value. If the 95% CI includes the value of 1.0, then there is no statistically significant difference from the average mortality. The climate zones are numbered 1 to 5 with climate zone 1 typically characterized by more summer day‐​to‐​day temperature variability than climate zone 5 (see figure 2). The different elderly population cohorts with pre‐​existing medical conditions are listed as CHF (congestive heart failure), MI (myocardial infarction), diabetes, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).









The take‐​home message from these results is that only in climate zones 4 and 5 (the zones with the _least_ amount of average daily summertime temperature variability) is there a statistically significant reduction in survivorship when the variability is 1°C above average. This suggests that people in cities that typically experience a high degree of day‐​to‐​day temperature variability during the summer are better adapted to extremes in temperature variability than those people living in cities where day‐​to‐​day temperature variability is low. Just as is the case with heat waves, more exposure leads to less susceptibility.



Pretty straightforward. Here is how Zanobetti et al. sum things up:



“Our data suggest that long‐​term increases in temperature variability may increase the risk of mortality in different subgroups of susceptible older populations.”



Huh? 



“Taken together, our present findings and previous evidence suggest that summer temperature variability could plausibly impair the health and shorten the life expectancy of older adults, particularly those with chronic medical conditions… A 1 °C increase in temperature [variability] is a plausible increase in some regions. Based on our findings, this increase in temperature [variability] would increase all‐​cause mortality in our MI cohort by 5%, for example. Based on an average of 270,000 deaths per year across all four cohorts, a 5% increase in mortality would correspond to ~14,000 additional deaths per year due to an increase in temperature variability in the United States.”



Come again?



“In addition to an increase in temperature, climate models predict an increase in summer temperature variability in mid‐​latitude Northern Hemisphere land areas, which may be a major public health concern.”



That is just the opposite to what a more enlightened view of their results suggest.



Zanobetti et al.’s data pretty clearly show that cities with a climate characterized by high summer temperature variability have _lower_ rates of mortality in the cohorts they studied. This should lead directly to the conclusion that if climate change were to result in increasing summer temperature variability, then there should be a reduction in the mortality rate as the population becomes better adapted to higher temperature variability.



Instead, the authors conclude the opposite, the paper appears in the pal‐​reviewed PNAS, and headlines are made—global warming to kill more people.



Such is the state of climate “science” these days.

How much pressure would it take before you would sell out your intellectual integrity? Those who are given responsibilities for developing and promoting sound public policy are subject to never‐​ending pressure by those in the political class to serve them rather than the public.



An extraordinarily well‐​researched and provocative paper has just been released, tracing how the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a major international organization, descended from promoting trade‐ and job‐​creation policies among the nations of the world to one that is supporting job‐​destroying tax cartels for the benefit of the high‐​tax countries. The paper, “Cartelizing Taxes: Understanding the OECD’s Campaign Against ‘Harmful Tax Competition,’ ” was clearly and interestingly written by law and economics scholar Andrew Morriss of the University of Alabama and Swedish economic researcher Lotta Moberg of George Mason University. The authors conducted many interviews and used primary and secondary sources to support their disturbing conclusions.



The paper documents how the OECD drifted from its original goals into an organization that is undercutting the rationale for its existence. Mr. Morriss states, “The puzzle we set out to explore is why the OECD, an organization devoted to promoting economic growth for much of its existence, would start promoting tax policies that reduce economic growth.” The paper shows that “central to the OECD critique of tax competition was the claim that attracting investment was an illegitimate criterion for evaluating tax policy, even though creating an attractive investment climate was treated as a legitimate goal in other policy areas by the OECD.” The authors note, “The most objectionable feature of the OECD’s expansion of its mission was its effort to impose its standards on jurisdictions that had no voice in the creation of the standards through the blacklist.” Again, Mr. Morriss comments: “There is something particularly galling about people sitting in Paris, getting hefty tax‐​free salaries [also true of those working for the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other international organizations] paid by the rest of us, spending their time telling the rest of the world to pay higher taxes.” Finally, perhaps most frightening of all, as Ms. Moberg notes, “The ongoing project against tax competition can be seen in a larger perspective of international organizations moving into areas of international regulation, if not by legal means then by peer pressure and norm setting.”



What we are seeing is the growth of international, non‐​elected bureaucracies that hack away at our liberties and economic freedoms, destroying jobs and opportunity, all in the name of redistributionist and “tax‐​fairness” schemes. In the case of the OECD, the United States is funding approximately a quarter of its budget. Citizens ought to be asking members of Congress why their precious taxpayer dollars are being wasted on an organization that is now promoting and mandating destructive economic policies.



But international organizations aren’t the only ones that are destroying jobs and economic opportunity in the name of tax fairness. The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service are considering regulations that could cost Americans millions of jobs. One of the regulations being developed stems from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which was passed by Congress in 2010. FATCA would impose a 30 percent tax on the investment in the United States of any foreign financial institution, including a bank, if it had any unreported U.S. citizen or green card holder contributing to the pool of money invested. Furthermore, the foreign financial institution’s officers could be subject to civil and criminal charges for making such an investment. In an era of common dual citizenships, it is impossible for a foreign financial institution to know for certain whether any of its clients is a U.S. taxpayer (i.e., citizen, green card holder, etc.). Thus, foreign financial institutions in Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere are pulling their investments out of the United States right at the time when the U.S. needs all of the job‐​creating foreign investment it can get.



Sen. Carl Levin, Michigan Democrat, and the other economic‐​know‐​nothings who proposed these measures claim — without any basis in fact — that the United States is losing $100 billion annually because of foreign account tax avoidance or evasion. Private foreign investment in the U.S. is about $14 trillion. So $100 billion is less than 1 percent of the private foreign investment, yet the mental midgets in Congress and the administration are willing to risk trillions of dollars in job‐​creating foreign investment in exchange for a phony $100 billion. Well over 10 million American jobs are at risk because of this foolishness.



It gets worse. The Treasury and IRS have yet to do a cost‐​benefit study of FATCA, but final regulations are being developed. In the private sector, executives who so failed at their fiduciary responsibilities would be fired, perhaps fined or even sent to jail. But members of Congress and the executive branch are most unlikely to pay any penalty for risking perhaps 20 to 40 jobs for each job they might, theoretically, save. By the way, many of the senators and congressmen who brought you FATCA are the same ones who want to continue to fund the OECD. Mr. President, if you really care about jobs in the way you say you do, why are you not calling for the repeal of FATCA and reining in Mr. Levin, his colleagues and your own Treasury secretary, who are in the process of endangering far more existing jobs than any of your questionable jobs proposals could possibly create?

"He is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3, 500. Perhaps that’s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump  —   and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry  —   has quietly become the most   reading material on Wall Street. He is Seth A. Klarman, the    value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion. While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as “The Oracle of Boston,” where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised. In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing “perilously high valuations. ” “Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from   protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,” he wrote. “President Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,” he continued. “While they might be popular, the reason the U. S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don’t work, they actually leave society worse off. ” In particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of   policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump’s stimulus efforts “could prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors. ” And he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy’s growth over the long term. “The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,” Mr. Klarman wrote. “The large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today’s artificially low levels. ” Much of Mr. Klarman’s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump’s leadership style. He described it this way: “The erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound  . ” He also linked this point  —   which is a fair one  —   to what “Trump style” means for Mr. Klarman’s constituency and others. “The big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,” he wrote. “Not only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he’s apparently deliberately so he says it’s part of his plan. ” While Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, “If things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst. ” Mr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner. While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: “His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president. ” In his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. “Despite my preference to stay out of the media,” he wrote, “I’ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander. ” From the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund’s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years. What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election  —   about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet  —   wrongly so far  —   that the stock market would fall he lost about $1 billion. Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes  —   he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard  Poor’s index  —   he blamed the influx of money into the industry. “With any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,” Mr. Klarman wrote. “No surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured. ” He continued, “To many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product. ” The lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity. Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes  —   at least that finance geeks will appreciate  —   is what he says is the irony that investors now “have gotten excited about   index funds and exchange traded funds (E. T. F. s) that mimic various market or sector indices. ” He says he sees big trouble ahead in this area  —   or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit. “One of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E. T. F. activity is that it will tend to ‘lock in’ today’s relative valuations between securities,” Mr. Klarman wrote. “When money flows into an index fund or   E. T. F. the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),” he wrote. “Thus today’s   companies are likely to also be tomorrow’s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings. ” To Mr. Klarman, “stocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it. ” “This should give   value investors a distinct advantage,” he wrote. “The inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become. ” How Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here’s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: “In matters of style, swim with the current in matters of principle, stand like a rock. ”"

Romm must be fuming. After disappearing his formerly independent “Climate Progress” blog and merging it with the main Think Progress website, where he’s lucky to get a dozen comments a day. His parent organization, Think Progress, utterly fails to mention The Most Important Issue of All Time as a top issue for 2013. Oooh, that’s gotta hurt.


This morning, 31 December 2012, Think Progress provided 12 Progressive Resolutions for 2013. From better drug policy to immigration reform to enacting gun safety laws, many interesting (if not outright good) items in this list. Again, however, the telling thing is the absence of a critical set of issues.
Amid these 12, no (zero, nada, nilch) reference to climate change, the climate cliff, environment, clean energy, green jobs, energy efficiency, fossil fuel impacts on the political system, …

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe green energy orgy in Germany is over. The music has stopped and the wine that once flowed freely has long run out. The green energy whores and pimps can go home.
In a stunning admission by Germany’s Economics Minister and Vice Chancellor to Angela Merkel, Sigmar Gabriel announced in a recent speech that the country’s once highly ballyhooed transformation to renewable energy, the so called Energiewende, a model that has been adopted by a number of countries worldwide, is “on the verge of failure“.

Speaking at an event at SMA Solar, Germany’s leading manufacturer of solar technology, Gabriel even dropped yet another admission bomb:
The truth is that in all fields we under-estimated the complexity of the Energiewende.”
Gabriel is not only the national economics minister and vice chancellor to Angela Merkel, he is also head of Germany’s socialist SPD party, which is now the coalition partner in Angela Merkel’s CDU/SPD grand coalition government. Moreover Gabriel was once the country’s environment minister and a devout believer in global warming and in Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth.
In the speech Gabriel tells the audience how the energy transformation is on the verge of failure:
Those who are the engines of the transformation to renewable energies, that’s you, you don’t see how close we are to the failure of the energy transformation.”
Gabriel says that major reforms are thus unavoidable, and he calls efforts for energy consumers to get off the grid “pure madness”. That’s not what they want after all. Gabriel is now calling on companies who produce green energy for their own use to ante up as well:

The complete exemption from paying feed-in tariffs is a model that is wonderful for you as a business model, but is one that is a problem for everyone else.”
The solar energy audience reacts with dead, stunned silence (3:03). That can’t believe what they just heard.
The mood at SMA Solar, which has been a huge benefactor of the renewable energy subsidies brought on by Germany’s EEG feed-in act, was somber and shock and Gabriel delivered the reality. Many in attendance seemed unable to fathom what Gabriel was unloading: the heady days at the green energy feeding trough are over – live with it.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here writes:
The responsible persons in attendance at the Hessen-based photovoltaic SMA Solar and all the other profiteers of the EEG feed-in act saw their jaws drop when this late and blunt admission was made.”
That Gabriel would make such comments can only tell us that the situation and the costs surrounding the Energiewende must be far more dire than most of us realize.
Germany’s renewable energy gravy train has derailed for good. Other countries take note!
Finally, give credit to Gabriel for not shying away from what needs to be done and for taking the responsibilities as economics minister very seriously. Finally a person in power who gets it!
Other reading: Even media now mocking failed Energiewende.

Earlier this month, I detailed at some length why claims about the purported economic harms of piracy, offered by supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT-IP Act (PIPA), ought to be treated with much more skepticism than they generally get from journalists and policymakers. My own view is that this ought to be rather secondary to the policy discussion: SOPA and PIPA would be ineffective mechanisms for addressing the problem, and a terrible idea for many other reasons, even if the numbers were exactly right. No matter how bad last season's crops were, witch burnings are a poor policy response. Fortunately, legislators finally seem to be cottoning on to this: SOPA now appears to be on ice for the time being, and PIPA's own sponsors are having second thoughts about mucking with the Internet's Domain Name System.   
  
That said, I remain a bit amazed that it's become an indisputable premise in Washington that there's an enormous piracy problem, that it's having a devastating impact on U.S. content industries, and that _some_ kind of aggressive new legislation is needed _tout suite_ to stanch the bleeding. Despite the fact that the Government Accountability Office recently concluded that it is ""difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the net effect of counterfeiting and piracy on the economy as a whole,"" our legislative class has somehow determined that—among all the dire challenges now facing the United States— _this_ is an urgent priority. Obviously, there's quite a lot of copyrighted material circulating on the Internet without authorization, and other things equal, one would like to see less of it. But does the best available evidence show that this is inflicting such catastrophic economic harm—that it is depressing so much output, and destroying so many jobs—that Congress has no option but to Do Something immediately? Bearing the GAO's warning in mind, the data we _do_ have doesn't remotely seem to justify the DEFCON One rhetoric that now appears to be obligatory on the Hill.   
  
The International Intellectual Property Alliance—a kind of meta-trade association for all the content industries, and a zealous prophet of the piracy apocalypse, released a report back in November meant to establish that copyright industries are so economically valuable that they merit more vigorous government protection. But it actually paints a picture of industries that, far from being ""killed"" by piracy, are _already_ weathering a harsh economic climate better than most, and have far outperformed the overall U.S. economy through the current recession. The ""core copyright industries"" have, unsurprisingly, shed some jobs over the past few years, but again, compared with the rest of the economy, employment seems to have held relatively stable at a time when you might expect cash-strapped consumers to be turning to piracy to save money.   
  
Since the core function of copyright is to incentivize the production of creative works, it's also worth looking for signs of declining output associated with filesharing. Empirically, it's surprisingly hard to find an effect. Rather, a recent survey study by Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business School concluded that ""data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers"" from producing more works, at least in the U.S. market.   
  
So, for instance, Nielsen SoundScan data shows new album releases stood at 35,516 in 2000, peaked at 106,000 in 2008, and (amidst a general recession) fell back to mid-decade levels of about 75,000 for 2010. That's against a general background of falling sales since 2004—mostly explained by factors unrelated to piracy—which finally seems to have reversed in 2011. The actual picture is probably somewhat better than that, because SoundScan data are markedly incomplete when it comes to the releases by indie artists who've benefited most from the rise of digital distribution.   




If we look at movies, the numbers compiled by the industry statistics site Box Office Mojo show an average of 558 releases from American studios over the past decade, which rises to 578 if you focus on just the past five years. The average for the _previous_ decade—before illicit movie downloads were even an option on most people's radar—is 472 releases per year. (As we learn from a recent Congressional Research Service report, it's weirdly hard to detect a strong overall correlation between output and employment in the motion picture industry, which actually fell slightly from 1998 to 2008, even as profits and CEO pay soared. One reason the growing trend in recent decades for ""Hollywood"" features to actually be produced in Canada or Australia.)   
  
That's all very nice, one might object, but wouldn't these heartening numbers be _even higher_ if labels and studios could recapture some of the revenue lost to illicit downloads? Well, they surely _might_ —but it's not nearly as clear as you'd think.   
  
One reason is that they already _are_ recapturing much of that revenue through ""complementary"" purchases. As Oberholzer-Gee observes, recording industry numbers show large increases in concert revenues corresponding to the drop in recorded music sales. That suggests that, as people discover new artists by sampling downloaded albums online, they're shifting consumption _within_ the sector to live performances. In other words, people have a roughly constant ""music budget,"" and what they don't spend on the albums they've downloaded gets spent on seeing that new band they discovered. For the firms that specifically make their money from the sale of recordings, that may seem like cold comfort, but if we're concerned with the _music_ industry as a whole, it's a wash. Something similar might occur with respect to purchases of merchandise based on licensed film properties.   
  
Another factor is that, notwithstanding projections of a ""long tail"" effect resulting from lower search and distribution costs in the digital era, most entertainment industries continue to operate on a ""tournament"" or ""lottery"" model, where a few hits generate jackpot revenues, sufficient to make up for losses on the majority of new products. Unsurprisingly, the most heavily pirated movies each year tend to be the ones that are also highly successful at the box office and in DVD sales, with similar patterns in album downloads. In other words, bleeding revenue to piracy is going to be a problem to the extent that your product is a hit, in a market where the core uncertainty about this crucial fact (at the time when the decision whether to greenlight production is made) looms a lot larger than the marginal loss from illicit downloads if you _are_ successful.   
  
It's a tricky but more or less tractable problem to estimate roughly how many full-time jobs you'll need regionally to support one additional $150 million movie production next year. It's a totally different question how aggregate sectoral employment in a volatile and evolving industry changes based on investor responses to a $150 million across-the-board drop in the size of the total film jackpot, especially given that arcane financial arrangements are one place Hollywood does show a genius for constantly adapting its business model. If you want to know how many people are getting laid off when McDonald's revenues drop, it makes a difference whether it's each of 13,000 franchises earning $100 less per year, or one franchise earning $1.3 million less, even though the total reduction is the same.   
  
Finally, _more demand for content_ being captured by the content industries is not always the same thing as _demand for more content_ , in the sense of ""a greater variety of output."" I noted earlier that the past few years have seen a significant spike in the number of movie titles released annually. But as the _Los Angeles Times_ reported in 2008, studio executives soon began complaining about a ""glut"" of new movies, many of which were targeted at the same demographics, and therefore cannibalizing their own audiences. As one executive suggested, that meant that (at least in a market dominated by a few huge distributors) releasing _fewer_ titles could yield higher profits—and, indeed, the number of titles released in the following two years dropped back to mid-decade levels. The key point here is that shifting some portion of the pirate audience to some form of legal viewing doesn't necessarily change this basic calculus, because there's an upper bound to the number of hours most people are going to spend watching (say) racing movies, whether they're paying for the privilege or not. Rising demand can just as easily, for instance, bid up star salaries for a fixed number of films.   
  
The point here isn't that piracy by American consumers is somehow completely independent from output or employment rates in the content industries—though, again, that's not at all the same thing as the _overall U.S. employment rate_. Obviously, at _some_ level it has to have some effect. But the link is, to use the technical economic term, _weirder_ than in many other sectors of the economy. In many industries, the relationship between consumer spending and job creation is _relatively_ straightforward. If demand for widgets or restaurant meals rises, satisfying that demand requires a roughly linear increase in widget factories and restaurants, in hiring of widget-makers and cooks and waiters, and in purchases of the raw material inputs for those goods. Distribution of copyrighted content—and in particular digital distribution over the Internet—is a bit more complicated, for precisely the same reason piracy is an issue: once the first copy of a work has been created, an unlimited number of additional units (of the digital product) can be produced at effectively zero cost.   
  
Let's imagine, implausibly, that a measure like SOPA _did_ manage to reduce online piracy by U.S. consumers by some meaningful amount. A small potion of that reduction, the minority of downloads representing legal purchases displaced by file sharing, would translate into sales for the content industries. What form would these take? It seems reasonable to suppose that the majority of people who were previously getting their music and movies from The Pirate Bay are not typically lining up to buy shiny plastic discs at Wal-Mart. Rather, they're probably disproportionately displacing _legal digital downloads_ from venues like iTunes and Amazon, or subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, which are pretty clearly where the overall market is quickly going anyway. (Apparently, literal thieves don't even bother stealing physical media anymore.) For movies, there's probably also some displacement of theatrical ticket sales, though as the theatrical experience is in many ways a distinct good, it's hard to say how much substitution it's reasonable to expect.   
  
In the very short term, increased legal purchases of digital content wouldn't seem likely to generate many additional jobs. If spending in the physical retail sector jumps 20 percent, shops need to hire more clerks, and their suppliers more manufacturing workers, to meet the increased demand. If spending in the iTunes store jumps 20 percent, Apple probably needs to pay a few bucks more for bandwidth and electricity, but basically everyone just gets to smile and pocket the extra profit. The jobs effects estimates we're seeing tossed around, however, are coming from a 2007 study that would have had to employ, at the most recent, adjustments made several years before _that_ to the benchmark multipliers the Bureau of Economic Analysis developed in 2002. Even leaving aside its many other problems, then, the job impact estimates in that study would have been largely based on legacy assumptions from a brick-and-mortar economy. (The loss estimates relied on would also, necessarily, fail to account for the recent rise of popular, legal streaming services that have likely lured many consumers back from the pirate market. There is, alas, no very good data here, but I'd wager Hulu and Netflix have done exponentially more to reduce piracy losses than enforcement crackdowns ever will.) In any event, you'd expect the most _immediate_ effect of consumer spending shifts from widgets and restaurants to digital downloads would be, if anything, fewer _net_ jobs. The output and employment effects, rather, would show up in the longer term as lower returns reduce incentives to produce new content—and hire the workers needed to support that production. For some of the reasons discussed above, though, empirically there's just not much evidence for a dramatic effect of this kind.   
  
No doubt piracy is costing the content industries _something_ —or they wouldn't be throwing so much money at Congress in support of this kind of legislation. If we could wave a magic wand and have less piracy, obviously that would be good. But in the real world, where enforcement has direct costs to the taxpayer, regulation has costs on the industries it burdens, and the reduction in piracy they're likely to produce is very small, it seems important to point out that the credible evidence for the _magnitude_ of the harm is fairly thin. As a rough analogy, since antipiracy crusaders are fond of equating filesharing with shoplifting: suppose the CEO of Wal-Mart came to Congress demanding a $50 million program to deploy FBI agents to frisk suspicious-looking teens in towns near Wal-Marts. A lawmaker might, without for one instant doubting that shoplifiting is a bad thing, question whether this is really the optimal use of federal law enforcement resources. The CEO indignantly points out that shoplifting _kills one million adorable towheaded orphans_ each year. The proof is right here in this study by the Wal-Mart Institute for Anti-Shoplifting Studies. The study sources this dramatic claim to a newspaper article, which quotes the CEO of Wal-Mart asserting (on the basis of private data you can't see) that shoplifting kills hundreds of orphans annually. And as a footnote explains, it seemed prudent to round up to a million. I wish this were _just_ a joke, but as readers of my previous post will recognize, that's literally about the level of evidence we're dealing with here.   
  
In short, piracy is certainly one problem in a world filled with problems. But politicians and journalists seem to have been persuaded to take it largely on faith that it's a uniquely dire and pressing problem that demands dramatic remedies with little time for deliberation. On the data available so far, though, reports of the death of the industry seem much exaggerated.

"**Wales is ready and waiting to roll out a Covid vaccination programme within days, say officials in Wales.**
It follows mounting speculation that UK regulators are ready to approve at least one of the vaccines being reviewed.
They have been reviewing data on three vaccines for emergency approval for use.
A decision could come as early as Wednesday and First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales was prepared.
Speaking at a Covid briefing, Mr Drakeford said: ""Last week, the NHS in Wales carried out a large and successful test of all the practical things, which will need to be in place once a vaccine is given the go-ahead.""
He added that this ""could be as early as this week and we will be ready for it"".
On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a laboratory in Wrexham, which is gearing up to produce the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine if it is approved.
The Wockhardt UK lab has the capability to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine a year and preparations to produce 150,000 vials a day of the vaccine have been under way for weeks.
Mr Johnson said it could provide ""salvation for humanity"" when it starts producing coronavirus vaccines.
Trials have shown the Wrexham vaccine to be between 62% and 90% effective in protecting against Covid-19.
It is the cheapest of the vaccines being considered, and can be stored at normal fridge temperatures.
But the vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech is also being scrutinised by regulators, and could also get early approval.
Moderna are also hoping to get the go-ahead in the US and Europe for its vaccine.
The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines:
Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be amongst the first to receive the vaccines when they are approved.
The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority:
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19."

President Obama is presiding over what may prove to be the most significant round of trade liberalization in American history, yet he has never once made an affirmative case for that outcome. Despite various reports of intensifying outreach to members of Congress, the president's ""advocacy"" is couched in enough skepticism to create and reinforce fears about trade and globalization.



Politico reports:



On Tuesday, Obama sent a letter directly to Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), arguing that reaching new trade agreements is the only way to stop China from dominating the global markets and letting its lax standards run the world.



""If they succeed, our competitors would be free to ignore basic environmental and labor standards, giving them an unfair advantage against American workers,"" Obama wrote Gallego in a letter obtained by POLITICO. ""We can’t let that happen. We should write the rules, and level the playing field for the middle class.""





Certainly, playing the China card could help win support for Trade Promotion Authority and, eventually, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but it needn't be the first selling point. Pitching trade agreements as though they were innoculations from an otherwise imminent disease betrays a profound lack of understanding of the benefits of trade. With TPP near completion and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks expected to accelerate, the president’s stubborn refusal to make an affirmative case for his trade initiatives to the public and the skeptics in his party is disconcerting. Bill Watson was troubled by the president's feeble advocacy of trade liberalization in his SOTU address.



Does Obama really want a legacy as the president who increased Americans’ economic liberties and opportunities when the best case he can muster for his agenda is that if we don’t adopt it we’ll get crushed? I have questioned whether he supports his own trade agenda considering -- among other things -- his commitment to arresting climate change and growing income inequality, both of which he believes are exacerbated by increased trade.

Never has the president described how the TPP will better integrate U.S. producers, consumers, workers, investors and taxpayers with customers, suppliers, supply-chain collaborators, and investors in Asia and the Americas. Never has he explained that by eliminating tariffs and other monopolistic impediments to trade and investment, the TPP will help increase the scope for economies of scale and specialization, which will help reduce production costs, freeing resources for lower prices, investment, and research and development. Never has he taken the time to point out that competition inspires innovation, which especially benefits companies operating in the United States, which are advantaged with privileged access to research universities and broad and deep capital markets to commercialize innovation. Never has he mentioned that by opening the door to more competition to bid on public procurement projects, the TPP will help ensure higher quality infrastructure, on-time completion, and better use of taxpayer dollars. Never has he touted the advantages to the U.S. economy of tighter integration with the world’s fastest growing region. None of these positive, promising, pioneering aspects of the TPP has been given an ounce of public attention from the president. 

Some Washington insiders will be sure to contact Bill or me to say it doesn’t matter how Obama portrays trade, as long as he gets enough votes. Well, sure, I understand the transactional nature of politics. But if you don’t try to convince anyone of the merits of trade, if you allow to lay unrebutted, to fester and metastasize, the fallacies concocted by the monopolies who benefit from restricting trade, it serves to legitimize those fears and guarantees a continuation of misinformation and discord where there should be much less.

"**There were 223 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales registered in the latest week.**
This is 33 more than the previous week and accounts for 26.3% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
There were 65 deaths across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area - 44 in hospital - in the week to 20 November.
There were 58 deaths in care homes involving Covid-19 - the highest weekly number since mid May.
Eleven of the deaths were in care homes in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), nine in Neath Port Talbot and six in the Vale of Glamorgan.
There were 47 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, across all settings, 38 deaths in Swansea Bay, 21 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 23 in Cardiff and Vale.
There were 21 deaths in Hywel Dda - more than double the figure last week - and eight deaths involving Powys residents, five of them in hospital.
The total weekly deaths is the highest since the start of May.
Meanwhile, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board have reported another 27 deaths related to hospital infections in the last week.
There were eight more deaths in both Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals, and nine at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend.
It takes the total number of deaths to 204.
There have been more than 700 cases linked to the outbreaks, although the rise in cases has slowed down.
So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average.
Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a reliable measure of the impact of the pandemic.
In Wales, the number of deaths increased from 742 to 848 in the latest week, which was 195 deaths (29.9%) higher than the five-year average for that week.
Altogether, there have now been a total of 851 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 20 November, making up 24.6% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.
There have been 20 care home deaths in recent weeks in Llangollen but only two deaths in Denbighshire were registered in time for the latest figures.
The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 13 November was 3,464 deaths.
When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 3,536 deaths up to 20 November.
RCT, with 503 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales so far in the pandemic. Cardiff has had 442 including the latest week.
Ceredigion has the lowest number of deaths but the total rose by eight in a week to 23. Neither Anglesey or Gwynedd had a death registered involving Covid in the most recent week.
The deaths involving Covid include both suspected and confirmed cases and where Covid is a factor - although it is estimated in 90% of cases the virus is the underlying cause of death.
Unlike Public Health Wales' daily reporting of deaths, this also includes deaths in people's homes, all care homes and hospices."
"**A 10-year-old boy has gone back to school for the first time since March after his family won the right for him to wear a facemask in lessons.**
Kieron said he wanted to wear the mask when at school to protect his father, who has diabetes.
But the headteacher at All Saints Primary School in Friskney, Lincolnshire, said he should not wear a mask in school.
A panel of independent school governors has backed the family's case.
Kieron's full name and those of his parents are not being disclosed by the BBC, in order to help protect the family's identity.
The youngster's parents had their son at home since the first lockdown was announced in March.
The couple did not feel safe sending Kieron back when schools initially reopened, and undertook to continue home education.
In early October the school contacted the family to make a plan for his return, but in a letter dated 8 October said: ""We do hope Kieron returns tomorrow but it must be without a face covering in accordance to the guidance provided.""
The school's head, Charles Daniels, told the family in his letter: ""School is following the advice and guidance from the Department for Education, Lincolnshire County Council, Public Health England and Lincolnshire.
""Until the school receives different advice from those organisations then the school policy remains that primary aged pupils do not wear face coverings on school premises.""
But after an appeal to the independent governors Kieron returned to the school wearing a mask on Tuesday.
His father said: ""We think it's utter madness, at a time when everyone is screaming, 'wear a mask, wear a mask', the school says 'don't wear a mask, you can't come in'.
""Every child that wears a mask in the classroom is helping to keep Covid away.""
The school governors said: ""We believe the best place for our pupils is in the classroom.
""Having met with Kieron's parents to discuss the matter, we are pleased to report that he has returned to school.
""It has been agreed that Kieron can wear a mask in class as long as he meets the school's expectations for managing its use.""

"People have fallen in love with their Instant Pots. They may like their blenders, cherish their slow cookers and need their food processors. But the Instant Pot  —   a device that combines an electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker in one handy unit  —   sends even   cooks into fits of passion. You find the “L” word over and over in the 15, 000 or so product reviews on Amazon. And if you click over to Instant Pot’s Facebook community page, you’ll find more than 360, 000 members sharing their undying affection alongside their recipes for chili. (A typical post: “I’m having an affair. My husband said he wished he would have never given me the Instant Pot for Christmas. ”) If you’re a cook and got through last year without bumping into people who couldn’t stop talking about their Instant Pots  —   or any of the other multifunctional electric pressure cookers on the market (Breville and Cuisinart both make versions)  —   then you won’t have to wait much longer. Electric pressure cookers is one of the fastest growing kitchen appliance sectors on the market, with sales doubling and tripling over the last four years, according to Robert Wang, the C. E. O. of Instant Pot Company. When the Instant Pot debuted in 2009, it was one of the first brands to hit North America electric pressure cookers were already gaining popularity in China. In 2010, approximately 300, 000 electric pressure cookers were sold in the United States and Canada, said Dr. Wang. By 2015, that number rose to over three million. (He declined to give exact sales figures, as did representatives from Breville and Cuisinart.) The majority of Instant Pots are sold on Amazon. More than 215, 000 units were sold on Amazon Prime Day 2016, in July, when Prime members get discounts on select items, outperforming any other product on the site. Two different models of the Instant Pot currently sit in the top 10 list of Amazon best sellers in the Kitchen and Dining category. So why do electric pressure cookers inspire such a devoted following? I bought one to find out. A confession: I already own a stovetop pressure cooker, the conventional kind that you would heat over a burner and then regulate yourself. It is currently supporting a colony of dust bunnies in the back of my highest cabinet, behind the panini press. I never got over my fear of exploding   soup to use it with any regularity. What makes this newest generation of electric pressure cookers different is that it is designed with a slew of   safety features, including sensors to monitor the unit’s temperature and amount of pressure. All you do is plug it in and tap a button, and it does everything else. It’s as   as a slow cooker  —   except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster. The promise of a fast, fresh homemade meal is a pressure cooker’s greatest appeal, said Lorna Sass, author of four pioneering cookbooks on pressure cooking, including “Pressure Perfect. ” “It doesn’t matter if you’re Paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better, pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food,” Ms. Sass said. After cooking a pork shoulder in the electric pressure cooker, I could easily see why the appliance has struck a chord, with the Paleo community in particular: It cooks large hunks of meat superbly and speedily. After a mere 90 minutes, the meat was spoon tender and deeply flavored, even before I covered the soft shreds with spicy barbecue sauce. The same recipe made in my slow cooker took seven hours, and the meat wasn’t quite as uniformly juicy. It was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer. I continued to play, spending six weeks experimenting with the Instant Pot and a second electric pressure cooker, the Breville Fast Slow Pro. These are the two models recommended by my colleagues at The Sweethome, a product review site owned by The New York Times Company that put six electric pressure cookers through their paces. In terms of performance, I found the two to be more or less the same. Lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes, short ribs fell off the bone in 30, and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes. Perhaps most convenient, the   beef bone broth that took two days to cook down in my slow cooker was ready in an afternoon, without making the whole house smell like soup (which is nice for the first couple of hours but then gets really old). But the electric pressure cooker does have its shortcomings. The most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken. The recipes I tested came out with slack and soggy skin, and either stringy and dry white meat or undercooked dark meat. I did have more success with   skinless chicken breasts, which were evenly cooked and perfumed with the delicate rice wine and fresh ginger. A nice dish, though how often does one really want to eat steamed skinless chicken breasts? I didn’t like it much for vegetables either, most of which don’t benefit from the intense pressure of   steam (beets and artichokes being the important exceptions here). Broccoli, kale, zucchini, fennel, brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing. They also took longer to cook than if I had used a skillet on the stove. The manual tells you an ingredient only needs, say, five minutes to cook, but that doesn’t take into account the 10 to 15 minutes required for the machine to build pressure, in addition to the time needed to release the pressure, which brings the total to around 20 minutes. I can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet, some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes. In general, this is a good rule of thumb: If something takes 20 minutes or less to cook conventionally on the stove, use the stove. Another pressure cooker downside: They just don’t do crisp or crunchy. Although most cookers allow you to brown meats and vegetables on the sauté function before cooking, any crunchy bits will wilt under the pressurized steam once you lock on the lid. Though I might use the pressure cooker for potatoes if I were going to mash them, I would never be able to achieve anything like the   roasted potatoes I can get in the oven. And in the future, I’ll stick to roasting my whole chickens, so I can crunch on the shards of browned, salty skin. The key to pressure cooker happiness is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal, and which traditionally take hours to get there. For example, I’ll never go back to a Dutch oven for chili, which I made in the electric pressure cooker in an hour starting from dried beans. Same goes for my favorite red lentil soup. Although I didn’t save any time when I tested it, I adored the convenience of not having to watch a pot on the stove. I could turn the pressure cooker on, then go for a run. When I got home, my soup was ready  —   a good thing since I was starving. And it’s amazing for chickpeas, which take an hour all told instead of the usual three to four hours for unsoaked beans. “People want to use their pressure cookers for everything, but they’re better for some things than others,” Ms. Sass said. “Stick to soups, stews, beans and risotto. It makes fabulous risotto. ” I’d have to agree Ms. Sass’s recipe for porcini mushroom risotto with peas is excellent, adaptable and about as easy as dinner gets (once you source the dried porcinis and arborio rice, that is). I also like the machine for polenta, which eliminates the stirring (and the splatters of molten blobs). But perhaps the biggest pressure cooker joy I found was for something as simple as   eggs. They didn’t cook faster, but even fresh eggs from the farmers’ market peeled effortlessly, without ending up pockmarked and riddled with craters the way they do when I boil them in a pot. This is because the pressure helps inflate the air pocket between the cooked white and the shell, which makes separating the two go more smoothly. I also tried out some of the other functions, including the slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker settings. The unit worked as well as my separate,   slow cooker, though I can see a future in which I   more, and   less the results are similar, but one is a whole lot faster. For cooking rice, I preferred both the brown and white rice I made in my separate rice cooker. The pressure cooker was faster, but the rice a bit heavier and chewier. And for yogurt, which I’d gotten into the habit of making every other week on the stove, I have to admit that the machine worked like a dream. So after all that cooking, did I fall in love with the electric pressure cooker? It takes up a lot of space, it’s not at all intuitive, and I hate not being able to check on my food as it cooks. But even so, I don’t plan on giving mine up anytime soon. My friend Robin, who bought an Instant Pot six month ago, summed it up well. “I’m out of the honeymoon phase,” she said. “Now we’re settling into a relationship. And I’ve accepted its limitations, like the fact that there’s no reason to ever make oatmeal or rice in it. But between the lamb stew and the butternut squash soup, I know we will be together forever. ” Recipes: Pressure Cooker Chocolate Pudding | Pressure Cooker Spicy Pork Shoulder | Pressure Cooker Beef Short Ribs With Red Wine and Chile | Pressure Cooker Pork Salad With Pomelo and Garlic Chips | More Pressure Cooker Recipes"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt turns out that because of the emissions of extraordinarily potent greenhouse gases NF3 and SF6 and energy during the manufacture of solar modules, solar energy ends up being worse for the climate than burning coal (assuming the global warming hypothesis is valid).
A Swiss engineer has made a thorough analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacture, transport and operation of solar panels. His conclusion:
Solar energy in Germany is climate killer no. 1!” 
Ferrucio Ferroni writes here how China is the number 1 manufacturer of solar panels globally and that the production of solar panels there requires immense amounts of electricity, which in China is mainly produced by coal power plants. Moreover the manufacture of solar panels also involves substantial amounts of potent greenhouse gases that leak out into the atmosphere.
The result Ferroni writes:
The comparison on CO2 emissions of a modern coal power plant and that of a PV system shows that per kilowatt-hour of power produced, PV systems damage the climate more. This statement is true if the hypothesis of the IPCC is correct to start with.”
Ferroni writes that it is accepted as fact the coal power plants emit carbon dioxide. But what is little known is that PV systems also lead to the emission of considerable quantities greenhouse gases – not during their operation, but during their manufacture.
Ferroni writes that when calculating the climate impacts of PV systems per unit, it is first necessary to account for the energy used in their manufacture in China, which involves the processing of solar silizium. Silizium processing involves considerable amounts of chemicals and raw materials. Also the manufacture of peripheral systems and their subsequent transport of materials to Europe and North America and their modest outputs in many northern locations have to be taken into account.
In comparison, modern steam power plants using clean-coal-technology now reach an efficiency of 52%, which means they emit 846 grams of CO2 per kWh when powered with stone coal (heat value: 30 MJ/kg). Moreover, nowadays highly efficient filters keep dust emissions to a minimum.
Producing 1 square meter requires 300 kg of coal
The manufacture of the silizium for the panels is immensely energy-intensive. According to Prof. Jian Shuisheng of the Jiatong-University in Peking, one square meter of solar module production requires more than 300 kg of coal, which leads to more than 1100 kg of CO2 emissions.
Also the production in China of peripheral systems for PV systems, like frequency converters, batteries, copper cable, switches, instruments etc., require fossil energy. According to literature this is estimated to be an additional 13%. Thus so far the emission for one square meter of solar module now adds up to 1243 kg CO2.
Potent gases needed for manufacturing solar modules

According to Ferroni, the other huge drawback presented by PV systems are the nasty chemicals and industrial gases used for their manufacture. The production of solar panels in China entails nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which are extremely potent heat-trapping gases that leak out during the process. NF3 has a greenhouse gas potency that is 16,600 times greater than CO2; SF6 is 23,900 times more potent. Reports show that these gases emitted annually into the atmosphere from the manufacture of solar panels is equivalent to over 70 million tonnes of CO2 in terms of greenhouse effect. In 2010 over 17.5 GW of rated capacity of solar cells were installed. Thus the emissions per square meter of solar panels comes out to be 513 kg CO2 – a huge amount!
Other chemicals in the production process
The manufacture of solar cells also uses other chemicals like (HCl), silizium carbide, and silver among others. The total alleged warming potential of these chemicals comes out to be an estimated 30 kg CO2 per square meter of PV module. Oddly (likely to avoid embarrassment) the solar industry has yet to release any detailed data on the warming potential and impacts of the chemicals used in their manufacture.
Emissions-intensive transport 
Also the transport of the PV systems and modules represent a considerable source of emissions. Ferroni writes that the transport of the systems from China to Germany results in 23 kg CO2 per square meter of solar module, more than what is used to transport coal from South Africa to Europe.
In total 1809 kg of CO2 equivalent is emitted into the atmosphere per square meter of solar panel manufactured and transported.
Ferroni then calculates that over the entire lifetime of a solar panel (25 years) one square meter will produce a total 2000 kwh in Germany. But then there are losses from conversions and so the real value is closer to 1850 kWh.
Over the entire lifetime and taking all factors into account, Ferroni finds that each kwh of electricity produced by solar modules emits 978g of CO2. How does this compare to coal? Ferroni:
In comparison, a modern coal power plant emits 846 g CO2/kWh, i.e. about 13% less. As a result, under German conditions, PV modules are the no. 1 climate killers. By comparison a gas power plant is more advantageous because its CO2 emissions are about half as much: approx.: 400g CO2/kWh.”

"Volkswagen has lost a landmark legal battle in Germany’s highest civil court over compensation for the buyer of a secondhand minivan fitted with emissions-cheating software. The world’s largest carmaker must take back the plantiff’s manipulated car and pay him €28,257.74 (£25,325), in a case that will lead to the company paying compensation to 60,000 German VW owners. The ruling is the latest blow in the so-called dieselgate scandal, in which Volkswagen and fellow German carmaker Daimler have paid more than €30bn (£28bn) in fines and compensation around the world since it was revealed in 2015. VW was found to have installed software that artificially lowered emissions of nitrogen oxides when the vehicles were being tested, meaning the output of the harmful pollutants were much higher in real-life conditions. Germany’s federal court of justice said Herbert Gilbert was entitled to compensation for the purchase price of the Volkswagen Sharan people carrier minus mileage costs. Gilbert bought the car in January 2014. Claus Goldenstein, a lawyer handling about 21,000 VW cases including Gilbert’s, said: “The ruling means legal certainty for millions of consumers in Germany and shows once again that even a large corporation is not above the law. Today we have made history.” In the UK, Volkswagen faces 91,000 consumer claims under a group litigation order. A high court judge hearing the case found that Volkswagen installed a “cheat device” in cars under its Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda brands. Despite being found to have cheated emissions in the US, Volkswagen had disputed the accusation in the UK. The dieselgate scandal rocked Volkswagen, with billions of euros wiped from its market value and fraud charges for its former chief executive Martin Winterkorn. The fallout has also been credited for spurring Volkswagen to accelerate plans to become the world’s largest manufacturer of battery electric vehicles, with zero exhaust emissions. The latest ruling removes one of the last remaining legal risks to Volkswagen in Germany in relation to the scandal. The company in February paid a settlement with about 240,000 car owners in a separate action that will cost it about €750m. Volkswagen said it would pay compensation in Germany as soon as possible and offer one-off payments dependent on individual claims. A Volkswagen spokesman said: “The ruling of the German federal court of justice will bring closure for the diesel proceedings in Germany. “Volkswagen is now seeking to bring these proceedings to a prompt conclusion in agreement with the plaintiffs. We will therefore approach the plaintiffs with the adequate settlement proposals.” The spokesman said the carmaker did not expect there would be many more lawsuits from consumers because of a high rate of acceptance of settlements and limits on new claims."

 **Manurewa-Papakura ward**



 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



I’m a Manurewa native myself having grown up in Wattle Downs until moving to Mt. Roskill aged 14. Started school at St. Annes Primary School. Their carelessness in permitting space and dinosaur books in the library ensured I was an atheist by the time First Communion was due. I attended Manurewa Intermediate and then spent Years 9 and 10 at James Cook High School. Apparently it wasn’t a great school at the time but I can’t say I noticed. I also played cricket for Weymouth for 4 seasons which I willingly admit to being crap at. Top figures of 20 runs and 3-14 attained in the season I was placed in a team 3 grades below my age group.  
  
Manurewa-Papakura ward has been poorly served since the 2010 amalgamation, by representatives that supported Len Brown and his 9.9% rates increase or who slept through meetings. That started to change in 2016…



There are six candidates contesting this two member ward. Daniel Newman of Manurewa-Papakura Action Team is the only incumbent.



 **[Angela Dalton](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=709e9c5b-30c4-43e2-9193-f401c4890f91&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)** – Manurewa-Papakura Action Team **$$$$**



Angela has been well known and enormously popular figure in South Auckland politics for quite some time, having topped the polls for Manurewa Local board in 2016 and 2013. The 2010 results are a bit more difficult to find. Her leadership has been competent and firm, though that hasn’t been without controversy in this year’s local board contest.



Manurewa has its own [particular challenges](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/01/manurewa-locals-forced-to-live-with-stench-from-rubbish-filled-property-for-months.html) with illegal rubbish dumping and escalating numbers of [homeless rough sleepers](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12248737), but they’re issues that Angela’s chairmanship has excelled in dealing with. Other successes resulting from Dalton’s time on the Manurewa Local Board include opening the Manurewa Sports Centre, the recovery of Netball Manurewa at Browns Road and the transformation of Riverton Reserve in Randwick Park.



A playground at Randwick Park was completed in April of this year. While Jacinda Ardern has allowed school children to influence Government policy on climate change and banning plastic bags, Manurewa Local Board were a bit smarter, giving children from Randwick Park School the opportunity to design 3D models of what they wanted the playground to look like. It includes a Kuzebo structure, a rocktopus and a flying fox.



With Councillor Daniel Newman, Angela Dalton and the local community successfully put a stay on the repurposing of a Oranga Tamariki care and protection facility into a youth justice residence. There had been no prior consultation of the local community on having the facility in a residential area and taking the Ministry of Children to court was a win for local residents.



I don’t always see eye to eye with Angela on some issues. Her wowserish campaigns against on-license bars and new liquor stores have been very effective, no doubt pleasing existing liquor retailers who have fewer competitors to deal with. Recently a proposed upmarket sports bar in the former Manurewa RSA premises has been blocked from opening, one of many businesses prevented and jobs not created. 



There are a lot of candidates making wild promises to voters that they simply cannot achieve. The complexity of the Council’s functions makes it difficult for voters to know just what candidates can actually deliver and many of the candidates themselves either exploit this confusion for votes or simply don’t know themselves. Angela knows exactly how local government works and isn’t shy about[ truthfully communicating ](https://www.facebook.com/daltonmanurewa/posts/2380594881989952)what can or can’t be done to voters.



[ **Karin Kerr**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=ecbe9701-17b6-413d-b157-3cc1954be165&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Independent **$$**



Kerr’s candidate profile is very brief and contains little to inspire. No signs and a sad statement to accompany voting papers don’t fill me with optimism at her chances. I’d have left it at that and moved on, but there are people in the ward who have insisted I look a bit closer.



Karin Kerr is a property manager and the founder of Homestar Rentals. This is her first attempt at local body politics and she is running a low budget campaign. Working in the rental market brings with it knowledge and abilities that complement being a local representative. I’m advised that there is a grassroots buzz that is growing but I have no way of verifying that.  
  
Maybe in three years.



[ **Ilango Krishnamoorthy**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=78100d58-d927-4ec9-8919-319899d654ab&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Labour **$**



Auckland is a bit odd politically. South Auckland is painted red every election in central government but when it comes to Council, fiscal conservatives seem to have staked out some secure territory.



Krishnamoorthy has lived in Manurewa for thirty years, owns a printing business and is very active in the Indian community. He is a Trustee of the South Asian Trust which provides counselling support to ethnic groups and is a founding member of the NZ Hindu Temple Society. The Indian News Link describes him as “one of the most popular community leaders.” I’ve never heard of him but we probably go to different bars.



From his candidate profile: “Ilango’s focus is preserving and promoting the amazing natural environments and public facilities that Manurewa-Papakura has to share with all Aucklanders”.



Maybe he needs to build some amazing public facilities before promoting them?



Both Labour candidates finish their statements with: Voting for all our Labour endorsed Mayor, Councillors, Local Board and DHB candidates guarantees you the most effective advocates working with Manurewa MPs Louisa Wall and Peeni Henare. #VoteLabour #LetsDoThis



It’s a bit sad that they have to resort to name dropping the local MP to get people to vote for them. Probably because in the 2016 local board elections the top 8 positions went to Manurewa Action Team, followed by three Independents, followed by four Labour candidates, followed by It’s Worth It Manurewa, followed by Ilango Krishnamoorthy.



[ **Peter Neilson**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=65e91098-b620-4198-a171-005089c05ce5&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Labour 



Local boards are where political careers are born and sometimes where they go to die. Peter Neilson was in parliament for 9 years and Minister for Revenue, Works and Associate Finance. I’ve never heard of him and can’t remember when I last heard of a Minister of Works.



Wyatt Creech was the last Minister of Works in 1993 while Neilson held the post for 9 months in 1990. 



So, Neilson was a Minister in the greatest New Zealand government of all time and I’ve still never heard of him.  
In his [blog](https://www.peterneilson.nz/blog/2019/6/21/peter-for-manurewa-papakura-ward-on-auckland-council), Peter hinges his strategy for winning the ward on getting non-voters out to vote. Sounds like a Labour party strategy in the 2014 election that planned to win by getting 1 million non-voters out to vote. That didn’t work. This won’t either. The problem with non-voters is that they don’t vote.



Neilson loves “the optimism of the people he meets while walking the streets of Panurewa (sic).” His priority if he is elected is to unite the community by holding a 2 day 2020 Vision conference involving community organisations, sports clubs, churches, local councillors, the Local Board, our MP’s, the Mayor and others. On day 1 they will agree on what needs to be done. One day 2 they would decide what they need to do in the next 3 years and the following 7 years.  
  
Manurewa MP Louisa Wall asked this guy to run for Council.



[ **Daniel Newman**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=bdf967d8-e52b-4d2e-b3d1-5bccdb4ca6ec&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Manurewa – Papakura Action Team **$$$$$**



Uttering this guy’s name in the ward generates very strong feelings for positive and negative reasons alike. I had to take a closer look. He lives in Wattle Downs and (unlike me) attends St. Annes Catholic Church because he actually wants to.   
The _Whaleoil_ blog called “Daniel ‘Vlad’ Newman the most formidable man in Auckland Politics.” _NZ Herald_ writers Bernard Orsman and Simon Wilson both [rated Newman’s performance](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2019/09/wilson_and_orsman_rate_the_auckland_councillors.html) 8/10; the highest rating for anyone on Auckland Council.



Newman is a fiscal and social conservative, practical and with a no-nonsense approach to his role as Councillor. When Auckland Council announced that the CRL was facing a $500 million cost blowout, Mayor Goff was said to have weakly said, “nobody is surprised no matter how unwelcome these costs will be.” I preferred Newman’s approach. He said parts of the funding formula [gave him “the shits”](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/112383569/city-rail-link-auckland-councillors-to-consider-500m-extra-for-underground-tunnels) and he expects Crown Company City Rail Link Ltd to pay the added cost.



It’s not hard to find stories about the larger than life Councillor over the past term. They include small scale practicality such as when a [Papakura art group](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2019/03/papakura-art-group-needs-a-hand/) went to their local board about difficulties accessing a community hall since changes to the carpark had made things difficult for members on the upper-end of the age scale. Within weeks Newman and board chairman Brent Catchpole were at the site, working with the art group and Council officers to get a simple, quick fix.



A Summerset Retirement Village resident finding it increasingly more difficult to enjoy visiting Karaka Lakes due to an absence of seating and this was brought up at a local board meeting last April. Newman shares my impatience with getting things done the [bureaucratic way](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2019/04/local-board-asked-to-install-memorial-seat/), saying they would have a chat with developers to get it done without going through workshops and board meetings.



In a ward where illegal dumping and poor health outcomes are common, Daniel has taken Housing New Zealand to task for trying to reduce its spend on rubbish collection with 125L bins for 3 bedroom houses. In South Auckland, 3 bedrooms notoriously means much larger families living there and the bins are not adequate for many tenants.



When Councillors Darby and Hills teamed up with Goff to announce free bus rides on weekends for kids under 15, potentially costing $643,000, it was dismissed by Newman as a “schooze” which wouldn’t help the majority of Aucklanders who depend on private vehicles.



“An election year sweetener on public transport fares will be paid for by foregoing other urgent initiatives, including new public transport services,” he said. 



Daniel Newman is widely considered to lead the so-called B team, who oppose Phil Goff’s mayoralty (vs the A team councillors who vote with Goff). His manner is blunt and can be divisive but Newman shows no sign of caring.



[ **Veronica Turner**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a9f0a27f-90ae-495d-aa05-b7fe163c05d9&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Justice for Families 



Veronica’s affiliation is a bit strange for local body politics but I knew I had seen it somewhere before…



Susanna Kruger is running for Mayor yet again. Each time she pledges to implement some business or education project owned by her company. That’s where I had seen it…



Veronica Turner runs South African market days to share her South African culture with New Zealanders. She also organises networking teas and ladies’ retreats. Kruger has clearly trained her apprentice well, the website for these ladies’ retreats is included in Turner’s candidate profile. ( [ladyinbusiness.info](http://ladyinbusiness.info/) )



Turner’s priorities are introducing a low-cost housing scheme yet to be introduced by Justice For Families and assisting families to become financially independent through Create Your Own J.O.B. workshops. Something like [this?](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/create-your-own-job-course-tickets-56256516756#)

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s eco-evangelical, leftie  weekly Die Zeit has a surprisingly sober online piece that almost got by me.
It actually harshly criticizes global warming science – unusual for Die Zeit, which is an influential “intellectual” weekly that has been preaching the science is settled for years. Not long ago it one-sidedly attacked skeptics and portrayed them as gangster-types led by Godfather and mastermind Marc Morano, aided and abetted by the evil Fred Singer and German Fritz Vahrenholt.
In the latest commentary, Andreas Frey of Die Zeit writes:
We need less alarmism, more fundamental research and courage to take risks!”
Climate alarmism headed for a dead-end
Frey compares the climate change scare to another scare that swept across Germany in the 1980s: forest die-off because of acid rain. That catastrophe never materialized, of course. Frey writes that the climate change movement is caught in the very same trap and finds itself well on its way to a dead-end.
The pattern observed is similar to the issue of forest die-off. Though the catastrophe never came about, forest still isn’t doing well. But who wants to hear about it?”
Damaged science
In point number 2 of his commentary, Frey writes that many climate scientists engaged “in spreading fear, warning of dire scenarios for our future“. But that has backfired, as Frey writes:
The flood of alarm threatens the credibility of the entire field – and thus damages science. But the alarmist is proud about having made the climate issue popular; he mingles gladly with politicians (and he even fancies himself as one) and thus knows precisely what is needed to curb the collapse of the planet: eat no meat, don’t drive cars, don’t consume electricity made with coal, don’t fly. Thus he has stepped over the line between science and activism.”
Media have been too uncritical

//-->




In point no. 3, Frey surprisingly even writes that the media have been too uncritical of the science they’ve been fed by alarmist scientists…something that Die Zeit is guilty of well beyond the shadow of any doubt. In fact, skeptics get labeled as gangster-like evil climate mobsters (see above). Astonishingly, Frey describes the mindset of the media as follows:
Whatever you do, don’t say anything bad about climate scientists, don’t express any doubts about their results or forecasts – that could be fodder for climate skeptics! That’s how journalists often reacted.”
UN conferences have failed
In point no. 4, Frey claims that “climate diplomacy has failed. Emissions continue rising – all the UN conferences amounted to nothing.”
It probably was just too naïve to believe that the countries would come to their senses and obligate themselves to make cuts.”
Bring on fracking!
In point no. 5 he reiterates the global warming is still a real problem and adds that Germans must be willing to take more risks in combatting climate change. He says Germans must be more open to geo-engineering, CO2 sequestation and fracking.
Climate science has lost its relevance
In point no. 6 Frey writes of the “diminishing relevance of climate science” , which he says is confirmed by studies. Frey asks what’s the use of studies that show the world’s cultural monuments are threatened by sea level rise, and that El Ninos lead to more war? Frey thinks the science is often focused on the wrong things.
Finally, in point no.7 of the essay, Frey believes that climate scientists aren’t the ones who should be advising policy advisors after all. He writes that the science has to become more open to other scientists from other fields, such as sociologists, historians, geographers and ethnologists. He adds that “there are many possibilities for adaptation. In the climate debate adaptation will become an increasingly important topic, and everyone has to be allowed to join the discussion.”
Yes. it’s been a long time since we’ve witnessed sobriety at Die Zeit. It’s almost as if they forgot to take their dose on panic pills one day. Don’t get your hopes up.  This is probably the last sober piece we’ll see from Die Zeit for quite some time.

"If a piece of information is repeated often enough, it will eventually be believed, even if there is no evidence for it. One example of this features the friendly clownfish Nemo and his side-kick Dory, a blue tang fish, who you may know from the animated blockbusters Finding Nemo and Finding Dory. Everyone loves Nemo. But to some, his rise to global stardom in 2003 had a darker side, as news outlets around the world reported that the popularity of the movie was leading an increasing number of people to buy clownfish as pets. These articles claimed that this increase in demand was a threat to wild populations. While there was little to no evidence to support this story, with so much repetition, the so-called Nemo Effect became conventional wisdom. So it wasn’t surprising that before its sequel, Finding Dory, was released in 2016, a chorus of voices, including Ellen DeGeneres who voices Dory in the movie, once again raised the alarm. The calls were, however, dwarfed by the more than 50m spectators who watched the movie in the US alone. Could there be a Dory Effect?  Dory is a blue tang, a species found across much of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Despite its popularity as an aquarium fish, it’s currently not considered to be threatened. Still, increased sales could constitute a threat to wild populations since, in contrast with clownfish which are often bred specially for the trade, blue tangs cannot be reared in captivity and there are no alternatives to wild-caught fish. To find out if there had been a Dory Effect, my co-authors and I compared how sales of blue tang fish changed over time, as compared to other species of the same family that are also traded as pets. Our results are now published in the journal Ambio. We found no link between the release of the movie and the number of fish imported into the US, where many of the viewers were located. This is to some extent not surprising as blue tang are large and hard to keep, and so not particularly suitable for first-time fish enthusiasts.  So what other things could movie goers do as a result of watching Finding Dory? There is some evidence that animated blockbusters can influence people to visit these and other ornamental fish at an aquarium. We looked at visitor numbers over time at 20 US aquariums to see if there had been any changes associated with the release of the movie. Again, we did not find any effect. We then turned to an indicator that related to a less expensive and time-consuming behaviour, the act of searching online, in particular, searching on Google for different ornamental fish species. We again compared the blue tang fish with other ornamental fish of the same family. This time, things were different.  We found a sharp rise in the frequency of Google searches for the scientific name of the blue tang: Paracanthurus hepatus. This showed that while Dory fans were not willing to invest time and money to buy pet fish or visit an aquarium, they were indeed willing to search online for information about the species, an act involving little investment in money or time. Our results show that contrary to what was previously widely reported, the movie Finding Dory was not responsible for an increase in demand for the blue tang fish, but it did encourage people to seek more information about the species. It seems blockbusters can play an important role in putting a more diverse group of species in the public’s mind. This is key for conservation as we know that the least familiar species are less often perceived to be worthy of conservation support. Finally, these findings also highlight how we need better links between the press and the scientific community, to ensure that stories based on anecdotal evidence such as this do not gain unwarranted momentum and end up shaping public opinion and even public policy.  There are several similar stories to this one out there. For example, there are reports of the Harry Potter movies driving demand for pet owls or the movie Zootopia leading to a spike in the demand for pet Fennec foxes, despite no evidence to support them. Scientists and journalists need to find better ways of working together to ensure more factual coverage. In the era where experts are sometimes seen as irrelevant and fake news plagues our media streams, this improved relationship will be vital to demonstrate the value of both groups to society."

I note that emails regarding the paper that were received by one author and not forwarded to the others would not have been covered by my request.
Despite the embarrassment of the withdrawn paper, the University is to be commended for their no nonsense approach to this request. As an alumunus, I am pleased that the response is far more sensible than the approach taken by the UEA and UVa.
That’s true, because there appears to be no holding back of any important correspondence. Here’s some select portions.
Karoly’s first technical response (June 7 Melbourne) to Neukom’s confession was a surprisingly strong endorsement of criticism of non-detrended correlation, going as far as to even agree with [McIntyre] by name:
”If the selection is done on the proxies without detrending ie the full proxy records over the 20th century, then records with strong trends will be selected and that will effectively force a hockey stick result. Then Stephen Mcintyre criticism is valid”.
And then there’s this from Gergis
[…]
”Over recent days we have been in discussion with colleagues here in Australia and internationally about the use of detrended or non detrended data for proxy selection as both methods are published in the literature .
People have argued that detrending proxy records when reconstructing temperature is in fact undesirable (see two papers attached provided courtesy of Professor Michael Mann) .
While anthropogenic trends may inflate correlation coefficients, this can be dealt with by allowing for autocorrelation when assessing significance. If any linear trends ARE removed when validating individual proxies, then the validation exercise will essentially only confirm the ability of the proxies to reconstruct interannual variations. However, in an exercise of this nature we are also intrinsically interested in reconstructing longer-term trends. It therefore appears to be preferable to retain trends in the data, so that we are also assessing the ability of the proxies to reconstruct this information.”
And this admission from co-author Phipps:
Based on the various emails circulated over the past few days, it appears that we will not have a viable millennial-scale reconstruction if we pursue the detrended approach. I therefore feel that we should use the raw data to validate the proxies…
My preference is therefore for David’s Option 2, with Option 1 as my second choice. I dislike Option 3 as it will not leave us with a viable reconstruction. I also dislike Option 4 as it strikes me as essentially starting again from scratch – which seems unnecessary given how far this work has already progressed, and also seems out of proportion to what is only a matter of fixing a technical issue.
Mann, in correspondence with the authors Gergis and Karoly, in his typical style tried to sell a collection different workarounds for the problems they brought on themselves, and in the end, his advice was rejected, the JC editors told the authors the paper was not viable, and the authors were forced to withdraw the paper. Full stop.
Journal of Climate editor Chiang wrote:
After consulting with the Chief Editor, I have decided to rescind acceptance of the paper- you’ll receive an official email from J Climate to this effect as soon as we figure out how it should be properly done. I believe the EOR has already been taken down.
Also, since it appears that you will have to redo the entire analysis (and which may result in different conclusions), I will also be requesting that you withdraw the paper from consideration. Again, you’ll hear officially from J CLimate in due course. I invite you to resubmit once the necessary analyses and changes to the manuscript have been made.
I hope this will be acceptable to you. I regret the situation, but thank you for bringing it to my prompt attention.
The end result of the AMS putting the authors on notice, plus the admissions in the emails, rather puts this early defamatory remark from Dr. Mann in perspective:
Well I’m afraid Mclntyre has probably already leaked this anyway. I probably don’t have to tell you this, but don’t trust him to behave ethically or honestly here, and assume that anything you tell him will be cherry-picked in a way that maximally discredits the study and will be leaked as suits his purposes.
Read the whole episode here at Climate Audit. 
It should be noted that commenter Jean S. contributed the first valid critique, which then later grew into this full retraction. Kudos to him too.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp at the skeptical website Science Skeptical here writes about one of the incredible (but very real) absurdities of Germany’s “EEG” renewable energy feed-in act, which forces power companies to buy all green power that gets produced, whether needed or not, and even power that doesn’t get produced.
=====================================
When the wind turbine is idle…
By Rudolf Kipp
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
For some weeks now I have been observing from my window the operation of an Enercon 101 wind turbine. On many Sundays when there is a fair amount of wind its rotor remains idle. Next to it there are smaller 1 MW turbines which continue turning. At first I thought little of this. After all on Sundays not as much electricity gets consumed. Yet, this is true only in an indirect way. Electricity from the wind turbines are usually given the right of way into the power grid before fossil-fuel generated power. That means when the wind turbines are switched off because their power is not needed or the grid is not able to take it in, the wind-park operator gets compensated. Here the amount of compensation is not determined by the actual wind strength prevailing at the time the turbine is idle and the corresponding amount of energy that would have been generated, rather it is determined by the turbine’s rated capacity. According to the German feed-in law, an Enercon 101 turbine with a rated capacity of 3 MW must be compensated 90% should it be ordered to remain idle and not feed-in energy.
That means the turbine I saw standing idle 10 hours on a Sunday was compensated to the tune of 10hrs x 3MW/hr x 90% = 27,000 kWh. At 15 cents per kwh, the turbine operator is entitled to €4050.00…for nothing.
On the other hand if the very same turbine had been allowed to operate under the prevailing moderate wind conditions on that Sunday, thus putting out say 33% of its rated capacity, then it would have fed in 9900 kWh into the grid, meaning the turbine operator would have earned only €1485.00…for 9900 kwh of real electricity.
What a wonderful business you can make with the German feed-in act! Doing nothing gets rewarded to the max, bringing in multiple times more money than if you actually delivered something!
===================================
Just for your information, the average output for a wind turbine in Germany is only about 20% of its rated capacity.

There has been a great deal of concern lately about rising partisanship and tribalism in the American political and cultural dialogue. Magazines, cable networks, and friends on Facebook line up with the Red Team or the Blue Team (which, lately, means pro‐ or anti‐​Trump) and present very different views of the world.



In times of polarization, think tanks seek to model civil discourse and respectful disagreement. Scholars at think tanks — more formally, public policy research organizations — may disagree, but they do so on the basis of facts, logic, and analysis.



But think tanks increasingly find themselves pressured to join a team and face off with the opposition. U.S. think tanks across the political spectrum report more pressure from donors and allies to be part of the red or blue team.



Meanwhile, increased partisan competition means more focus on think tanks, their activities, and their funding. Journalists and activists demand more transparency about funding sources and donor relations. The _New York Times_ blasted several major think tanks for seeming to give foreign‐​government donors what they want. Yahoo! News reported in 2018, “Think tanks reconsider Saudi support amid Khashoggi controversy.” The Cato Institute has not been mentioned in these stories — not because we’re lucky, but because we don’t seek or accept money from governments. That course of action proves wiser every year.



There are legitimate arguments for transparency about funding. But we have also seen an uptick in efforts by political opponents and even by officeholders to pressure or punish donors. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has urged the Justice Department to bring a lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against Exxon Mobil and its purported “network” of “conservative policy institutes” that disagree with the senator on climate science. And in 2013, Cato received a letter from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) demanding to know, among other things, “Has Cato Institute served as a member of ALEC American Legislative Exchange Council or provided any funding to ALEC in 2013?” The answer to that question was no, but then‐​CEO John Allison’s answer to Senator Durbin was more blunt: “Your letter … represents a blatant violation of our First Amendment rights.”



All think tanks need to resist this sort of intimidation, no matter at whom it is directed, and insist on our institutional independence.



Red‐​blue polarization is tough for those of us who don’t line up with either side, who try to talk to people of good will across the political spectrum, and who seek to defend principle while holding politicians accountable. There have certainly been policy improvements that were driven by the left (gay marriage, marijuana reform), the right (tax cuts, regulatory slowdown, repealing the health care mandate), and both (criminal justice reform). But politicians and parties have an incredible propensity to let us down even when we supposedly agree. Democrats pay lip service to civil liberties but do little to defend them, while for all the talk of fiscal conservatism by Republicans, spending and debt grow regardless of which party is in charge. Cato must defend these values and be willing to call out either side as necessary. This stance is particularly necessary as the attitudes of both parties have hardened and polarized in unfortunate directions. Although his tax and regulation policies are laudable, President Trump has shifted the GOP’s focus from smaller‐​government Reaganism to protectionism, anti‐​immigration hysteria, and cultural issues, often racially charged ones. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party has moved sharply left on all the wrong things — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and a wealth tax. Those changes make Cato’s role all the more important, and we’ve developed some projects to fight back against tribalism, such as our recent art exhibit and a high school teachers’ conference this summer.



Most think tanks are committed to liberalism in the broad sense — to rule of law, freedom of conscience, toleration, limited government, markets, democracy, and, perhaps especially, free speech and the value of truth. With rising tides of illiberalism on left and right, here and elsewhere, we have a common purpose to defend liberalism, even though we argue a great deal about policy details.

While there is wailing and gnashing of teeth over the current midwest drought,

We have this interesting piece from the American Society of Agronomy :
Droughts can severely limit crop growth, causing yearly losses of around $8 billion in the United States. But it may be possible to minimize those losses if farmers can synchronize the growth of crops with periods of time when drought is less likely to occur. Researchers from Oklahoma State University are working to create a reliable “calendar” of seasonal drought patterns that could help farmers optimize crop production by avoiding days prone to drought.
Historical probabilities of drought, which can point to days on which crop water stress is likely, are often calculated using atmospheric data such as rainfall and temperatures. However, those measurements do not consider the soil properties of individual fields or sites.  
“Atmospheric variables do not take into account soil moisture,” explains Tyson Ochsner, lead author of the study. “And soil moisture can provide an important buffer against short-term precipitation deficits.”
In an attempt to more accurately assess drought probabilities, Ochsner and co-authors, Guilherme Torres and Romulo Lollato, used 15 years of soil moisture measurements from eight locations across Oklahoma to calculate soil water deficits and determine the days on which dry conditions would be likely. Results of the study, which began as a student-led class research project, were published online Jan. 29 in Agronomy Journal. The researchers found that soil water deficits more successfully identified periods during which plants were likely to be water stressed than did traditional atmospheric measurements when used as proposed by previous research.
Soil water deficit is defined in the study as the difference between the capacity of the soil to hold water and the actual water content calculated from long-term soil moisture measurements. Researchers then compared that soil water deficit to a threshold at which plants would experience water stress and, therefore, drought conditions. The threshold was determined for each study site since available water, a factor used to calculate threshold, is affected by specific soil characteristics.
“The soil water contents differ across sites and depths depending on the sand, silt, and clay contents,” says Ochsner. “Readily available water is a site- and depth-specific parameter.”
Upon calculating soil water deficits and stress thresholds for the study sites, the research team compared their assessment of drought probability to assessments made using atmospheric data. They found that a previously developed method using atmospheric data often underestimated drought conditions, while soil water deficits measurements more accurately and consistently assessed drought probabilities. Therefore, the researchers suggest that soil water data be used whenever it is available to create a picture of the days on which drought conditions are likely.
If soil measurements are not available, however, the researchers recommend that the calculations used for atmospheric assessments be reconfigured to be more accurate. The authors made two such changes in their study. First, they decreased the threshold at which plants were deemed stressed, thus allowing a smaller deficit to be considered a drought condition. They also increased the number of days over which atmospheric deficits were summed. Those two changes provided estimates that better agreed with soil water deficit probabilities.
Further research is needed, says Ochsner, to optimize atmospheric calculations and provide accurate estimations for those without soil water data. “We are in a time of rapid increase in the availability of soil moisture data, but many users will still have to rely on the atmospheric water deficit method for locations where soil moisture data are insufficient.”
Regardless of the method used, Ochsner and his team hope that their research will help farmers better plan the cultivation of their crops and avoid costly losses to drought conditions.

"MANILA  —   A fire raced through a squalid Manila shantytown teeming with people on Tuesday night, as residents armed only with buckets of water tried to fight the inferno. As day broke on Wednesday, more than 15, 000 people found themselves homeless, bereft of their few worldly possessions and forced to sleep on the Philippine capital’s streets. “It spread fast across the neighboring homes made of light materials,” said Wilberto Tiu, Manila’s fire chief. “Firemen had trouble reaching the area because of small alleyways,” Mr. Tiu said of the warren of closely built homes, some constructed of no more than plywood and scrap metal. He said the alleys between homes were too narrow for fire trucks. Residents tried to outrun the blaze, grabbing whatever they could carry: pots and pans, family pets, washing machines and electric fans. Dozens of people were injured in the stampede, but miraculously, officials said, no one was killed. The blaze had been brought under control by Wednesday morning. Fires in the country’s slums are a regular occurrence. About 1, 200 families were left without homes in January after a fire in Navotas, a suburb of Manila. Residents of shantytowns are at particular risk in the months of February and March, as the weather warms and the rains stop, officials said. In March 2015, more than 7, 000 families were left homeless when a blaze tore through the same slum, Parola Compound, near the capital’s main port. In 2014, the homes of at least 2, 500 families in the slum were destroyed in a predawn blaze. Investigators said they believed Tuesday’s blaze was caused by faulty electrical wiring or a malfunctioning gas stove. By Wednesday morning, hundreds of families were left to sleep on the street, some at a makeshift shelter at a covered basketball court, disaster officials said. Television footage showed children sleeping on sidewalks along streets near the slum, as health workers distributed food and other supplies."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans-Joachim Schellnhuber, often regarded in Europe as the Pope John of climate change, has an interview in German flagship political daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
Schellnhuber is often regarded as the father of the 2°C limit the UN and warmists keep talking about. To not exceed the 2°C warming limit, Schellnhuber and the warmists say that drastic cuts in CO2 emissions are needed very urgently.
Barroso “appears exhausted”
In the FAZ, Schellnhuber reiterates many of the points he’s made in the past. But a number of his comments relate to the new non-binding emissions targets now proposed by the European Union. The latest EU proposal is to achieve a 40% CO2 reduction by 2030. Many view this as watered down. Schellnhuber characterizes the new target as “a still acceptable level of ambition, and is in any case not a catastrophe.” He adds:
The new target is the weakest version of a European lead role […]. It is compromise that puts competition at the forefront. It is certainly the result of the European economic crisis and an attempt to some extent to address the trauma while at the same time to not abandon climate protection. The fire that burned in President Barroso is pretty much out.”
Later he adds:
Barroso listens and he understands the things, but he appears exhausted by the European crisis.”
By now we see that even top European policy makers, like Barroso and Merkel, view attempts to reduce carbon as clashing with economic stability. They continue to want to pursue carbon reductions, but realize that going it alone is not going to work economically.
“A renewable efficient system is superior”
But Schellnhuber is not one to give up easily and maintains a face of optimism:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




I believe that Europe will decarbonize faster than provided by the roadmap because we can anticipate additional technical and social innovations in the years ahead. We know that a renewable efficient system is superior to fossil-nuclear.”
Prof. Schellnhuber must know a technology that the rest of us aren’t aware of. So far there is not a single green energy out there that has been demonstrated to have the superiority he claims. It’s not for nothing European countries are scaling back green energy subsidies. They’re just not working anywhere near as well as hoped. Right now where I live solar panels are covered with 10 cm of snow and the wind is hardly blowing. Cars are running and homes are heating by using fossil fuels.
“By 2050 we have to be near zero globally.”
From a global perspective, Schellnhuber adds:
By 2020 we must reach the peak in CO2 emissions, then it has to go down and by 2050 we have to be near zero globally.”
It’s one thing to be optimistic, but here Schellnhuber is totally out to lunch if he thinks this is a realistic and achievable target. Does he have any understanding about energy supply and consumption? The whole world is expected to consume as much carbon as the poorest African within a single generation? It’s clearer than ever that Schellnhuber completely miscalculated and that his CO2 – 2°C target calculation is fantasy. Expect leaders to keep listening to Schellnhuber, but not to act.
What is professor Schellnhuber’s next step?
I’m going to speak to Barroso about how he can bring this in harmony with the international target of maximum 2°C.
Whether he listens is another question.

Audrey Young’s headline for her article featuring her interview with Jacinda Ardern in _A Weekend Newspaper_ was dripping with hypocrisy; and that’s putting it politely. It read –



PM: I’m not trying to build my personal profile.



Steeling myself to read the written confabulation I made sure a bucket was in close proximity. The first thing I learned was that her international profile has surpassed any other New Zealand leader but her local credibility is on the line. It’s to her advantage that overseas journalists, like many of our own, don’t take the time to research domestic affairs in any depth, or her international credibility would be on the line as well. Although not from the sympathetic far-left _Washington Post_. The interviewer was Lally Graham Weymouth. Audrey was kind enough to list some famous political leaders Lally had interviewed in the past. **Most were dictators.** She’s finally got to Ardern.



Anyway back to Audrey’s article, having made sure the bucket is still nearby. Where to start? At the beginning, I suppose. A year ago she was known internationally as that young leader who became Prime Minister overnight and had a baby while in office. Well, novel maybe, but hardly a blockbuster story. We’re told the defining photos were of the pregnant PM meeting the Queen, who probably would have found a bucket useful, and playing with the baby at the United Nations General Assembly. I thought the defining UN photo was the fisherman changing the kid’s nappy in public view. Doing it where he did defined him hook, line and sinker in terms of his persona, in my opinion.



Jacinda talks to Audrey about the Christchurch massacre and says she doesn’t want New Zealand to be defined by that event. She wants the country to be known for our humanity and empathy in the aftermath. Audrey gushes that today Jacinda is known by millions if not billions more than a year ago and is defined by her empathetic response to the mosque massacre which touched the world! A nervous glance in the direction of the bucket. Translation: she dressed up in a hijab and wandered around hugging people.



We then get to the part in the interview where she is emphatic; all her international media engagements have nothing to do with building her own persona. Such interviews, she says, are all calculated as part of the national interest and are not about building her personal profile. I’m now starting to feel decidedly queasy, so again have to check the whereabouts of the bucket. It’s still handy. Anyway I say bollocks to that because that’s exactly what it’s about. Writing her CV for that upcoming UN job which, in the view of readers of _The BFD_ and others, can’t come soon enough.



Evidently, the _Washington Post_ interview will give her more leverage when she hits the ground running (away) in the United States. Audrey muses as to whether Trump will see it, or if he will be moved either way by it. I momentarily think he might need the bucket. Two things there Audrey, Trump doesn’t read the garbage in the W _ashington Post_ and, from memory, according to Jacinda, he thinks she is Trudeau’s wife. 



In case you’ve forgotten, Trudeau is that awfully wet Canadian bloke whom Jacinda compares herself to, who also likes to dress up. Birds of a feather, both flying blind. Next up, we’re told Jacinda is actually anti-Trump which begs the question, why bother going?



Audrey says being anti-Trump is not an issue that the PM wants to address and simply resorts to a standard deflection of answering a question she actually hasn’t been asked. That would be practice then for deflecting an answer to a question she has actually been asked would it?



Audrey says incredibly that Ardern claims to have no concept of having a high international profile. True or false? It might be true, bearing in mind she has no concept of anything else. An example is provided by Audrey who says, not surprisingly, that Jacinda cites climate change as the biggest global challenge. Hence she’s stopped oil and gas exploration and has instead decided to import coal from Indonesia. Voila!



Audrey says that Ardern seems genuinely excited about her first trip to Japan as Prime Minister. I would imagine she’d be excited about going to Outer Mongolia at the moment. Audrey concludes by saying that Jacinda was decidedly chipper when she handed her over to the _Washington Post_. So we’re all proven correct, she hasn’t got a clue as to what’s going on.



I glance at the bucket. Miraculously, it’s empty!

"**As England's national coronavirus lockdown comes to an end, non-essential businesses are able to reopen in a final rush to make money before Christmas.**
**However, confusion over government information about the rules means some businesses are keeping their doors closed for another 24 hours.**
**Becky Dewar** , who owns the Hare and Hounds in Levens, Cumbria, started furiously working towards a 3 December reopening date as soon as the four-week lockdown was announced, because ""it takes two weeks to shut a pub and two weeks to open a pub"".
After almost three weeks of cleaning up, filling out furlough paperwork for her 30 staff, managing the pub's finances and saving what stock she could, Becky realised that government guidance said she would in fact be able to reopen when England's new tiered system of coronavirus restrictions came into effect on Wednesday 2 December - a day earlier than she had been expecting.
With only nine days to go, it was too late for Becky, 40, to bring the reopening date forward - her staff rota was finalised and everything else had been geared towards opening on Thursday. The pub's takings on a normal Wednesday in December would be up to Â£2,000, but Becky is matter-of-fact about losing out on a day's trading. ""When you've been shut for 130 days in a year, 131 is... [just] one day,"" she said.
""If we'd mucked up the date by a week we would have crossed mountains to correct our mistake and sort it out, but a day in the whole scheme of how this year's worked outâ¦ these things are drops in the ocean,"" she said.
Becky said the mix-up was probably her own oversight, adding that pubs do not get any direct communication from the government about what Covid rules mean. ""You just go online and Google around, you read through the government website like everyone else does,"" she said.
However, Becky is not the only one to be reopening a day later than she needs to - and it may be because of inconsistent information from the government, rather than because people have misread the rules.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has not yet responded to a request to explain why a Cabinet Office document said lockdown measures would apply ""up to and including 2 December"" - suggesting they would end at some point on 3 December - whereas a DHSC document said the new tiered system would come into effect ""from the beginning of Wednesday 2 December"".
The DHSC told the BBC that the new tiered system coming into effect from 00:01 on 2 December would supersede lockdown regulations, and that it had always been the intention of the government to introduce new rules ""on 2 December"".
If **Phil Pinder** doesn't manage to reopen his drinks business in York tomorrow he could lose up Â£1,000 in potential sales.
Phil, 43, who owns a ""magical drinks emporium"" called The Potions Cauldron, will work through the night to try to get stock ready to open on Wednesday, instead of Thursday as he had initially arranged.
He said his small team's last-minute dash to avoid losing a day's trade is a result of contradictory information from the government.
""When they changed the new tier system, the [government] website said these rules come into force from the start of play on 2 December, but that the national lockdown restrictions will still play out in full.
""Then it linked to the previous lockdown rules, which said the lockdown will end at midnight on 2 December. That still exists on the government website. I think they messed up,"" Phil said.
Phil, whose shop's popular items include bottled ""serpent's venom"" and ""unicorn essence"", said his rushed reopening is down to the government ""messing about"" with lockdown end dates.
""We've got orders going out for wholesale, people now want their stock a day early and things like that - so it's having real consequences,"" he added.
If Phil's courier can deliver stock to him earlier than planned, the seven-strong team of shop workers will work ""really long"" hours to try to get the shop open on Wednesday. ""It's a very important time of year - we don't want to miss out,"" he said.
Moving on to another business owner called Phil, **Phil Townend** is hastily preparing to reopen his barbers in Leeds because lockdown is ending a day earlier than he had been expecting.
He only brought forward his reopening date a few days ago and hasn't managed to fill half of the available appointments yet - so is ""relying on last-minute people"" booking a haircut on Wednesday.
""We're not going to lose thousands of pounds on haircuts in one day - there's only two of us,"" Phil said - adding that he had to cut a third staff member's job at the end of the first national lockdown.
But Phil, 48, added he has generally been happy with the way the government has set out rules for businesses. ""It's been confusing at times but by and large I've understood what's going on.""
Another business person, who wanted to remain anonymous, runs a bowling alley in south-east England and said it was ""mentally exhausting"" to have to keep up with what he felt were last-minute changes to the rules set out by the government.
His business will lose a day of trading as a result of having to open on Thursday, not Wednesday.
""The leisure industry isn't a tap you can turn on and off at a moment's notice,"" he said.
""Stock goes out of date. Customers are scared to book because we keep having to open and close all the time, seemingly at a whim.
""The short term-ism does nobody any favours and whilst I completely agree and understand that the virus needs containing, we have been left out to dry and treated like second-class citizens.""
However, some businesses have had time to bring forward their opening times - and are celebrating the extra day of trading.
""Christmas has truly come early,"" the restaurant chain Pizza Express said in a tweet as it announced that it would be moving its reopening date from 3 December to 2 December.
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said there had been some confusion among the trade association's members about when their businesses could reopen but the government had since clarified it to would be from 00:01 GMT on 2 December.
""Over the past nine months, the flow of information from the government has been slow and lacking in clarity,"" she added.
""Businesses have had to react to announcements regarding opening, closures and changing of restrictions at short notice.
""It has been a theme of this year that businesses have not been given adequate warning about changes that impact their operation.""
Mike Cherry, national chair at the Federation for Small Businesses, added that the frequent changes to lockdown rules meant it was ""no surprise"" that there was ""frustration, anxiety and confusion in the business community""."
"Unlike the many species which stalk the shallow, coastal waters that fisheries exploit all year round, pelagic sharks roam the vast open oceans. These are the long-distance travellers of the submarine world and include the world’s largest fish, the whale shark, and also one of the fastest fish in the sea, the shortfin mako shark, capable of swimming at 40mph. Because these species range far from shore, you might expect them to escape most of the lines and nets that fishing vessels cast. But over the last 50 years, industrial scale fisheries have extended their reach across the world’s oceans and tens of millions of pelagic sharks are now caught every year for their valuable fins and meat. On average, large pelagic sharks account for over half of all shark species identified in catches worldwide. The toll this has taken on species such as the shortfin mako has prompted calls to introduce catch limits in the high seas – areas of the ocean beyond national jurisdiction where there is little or no management for the majority of shark species. We wanted to know where the ocean’s shark hotspots are – the places where lots of different species gather – and how much these places are worked by fishing boats. We took up the challenge of finding out where pelagic sharks hang out by satellite tracking their movements with electronic tags. This approach by our international team of over 150 scientists from 26 countries has an important advantage over fishery catch records. Rather than showing where a fishing boat found them, it can precisely map all of the places sharks visit.  For a new study published in Nature we tracked nearly 2,000 sharks from 23 different species, including great whites, blue sharks, shortfin mako and tiger sharks. We were able to map their positions in unprecedented detail and discern the most visited hotspots where sharks feed, breed and rest. Hotspots were often located in frontal zones – boundaries in the sea between different water masses that can have the best conditions of temperature and nutrients for phytoplankton to bloom, which attracts masses of zooplankton, as well as the fish and squid that sharks eat. Then we calculated how much these hotspots overlapped with global fleets of large, longline fishing vessels, which we also tracked by satellite. This type of fishing gear is used very widely on the high seas and catches more pelagic sharks than trawls and other gear. Each longline vessel is capable of deploying a 100km long line bearing over 1,000 baited hooks. We found that even the most remote parts of the ocean that are many miles from land offer pelagic sharks little refuge from industrial-scale fishing fleets. One in four of the places sharks visited each month overlapped with the areas longline fishing vessels operated in.  Sharks such as the North Atlantic blue and the shortfin mako – which fishers also target for their fins and meat – were much more likely to encounter these vessels, with as much as 76% of the places these species visited most in each month overlapping with where longline vessels were fishing. Even internationally protected species such as great whites and porbeagle sharks encountered longline vessels in half of their tracked range. It’s now clear that much of the world’s fishing activity on the high seas is centred on shark hotspots, which longlines rake for much of the year. Many large sharks, which are already endangered, face a future without refuge from industrial fishing in the places they gather. The maps of shark hotspots and longline fishing activity that we created can at least provide a blueprint for where large-scale marine protected areas aimed at conserving sharks could be set. Outside of these, strict quotas could reduce catches. The United Nations is creating a high seas treaty for protecting ocean biodiversity – negotiations are due to continue in August 2019 in New York. They’ll consider large-scale marine protected areas for the high seas and we’ll suggest where these could be located to best protect pelagic sharks. Satellite monitoring could give real-time signals of where sharks and other threatened creatures such as turtles and whales are gathering. Tracking where these species roam and where fishers interact with them will help patrol vessels monitor these high-risk zones more efficiently. Such management action is overdue for many shark populations in the high seas. Take North Atlantic shortfin makos – not only are they overfished 
and endangered, but now we know they have no respite from longline fishing during many months of the year in the places they gather most often. Some of these shark hotspots may not exist in the near future if action isn’t taken now to conserve these species and the habitats they depend on."

Coronavirus is forcing nearly everyone to rethink their normal Christmas plans this year. And that includes the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be spending the festive season ""quietly"" at Windsor Castle rather than at Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said. The Royal Family has been making the trek to the Queen's Norfolk estate every Christmas since 1988, according to the official web site. ""Like everyone, they hope things will get back to normal in 2021,"" a palace spokesperson said.
An argument over whether a stricter Covid tiers system should come into effect in England is still going on in Parliament, with Boris Johnson facing a threatened rebellion from his own backbenchers. Even if they do rebel, the measures are likely to go through, thanks to Labour and the SNP abstaining on the vote, expected at around 19:00 GMT. You can look up what tier your area is likely to be in, and the rules, in this handy guide.

On May 18, the Environmental Protection Agency took sides with opponents of Pebble Partnership, a company exploring a copper deposit, some 200 miles west of Anchorage, Alaska. Pebble is probably the largest accessible aggregation of copper‐​bearing minerals in North America.



The Obama Administration has been under relentless pressure to stop Pebble—much more of the pressure emanating from hordes of bicoastal environmentalists as opposed to citizens of sparsely populated Alaska. EPA’s _Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska_ is designed as the first step to do just that, before the Pebble developers have even submitted one permit application.



All of this has very little to do with the welfare of Alaskans. It has much more to do with the President pleasing his environmental base. In fact, it seems that the less that one has been to Alaska, the more one knows what’s best for it. The dinosaur media, especially in northeastern cities, is particularly exercised about the stretch of desolate Alaska that is Pebble—land that was traded by the federal government to the State for mineral development, in exchange for the some land that became Lake Clark Park and Preserve.



EPA’s Assessment ignores this history and the positive economic impact $7 billion of new infrastructure would bring to a place without a diverse economy. The Assessment is designed to be used for regulation based upon the “precautionary principle”. This darling of the global left states that “if something has the potential to cause harm, it shouldn’t be done”. The UN’s a big fan and reports are that they have been sniffing around parts of Bristol Bay looking for a way to get in on the Pebble issue. In fact, its Framework Convention on Climate Change—the scaffold upon which the failed Kyoto Protocol on global warming was erected‐​is based on the precautionary principle, noting that a lack “full scientific certainty” should not provide grounds to preclude regulation.



In other words, if you can’t prove that something will not cause harm—pretty much a logical impossibility—you can’t do it. The precautionary principle is the opposite of the much more productive Song of the South, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.



Under the precautionary principle, there is simply no way that antibiotics would ever have been marketed, had scientists had known of the potential for bacteria to mutate into resistant strains. There would be no airplanes or cars (they can and will crash, you know). Even today, New Jersey and Oregon won’t let you pump gas because your car could explode (and the price of gas must therefore go up).



EPA did its Assessment in response to a petition by a collection of environmental groups requesting that the Agency pre‐​emptively prevent Pebble before it can present its plan and show how it will comply with environemtal laws. So far, that has cost those making the exploration investment about $500 million. The ostensible basis for EPA siding with the environmental opponents is an obscure section of the Clean Water Act that supposedly grants EPA the authority to assess environmental impacts of human activity on watersheds.



While the Agency says that its Assessment passes no judgment on whether or not Pebble proceeds, it is also clear that the document is precisely and specifically designed to be the basis for precautionary principle‐​based litigation. Evidence of this is that it launched the Assessment with a big press conference in Seattle, of all places.



The Assessment assumes a large open‐​pit mine, but Pebble has yet to decide between an underground, a pit, or some combination. When all is said and done, here’s what the Assessment takes hundreds of pages to say:



• An open‐​pit mine and associated tailings will obstruct or alter a exceptionally small percentage of small streams in the massive Bristol Bay watershed that supports the world’s largest natural sockeye salmon fishery.



• An infinitesimal portion of the region’s massive wetlands will be destroyed.



• Some fish will die.



• Some people in the indigenous cultures of Bristol Bay, and hungry bears, may therefore have fewer fish.



• The history of Alaskan mining shows that piles of rocks (tailings) do not go away.



Translation: There is some potential for a—perhaps detectable—effect on the culture and ecology of the Bristol Bay watershed. So, if you want to invoke the precautionary principle to stop Pebble, gentlemen, start your lawyers.



And when that occurs, people should ask, as they smugly drive their hybrids (and pressure the government to mandate millions more) where the copper that wires these vehicles is to come from? If price is any guide, supplies are increasingly tight. Wouldn’t it be a shame if the cost of slamming Pebble shut was to price hybrids even more out of the market?

"**The boss of the biggest Welsh-owned brewery has called new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday.**
Brains said the majority of its 1,500 staff will be put on furlough on 80% of their wages.
Chief executive Alistair Darby said the earlier firebreak cost it Â£1.6m.
Welsh pubs and restaurants will be banned from selling alcohol from Friday and must close after 18:00 GMT.
The Welsh Government says the rules are needed to tackle a rise in cases.
Opposition leaders challenged the decision in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday.
The Welsh Conservatives' Paul Davies questioned how pubs could be expected to survive on ""pop and pork scratchings"".
Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, warned public trust was ""being eroded"" due to a ""lack of logic"" behind the government's approach.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said the step - which still allows for takeaway alcohol to be sold - had been taken in the ""inescapable context"" of the spread of coronavirus.
Later he came under pressure from two Labour backbenchers - with Blaenau Gwent's Alun Davies demanding to see the evidence underpinning the decision.
He told the Senedd that despite the efforts that had been made by businesses ""we continue to face a public health emergency here in Wales"".
There were ""no easy decisions"", he said, telling Mr Price it ""wasn't possible to have a logic that is watertight on every single occasion and on every single aspect"".
The evidence for the decision was the same, he said, as that which had led governments across the UK and across Europe to take similar actions.
Pubs are closed in tier three areas in England, while in level three areas in Scotland they are not able to serve alcohol.
Brains directly employs around 1,500 people and has 300 tenants as well as suppliers and regular trades people.
Mr Darby said the new rules for pubs were ""insulting"" and ""a huge slap in the face"" for the sector.
He called on politicians to ""stop changing their mind"" on what is required, and said the move suggests pubs and restaurants are areas of ""high transmission"".
""It's hugely frustrating and a bit insulting. It says people are not making the effort being asked of them,"" he said.
Mr Darby said the decision will be felt by many thousands of other workers who supply the industry, such as electricians, plumbers and caterers.
Mr Drakeford has said there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths without action taken this winter.
But the Brains boss said: ""The sector has done more than its fair share to ensure those potential deaths are avoided.
""And at the end of this, we will be asking, if lives aren't saved, what the answer will be?""
Adam Price called for a ""sensible compromise"", allowing hospitality to serve alcohol until 19:00, with a ban on alcohol sales at off-licences and supermarkets after that time to ""to discourage people from going into each other's homes"".
Paul Davies described the decision as ""catastrophic"" and ""devastating"" for businesses.
""Pubs and restaurants in areas where transmission rates are low will rightly feel upset that their businesses is being put at risk, through no fault of their own,"" he added.
Both called for Mr Drakeford to reveal the scientific evidence underpinning the decision.
""There is no absence of evidence,"" Mr Drakeford told the Senedd.
Later, he added that similar restrictions have been introduced in ""all parts of the UK and across the world"".
""The consumption of alcohol has been identified by health officials and policy makers internationally as increasing the risk of transmission, as social distancing can break down as people have an altered perception of risk,"" he said.
The first minister added that data from contact tracing had regularly highlighted hospitality ""as venues where contacts of infectious individuals are identified"".
UK government cabinet minister Michael Gove said restrictions had been lifted too quickly after Wales' 17-day firebreak.
He told BBC Breakfast he sympathised with the Welsh Government, but added: ""As a result of doing that, the virus once more got out of control, so they've had to slam the brakes on again.
""The example of Wales shows what can happen if you lift the restrictions in too blanket a way too soon.""
The first minister promised firms hit by the restrictions they would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package"" anywhere in the UK.
However Mr Darby said the support ""would not touch the sides"".
As an Â£80m turnover business, Brains spent Â£500,000 in personal protective equipment (PPE) and digital technology for pre-booking, while it has ""surrendered"" huge capacity and lost summer trading, Mr Darby added.
He said: ""My message to politicians is 'you have to stop changing your mind on what is required in the sector'.
""We have done more than our fair share to ensure potential deaths are avoided at the end of this.""
David Cattrall, managing director of Harlech Foodservice, warned that many hospitality businesses would not survive the latest round of restrictions.
""There is a palpable sense of frustration, bewilderment and anger at the restrictions being placed upon the hospitality sector in north and mid Wales,"" he said.
""The rate of the virus is lower here than in south Wales so it defies logic that we are being subjected to this damaging one-size-fits-all policy.
""The run-up to Christmas is when the sector makes enough money to keep them going through the quiet months of January and February but it's clear now that Christmas has been cancelled as far as the hospitality sector is concerned.""
Businesses need an exit plan and reassurance they will be able to open at Easter ""as a matter of urgency"", he added.
KellyÂ Jolliffe, owner and landlady of The Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, said she was ""gutted"" about the new restrictions.
""I was expecting it, I was hoping that it would only be shutting at 6pm, which I think we could all have managed with and could have all worked around,"" she said.
""But when he banned the alcohol, I just thought there's no point really - we're a pub!""
She told Radio Wales Breakfast she has decided to close, despite having got the pub ready for the Christmas trade.
""We were all decked out, all socially distanced, bookings coming in, everybody working around the regulations,"" she said.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry were upset, but admitted there was ""no perfect balance"" between protecting public health and businesses.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, he added: ""What we can do is make sure more of us will be here in the future to celebrate life events."""
"Reaching net zero emissions has become the focal point of government efforts to halt climate and ecological breakdown. It is easy to aim for but much more difficult to deliver – and worse, we may be focusing on the wrong objective. During my past seven years spent as chief scientific adviser at the UK’s environment ministry, it has become clear to me that even if governments succeed in reaching net zero by 2050, it may do nothing significant to halt environmental decline. To produce goods and services, the global economy needs materials – and that means growing or mining natural resources. Since the industrial revolution, the rate at which we have been using these resources has been increasing, and in the last 15 years this rate has accelerated considerably. As an example, China used 50% more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in the whole of the 20th century. The second of Newton’s seminal laws of thermodynamics tells us that the outputs of a stable system have to equal its inputs – and the global economy is no exception. Because the economy – and in particular the circular economy – is still growing, the increase in waste lags a little behind the increase in inputs of natural resources. However, retention of materials in the economy is temporary. All materials will eventually exit as waste, whether in minutes or centuries. Greenhouse gases are among the quickest of the global economy’s waste products to be felt, and eliminating emissions is essential if we are to halt catastrophic global heating. But focusing our efforts on curbing one of the waste outputs without addressing how much we’re putting into the system is like putting a bung in a car’s tail pipe and hoping nothing will go wrong. Everything we consume needs energy to create, and while we are making progress at reducing the energy costs per unit consumption, current evidence does not indicate that the total energy costs of consumption are declining. Even if the world’s energy demands stay the same, our transition away from fossil fuels will require massive amounts of new renewable infrastructure, which will in turn require vast quantities of raw materials. Global stocks of most basic resources aren’t low – although sand for construction is already becoming scarce. But when you consider that the projected trend is for energy demand to nearly double by 2050 as developing economies consume more, skyrocketing resource use is likely to become a serious problem. As the most accessible deposits of resources become depleted, the energy and environmental costs of accessing further reserves increase. Eventually, we will be faced with a dangerous excess of new forms of waste, or worse, run out of a crucial building block of the global economy. If we think that technology can come to the rescue, then we are almost certainly mistaken. Claims about the rapidity with which we can transition away from fossil fuels are exaggerated, and evidence suggests that levels of innovation within advanced economies is declining, in spite of continuous investment in research and development. If we continue on our current trajectory, then by 2050 the amount of waste we produce, in all its forms, is likely to be three to four times what we produce now. It’s difficult to say exactly how soon resource use and resulting waste will become a problem with existential implications. But its crucial that we stop treating the planet as a bottomless pool of resources long before that point. We must act now, before the task becomes any harder. To do this, as a society we must focus not on emissions themselves, but on the root cause behind them – consumption. If we truly want to reduce the damaging waste produced by our global economy, then we need to reduce the amount of materials we put into it. We need policies that are explicitly designed to reduce demand and build a very different model of economic prosperity. Governments need to pull their three main strings – public investment, regulation and taxation – in concert, and across all departments. That’s a gargantuan task. To oversee such a shift, governments could create a department with the explicit remit of realigning the entrenched economic priorities of all other departments. At a fundamental level, this means moving away from maximising growth, and incorporating ecological principles into economics. The fact that we can currently exchange non-material wealth – in which growth, mainly driven by the services economy, is potentially limitless – for material wealth is placing unsustainable demands on limited natural resources. Meanwhile, the environmental costs of these resources are usually not accounted for, and natural resources with no commercial value are treated as essentially valueless. Only by addressing these flaws can we redress the imbalance between the short-term value of consuming and the long-term value of safeguarding our environment. There is no free lunch when it comes to halting climate and environmental breakdown. It is simply not feasible for everybody on the planet to consume at the rate of the average European of North American, and we should not create the expectation that this is possible. Instead, established economic powers and their citizens must drastically reduce the amount they demand of the global economy. If not, our efforts to live in harmony with the natural world will join the waste heap too. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated, edited by P Gosselin
Earlier this year the USA was tested by unexpectedly cool temperatures. Die Welt summed up the situation on January 9, 2014:
According to the German Weather Service (DWD) the current cold wave in North America is the harshest in 2 decades. […] The peak of the cold snap was reached on January 6-7 when polar air dipped down to southern USA and Northern Mexico, said a published report by DWD expert Susanne Haeseler and Christina Lefebvre on Thursday. At night temperatures dropped to 30 below zero, and even down to 40 below in Central Canada. In Chicago the high temperature on January 6 was only -25.5°C.” 
If it had been a heat wave, then a connection to the projected climate catastrophe would have been fabricated in short order. However, extreme cold snaps such as this recent one traditionally had been simply played down as “weather and not climate“. But over the last few years it appears a new strategy has been put to use by IPCC scientists: Not only heat waves are a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but now so are cold snaps. A double-pack is always better. And the German end-of-world believers at Klimaretter are always front and centre in this respect (excerpt from 8 January 2014):
Is the icy cold in North America a result of climate change? Indeed the weather pattern that is currently freezing Americans is very unusual. But whether or not this has something to do with global warming is still being controversially discussed by experts.”
Next Klimaretter explains that climate change nailed down the Jet Stream in the atmosphere and that in turn impacted low pressure system “Christina” so much that it was able to intensify over North America. Klimaretter adds:
This is how climate scientist Thomas Jung of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research sees it. “It cannot be dismissed altogether that this situation has something to do with climate change. However, in my opinion the probable explanation is that this situation is a random variability of the atmosphere. It happens sometimes.” Other scientists like Dim Coumou of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research [PIK] see a connection to climate change. The extreme cold waves have become more frequent over the last winters, Coumou told news agency AFP. His explanation: The polar vortex feeds on the temperature difference between the Arctic and the middle latitudes. Because the Arctic is warming faster than average, this temperature difference is decreasing – and with it the strength of the polar vortex. As a result it can break out more easily, says Coumou. However, Thomas Jung of the Alfred Wegener Institute has some doubts: From our research we are able to confirm a connection between the retreat in Arctic sea ice and the colder winters in Europe. This impact however is relatively small and thus in my opinion cannot alone explain such extreme weather events.’ Works from climate scientist Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University indicate that the unusual stability of the Jet Stream can be linked to climate change. Also Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research assumes the same. “The rare temperature pattern is connected to the wild jet stream”, the scientist twittered.”

Klimaretter does allow a few skeptic opinions, but mostly the alarmist blogsite provides an extensive platform for those proposing the Jet Stream blockade. That these are fringe opinions is not at all clear in the Klimaretter article. Most fellow scientists in the field view the ideas of Coumou, Rahmstorf and other PIK scientists with skepticism. There are even opposing, counter publications (see out blog article “Study from Colorado State University contradicts the PIK: retreat of Arctic sea ice does not lead to extreme weather“). Also Judith Curry thinks little of linking US cold snaps to climate change. At her blog Climate Etc. she wrote on January 7, 2014:
Is global warming causing the polar vortex? In a word, no. […] The media are mostly in stupid mode over this one. Cliff Mass provides a good overview, the punch lines:
The bottom line: the claims that greenhouse warming causes more cold waves like we have seen this week really seems to be without any basis in observational evidence or in theory. The media needs to stop pushing this unsupported argument. It is SO frustrating that every major weather event causes such claims and counterclaims to be aired, with many media outlets unable to do the minimal research that would allow them to give the public more dependable information. All this bogus reporting has done substantial damage, with many American’s believing that global warming is already causing our winter weather to become more extreme, while the observational evidence suggests no such thing. One day some sociologists will study this situation and the psychological elements that drove it.”
So is the Jet Stream today really flowing more slowly than it did in former times? A team from the University of Reading and the British Antarctic Survey lead by Tim Woolings published an analysis of the Jet Stream’s development in the North Atlantic over the past 140 years in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society in August 2013. The result was clear: The Jet Stream escapades today are no different then in the past. The current behavior is completely within the range of known natural variability. In the paper’s abstract Woolings and his colleagues write:
When viewed in this longer term context, the variations of recent decades do not appear unusual and recent values of jet latitude and speed are not unprecedented in the historical record.”
Also Italian meteorologist Guido Guidi was not able to discover any long-term trend in an analysis of data over the last 66 years. Moreover climate models are still unable to reproduce the polar vortex, so reported Horwitz et al. 2009. Interestingly Veretenenko and Ogurtsov (in print) have even found a relationship between the development of the polar vortex and fluctuations in solar activity. Curiously, in 1974, Time Magazine interpreted similar polar vortices as being the result of global cooling.

"The main reason for the gender gaps at work  —   why women are paid less, why they’re less likely to reach the top levels of companies, and why they’re more likely to stop working after having children  —   is employers’ expectation that people spend long hours at their desks, research has shown. It’s especially difficult for women because they have disproportionate responsibility for caregiving. Flexibility regarding the time and place that work gets done would go a long way toward closing the gaps, economists say. Yet when people ask for it, especially parents, they can be penalized in pay and promotions. Social scientists call it the flexibility stigma, and it’s the reason that even when companies offer such policies, they’re not widely used. A new job search company, Werk, is trying to address the problem by negotiating for flexibility with employers before posting jobs, so employees don’t have to. All the positions listed on the Werk site, including some from Facebook, Uber and Samsung, are highly skilled jobs that offer some sort of control over the time and place of work. People can apply to jobs that let them work away from the office all the time or some of the time, and at hours other than    part time or with minimal travel. Another option gives workers the freedom to adjust their schedules, no questions asked, because of unpredictable obligations, like a sleepless night with a toddler or a trip to the emergency room with an older parent. “Nobody wants to be the female in the department who says, ‘My kid threw up on me this morning I can’t come in,’ ” said Annie Dean, who worked as a lawyer before starting Werk with Anna Auerbach, a former consultant. “Eighty percent of companies say they offer flexibility, but it’s a black market topic. You raise it and you’re not taken seriously. ” For now, Werk is a limited experiment. Most of the employers are small companies, and it is aimed at an elite group of women  —   highly educated and on a leadership track. But it could provide lessons for how to improve work and make it more equal for a broader group. Women who have less education or are paid hourly wages have significantly less flexibility than professional women to begin with. It makes working and caregiving that much harder. Motherhood presents a different challenge for the elite women that Werk was made for. The careers that pay the most and require the most education, like business and law, also have the most gender inequality. Why? Economists have found it’s a result of the long hours and limited flexibility. When educated mothers leave their jobs, it’s often because they feel pushed out by inflexible employers, according to sociologists. It’s a big reason the top of corporate America is still so male 4 percent of the chief executives of companies in the S. P. 500 are women. “They want top leadership roles,” said Ms. Dean, who thought of the idea for Werk with Ms. Auerbach after they each had children. “The only reason they’re not getting there is they’re going through this phase in their life where working 16 hours at a single desk is incompatible with their life. ” Seventy percent of working mothers say having a flexible work schedule is extremely important to them, according to a Pew survey. So do 48 percent of working fathers. Workplace flexibility reduces turnover and   conflict, according to much of the research, including a study by 10 researchers from seven universities published in December. Yet when people get flexible work arrangements, they’re generally isolated cases  —   for longtime employees whom companies trust and don’t want to lose. The employers using Werk say they get access to highly skilled employees who might not otherwise apply. Gerard Masci, founder and chief executive of Lowercase, a   eyeglass maker in Brooklyn, just hired a vice president for communications on Werk. She works   and remotely, except for monthly   meetings. “I don’t care if this week you work less if in a month you work more, and whether they work in the space or not is irrelevant,” Mr. Masci said. “All I care about is the productivity in the end. ” “The happier she is in her flexibility,” he said, “the more engaged she’s going to be in her work. ” Erin Fahs turned to Werk after her husband was transferred to Fort Myers, Fla. and she needed to find a new job. She wanted to work part time and from home because she was pregnant and the primary caregiver for their    daughter. She found three jobs on Werk that would let her do that, and took one as the business manager for the Collective Good, which does consulting for nonprofits. “Getting to have those direct conversations with the C. E. O. about what matters made it so much different from when I was applying for jobs earlier in my career,” Ms. Fahs, 33, said. She has a baby sitter 10 hours a week and works the other 10 hours when her daughter is sleeping. She has a few set meetings, which she attends via Google Hangouts  —   and gives her daughter an iPad for a diversion if there is a work emergency. She plans to expand to   work after maternity leave. This type of flexibility, while valuable, would not magically solve workplace problems. For one, any solution would need to be for both women and men. Some jobs have to be done at a certain time and place, like teaching and food service. And even at companies where it’s possible to let employees work at the time and place of their choosing, a different type of manager is required. Best Buy tried it for corporate employees, then revoked it. “There are a vast number of jobs that could be handled in an    way, but it’s just easier to measure performance by presence,” said   Slaughter, the chief executive of the think tank New America, who has written about gender and work and advises Werk. “So it is a real adjustment for managers. ”"

Joe Romm has cited the “shout them down” phrase in his references to WUWT and my name no less than 13 times in his blogs:

Last week, I finally had enough of his shenanigans and emailed him, and he made a change to the most recent story for which I thank him, but the other stories remain unchanged. He also suggested in his reply email that I make a note on the blog entry that it is D’Aleo’s words, not mine, and I’ve done that.
Also last week it was revealed that Joe Romm had concerns over accuracy of the blog posts at Skeptical Science: Skeptical Science gets Romm-Bombed
Romm wrote to John Cook, and Cook summarized in their secret offline forum :
“Just got this email from Joe Romm: You must do more post vetting. More errors are creeping into posts and it will start making people like me wary of using them.” – John Cook [Skeptical Science], December 2, 2011
So in that spirit of accuracy, I would think that Joe would want to go back and correct his 12 other mistakes on that “shout them down” phrase he is so fond of using. We’ll see.
But here’s a test to see just how much integrity he has. You see it seems there has in fact been a coordinated effort on the part of Skeptical Science to do exactly what Joe Romm accuses WUWT of doing. Here’s some of that dialog as posted by PopularTechnology.net:
============================================================
“I posted over at Politico just recently. Hey, we can tag team it a bit if you like, use time zone differences.” – Glenn Tamblyn [Skeptical Science], February 10, 2011
“I think this is a highly effective method of dealing with various blogs and online articles where these discussions pop up. Flag them, discuss them and then send in the troops to hammer down what are usually just a couple of very vocal people. It seems like lots of us are doing similar work, cruising comments sections online looking for disinformation to crush. I spend hours every day doing exactly this. If we can coordinate better and grow the “team of crushers” then we could address all the anti-science much more effectively.” – Rob Honeycutt [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
“Rob, Your post is music to my ears. I’ve been advocating the need to create a “crusher crew” for quite some time. I was not however able to get much traction on it with fellow environmental activists here in South Carolina or nationally. Like you, I spend (much to my wife’s chagrin) many hours each day posting comments on articles. One of haunts was the USA Today website […] The bottom line, would you be willing to patrol articles posted on the USA Today website?” – John Hartz [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
This started a new forum discussion entitled, “Crusher Crew“.
“Badgersouth and I were just discussing the potential of setting up a coordinated “Crusher Crew” where we could pull our collective time and knowledge together in order to pounce on overly vocal deniers on various comments sections of blogs and news articles.” – Rob Honeycutt [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
“May I suggest first on our list as being the *#1 Science Blog* “Watts up with that”? They get a few people come there to engage from time to time but rarely a coordinated effort.” – Robert W. [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
“I think it might be better to start out with smaller fish. Build a community and a team. Find some methods and strategies that work. Then start moving up the denier food chain with our targets set on WUWT. I could see this expanding into a broad team of 100 or more people (outside the scope of this SkS forum of course). […] We just need to raise our collective voices to drown them out. I would venture to guess that most people here know of 4 or 5 regulars on comments sections that would be interested in coordinating their efforts. I know probably 10 or 20 people who would like to help with this.” – Rob Honeycutt [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
This eco-strike squad was highly endorsed by John Cook,
“The Rapid Response Network would be a good way to coordinate this kind of activity, identifying new articles, logging responses, supporting each other. Can i suggest if a group engage in this, that they use the RRN as beta testers to he’ll me develop and refine the system?” – John Cook [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011

===============================================================
I had to chuckle at this admission:
“May I suggest first on our list as being the *#1 Science Blog* “Watts up with that”? They get a few people come there to engage from time to time but rarely a coordinated effort.”
Even more hilarious, is this comment left by Skeptical Science author and moderator on Romm’s first essay where he bring the “shout them down” issue up:

Rob Honeycutt says:
 March 4, 2011 at 2:50 pm
I think Anthony Watts relishes his position as a climate thug.
Given the evidence cited above for his own behavior, that’s a classic case of projection by Honeycutt if I’ve ever seen one.
So now the integrity test for Joe Romm is: will you condemn Skeptical Science for actual organized behavior of the same kind that you condemn me of from an off-the cuff comment made by a guest blogger?
So, as it turns out Joe D’Aleo was right, there is an organized effort “…to team up on the comment section to defend the undefensible.“. Maybe he didn’t phrase the call to action well, but all D’Aleo was doing is urging people to exercise their right to free speech if they choose to disagree. There’s no organized effort. I’ve received no complaints from Forbes or any other online venue.
We’ll see how Mr. Romm handles this integrity test when it comes to pointing out the “drown them out” calls of his own misbehaving friends. If he has any integrity he’ll condemn the Skeptical Science organized practice in the same way he has condemned WUWT and me for that offhand remark by D’Aleo.
Ball’s in your court Joe.
================================================================
UPDATE: Joe D’Aleo responds in comments:
Joe D’Aleo says:
 October 1, 2012 at 3:34 pm

Guilty as charged. I posted that in frustration after many attempts by me and others to post comments refuting obviously flawed claims on numerous blogs that were blocked by moderators. That site, like WUWT was not restrictive, which I encouraged people to respond to. Obviously if readers did not agree with me, they would not /should not do so.
Many times after failing to have my comments appear on some blogs and sites, I have resorted to sending an email with facts, charts and diagrams to the author to try and educate them. SInce you can’t do that in comments and a picture says a thousand words, it may be more effective, but my guess is that they just discard.
Downside then is my argument is never seen by the knee jerk commenters with their litanys…”obviously shills for big oil”, ” 97% of scientists agree”, “deniers are anti-science” , “it is far worse than we ever thought”, “the climate is nearing the tipping point”, “deniers don’t care about the air and water”……that fill the comment section.
Any comments that get through ignore the facts I present and attack my integrity, reasons for not believing, and intelligence. They go ad hominem.
As more soylent green says so well, since this i not a scientific debate and never was is “shout them” down really inappropriate?
By the way a skeptic was invited to give a talk in New England on natural factors and a professor organized a group to come in and disrupt the talk – not wait for the Q&A session after with tough questions but to try and make it impossible for the speaker to present his case. I experienced that kind of resistance twice in talks in Vermont where a group tried to convince the museum to cancel my talk and the second when a talk at a college was constantly interrupted with challenges ironically to pictures of bad climate sites. The person involved kept insisting these were not real sites. It was in the early days of surfacestations.org and I used stations from Anthony, Roger Pielke Sr. and the late John Daly.

"Was it just a year ago that Katie Holmes, Jennifer Hudson and Lucy Liu snatched up most of the light and much of the air at Zac Posen’s fall show? A scant six months later, Mr. Posen was host to a somewhat less lustrous contingent, one that included Malin Akerman, Kelly Bensimon and Olivia Culpo. (Who?) Last February, Claire Danes, Laura Linney and Amy Schumer lent their aggregate star power to Narciso Rodriguez’s show. By September, the designer’s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by Jessica Alba and Jessica Seinfeld. So it went. And now, on the eve of another round of New York shows, it seems safe to predict a similar thinning of celebrity ranks, as top film and music personalities disappear from their gilded   perches, their dwindling presence matched only, some say, by their diminishing impact. “You can still expect to see certain celebrities in the front row,” said Tommy Hilfiger, who began trumpeting his alignment with entertainment world players as far back as the 1980s. But these days, Mr. Hilfiger suggested, designers and major Seventh Avenue brands need to rethink their marketing strategies. In itself, he said, “a star’s presence does nothing to move the needle. ” That realization, somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles, accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance. “In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the shows were really ” said Billy Farrell, who heads BFA, an events photography agency. “As a house photographer, I used to get a long list of faces. Now at any given show, one or a maximum of five celebrities are guaranteed to go backstage or sit in the front row wearing the designer clothes. ” That paucity of   personalities is ascribed to a string of factors: celebrity overexposure, a generalized fashion fatigue and, chief among them, shrinking fashion budgets. “People don’t have as much money as they used to, and they’re scared,” said Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist. Aware that the payoff may be negligible, many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of, say, a Jessica Chastain, a Julianne Moore or, for that matter, a Lady Gaga, pop culture luminaries who, once they arrive, may or may not deign to speak to the press. For designers, the topic is a touchy one. Among those who declined to comment were Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig of Marchesa, Carolina Herrera, Marc Jacobs, Mr. Rodriguez, Jeremy Scott, Diane von Furstenberg, Alexander Wang and Vera Wang. But publicists and others strategizing behind the scenes were more voluble, citing, among other causes, a certain jadedness among consumers. “People can tell it’s a paid front row,” Ms. Cutrone said. “Does anyone really believe that Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger are going to Seven jeans because they like Seven jeans?” More troubling, still, is the widening view that fashion itself is losing much of its vaunted cachet. “The shows are not cool anymore,” said Teri Agins, the author of the 2014 book “Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers,” which chronicles the evolution of the celebrity front row. European houses may still attract stars of a certain caliber, Ms. Agins noted, some drawn by Europe’s cachet, others compelled by   cosmetic and marketing contracts. But in New York, she said, “the novelty is gone. ” Oversaturation has played a role. In recent years, invitations were issued, vetted and approved by teams of publicists, Hollywood agents,   stylists and, as often as not, the stars themselves, many of whom are snapped each season hopscotching from show to show, their influence diluted by their ubiquity. “We sort of cooked our golden goose,” said James LaForce, a veteran fashion publicist. “At the end of the day, all their pictures seemed to run together. ” “We’re at the end of that cycle now,” he added. “It feels   something from another era. ” By most accounts, that era dawned in the early to   when the shows, once scattered in showrooms, galleries and ballrooms all over town, were brought together under the tents at Bryant Park. At the time designer front rows were judiciously seeded with “friends of the house,” among them society figures, and the occasional television personality, Broadway ingénue or authentic megastar. “They were people we dressed, people I often had dinner with, people whose children we knew and sometimes dressed,” the designer Dennis Basso said. At Mr. Basso’s fashion extravaganzas over the years, Diane Sawyer might have been seen rubbing shoulders with Ivana Trump, Martha Stewart spied sitting flank to flank alongside Mary J. Blige. “The celebrity front row was a form of preshow entertainment,” Mr. Basso recalled. It generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide. In that seemingly innocent era, shows were   trade events, largely the province of store buyers, journalists and a smattering of   ladies who lunched. That picture altered in the   when Uma Thurman wore a   Prada dress to the Oscars. “It was a sort of milestone,” said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York, “a sign that it was groovy for a designer to dress a celebrity. ” So groovy, in fact, that before long the celebrity front row went from a mildly provocative attraction to fashion’s main event, transforming, as Ms. Agins writes, “what was once a clubby ritual for fashion insiders into a multiplatform extravaganza showcased in print, on TV and everywhere on the internet. ” In those heady days, she observed, the front row itself became part of the content of fashion show. Today, some argue, that content is debased. “What constitutes a celebrity now has changed,” said Fern Mallis, a fashion consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “It’s no longer necessarily that   Hollywood diva. ” The diva, it seems, has ceded her power to models and social media megastars like Gigi Hadid, Kylie Jenner and Irina Shayk, pop idols who bring to the table a large internet following but lack the gravitas of Ms. Chastain and her rarefied peers. “The rise of celebrity bloggers, reality stars and others who are famous simply for being famous turns a lot of people off,” said Leslie Sloane, a prominent Hollywood publicist. “Those girls may be lovely, but they’re not fashion. ” Just as   is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum. Lady Gaga appeared last season at the show of Brandon Maxwell, her    posing gamely for photographers but turning away reporters. Also taking no interviews were Ms. Holmes at Zac Posen, and Zoê Kravitz and Ms. Jenner at Alexander Wang, whose show in September was one of the few that attracted marquee names like Madonna and her daughter Lourdes. That kind of drawing power does not come cheap. Hard figures are elusive, but insiders estimate that fees for attendance can range from $25, 000 to more than $100, 000. In the   practice known industrywide as    an   attraction like Angelina Jolie could command close to $1 million, Mr. Hilfiger said. Such sums, which vary according to a celebrity’s clout, are expected to cover the cost of   airfare and hotel accommodations, as well as wardrobe, hair, makeup and other amenities. They are   numbers, for sure. But just two or three years ago, they were routinely factored into many designers’ marketing budgets. In distributing funds, Mr. LaForce said, “we would game the situation. ” It was a little like a commodities market, sums parceled out “based on who was available and who would take what,” he said, adding, “Still, in the end we would say it was absolutely worth it. ” For some designers, it still is. “To have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense of heightened reality,” said Michael Kors, whose celebrity turnout last season included Emily Blunt Cynthia Erivo, the   winning Broadway star and Sienna Miller. “You see the clothes on the runway, then you see our clothes from the last show on the celebrities in the front row, and you get it. The message has come full circle. ” No one would argue that the fame game is entirely played out. But for some designers, attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars. “A handful of supermodels out there have enormous social media followings, Gigi Hadid being the leader,” Mr. Hilfiger said. “She’s the girl next door with an exotic twist. ” (Ms. Hadid’s mother is Dutch her father is Palestinian.) Mr. Hilfiger was prompt to exploit Ms. Hadid’s growing global appeal, enlisting her to walk his runway, appear in his advertising campaigns and design a capsule collection of her own. The success of those moves was measurable, he said, in 2. 2 million social media impressions, a 900 percent increase in total   over the previous year, and tens of millions in sales of the Hadid line. Plenty of people were impressed, among them designers of an altogether different ilk. “We understand the power involved in that alignment we won’t pretend that we don’t,” said Ryan Lobo, who, with Ramon Martin, designs Tome, a collection aimed largely at a haute bohemian clientele. Mr. Lobo and Mr. Martin, however, prefer a nuanced approach that takes celebrity marketing back to its roots. At their shows they tend to seat loyalists, prominent clients like the artists Shirin Neshat and Kara Walker, alongside such    personalities as Sandra Bernhard. “We aim to make the mix intriguing,” Mr. Lobo said, “like a dinner party with people who don’t normally have access to each other. ” Picking up the analogy, Mr. Martin added: “These people are our personal icons, and there will be others. You know we’re always going to add a chair to the end of the table. ”"

The Founding Fathers intended for impeachment to serve as Congress’s “essential check” on executive overreach.



Rather than checking the president’s power, this impeachment is all about winning the White House. Getting two‐​thirds of the Senate to go along with removing President Trump was never going to happen, so instead House Democrats are using the impeachment inquiry to sway next November’s vote. For their part, Senate Republicans are embracing a trial, reportedly in the hope that a drawn‐​out process will keep Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate off the campaign trail during the crucial first primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.



What’s going on here? Why have the House and Senate, through the impeachment process, become willing cogs in the oily machinery of the 2020 presidential contest?



The first step back to a healthy separation of powers is for lawmakers to recognize that the presidency—and not just the office-holder—is Congress’s constitutional rival.



The answer involves a tectonic shift in American government, from a functioning separation of powers to one that is out of whack. To appreciate today’s perverted impeachment process, one must understand how the president supplanted Congress as policymaker‐​in‐​chief.



Over the last century, Congress has given away, or “delegated,” much of its policymaking initiative to the executive branch. In part, Congress delegates out of necessity—there isn’t enough time in the day for lawmakers to execute the laws they pass. And in part, Congress delegates to pass the buck by having agencies make tough choices.



Through these grants of authority, Congress created an alphabet soup’s worth of regulatory agencies collectively known as the administrative state. At first, Congress took pains to oversee its delegations through a system of strong committees in the House and Senate. From the New Deal to the Reagan era, powerful committee chairs vied with presidential appointees for influence at regulatory agencies.



During the last 40 years, however, Congress changed. Demographic shifts led to the end of blocs of southern Democrats and northeastern Republicans, which rendered the parties more uniform. While hive‐​mentalities were taking hold in Congress, opportunistic leaders, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R‐​Ga.) and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D‐​Maine), consolidated power with rules changes, procedural maneuvering, and the distribution of party resources.



As power shifted from committees to party leadership, Congress lost the capacity to oversee its delegations. In the power vacuum left behind, modern presidents have seized undisputed supremacy over the administrative state by increasing control over agency budgets and regulatory management.



Policy now flows from the White House.



Congress couldn’t pass immigration reform, but President Obama achieved the same results with DACA. Congress denied President Trump funding to build a border wall, but then he exercised his delegated authority to declare an “emergency” and funded the wall unilaterally.



In this context—where the president calls the shots and Congress is beholden to party leadership—half the legislature always is unbothered with unbound executive authority whenever “their guy” occupies the White House.



It’s a vicious feedback loop. The more powerful the president becomes, the more our party‐​centric Congress rationally believes that the Oval Office is the most efficient means to implement the planks of a given party’s platform.



Of course, the parties whine about executive overreach, but only when they don’t occupy the White House. Neither party seeks to claw back power from the presidency, because each side wants its respective team to exercise executive authority.



So, congressional Republicans cried foul about executive power when President Obama resorted to his “phone and pen,” but then rallied to the support of President Trump when he disregarded Congress’s “power of the purse” in funding the border wall. And Democratic lawmakers now complain about presidential power, even though they gave President Obama an ovation when he threatened to bypass Congress on climate change during the 2013 State of the Union address.



Today’s supine Congress would be unrecognizable to the Founding Fathers. They understood that a concentration of power threatens individual liberty, so they designed a government with three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial—and gave each the means to check the other. By dispersing power into competing institutions, the Founders’ constitutional design serves as a bulwark for freedom.



At present, this constitutional design is buckling under the weight of partisanship. The impeachment brouhaha is the latest conspicuous example. Rather than competing _with_ the president, both chambers in Congress are leveraging the proceedings to conduct partisan political campaigns _for_ the presidency.



For as long as love of party trumps institutional pride in Congress, lawmakers will undermine crucial safeguards for “We the People.” The first step back to a healthy separation of powers is for lawmakers to recognize that the presidency—and not just the office-holder—is Congress’s constitutional rival.

 **North Shore ward**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo.



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



This is going to be a tough one. When you look through the options you’ll see why. I suppose I could recommend not voting at all, but that kinda contradicts the point of this exercise. The biggest issue in this ward is the proposal to sell a Takapuna golf course, turning the site into a Town Centre for Takapuna. It has been viciously argued over for the last nine years. I support the sale.



You may cast up to 2 votes for 2 positions in this FPP election



[ **Anthony Bunting**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e351e134-9a28-42a1-bd3c-4ebaf77358dd&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=North%20Shore%20Ward)– Independent **$$$$**



Bunting has virtually no google footprint and unusually, no picture of himself in the candidate profile. All we have to go on is his candidate profile statement.



He has a construction business which has been building new homes on North Shore for ten years, after a career in the Navy based at Devonport. Unsurprisingly, he is frustrated at the money wasted by the Council complying with the RMA and building consent processes. No doubt this includes a significant amount of his own money too.



Bunting appears to be a reluctant politician. Despite the enormous changes taking place in the region he sees the same old faces on billboards each election and isn’t convinced they are going to tackle the issues he faces, building new homes in the area.



He says he is a straight shooter that he offers new blood, open-door meetings and recognising ratepayers pay his wages. Someone who knows how to run a business needs to represent North Shore at the Council table.



That looks bloody good to me.



[ **Chris Darby**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=d96d3952-bd5f-4c00-b2bc-9880eebe5d75&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=North%20Shore%20Ward)– Taking the Shore Forward **$**



But first, view this video; [**Chris Darby Looks At Things**](https://www.facebook.com/CouncilDarby/videos/682562898879401/)



You may recall during my review of the Howick ward race I commented on the sloppy affiliations used by David Collings, running on a “Collings for Council” ticket. Darby’s affiliation is Taking the Shore Forward. Richard Hills is Darby’s running mate in all but affiliation lists his affiliation as A Positive Voice for the Shore.



Section 57(3) of the Local Electoral Act 2001 states: _An affiliation is ‘an endorsement by any organisation or group (whether incorporated or unincorporated).’_  




 _A candidate claiming a specific affiliation should supply with their nomination paper an authority to adopt the affiliation for the organisation or group concerned (i.e. letter of consent to use the affiliation from the organisation or group). This is a safety measure to avoid any illegal adoption of affiliations._



I’m highly sceptical that there are organisations named Taking the Shore Forward and A Positive Voice for the Shore that have supplied authorisations along with these two candidates’ nomination forms authorising them to use their names as endorsing organisations.



I’ve lodged an OIA request with the Auckland Council Electoral Officer who, to his credit replied quickly, to advise the nomination forms and supporting documentation are public documents which can be viewed at the Electoral Office. Alas, they’re only available to view during business hours so it will be a week before I can go in to view them. Will keep you posted.



Now, back to Darby. Little known fact, he was a supporter of Ngati Whatua’s occupation of Bastion Point, present on eviction day on May 25 1978. Prior to the formation of the super city, he served on North Shore City Council. He failed to be elected to Auckland Council 2010, settling for a place on Devonport-Takapuna Local Board, but won the Council race in 2013. Darby has generally sat with the left, his voting record closely matching Len Brown and Phil Goff. The latter appointed Darby Chair of the Planning Committee in 2016. In 2016, he was one of the Terrible Ten who voted in favour of the 9.9% rates increase.



Darby has positioned himself as a far-left, anti-car, pro-public transport extremist in favour of stringent planning laws leading to regulatory intensification. In 2015, when Labour joined National in supporting the extension or removal of the urban boundary, Darby said politicians should stay out of the issue. When new mega-mall Westfield NorthWest opened the same year, Darby labelled it “the anchor of more sprawl and a dire Henderson town centre left in its wake.” Darby seems to hold malls responsible for the decline of small business centres like Henderson; however, there are no mega-malls without customers. Their money clearly votes for increasing numbers of mega malls over blighted stretches of road.



Darby is on the side of those who wish to sell the Takapuna car park (probably the only thing I’d ever agree with him on), which really is playing with fire in this ward.



When Phil Goff announced free use of public transport for under 16’s on weekends, Darby was at the mayor’s side for the announcement as a strong advocate. Considering under 16’s don’t currently drive cars and the weekends have minimal congestion, the only reason for doing it is to instil bus/train usage into the minds of the young ensuring thorough brainwashing by the time they can drive.



In June of this year, the Governing Body approved a submission to the Government calling for universal design standards for residential buildings, requiring them to be accessible to all people regardless of age, disability or other factors. Currently, that requirement only exists for commercial buildings. Darby is a [cheerleader for the change](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/property/113192329/auckland-council-pushes-for-all-homes-to-be-accessible-in-building-act-review) because current rules disadvantage the 10% of Aucklanders that have a mobility impairment. Earlier attempts by Auckland Council to include this in the Unitary Plan were removed by the independent hearings panel who felt it would be in conflict with the Building Act. 



Every regulation added to a product or activity results in an additional cost. Sometimes it may be the opportunity cost of doing the activity a different, more efficient way but usually, the cost is visible and financial. If the number of Aucklanders needing accessibility adaptations in private housing is significant, removing regulatory distortion as a factor, the market will respond and the provision of such houses increase. The answer to a minor problem for some Aucklanders isn’t applying whole-scale compulsion to all new developments to include these features in every private home. Property rights is not a phrase in Darby’s lexicon, but there are volumes covering central planning of every aspect to the nth degree.



Darby’s blind hatred of private vehicles is being played out in the Auckland CBD, whether it be lowering speed limits to 30 km/h, increasing shared spaces giving pedestrians right of way or complete removal of car access entirely as is proposed for Auckland’s High Street, costing $14-22m. [Darby says](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/auckland-mayor-announces-plan-expedite-removal-car-parks-popular-city-centre-street), “Personal mobility and enjoyment trumps parking and kerbs to bring people out on the street. It’s time to trigger that change.”



Chris has identified several priorities if he gets another term on Auckland Council: securing a fair share of funding for the Shore (what is fair?), advancing Shore rail (0% achieved thus far but I’ll return to that), safeguarding strategic assets like Watercare, capping rates (he has voted for 9.9% increases previously) and reining in Auckland Transport (whatever that means).



Darby is also indulging in the climate change Kool-Aid. In saying that I’m not denying the climate is changing, I’m saying there is absolutely no chance anything Auckland Council does will have any impact on it.



Finally, Darby’s obsession with rail linking the Shore, which has got nowhere, is not something I’d completely write off as a worthwhile possibility. There is no denying the harbour needs at least one more crossing. I previously advocated a second crossing, linking the Meola Reef to Chelsea with a motorway linked up to the Albany Highway, at a cost of $5.5 billion. While I haven’t fully investigated the possibilities, a third crossing from Devonport to the Eastern Corridor would certainly suck the congestion out of SH1 and Lake Rd. 



It’s big-ticket stuff, but if rail were to become a reality on the Shore then it should be accompanied by a new parallel road crossing. I’d pay for it by applying electronic road pricing as an alternative to regressive petrol taxes, which still don’t come close to covering the cost of transport infrastructure.

Grant Gillon has previously worked as a firefighter and union official but his first political position was as an Alliance MP, a radical left collection of minor parties, from 1996 until its collapse in 2002. Gillon followed Jim Anderton from The Alliance to the new Progressive Coalition which vanished with Anderton’s resignation from politics.



Gillon has been on the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board since 2010, missing out on the North Shore Council seat by 128 votes in 2016.



On the Takapuna Car Park controversy, after initially opposing the sale, Gillon has switched to[ favouring an alternative plan put forward by designers Richard Reid & Associates](https://www.metromag.co.nz/society/society-politics/auckland-council-roadblocked-again-by-army-of-whingers-and-naysayers). 



Gillon’s planning ideology falls on the NIMBY/heritage imposition side of the ledger, opposing the development of denser multi-storey apartments. Heritage preservation is a bugbear particular to the Devonport area of his local board, where resident historical groups have run rampant against property owners, including businesses, with expensive court battles to prevent property owners enjoying the natural extension of ownership, making alterations to their buildings.



In 2014, Gillon backed the NIMBYs trying to block the redevelopment of the Baywater Village Marina, claiming that was what the community wanted. A Colmar Brunton poll at the time found that wasn’t the case, with 70% of residents polled being in favour of the development going ahead and 86% supporting new facilities for the Takapuna Rowing Club.



He says he will advocate strongly for reduced congestion on residential streets. However, his methods of congestion reduction tend to favour public transport options with buses and ferries and improved cycling and walking infrastructure.   
  
Private vehicle use is the overwhelming preference for Aucklanders, with car occupancy rates in Devonport and Takapuna averaging 1.2 people each. Were we talking about a private good or service, profits would come from providing what most consumers want. Because it is Council, with thinly-spread resources addressing an ‘expense,’ the strategy is altering preferences to cheaper transport methods by making private vehicles unbearable.

Danielle Grant has served on the Kaipatiki Local Board for two terms and is standing again as well as running for the North Shore council ward, on the More For The Shore ticket with Grant Gillon.  
  
It’s a bit of an odd pairing up when you consider Grant contested North Shore on the right-wing Auckland Future ticket in 2016. This vote split led to popular and reliable Independent George Wood withdrawing from the Council race to form a new ticket on Devonport-Takapuna Local Board. The result of the 2016 election saw two left-wing candidates being returned to the Governing Body.



Grant Gillon, a former Alliance MP and union organiser is on the far left of the political spectrum so it is reasonable to presume that Danielle Grant’s driving priority is her own political career.



Her candidate profile provides overwhelming evidence that Danielle’s political principles are as flexible as a broken flip flop and leaves North Shore voters in a position of choosing the less bad option for their second vote.



Her message on congestion is that it is frustrating and she will hold Auckland Transport to account. That will be as effective as a slap with a wet wipe. She accurately identifies Lake Rd and Onewa Rd as the most urgent congestion hot points in the ward. Her solutions are “to lead the major projects we see before us [and] work for sensible solutions.” That’s a complete cop-out.



She advocates building more separate path options for cyclists, more frequent bus services and upgrades of the Bayswater Ferry terminal and an all weather service for Northcote wharf plus weekend ferry services in other parts of the ward. Completely useless.



Danielle Grant also states her focus is on Council core business. In reality, she is borrowing fiscally prudent buzzwords without taking them seriously. Increased funding for sporting groups, investing more money into increased numbers of Council owned social houses, and adding free wifi to bus stops are not core Council functions.



Grant also identifies climate change as a significant issue. That may or may not be the case but it isn’t a core Council issue. 



Prior to writing this article, I thought I’d be supporting Grant but now I don’t even trust her.



[ **Richard Hills**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=56ce699e-e685-4409-9588-12f268e7400d&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=North%20Shore%20Ward)– A Positive Voice for the Shore **$$**



Hills is the other left-wing incumbent in this ward, and essentially on the same ticket as Darby in every way except the affiliation slogan on their voting papers. He is also a longtime Labour party member, unsuccessfully seeking to be their candidate in the 2018 Northcote by-election. Hills beat Grant Gillon by 128 votes to become the Councillor in 2016.



Richard was awarded an A+ by radical left Generation Zero for his positions on housing, transport and the environment. No doubt that was helped by his support for Mayor Phil Goff’s dopey idea making buses free for under 15’s on weekends.



Projects which Hills takes some credit for driving include double-decker buses for Onewa Rd routes, water quality projects, the Beach Haven Ferry terminal and funding for parks, community facilities and Kaipatiki bush tracks.



The Devonport-Takapuna Local Board has attacked Auckland Council for later deferring the funding for some of those projects; however, Councillor Chris Darby says the reason for that funding deferment is the insistence of the local board on full public notification of the resource consent. That adds six to twelve months to the timeline, and Council finance policy only permits budgets to be confirmed when there is a reasonable chance of the project being delivered in the year it is budgeted for. Gillon has also complained that the local board only had three ‘growth funded’ projects in the area that were now funding deferred, another claim Hills points out is false.



Hills has also pushed the development of the Marlborough Park Youth facility and secured funding for Lake Rd, Birkenhead War Memorial and Skypath (which continues to suffer delays of its own).



Other priorities identified by Hills include making sure “those with diverse backgrounds are included in decision making.” upgrading bush tracks, playgrounds, sports fields and community facilities. He also wants to invest more in the arts; in my opinion that’s throwing money away rather than investing it.



Whatever I may think of Hills’ policy positions and achievements, he is at least engaging and competent. Hills has been effective and diligent over this term, make what you want from that.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** This is a hard pick. One unknown right wing candidate. Three well known left wing candidates. One former right wing candidate.

My wife and I were in Moscow in early April. With temperatures of -50 C, there was no sign of spring. This continuing winter freeze reflected the mood of most of the participants at the annual international academic conference organised by the Higher School of Economics, which I had come to attend. With Putin set to rule for another 12 years, what are Russia’s prospects?



Though high oil prices have shored up Russia’s fiscal and current account balances at this time, and allowed GDP growth to pick up to about five per cent in the last quarter, the economic development minister, Elvira Nabiullina, warned of a quick drop to two to three per cent if Russia continues to be a resource‐​dependent economy, with unreformed institutions and a hostile business climate. And the deputy chairman of Russia’s central bank, Alexei Ulyukayev, saw inflation accelerating from the current 3.7 per cent to five to six per cent by the end of the year.



Even this downgrading of Russia’s short‐ to medium‐​term prospects was seen as too rosy by former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, who argued that the sovereign wealth fund he had set up to channel Russian resource rents was being raided for various populist handouts to counter dissent — and if oil and gas prices fell, Russia would not be able to manage the resultant fiscal and balance of payments crises. There was a consensus that, unless Russia weaned itself off its natural resource‐​led, statist growth model, its future prospects looked bleak.



This is underlined by the growing emigration of Russia’s skilled youth and increased capital flight (private sector net capital outflows in the first three months of 2012 were $35 billion compared to $20 billion in first quarter of 2011). The dismal condition of Russian business was underlined in a remarkable paper by a brave lawyer, Vladimir Radchenko, (the first deputy chairman of the supreme court, 1989–2008). He claimed that the Soviet mode of justice still continues. There are three million small‐ and medium‐​scale business entrepreneurs in jail for economic crimes. He contrasted this with conditions during the 1920s’ New Economic Policy when the share of output from small and medium enterprises in GDP was about the same as today — however, at the time, not only were there few listed economic crimes, but the punishment for them was a fine, not imprisonment. By contrast, today, ordinary profit‐​making has been criminalised. This lack of the rule of law has led Russian oligarchs to register their companies abroad, fight their legal battles in London, and move their assets and families to the West.



Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox Church has resumed its promotion of Caesaropapism (“render unto Caesar not only what is Caesar’s but also God’s”). This deviant Christian doctrine had prompted Vladimir, the ruler of the Kievan state (the precursor of the Russian empire), to choose the Greek over the Latin Church. This doctrine has underwritten the autocratic Russian state ever since. Not only did the Moscow Patriarch urge his flock to vote for Putin, calling his rule a “miracle of God”, but he was caught in a photoshopping scandal when he tried to doctor a published photograph showing him wearing a $30,000 Breguet watch, purportedly a gift from Putin.



What then of civil society and the middle‐​class protests after the Duma elections which rattled Putin? They are part of a 200‐​year‐​old tradition when Russia’s intellectuals and literary figures come out of their cafes and salons onto the streets to fight an oppressive state apparatus, and then at the first whiff of grapeshot rush back. The anti‐​Putin protests followed the same pattern. Then why have they rattled the President‐​elect?



In a recent biography, Masha Gessen ( _The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin_ , Granta) delves into whatever is known about Putin’s past and his motives. She describes him as growing up in a shabby flat, fierce and vengeful in street fights and dreaming to join the KGB. Having returned home 10 years after his dream was fulfilled, he unexpectedly found himself the _de facto_ Tsar of Russia. He used the art of secrecy learnt from his time in the KGB to control personal information and create his own myth. Putin, argues Gessen, wants to “turn the country into a supersize model of the KGB, where there can be no room for dissent or even independent actors”.



In a remarkable article in _The Moscow Times_ (April 4), Yulia Latynina, a radio talk‐​show host, reports on Putin’s plan to create a 400,000-strong personal National Guard; an institution adopted by dictators in West Asia and South America, where a working‐​class man’s best option was to join the Presidential Praetorian guard, unconnected to the army or the police: the Haitian President “Papa Doc” Duvalier’s infamous Tonton Macoutes being the most sinister example.



Putin wants his Praetorian Guard, as the siloviki — who were supposed to break up anti‐​government demonstrations in return for the freedom to extort, steal and kill — turned out to be unreliable, only turning out on the street with pay rises. Russia’s Federal Security Service, FSB, is more interested in its lucrative side businesses than the thankless task of dealing with street protests. On the other hand, the inefficient army, starved of resources because of Putin’s fear of a _putsch,_ is incapable of guarding Putin from the mob. The Nashi youth groups from depressed towns around Moscow, bussed in for pro‐​government demonstrations and to break up those against the government, turned out to be more interested in drinking and partying at the government’s expense. Hence a National Guard of young men without any chance of a career in the stagnant economy. It will protect the ruling elite from public anger at its siphoning off of the country’s petrodollars abroad and curtailing freedom.



Clearly, Russia will have to wait for its Spring.

"**Chloe Haskett wakes up every morning wondering whether she'll still have a job to go to.**
She's one of almost a million young people working in the retail sector whose future has been thrown into doubt by the coronavirus crisis.
Early December is normally a boom time for retailers when the festive shopping season is in full swing. But lockdowns across the UK have forced many shops to close or limit the number of customers they allow through their doors for much of the year, pushing more to shop online.
And that has had a devastating impact on the fortunes of some of the UK's biggest High Street names, as well as the staff.
On Tuesday, Chloe woke up to find that she was one of more than 25,000 retail workers whose job was put at risk this week after Debenhams revealed it was set to close and Arcadia, the owner of Topshop, was put into administration.
Both firms have been hit by a dramatic fall in visits to UK shops, which are expected to be down 62% in the final weeks of the year, according to retail analyst company Springboard.
But the pandemic has merely accelerated a trend that was already visible on Britain's High Streets, as shoppers swap bricks-and-mortar shops for online deliveries.
""This is my fifth Christmas in Debenhams, and over the years, every year, you just notice it getting quieter,"" says Chloe, who works in the Portsmouth branch.
""Commercial Road, our High Street, is just dead,"" says the 22-year-old, who works in a watch and jewellery repair concession in the Debenhams store. ""Everything's closing, nothing's really reopening.""
She's hoping for a Christmas rush when lockdown restrictions are relaxed in England. However, she worries that the news of Debenhams' demise could put people off bringing their valuables in for repair.
Chloe blames the High Street job losses on the rise of Amazon, but also bricks-and-mortar retailers themselves for promoting online-only offers that put people off visiting stores.
She also worries about what will happen if the closure of Debenhams puts her out of a job.
Chloe, who has only ever worked in retail, says that trying to find another job after the coronavirus crisis has ravaged the sector is ""an almost impossible battle"".
""I'd literally probably try anything at this point,"" she says. ""I used to be a bit picky before, but now I really can't be, it's going to be whatever pays money at the end of the day.""
Chris Brook-Carter, chief executive of RetailTrust, an organisation for shop workers, said: ""We're closing in on 150,000 jobs lost in retail, across the course of this pandemic.""
Four million people work in retail and the supporting sector, making it the biggest employer in the UK, according to Mr Brook-Carter.
""Sadly there will be fewer jobs in retail going forward than have existed in the past,"" he said.
The Centre for Retail Research estimates that job losses in the sector will hit 235,000 this year, with 20,620 stores expected to close their doors.
One of those to have already lost their job was Grant Docherty, 23, who worked at a Burton concession at the Debenhams store in Carlisle.
He was made redundant in October after being furloughed during the lockdown. But as he only joined the firm in February, he was ineligible for the wage top-up under the government's job retention scheme, which left him out of pocket.
""Stores were seeing a massive lack of customers, sales were down, and stock was still in the wrong season as deliveries took a long time to get back into the swing of things,"" he says.
He said the subsequent job hunt was very difficult. In the end, he was forced to relocate to Glasgow for a new job as a call handler for the NHS, which interviewed 500 people for the role.
That prospect of finding new work, possibly beyond retail, is now looming large for another 12,000 Debenhams employees.
Sarah (not her real name) works part-time in the chain's Worthing store. She knew it was likely to be bad news when she received a message on the staff WhatsApp group asking her and her colleagues to dial into an all-staff conference call.
Sarah says the staff were told in ""blunt"" terms that they would ""more than likely"" be made redundant.
Another person on the line, who also did not want to use her name, said: ""The call was really sad.""
""We don't know when we will close but I am going into work today to prepare for reopening tomorrow and it is with a heavy heart,"" she said.
""We unfortunately aren't the first casualty of the pandemic and sadly I don't think we will be the last.""
With Christmas just around the corner, many people like Sarah, Grant and Chloe face an uncertain wait as other big chains, such as Peacocks and Jaeger, announce cutbacks and job losses.
And with a third of retail workers thought to be 25 and under, that could leave thousands more young people looking for work."
"ATLANTA  —   What, exactly, do you do with a    work of art, mythmaking and Civil War history that is longer than a football field, more than 40 feet tall and urgently in need of a new home? This city is finding out. After decades of deepening disrepair and disinterest in the painting commonly known as the Atlanta Cyclorama, workers this month are moving the panorama as part of a $35 million plan to rescue and maintain a titanic, deteriorating example of an art form that has mostly disappeared. Saving “The Battle of Atlanta,” which is among the largest oil paintings in the world, has proved to be an undertaking of remarkable complexity. It is rife with logistical tests, engineering quandaries, curatorial challenges and political and racial sensitivities that linger more than 150 years after Gen. William T. Sherman’s military campaign here. Yet after taxpayers spent years supporting an imperiled painting in a building troubled by leaks and temperature fluctuations, formal opposition to the effort, which is privately funded by multiple philanthropists, is strikingly scarce. “The fact that this painting has survived when so many others were left out to mold and rot and get burned up and whatever is nothing short of a miracle,” said Gordon L. Jones, the senior military historian and curator at the Atlanta History Center, which reached a license agreement with the City of Atlanta to display the cyclorama. “Everything that we know about Civil War memory, all of those stories, can in some way be described by using this painting as an example,” Dr. Jones said. Indeed. “The Battle of Atlanta,” prepared in Milwaukee by a team of German artists, was completed in 1886, when cycloramas  —   massive panoramic projects intended to give viewers the sensation of standing in the depicted landscape  —   were a leading form of entertainment, and the colossal works traveled the country. During its tour of the North, “Atlanta” was widely interpreted as depicting the 1864 struggle here for what it was: a decisive and pivotal victory for the Union that left an estimated 12, 140 people dead, most of them Confederate troops. Then the exhibition moved to the South, and in November 1892, The Atlanta Constitution newspaper printed a masterstroke of spin: an advertisement that said the cyclorama’s scene was the “only Confederate victory ever painted. ” The painting swiftly attracted large, and almost exclusively white, audiences and was donated to the city around the turn of the century. But the crowds dwindled, in part because motion pictures increasingly replaced cycloramas as entertainment, and generations of decline began. A major restoration that concluded in 1982 bought the Atlanta Cyclorama more time before the painting’s quality and appeal began to wane again. In recent years, elementary schoolteachers leading    field trips were among the most loyal visitors to the cyclorama. “I remember that when I took my permission slip home, my mom and my dad had a conversation,” said Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta, 47, who is black. “I remember it not being a typical permission slip that was quickly signed. ” But it fell to Mr. Reed, who will leave office next year, to help solve the contemporary riddle of what to do with the cyclorama, which black residents, in an earlier time, were allowed to view only one day a month. The city announced the agreement with the Atlanta History Center in 2014. The center will display the   relic on its   campus, located in an upscale area of Atlanta that includes the Governor’s Mansion and some of the city’s finest restaurants. The plan comes  —   somewhat serendipitously, its organizers said  —   at a time of scattered efforts in the South to move beyond the traditional Old South narrative surrounding the Civil War. In 2014, for example, the Georgia Historical Society dedicated a marker that sought to undermine what it described as “popular myth” about Sherman’s cruelty during the war. “It helps to bring some emphasis to why what happened here was important and why it’s not your grandfather’s Civil War anymore,” Dr. Jones said of   scholarship and presentation of the war. Mr. Reed said he was not bothered by the painting’s continuing prominence and possible resurgence. “As a black person, I’m quite comfortable with it because I know how the end of the movie turned out,” the mayor said. “The right result was reached. That doesn’t mean that we should not be privy to an expansive story of how we got to who we are today. ” But the deal that Mr. Reed helped to broker created the complicated task of moving the painting from the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum, which closed in 2015 to prepare for a relocation that will cumulatively require about 200 people. Not long ago, a   expert from the History Center’s insurer called Jackson McQuigg, the center’s vice president of properties, with a polite, terse request: “Walk me through it. ” Workers, Mr. McQuigg replied, will spend days rolling the painting, which is appraised at $7. 5 million, onto a pair of   spools. A crane will slowly lift the spools  —   “We’re hoping   goes faster,” Mr. McQuigg said in an interview  —   through   holes cut in the roof of the nearly   building. Then, once the   painting is resting aboard two trucks, the workers will let the clock tick. “We’re going to wait until everybody goes home and the traffic dies down and there’s no more Atlanta rush hour,” Mr. McQuigg said in the musty room where the cyclorama has hung for generations. “Heck, it might be 3 in the morning. ” The cyclorama’s former home will be converted into an event space for Zoo Atlanta, a private nonprofit. The painting, once it has been relocated, will undergo extensive restoration efforts before its formal reopening, scheduled for fall 2018. Among panorama proponents, the project in Atlanta, more than eight years after a restoration of the “Battle of Gettysburg” cyclorama in Pennsylvania, is seen as a crucial effort to preserve the medium’s past. Fewer than two dozen cycloramas from the late 1800s and early 1900s are believed to have survived the last century. “It’s a chance to represent a really major and widely consumed art form that most people have really forgotten about,” said Sara Velas, the president of the International Panorama Council and the artistic director of the Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles. “It’s still impactful and entertaining, even if our attention span has changed from what it was in the 19th century. ” And in Atlanta, a city that was a cradle of the civil rights movement but is within sight of a   monument to the Confederacy at Stone Mountain, reviving the “Battle of Atlanta” cyclorama is also a means to clarifying history. “It’s been caught up in ‘the Lost Cause,’ and that made it a sore subject for a lot of people,” Dr. Jones said of the painting that stood nearby, shrouded in scaffolding. “We’ve got to unwrap that, and we’ve got to get past that, and we’ve got to be able to talk about ‘the Lost Cause’ objectively and talk about it for what it is and what it’s not. This is a way we can do that. ”"
"The Amazon is under threat from all sides. Over recent weeks, unprecedented blazes have spread through an ecosystem not adapted to fire. Much has been made of the consequences of these fires for global heating – but at a local level, the effects could be even more severe. While it’s too soon to establish the cause of the Amazon fires with certainty, levels of burning and deforestation are closely linked. Cut vegetation is routinely set alight to create cattle ranches and support land claims, in some cases sparking uncontrolled wildfires.

      Amazon fires explained: what are they, why are they so damaging, and how can we stop them?


 After reaching a record low in 2012, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been rising steadily, and has surged since Jair Bolsonaro became president in January. Recent data shows deforestation from January to August this year was the highest it’s been for a decade, increasing by 75% relative to the same period in 2018. That fires have also not been this extensive for a decade is surely no coincidence. With its vast store of carbon locked up in trees and soils, the Amazon – and its health – is of huge importance for global heating. There are concerns that emissions from the recent fires could hinder attempts to reach the climate targets set by the Paris Agreement. But the Amazon is also vital to local communities who depend on its fertile land. Many indigenous peoples have seen their territories invaded and deliberately burned in recent months, jeopardising lives and livelihoods. In this context, there is a pressing need to understand the benefits that intact Amazon forests provide to local populations, in addition to their importance at a global scale. Whilst scientists have been monitoring the global impacts of deforestation and fires for decades, how the Amazon regulates the local climate has not been widely studied. In a new study, my colleague Dominick Spracklen and I investigated how deforestation influences the local Amazonian climate. We selected areas of intact forest – regions of woodland that haven’t been affected by human disturbance – using the Intact Forest Landscapes maps. These undisturbed forests have lost less than 5% of their canopy cover, confirming their relative stability. We also identified forests that had lost their intact classification because of human disturbance, such as logging and fire.  Using satellite data, we examined climatic changes, particularly in temperature and rainfall, over these large swathes of forest between 2001 and 2013. While local-level rainfall was unaffected, we found that intact forests transfer more water to the atmosphere through a process known as evapotranspiration than areas that have been deforested. Evapotranspiration can be thought of as the forest sweating – as water evaporates from the leaves and the ground it cools the environment. Less evapotranspiration reduces the cooling capacity of forests and causes local temperatures to rise. While global warming continues to affect all regions of the forest, disturbed forests saw much stronger local warming, with annual temperatures rising by 0.44°C more than neighbouring intact forests over the study period. This may not sound like much, but it equates to approximately half of the warming seen in the region over the last 60 years. The effects of deforestation were most pronounced during the dry season, when temperature differences of up to 1.5°C were observed between intact and disturbed forests. This is because water is only available from deep in the soil during the dryer months, inaccessible to the shorter-rooted pasture vegetation that grows once forest has been felled. Higher temperatures increase the likelihood and intensity of drought during the dry season, as they increase plant demand for moisture at a time when water is already scarce. Increasing temperatures and drought are already shifting the plant composition of the Amazon, and many trees will perish as conditions breach the limits at which they can survive. Droughts also severely reduce populations of fish, waterfowl and dolphins, and make life increasingly difficult for local people who depend on small-scale agriculture for survival.

      Amazon fires: eight ways you can help stop the rainforest burning


 Forests also become more susceptible to fires, which in already drier areas can cause almost all of the remaining trees to die. At this point, rainforests become nothing more than low diversity and low carbon ecosystems with a fraction of their current social, ecological and climatic value. Worse still, evidence suggests that between 3°C and 4°C of warming will be a tipping point for the Amazon, beyond which large parts of the rainforest may switch to a savanna-like state with much poorer capacity to store carbon and support wildlife. Given that we have already reached more than 1°C of warming globally, an extra warming of 1.5°C in the dry season poses a serious threat to the continued existence of these degraded rainforests. Intact tropical forests are crucially important, not just for global heating, but for the local climate too. In his haste to economise the Amazon, Bolsonaro would do well to remember that.

Every once in awhile you see something in the “it’s worse than we thought” meme that deserves some clarification for those that want to look at all the data, rather than those who want to push gloom and doom. A recent tweet by Bill McKibben thoughtlessly retweeting a statement by the Master of Disaster, Weather Underground’s Dr. Jeff Masters, got me digging to see just how true it was. Here’s the tweet:

OK, we are used to weepy Bill regurgitating Tweeting without thinking on a daily basis, but the response from one his unthinking followers was a true Harold Camping moment.


Dear Ms. Andrea Angulo, the answer is: we’ve done nothing wrong, because this isn’t the worst USA drought by any measure nor did we cause it (it was a natural weather oscillation the NAO, and stop following weepy Bill and look for yourself rather than being a flock member).
Jeff Masters’ claim doesn’t hold up when you look at all the data, and it is a claim of his own invention that not even NOAA said anything about. Let’s look at Masters claim:

He cites this graphic and PR from the U.S. Drought Monitor, big mistake, because they have a documented tendency to exaggerate. Here’s the current map:

But Masters didn’t really bother to visualize all the drought data he cited, preferring instead to simply make a pronouncement, which is then unthinkingly parroted by folks like McKibben.  I took the CONUS drought area data Masters linked to in the article from:
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/sotc/drought/2012/11/uspctarea-wetdry-mod.txt 
And plotted it, noting the years Masters referred to:

Not so scary now, is it?  But it becomes even less scary when you don’t cherry pick the data you want, but instead look at all the drought data available to you. Quite frankly, since Masters holds a PhD. in meteorology, you’d think he’d know to look at the most widely accepted metric, the Palmer Drought Severity index (PDSI) also available from NOAA.

Negative values are dry (in yellow) positive values are wet (in green) Source: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/time-series/index.php?parameter=pdsi&month=11&year=2012&filter=ytd&state=110&div=0
(Note: the 2012 value is a slim yellow line to -4 on the right axis)
Using the Year-to-Date average Palmer Drought Severity Index, 2012 is just another blip compared to others in  the last century, and hardly rates a mention. But that doesn’t fit Masters and McKibben’s ongoing gloom and doom meme, so they don’t want to look at it or show it to their followers. But wait, there’s more.
From Sheffield et al 2012, plotting the Palmer Drought Severity Index globally over the past 60 years they show little change in drought severity, and certainly no response to “global warming”.

a, PDSI_Th (blue line) and PDSI_PM (red line). b, Area in drought (PDSI <−3.0) for the PDSI_Th (blue line) and PDSI_PM (red line). The shading represents the range derived from uncertainties in precipitation.
From their abstract:
Here we show that the previously reported increase in global drought is overestimated because the PDSI uses a simplified model of potential evaporation that responds only to changes in temperature and thus responds incorrectly to global warming in recent decades. More realistic calculations, based on the underlying physical principles that take into account changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, suggest that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.
So even the PDSI may have errors, making it overestimate drought severity, and it isn’t just one paper saying this. Martin Hoerling of NOAA says:
Hoerling et al. in Journal of Climate: Is a Transition to Semi-Permanent Drought Conditions Imminent in the U.S. Great Plains?
“We conclude that projections of acute and chronic PDSI decline in the 21st Century are likely an exaggerated indicator for future Great Plains drought severity.”
Climatologist Dr. Pat Michaels, in his previous WUWT opinion piece, noted that NASA GISS Dr. James Hansen is making a claim that global temperatures are driving U.S drought, and did a scatterplot to gauge correlation between Hansen’s own GISS temperature data (GISTEMP) and the U.S. Palmer Drought Severity Index with annual data through 2011:

Annual PDSI -vs- Annual Global GISTEMP – Source: Dr. Pat Michaels
There’s no correlation: zero, zip, nada. If there were, you’d see the dots align along a diagonal line, there’s not even a hint of that. Of course doom and gloom proponents like  Masters and McKibben might say “… but, but, but, 2012 was a terrible drought”. Yes, it was, it is, but we’ve seen worse in the past.
One final note, about the real worry of drought in the USA; effects on the food supply.

Note how 2012 compares to drought years of 1934, 1936, and 1988. It is certainly no outlier.
And, the trend for yield continues upward, with 2012 not even coming close to some of the worst years for production.

Source: http://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/YieldTrends.html
Agricultural science trumps a drought year. That’s a hockey stick we can all believe in.
Call me a “doubting Thomas” as to overwrought claims by Masters and McKibben, but the fact is that the 2012 drought isn’t as bad as they would have you believe and won’t show you these other data because they don’t fit their business model.
Regarding corn, recall what Bill McKibben once wrote wept:
Those damned shriveled ears of corn. I’ve done everything I can think of, and millions of people around the world have joined us at 350.org in the most international campaign there ever was.
Everything that is, but look at the data.

"Being rooted in one place gives plants the stability they need to grow and thrive. But as the Amazon fires show, that can quickly turn into a deadly disadvantage. Without any means of escape, it would seem that plants are powerless against the approaching flames. But while they can’t run from fire, that doesn’t necessarily mean certain death.  It’s hard to believe while surveying the aftermath of a wildfire, but plants can actually recover. Shoots can regrow from parts of the plant that are protected from the fire, such as buds buried beneath thick bark or below a layer of insulating soil. Plants that can survive and even thrive after a fire are common in ecosystems such as tropical savannas, where grasses regrow from shoots below ground, even when all vegetation has been incinerated at the surface.

      African grasslands are meant to burn – we can't let this distract from the Amazon fires


 Not only can plants survive fire, they can use the experience of being burned to prepare themselves for future fires. In a recent study, we found that savanna grasses with experience of fire were different from those that had never been burned before. Fire-wise grasses invested more of their living tissue, or biomass, below the ground after surviving a fire – where it would be protected from the heat of any subsequent fires – and put more resources into reproducing by producing more flowers.  These differences may mean that fire-wise plants have larger amounts of stored resources to regrow after the fire and produce more seeds for the next generation to spring up in any gaps opened by the fire, compared to those plants that are fire-naïve. These lingering physical differences can be thought of as memories of the fire in the wise plants which help them be better prepared the next time their surroundings burn. Memory in animals is a product of their consciousness – the events they experience are stored and can be recalled by the brain. Plants have no comparable anatomy, but they can react to sudden changes in their environment like wildfires by changing how they grow, ensuring they’re better prepared in case the same thing happens again in future. In the same way wild animals learn to avoid humans after violent encounters, plants shift to storing more of their mass underground in memory of the fire they narrowly survived. Fire and stressful events cause changes to plants which aren’t permanently fixed within their genetic code and so can be thought of as a product of their short-term memory. The event is likely to be recorded in temporary changes to the plant’s genome that don’t change the DNA sequence itself.  The physical differences between a fire-naïve and a fire-wise plant arise because plants can change their structure and appearance to stay flexible in a changing environment. By essentially holding onto short-term memories of fires, plants can maximise their survival in the sudden chaos of a fire and its aftermath and avoid more permanent changes to their structure which could end up being unhelpful if the environment changes again – for example, if fires are permanently prevented in an area by humans. Grasses appear to “remember” fire for some time. The differences between previously burnt and unburnt plants existed for at least a year, which is how long we studied them for, but these differences are likely to linger for much longer. The same pattern can be seen in plants responding to other stressful events, such as droughts or floods. Young wheat plants that became water-logged for the first time went on to grow bigger and produce higher yields when they were water-logged again in future.

      Plants can tell time even without a brain – here's how


 Human activity – such as slash and burn land clearing – and climate change have combined to increase the frequency, intensity and extent of wildfires. But as some plants can prime themselves for future fires, plant communities could become more resistant to these events over time. That’s the hope at least, but many species of plant can’t recover from fire and are killed outright by flames. The ability to survive fires is often found in plants that evolved in fire-prone environments, such as grasslands, savannas and heathland. But there are plenty of ecosystems that rarely burn, such as tropical rainforests, where plants have little to no defences against fire, having never experienced it in their evolutionary history. Such species may become locally extinct unless their seeds can withstand the high temperatures. The flora of the Amazon is certainly not adapted to survive this challenge – the fires there may have devastating, long-term consequences."
"Despite centuries of persecution, indigenous groups still manage or have tenure rights over at least a quarter of the world’s land surface. Often inhabiting these lands as far back as memory extends, they share a deep and unique connection to their environment. Recently released figures show that indigenous groups are continuing to pay a heavy price for standing up for their ancestral lands. In 2018 alone, at least 164 indigenous people were killed defending the environment, adding to hundreds more deaths in preceding years. They’re not the only ones – numerous lawyers, park rangers, and journalists have also been killed attempting to protect both resource and biodiversity-rich land from extractive industries. But indigenous groups account for the largest proportion of these killings, in a global battle that according to new research published in Nature is now more lethal than some war zones. We must make sure that these deaths aren’t in vain. The same key UN report that declared a million animal and plant species as at risk of extinction also highlighted that nature under indigenous control is declining less rapidly than in other lands. It’s time for us to sit up and take note of how they safeguard biodiversity, and why they’re willing to put their lives on the line for nature. Sharing a worldview that is centred on the land and their place within it, indigenous knowledge contains two central ideas that place nature front and centre. The first is connectedness. Constantly observing the surrounding environment, indigenous peoples have an intimate understanding of the interconnected nature of all living beings and natural systems. Tied to the changing world, this understanding is thorough but pragmatic and local in scale, always open to be altered in the face of evidence. The second idea is collectiveness. Knowledge is not considered to be owned by individuals, but held collectively by people as shared experiences that represent the sum of their wisdom. People are responsible for one another, nurturing values of cooperation, sharing and reciprocity. Research on indigenous livelihood practices shows how these values preserve the integrity of nature. In Amazonia for example, centuries of attention to crop health, climate, and forest regeneration has led to the development of rotational farming practices, whereby diverse crops are grown within a small farming area and continually rotated across a larger natural landscape over successive harvest seasons. Compared to modern intensive monoculture farming, this traditional method improves soil water and nutrient retention, reduces erosion and degradation, stores carbon more efficiently, increases crop biodiversity, and preserves forest habitats. The system provides a continuous flow of food through different seasons, where surpluses can still be sold, and its diversity makes it more resilient to environmental threats. The involvement of many in the success of the crops reinforces community cohesion, and a closer connection with the natural world. At a larger scale, indigenous territories have been recognised as crucial for maintaining vital natural stores of carbon. For example, studies using satellite imagery from northern South America suggests that indigenous lands have lower incidence of deforestation rates as a result of less invasive methods of farming, fishing, hunting, and land management. These methods not only require much less open space, but also support healthy soil and animal populations, creating much more resilient ecosystems. Indigenous fire management practices have also been shown to support biodiversity. By performing small-scale burning at different times during the year linked to cultural customs, the resulting mosaic landscape of burned and unburned patches makes it harder for large-scale, catastrophic wildfires to spread. The above examples are just a few of many ways in which indigenous peoples live in greater harmony with the natural world. The UN is right to emphasise that global ecosystems would benefit from greater recognition for Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. But we must also heed the words of indigenous scholars such as Linda Tuhiwai Smith and Renee Pualani Louis, who warn us that only engaging with the academic “usefulness” of indigenous knowledge is a colonising practice. While indigenous people account for roughly 5% of the global population, they make up about 15% of the world’s extreme poor. Many do not have adequate access to basic services such as health and education. In recognising the value of indigenous knowledge, we must also recognise that the legacy of colonialism has already eroded countless knowledge, values, and rights, and made indigenous peoples among the most marginalised on the planet. And the growing number of environmentally motivated murders of indigenous individuals shows that their access to justice is still severely lacking.

      The ethics of research: how to end the exploitation of vulnerable communities


 Research with indigenous people must not just draw from their knowledge, but prioritise their well-being and fundamental rights. This means acknowledging and respecting the distinctiveness of Indigenous worldviews and knowledge. It also means interacting in ways that build on Indigenous traditions of collaboration, reciprocity and oral communication. For example, a Darwin Initiative project in Guyana is using participatory video to allow local indigenous communities to showcase their knowledge and concerns about the management of protected land through autonomous storytelling. This allows indigenous people to communicate and codify their values in their own words, but more importantly, strengthens their ability to build more equal, collaborative, and responsive exchanges with decision makers. In conjunction with the Guyanese government, the project is developing a unique evidence-based national action plan that aims both to implement and maintain Indigenous knowledge, and empower indigenous people. Indigenous peoples should be a source of inspiration for the global community. The sooner decision makers represent their knowledge at the table, the better for biodiversity and the climate. Crucially though, we must not just value their practices, but their rights too. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNothing to do with climate directly, but it is funny and to me it serves to remind us skeptics of the people we are dealing with and their hopelessly warped lens through which they view the world. Such are the people we often find in the climate change movement and at Earth Day celebrations.
The following comes from an apartment search website where we have a young lady searching for an apartment to share with others in Berlin.
Hat-tip Steffen Hentrich at FB.
Here’s how she describes herself and what she expects of her potential roommates:
I, 31, am a good-natured open leftist* and openly feminist student of history (HU) and am searching a cosmopolitan and anti-capitalistic apartment to share with others in Friedrichshain/Kreuzberg. You need to be open minded when it comes to other lifestyle models and tolerance should be among your top values. Moreover it would be super if there was already a washing machine that I could also use in the apartment. I don’t like aggressions and power games, and so I’m searching for an apartment that is 100% shared by women who are active against terror, war, racial madness, fascism, chauvinism and US cultural imperialism. I am myself a vegan and think that long-term living together makes sense when absolutely no animal-based products find a place in my apartment.
In general I am easy to get along with, but must also be able to say where the limits are and when I don’t want to see anyone. For me this is part of an honest cohabitation. In the past unfortunately I often have had to make the experience of putting up with people who stayed around even when I asked them to (temporarily) leave the apartment.
In return for a room (20-30 sqm) I offer work in the household, repairs and discussions (also therapeutic). Money is the lever of the powerful with which I cannot identify with. But because I respect other views, I would be willing to contribute to WLAN and electricity (even it belongs to the fundamental needs of a person and thus MUST be provided free of charge.)

At the very top of the want ad, Mona writes that the maximum rent she is willing to pay is 5 euros. And it’s generous of her to offer to help out with the WLAN and electricity.
Note how she’s 31, and still a student. But that is not unusual in Europe. And she’s precisely the kind of “open-minded” and “tolerant” talent German liberal arts universities are putting out today.
So tell me folks, is it really possible to reason with such people? Talk about a failed upbringing. The first thing she needs to do is go on a meat diet.
I wonder why Mona isn’t staying with her parents?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf anyone thinks Germany’s move to renewable energies has been a success, you may want to take a few minutes and read what center-left news weekly Der Spiegel has just written.
Overall Germany’s energy revolution has made the country’s energy unaffordable, unreliable and has ruined its own idyllic landscape, and ravaged rainforests abroad as well.
Spiegel focusses on the costs in its article titled: Cost explosion with electricity, oil, gas: energy poverty in Germany is increasing drastically. The online flagship news weekly writes:
Rising energy costs are becoming a problem for more and more citizens in Germany. Just from 2008 to 20111 the share of energy-poor households in the Federal Republic jumped from 13.8 to 17 percent.”
Energy poverty is defined by the number of households that must pay more than 10% of their net income on energy. All told 6.9 million German households (every 6th household) finds itself in energy poverty, Spiegel writes.
Much of the rapid increase in energy prices is owing to Germany’s growth in expensive wind and solar energy. Ironically, despite more than 20% of Germany’s energy now being supplied by renewables, CO2 emissions have been rising just the same.
Spiegel calls the energy poverty rate “alarming”. However, when it comes to finding the cause for the runaway increase, the German Greens are blaming all the misery on the rising costs of oil and gas, and even hint that just more expensive, unreliable green energy is all that’s needed to get the costs back in line.
Natural gas in Germany costs three times more than it does in USA. The Greens are also demanding that the government pass legislation that would lead to residential units being renovated and better insulated. But critics say such a measure likely would make the situation even worse because landlords would benefit from the subsidies and pass the renovation costs to low income tenants.
The more the greens try to fix the mess, the more they screw it up.

Guest Post by Joe Bast
In a December 28 post, blogger Greg Laden, a self-described “biological anthropologist and science communicator,” ranked The Heartland Institute’s efforts to expose global warming alarmism as one of the “top climate stories of 2012”. I suppose we should be flattered, but his error-filled explanation for including us in the list requires some corrections:

Heartland isn’t a “climate denial ‘think’ tank.” Last time I checked, no Heartland spokesperson ever denied the existence of the climate, or even climate change.


Heartland didn’t “implode” or “suffer major damage” in 2012. In fact, we increased receipts by about 15% from 2011, increased the number of donors nearly four-fold, more than doubled the number of policy advisors (to 237), and set records for press attention and online traffic for our sites. 2012 was a breakthrough year for us, thanks in no small part to the attention generated by our work on global warming/cooling.


We have never tried to “prove that cigarette smoking was not bad for you.” We do argue that taxes on smokers are too high and second-hand smoke is not the public health threat that anti-smoking zealots claim.


We were not “caught red handed trying to fund an effort explicitly (but secretly) designed to damage science education in public schools.” That description is based on a fake memo circulated by disgraced water scientist Peter Gleick. We announced the curriculum project in our members newsletter and explained there that our intent is to help de-politicize the issue. How is that a bad thing?


We did run a billboard about global warming, but it did not “equat[e] people who thought the climate science on global warming is based on facts and is not a fraud with well-known serial killers.” The billboard simply pointed out that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, still believes in global warming, and asked viewers if they do, too. We know why lefties went nuts over it – Kaczynski, after all, is one of their own – but it wasn’t inaccurate or offensive.


We lost a few corporate donors who couldn’t stand the heat when liberal advocacy groups, using a donor list stolen by the aforementioned Peter Gleick, circulated online petitions demanding that they stop funding us. But as already mentioned, we gained many more donors than we lost and had an exceptionally good fundraising year.


Laden ends by saying The Heartland Institute, “which never was really that big, is now no longer a factor in the climate change.” He’s right that we aren’t very big – about $6 million a year – but he’s wrong about the role we continue to play in the international debate. Our Eighth International Conference on Climate Change, held in Munich on November 31-December 1, 2012, was a huge success. We’ve got projects on climate already lined up for 2013 that make 2012 look like a dress rehearsal.

In short, Heartland played a major role in shaping the debate over global warming in 2012, and we expect to play an even larger role in 2013. Sometimes it takes a little controversy to break through media bias and public indifference. Heartland achieved this in 2012.
Joe Bast is the president of the Heartland Institute

"When Ken Pimlott began fighting US wildfires at the age of 17, they seemed to him to be a brutal but manageable natural phenomenon.  “We had periodic [fire] sieges in the 80s, but there were breaks in between,” said Pimlott, the former head of the California department of forestry and fire protection. But no longer. “That doesn’t really happen any more. Now you can’t even blink” between fires, he said. “We’re seeing the kinds of fires we have never seen before.” A recent study published in the journal Science helps explains why, revealing that the south-western US is in the grip of a 20-year megadrought – a period of severe aridity that is stoking fires, depleting reservoirs and putting a strain on water supplies to the states of the region. “You see impacts everywhere, in snowpacks, reservoir levels, agriculture, groundwater and tree mortality,” said co-author Benjamin Cook, of Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. “Droughts are these amazingly disruptive events. Water sits at the foundation of everything.” Researchers compared soil moisture records from 2000-2019 to other drought events from the past 1,200 years. They found that the current period is worse than all but one of five megadroughts identified in the record. Unlike past megadroughts – brought on by natural fluctuations in the Earth’s climate – this current drought has been heavily influenced by human-induced climate change, “pushing what would have been a moderate drought in south-western North America into megadrought territory”, according to the study. “Global warming has made the drought much worse than it otherwise would have been,” said Cook. “We estimate 30-50% is attributed to climate change.” According to Nasa, 19 of the 20 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. Climate change, if unchecked, will hit the American south-west particularly hard. A major concern is the megadrought’s impact on water supplies in the region. It has experienced explosive growth – half of the nation’s fastest-growing states are in the south-west – made possible by elaborate river diversion projects and massive reservoirs. Over the past two decades, drought-depleted rivers, and population growth has led to steep declines in two of the nation’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, on which which tens of millions of people depend. Water deliveries from the Colorado River are also being rationed this year, for the first time. For Pimlott, this drought has manifested itself in 21st-century fires unlike any he had previously witnessed. In 2018, a fire tornado destroyed part of one northern California town, and almost the entire community of Paradise, California, was wiped out by a blaze that claimed 85 victims. “Were seeing more intense fires, with longer durations,” he said."
"

Business leaders are fuming over Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s nervy use of the Martin Act, the state law that gives him super‐​broad powers to investigate and press charges against alleged financial fraud. For example, Schneiderman has gone after several large energy firms for allegedly over‐​optimistic financial comments on upstate gas “fracking,” a charge conveniently aligned with his own anti‐​fracking stance. Recently he used the act in an attempt to upset a settlement deal between bankers and the feds over mortgage misdeeds — critics charge him with “blindsiding” the Bank of New York Mellon with what BNYM calls “outrageous” and “baseless” fraud charges.



But it’s a mistake to see Schneiderman’s left‐​tilting politics as the main source of the problem. As became clear under the reign of then‐​AG Eliot Spitzer, the trouble is with the state of the Martin Act itself. And the state of that law results from a devil’s deal that many leading New York City firms were happy enough to accept — until it blew up in the complacent faces of their execs and lawyers.



Albany passed the Martin Act in 1921, strengthening it at intervals so that it now grants more sweeping powers to New York’s AG than his federal or state counterparts wield. Equally important was that, over the decades, it became subject to an “unspoken gentleman’s agreement” (as Nicholas Thompson called it in a 2004 _Legal Affairs_ piece).



Crusading prosecutors like Louis Lefkowitz used the act to chase out of town the crumbums, sad sacks and grifters of the investment world. And up to a point — a point painfully symbolized by the career of Bernard Madoff — it seemed to work. A lot of shady penny‐​stock operators, worm‐​farm promoters and small‐​town Ponzi guys did head for states where such doings were less effectively policed.



That in turn pleased many on Wall Street — who gained from the general public impression that if you were dealing securities in a major way out of New York, you’d had to pass closer inspection than some guy from Florida or Utah.



Trouble is, with few well‐​established businesses pushing back, the Martin Act was turning by stages into a blank check for the prosecution. Under its terms, the AG can subpoena witnesses or demand the production of documents without probable cause or a grand jury’s say‐​so. He can sue anyone for alleged fraud without showing that anyone relied on the alleged misrepresentations to their detriment, and, astoundingly, without even having to show a guilty state of mind or intent to commit fraud. In this the act goes far beyond both federal securities law and common law.



Moreover, the law gives the AG almost total discretion over the public release of once‐​private documents and testimony — a perfect weapon for trying cases in the press. To top it all, targets of subpoenas do not enjoy rights against self‐​incrimination or even a right as of law to have a lawyer present.



Rather than resist the chipping away of the historic rights of those accused of wrongdoing, New York courts blessed ever‐​more expansive construction of the law’s terms on grounds that the Martin Act is after all “remedial.” Was the act turning into a menace to civil liberties? Few in high‐​level law and business circles seemed particularly to care: It wasn’t happening to _their_ clients.



Then Eliot Spitzer broke the deal.



In those days Spitzer was a national idol, flying high with indictment after indictment, headline after headline, settlement after settlement, opining about every issue under the legal sun (notably including the need for stiffer sentences for “johns”) and demanding that disgraced execs never be allowed to practice again in their old lines of business.



Famously, he sicced the Martin Act with great success against Merrill Lynch and other pillars of American finance. Most targets settled fast — who wouldn’t fold when the law gives the prosecutor all the legal cards?



Successors have followed in his path. Then‐​AG Andrew Cuomo used the law to browbeat utilities into issuing more warnings about climate change, supposedly with investor protection in mind rather than his environmentalist allies. Schneiderman is playing the same game. No end is in sight.



I don’t like crumbums and grifters either, but might we not be better off if someone had stuck up for their due process rights back when?

"DENVER  —   The Army approved the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Tuesday, paving the way for an infrastructure project that has been surrounded by protest and controversy. Robert Speer, the acting secretary of the Army, announced the decision to Congress, saying he was ready to offer the pipeline’s owner a   easement on a disputed patch of land. The move drew outrage from opponents, including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation in North Dakota sits less than a mile from the proposed pipeline route. And it drew cheers from supporters, who said the planning process for the completion of the $3. 7 billion project had already lasted too long. The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, Dave Archambault II, responded to the decision by vowing to fight it in court. “As native peoples, we have been knocked down again,” he said in statement. “But we will get back up, we will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact. ” The pipeline is set to run under the Missouri River near the reservation. It is opposed by many members of the tribe. Construction of the route has become a global rallying point for environmental and tribal activism, drawing thousands of people to a sprawling protest camp and sometimes prompting clashes with authorities. They had objected to the pipeline’s path running so close to the source of the tribe’s drinking water, noting that any spill could poison water supplies for it and others downstream. Members of the tribe also said the pipeline would cross through sacred ancestral lands. The move comes two weeks after President Trump ordered an expedited  review of the pipeline, part of his administration’s goal of supporting fossil fuel development and lowering barriers for major infrastructure initiatives. The project would carry 470, 000 barrels of oil a day. In the decision, Mr. Speer said he would halt the preparation of an environmental impact statement meant to assess the effects of the pipeline, adding that he had sufficient information to support approval. The move will allow for the completion of the last mile and a half of the   project, connecting oil production areas in North Dakota to a crude oil terminal near Patoka, Ill. The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners. The decision prompted immediate outcry from people within the protest camp, which now numbers about 400 people, according to Manape LaMere, 38, a leader living by the route since October. “All of our hearts are broken,” said Linda Black Elk, part of the protest’s healer council, in an emotional video live from the camp. “I’m just going to ask you guys to keep us all in your prayers. Pray for the water. Pray for the people. Pray for the water protectors. Pray for the tribe. ” The decision left some feeling whiplashed. Two months ago, under the Obama administration and in the face of global protests, the Army said that it would explore alternative routes for the pipeline. In a statement on Tuesday, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, a Republican, applauded the Army’s decision. “This is a key step toward the completion of this important infrastructure project, which has faced months of politically driven delays and will allow for safe transport of North Dakota product to market. ”"
"

These two political figures are chalk and cheese with very little, if anything, in common. They rule from opposite ends of the political spectrum, where Trump is a nationalist, the powerful master of a booming economy, and Ardern a globalist, seemingly unaware that her tiny nation is limping along at half speed precisely because her globalist theories don’t work in practice.



A man of action meeting a woman of unfulfilled promises, and it doesn’t take much imagination to know that Trump will not offer Ardern anything more than pleasantries. Trump is the master of the deal and Ardern will be sorely disappointed when all she brings to the table is her fist, with which she threatened following her bi-partisan meeting with Scott Morrison in July.



Following that meeting, [Ardern spoke to media](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/07/pm-jacinda-ardern-calls-on-united-states-to-play-larger-role-within-our-region.html) about her demand for greater US involvement in the region, suggesting that she and ScoMo were on the same page, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. 



“The Prime Minister [Ardern] is calling on the United States to play a larger role in Asia Pacific and says New Zealand will “suffer” if nations “look more inwardly”. 



  
Ardern seems to think that nationalists are introspective, whereas globalists, in contrast, are outward-looking. This implies Trump is only concerned about the US and uninterested in the rest of the world, which is not true. Trump puts the US first (why can’t Ardern do that for us?) but he also pays close attention to what is happening overseas.



“Ardern said there ‘has been a view in the past few years’ between Australia and New Zealand that there ‘hasn’t been the same level of attention from the United States within our region’.”



Ardern is presumptuous to speak on Australia’s behalf. She knows New Zealand has been ignored by Trump but Australia has not. ScoMo scored tariff [relief for Australia for 85%](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0203/03RP09) of its steel exports to the US, whereas Ardern failed to achieve any tariff relief whatsoever for us.



What ScoMo took to the US for his visit last week, from his earlier meeting with Ardern, was not table-thumping demands. “There are many larger… more powerful friends that America has, but they know _they do not have a more sure and steadfast friend_ than Australia,” [Morrison said](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/20/scott-morrison-lands-us-promising-another-100-years-friendship). Trump’s response was to accord ScoMo the highest honour he possibly could. A state banquet.



“Australian flags are fluttering alongside the Stars and Stripes at the White House, where Morrison will get a red carpet, honor guard, joint press conference and then dinner in the beautiful Rose Garden.



Morrison may air Australia’s nervousness about Trump’s trade war with China. In June, he warned of smaller economies suffering collateral damage and of the global system coming “under real pressure.” But this is likely to be a relaxed meeting between political friends, albeit with a lot of pomp and ceremony.



Although the head of state in Australia is Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, not Morrison, the White House is giving this the most prestigious category of state dinner. 



It’s only the second time that has been granted in the Trump presidency and the first for an Australian premier here since John Howard in 2006.” 



Our own PTPM won’t have to dust off her ball gown and heels. She will be very lucky if she even gets to meet the leader of the free world because, after all, these two have nothing in common compared to ScoMo and Trump.



“Morrison will cement his place in a growing conservative club – also including the likes of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson – drawn into Trump’s orbit.



Trump has defied controversy over his push to prevent illegal immigrants and asylum seekers from crossing the Mexican border. Similarly, Morrison, a former immigration minister, has worked to make Australia less attractive to would-be asylum seekers. 



His Liberal-National coalition also has much in common with Trump’s climate change skepticism, rejecting overwhelming scientific warnings to encourage lucrative fossil fuel industries. Australia is the world’s largest coal exporter.



Australia has joined Trump’s coalition to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, where Iranian forces threaten to interfere with the massive international flow of oil exports. 



One area that Trump especially appreciates is trade where the United States enjoys a surplus. The trade conflicts proliferating under Trump have bypassed Australia.”



Our PTPM talks about the importance of trade, but the path she chose for us is the globalist one enjoyed by the UK, Germany, France and Sweden. For this, we are expected to be grateful, but more than that, she wants to do a trade deal with the master of the deal? In our neighbour’s words: “she’s dreamin’”.



Either we are living in the wrong country or we have the wrong leader because Ardern is not us.

"Death certificates and commemorative plaques aren’t something you’d normally associate with a glacier. But that is exactly how Iceland recently mourned the loss of 700-year-old Okjökull, the first of its major glaciers to die. This is just one early example of events we will encounter more and more often as the hot new world we are creating slowly destroys ecosystems and livelihoods. But acknowledging the growing emotional trauma and grief felt at present and future environmental tragedies may yet be the kick we need to limit their reach. Grief radically differs in its logic from ordinary sadness over a loss. If sadness is the response to the removal of an object from the tablecloth that represents a person’s lived world, grief results from loss that tears the very fabric of that cloth. In order to repair this hole and emerge from the resulting pain and outrage, the lived world has to be reconfigured. To grieve though, one must acknowledge the tear in that world. This can take time, and denial is a common part of the process of accepting deep loss. This may at first take the form of a temptation toward out-and-out disbelief, and linger as sporadic thoughts and hopes that what was lost, wasn’t. It may seem an irrational reaction, but it’s a completely understandable defence mechanism against life-shattering loss. The world without what’s been lost is so radically and qualitatively different that the psyche resists accepting reality.

      Climate change: seeing the planet break down is depressing – here's how to turn your pain into action


 While much climate denial owes itself to corruption and vested interests, the avoidance of grief may explain why many decent and intelligent people are also tempted to deny the climatic breakdown humans are causing. It is, in a certain sense, unimaginable, even absurd, to think of us destabilising our very climate, or the scale and speed of change required to stop the slide. It isn’t surprising that so many people have been desperately hoping that the science must somehow be wrong, or that so many more act as if we can still hope for the continuation of our same old world, rather than the fundamental shift in the way we operate and organise that’s required. It requires sustained strength and attention to gradually turn denial into acceptance and to build a new life. Actions like Iceland’s glacier funeral are a vital part of that process. As symbols of eternity, glaciers have great cultural significance on the Nordic island. They’re also crucial for tourism and energy. And at current rates of warming, all of the country’s glaciers will suffer Okjökull’s fate in the next 200 years, one by one. For Icelanders, emotionally acknowledging this can galvanise the associated grief into action. It’s not an easy process, of course. As marks of our recklessness, the grief in cases such as this is particularly potent and often laden with anger, akin to that of someone close to a murder victim. This glacier ecosystem wasn’t “lost” - to speak of loss here is euphemistic. It was killed on our watch. Grief over climate breakdown and the degradation of our natural world is also notably different from grief at the death of a loved one, because it never lessens, let alone goes away. The anthropogenic climate emergency will define our entire lifetime, and deeply impact on all of us soon enough. Because of time-lags in the climate system, things will get worse for a long time to come, whatever we do. Thus, while a healthy reaction to the death of a loved one is to grieve deeply and then gradually to recover, the only recovery from ecological grief that is possible at all is for us to change the world such that our actions no longer deteriorate it. This is how ecological grief – at the tearing from us of the natural systems we are neither willing nor able to do without – leads to the radical action necessary to bring about a new world. Given how late the hour is, that means not accepting inaction any longer – and that’s up to us. In the words of Iceland’s commemorative plaque, laid at the base of the dead glacier as a message to the future: “We know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.” Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"The   weather in New York City saw a   62 degrees on Wednesday, but a significant snowstorm expected to move in overnight prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to close schools on Thursday. The announcement came after the National Weather Service on Wednesday posted a winter storm warning for the city and a blizzard warning for the eastern part of Long Island. Forecasts called for 8 to 12 inches of snow throughout northern New Jersey, the Hudson Valley, Long Island, coastal Connecticut and the city. The heaviest snow was expected from early Thursday morning through afternoon, with wind gusts up to 35 m. p. h. the service said on its website. Nationwide, airports were reporting more than 2, 800 canceled flights for Thursday, according to FlightAware. com, a   website. Newark Liberty International Airport had 603 canceled flights, La Guardia Airport, 566, and Kennedy International Airport, 480, the website reported on Thursday night. On Wednesday, the temperature reached 62 degrees in Central Park, beating the previous record of 61 degrees set in 1965. Around the city on Wednesday, people were taking advantage  —   walking around in   and tank tops, sitting outdoors at cafes, enjoying parks and promenades. For children who longed for a snow day, the news of the snowstorm was a reason to cheer. Libby Courtemanche had taken her two sons, Christopher, 2, and Bradley, less than a year old, to a park in Huntington, Long Island, on Wednesday. “You know what’s gonna happen tomorrow?” she asked the   . “It’s gonna snow. And we’re gonna get to play in the snow. ” And this roller coaster ride of extremes is sure to provide fuel for those who gripe about the weather. It will be unseasonably warm Wednesday and unpleasantly wintry Thursday, but neither will be just right, of course. Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the drastic shift in weather was “unusual, but it’s certainly not unprecedented. ” The extremes should not be seen as a sign that the gods are angry. Mr. Morrin said it could be explained by two competing weather patterns: cold air masses descending from the North that will push out a   warm air mass in time to chill the city and turn precipitation to snow. “Air masses move,” he said. “It’s just the timing. ” At Cozy Coffee in   Brooklyn, patrons headed straight for the back patio, where owner Migdalia Medina ran cups of coffee and small plates of food plates to people seated at picnic tables under a canopy of bare tree branches. “As soon as they feel it they start coming out,” Ms. Medina said of her customers. As for Thursday’s forecast, she said the patio seating “also looks good under snow. ” The New York weather historian Steve Fybish, who keeps records of the city’s weather dating to the 19th century, agreed that the weather swing was not unusual. He rifled through his records to find other days of similar extremes: a snowstorm and a   afternoon within a couple of days in 1984 69 degrees on a November day followed by five inches of snow in 1896. In February 2014, when the Super Bowl was at the Meadowlands, in East Rutherford, N. J. the weather swung sharply. While there had been concerns that the outdoor game at MetLife Stadium would be affected by the cold, game day registered a mild 49 degrees at the stadium and 57 degrees in the city. But the next day, the temperature plunged to 27 degrees followed by a cold snap that was punctuated by eight inches of snow. On Thursday, the snowfall is likely to be heaviest during the morning commute, Mr. Morrin said. “I don’t think there’s going to be anyone rushing anywhere,” he said. “The commute time will be impacted. ”"
"The level of methane in the atmosphere has risen dramatically in the last decade – and climate scientists are worried. Although there’s still roughly 60 times less of it floating around than carbon dioxide, the gas heats the planet 86 times more intensely than CO₂ over a 20-year period, meaning that it accounts for about a quarter of human-caused global heating we’re experiencing today. And because it’s so potent in the short-term, fluctuations in its levels can have large and rapid impacts on how much global temperature rises in the next few decades. The trouble is, the research community hasn’t been able to work out conclusively what’s most to blame for the increase. Some previous work has suggested that biological sources such as tropical wetlands, rice cultivation, or animal agriculture were the main culprits. But according to new research, chemical fingerprints point to a different source – natural gas. The Cornell University study indicates that natural gas production is responsible for two-thirds of the sizeable rise in global methane emissions between 2008 and 2014 – with shale gas produced by fracking accounting for more than half of this increase. So how could so much be escaping? Multiple stages of the fracking process, in which shale rock is fractured to release trapped oil or gas, result in gas being deliberately vented or flared. In the USA, during commercial extraction, gas not suitable for consumption may be vented or flared. Gas is similarly vented to regulate pressure during compression and storage. Wells and pipelines are also emptied whenever they need routine testing or maintenance, so that works can be performed without risk of explosion. In addition to these deliberate and necessary processes, a proportion of methane emissions from fracking is accidentally released, due to leaks and other more infrequent but more serious incidents. For example, in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta, one of the largest shale reserves in the world, there were more than two leaks or spills a day on average in 2018. The borehole can also leak after the well is decommissioned. Emissions like these aren’t restricted to fracked gas. “Conventional” oil and gas fields – those in which the oil and gas is more readily accessible – also have pressure venting requirements and are susceptible to leaks and occasionally even blowouts. So how do you tell one source of methane from another? The key is that methane gas from shale has a different chemical signature to conventionally extracted gas. The study first determined the typical chemical composition of methane from fracking, conventional gas extraction, and natural sources. Then, analysing the the overall chemical composition of methane in the atmosphere, it calculated a contribution to each source based on the proportion each different signature accounted for. It’s worth exercising some caution with regards to the severity of fracking’s contribution to methane emissions though, as there is likely to be some overlap between the chemical compositions of shale and conventional gas. Their signatures are somewhat distinct because shale gas is typically less mobile than the gas in a conventional oil and gas field – but rock formations can be highly variable and complex, and other factors can influence the chemical composition too. Nevertheless, while the relative contributions of conventional and fracked gas may be blurry, the research still indicates that natural gas production is the main culprit for the weight of 5m elephants’ worth of methane being added to the atmosphere each year. The current study backs up work published by NASA in early 2018 – that two-thirds of the rise in atmospheric methane is down to fossil fuels. Nobody can get away from the fact that natural gas extraction releases fugitive methane, not to mention the CO₂ produced when successfully captured gas is burnt. There are now serious question marks over the suitability of natural gas as a less polluting bridge fuel on the journey from coal and oil towards renewable energy. Does it still make sense to invest in new gas infrastructure when existing fossil fuel reserves already place the UN’s target of limiting warming to 1.5℃ under threat? At the very least, if natural gas continues to be developed, we need more smart monitoring systems streaming data in real time to prevent all but necessary emissions. The majority of fugitive methane emissions come from a minority of locations and activities – so-called super-emitters, whose emissions spikes are largely avoidable. In England, for example, methane was recently released into the atmosphere merely as a result of failing to burn the methane produced during a well test. It is the duty of countries who pursue this path to make sure that not a jot more methane is emitted than required. Sadly, this duty is not yet being fulfilled.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC’s tone, amplified by the media, speaks volumes: With its latest report, the UN organization is attempting to incite and lead a global coup d’état – with the main focus on Europe and North America.
Predictably the media in Germany are reporting today on the release of the IPCC’s Working Group II report and the new, shrill levels of alarm it has reached. The overall underlying tone from much of the German media is: The whole world needs to panic and drastic action is urgent and warranted!
Never mind that global temperatures have not warmed at all in over 15 years. The message coming from the German media is as clear as it is alarmist: Go for the hostile takeover! We’ll be behind you.
The center-left Die Zeit writes:
According to the new UN climate report, climate change is going to have more drastic impacts if man does not put the brakes on it more than it has up to now.”
And adds it’s not yet too late to act:
Through rash and comprehensive measures to reduce CO2, the dangers can be considerably reduced.”
Nothing like a thinly veiled call for a coup d’état.
Berlin’s leftist TAZ here writes that climate change is “blossoming and thriving“, warning that:

The galloping global warming is going to have drastic impacts. The UN climate report leaves no doubt a change of course is urgently needed.”
Tim Gore of Oxfam is quoted by TAZ:
The report is there and the message is clear: The impacts of climate change on the supply of food are worse than estimated earlier.”
The Handelsblatt, the business paper for the guilt-ridden rich, writes:
And getting control of the impacts of global warming, ocean over-acidification or climate-dependent natural catastrophes on millions of people is the largest humanitarian and economic challenge of our time.”
The Handelsblatt does add, though, that the IPCC risks failing in delivering the message because it seems to have “its finger permanently pressed on the alarm button” and that “many people have gotten used to the tone and only find it annoying.”
A correspondent on NDR Radio this morning said that the situation was dire, and that the scientists who authored the report were serious and that it had to be taken seriously. He mentioned that there were some dissident voices, but are mainly a gaggle of “Americans”, intonating they cannot be taken seriously.
Not every media outlet in Germany has allowed itself to be completely swallowed up by the uncontrolled fit of hysteria and calls for a green coup d’etat. Strangely Die Welt left the IPCC horror release off the top of its website (at least as of noon today), only posting an obscure story on how the country’s environment minister wants to combat climate change with textiles, saying that Germans might have to get used to wearing pullovers indoors in the wintertime.
At Spiegel, Axel Bojanowski writes that the climate debate has morphed into “a conflict between rich and poor countries” and that “developing countries are requesting payments from the industrial nations as indemnification“. Bojanowski also writes that the IPCC also had to backpedal on some of its earlier predictions involving species die-off, climate refugees, droughts in Africa, and hurricanes in the North Atlantic.

"The Morrison government will come under pressure over climate change in the looming byelection in Eden-Monaro, with a new poll showing six in 10 voters in the seat believe the Coalition is not doing enough to tackle the problem. The polling, commissioned by the progressive activist group GetUp, also illustrates the far-reaching impact of the summer of bushfires across the key New South Wales electorate, with nearly six in seven people surveyed saying they were affected in some way.  The Liberals fired the starting gun on their campaign on Sunday as their newly preselected candidate, Dr Fiona Kotvojs, sought to emphasise her green credentials by saying she had solar panels on her house and believed “that humans contribute to that changing climate”. Kotvojs – who narrowly fell short of winning the seat at the 2019 election – has been criticised in the past for playing down the central role of humans in contributing to the climate crisis. At a media conference in the town of Murrumbateman, Scott Morrison said the government was committed to lowering emissions and that Kotvojs “knows how to get things done”. She will be facing off against Labor candidate Kristy McBain, the former Bega Valley mayor, who has been campaigning without a major rival candidate for the past three weeks. McBain has sought to highlight gaps in the federal government’s support for local communities during the drought, fire and coronavirus crises. A byelection date is expected to be confirmed in the coming days, with speculation it could be set for 27 June or 4 July – just before the NSW school holidays. The survey, conducted by uComms on behalf of GetUp, polled 879 residents across Eden-Monaro last Wednesday night. It found 59% of the sample agreed with the statement that “the government is not doing enough to address climate change” – including 48% who strongly agreed. About 27% of the sample disagreed with the statement – including 12% strongly. Roughly 59% of the sample said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported publicly-funded renewable energy projects to create secure, full-time jobs in the local area, while 17% said they would be less likely to support such a candidate. Of the 85% of the respondents who said they were affected by the recent bushfire events, about 7% said they were affected severely, 21% significantly, 31% moderately and 27% slightly.  However, the sample was evenly divided on whether they were satisfied with the federal government’s response and support during the bushfire crisis. The poll’s margin of error was about 4 percentage points. The national director of GetUp, Paul Oosting, said the poll showed people “overwhelmingly want real, urgent action on climate change”. “People in Eden-Monaro won’t let politicians forget how their community was devastated by the bushfire crisis,” he said. Oosting said GetUp had more than 6,000 members who lived in Eden-Monaro and they would be “talking to their community about how we can recover better from the bushfires and create a safer climate future and sustainable jobs with investment in clean renewable energy”. Robynne Burchell, a GetUp member from the southern NSW town of Delegate which was evacuated three times during the bushfire crisis, said the fires were still front of mind for most people as they saw it everyday when they drove somewhere. The federal government has resisted calls to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, even though every Australian state has signed up to the goal and scientists say the world must reach it around the middle of the century to achieve the Paris agreement aspiration of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky News on Sunday gas and coal would “continue to play a really important role in our system for many years”. Guardian Australia revealed last week that a group advising the government on the Covid-19 recovery argued Australian taxpayers should underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry. On Sunday, McBain congratulated Kotvojs and said she hoped all candidates would “run a clean campaign, free of dirty tricks, focused on the issues that actually matter to people in Eden-Monaro”. Declaring her central focus would be on jobs, McBain seized on the revelation the jobkeeper program would cost $60bn less than originally forecast to call on the government to expand its eligibility, including to short-term casuals. It is unclear whether the Nationals will preselect their own candidate for the seat after John Barilaro, the NSW deputy premier, pulled out of the race a few weeks ago amid tensions with the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, and the Liberal state minister Andrew Constance, who also abandoned plans to run."
"For people in the market for a used car, the “certified  ” designation has long been the gold standard, an indication that a qualified mechanic has vouched for the car and that a buyer can expect a vehicle that is  —   hopefully  —   almost as good as new. But the Takata airbag recall, which is the biggest in history, has upended all of that. Now the certified designation  —   known in the auto trade as C. P. O.  —   will no longer necessarily have the same meaning. For one thing, last month the Federal Trade Commission made it easier for cars to be billed as “certified,” even if they were under recall and hadn’t been fixed yet. And just as significantly, Ford  —   with the F. T. C. settlement for cover  —   told its dealers this week that they could sell recalled vehicles and certify them too, so long as they did not advertise them as “safe” and required buyers to sign forms acknowledging that they were aware of the problem. Against this backdrop, one dealer in Florida has refused to sell recalled vehicles that he cannot get fixed, letting 100 or so pile up on a lot miles from his main showroom. He even sued a rival who he believes is selling recalled cars without disclosing that they have not been fixed yet. How did the   market get so confusing all of a sudden? For starters, the Takata airbag recall is unprecedented in its scope, with over 60 million airbags affected, but also in its complexity. Dealers can’t simply fix everything at once, because there are not enough replacement parts. As a result, the airbags most likely to cause harm are first in line for repair, and the lines for existing recalls and others to come may extend for at least a few more years. Given that situation, the Federal Trade Commission told General Motors and two dealers in December that it was just fine to advertise used vehicles as certified even if their airbags were under recall and had not been fixed. Just disclose it, the agency said (in a complaint that has sent jaws dropping throughout the auto industry). Until early this week, every major car company had said that they forbade their dealers from selling certified used vehicles with any open recalls, including ones for Takata airbags. On Monday, however, Ford broke ranks, issuing an update to dealers on its “enhanced” recall process and giving them permission to certify used vehicles that had open recalls after all. There are conditions for the dealers, including these: They must note the recall in two different places and have buyers initial a form. When parts arrive, they have to contact buyers to schedule a replacement. And no advertisements may make claims about “safety” or “safety inspections. ” So does Ford believe there is no competitive advantage to be gained from fixing all recalled cars before selling them? “It’s very difficult to answer that,” Sara Tatchio, a Ford spokeswoman, said. “We absolutely put safety first and fix everything we can. ” All the chaos, conflict and changing policies leave consumers in a frustrating position, trying to sort out who’s still selling cars that federal regulators have ordered to be fixed and just how much any seller is disclosing. While federal law prevents dealers from selling new cars with an open recall, no federal law forbids them from selling used ones that way, even if some state consumer protection laws might help an injured owner’s case. In the complex   ecosystem of   and with wholesalers and sellers of various sorts, this has created a number of challenges and a wide range of responses, including some prominent companies that have changed their policies 180 degrees. Whatever policies they set, automakers have only so much control, given that people who work at dealerships occasionally go rogue. Moreover, dealers sometimes certify a car as clean and put it up for sale  —   and then it’s recalled right after that. If the dealer does not catch it and pull the car out of the sales inventory, it is violating the automaker’s rules (and could attract the attention of the F. T. C. ). Buyers who wonder how safe it is to drive with a recalled Takata airbag and check the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website will learn the following: “The vast majority of Takata airbags will perform as expected. ” Oh, but: “Lives have been lost due to this defect. ” Reaction in the industry to Ford’s move was somewhat muted. Audi, BMW, General Motors, Honda, Kia, Mazda and Subaru said they had no plans to follow Ford’s move. Toyota’s response was a bit more squishy. “We are not going to speculate on what impact the F. T. C. ruling may or may not have on Toyota’s current policy,” Aaron Fowles, a Toyota spokesman, said via email. “But there have been no changes to date. ” The   chain CarMax has taken a similar approach to Ford’s. While it too had a recent   with the F. T. C. over disclosure issues, the company says that it is transparent as possible, from its online listings to its   interactions. But why sell cars with open recalls at all, thus putting the onus on consumers to sort out the repair? In a statement on its website, CarMax, which cannot repair recalled vehicles itself, states that “customers are in the best position to act on recall information. ” How can that be? Well, CarMax explains that dealers who are authorized to do recall repairs are more likely to repair cars quickly when working with an individual. If CarMax showed up with dozens of cars, those dealers might shun it because it competes with that dealer’s   operation. Does this sound like an extremely useful conspiracy theory designed to dump all the hassle on consumers, who have the least knowledge of how the system works? Would CarMax at least call out said manufacturers by name, to help get to the bottom of this? No, it would not. “Some manufacturers have provided guidance to their dealers that they should remediate recalls for dealer customers first,” a CarMax spokeswoman, Catherine M. Gryp, said in an email message. “Across the country, we have been put in the back of the line for recall repairs. ” AutoNation took a different approach, at least at first. In 2015, its chief executive, Mike Jackson, told Automotive News that the recall situation was “a dysfunctional nightmare that the industry should be ashamed of. ” The company pledged to sell no cars with open recalls, period. By last year, it was costing the company dearly, to the tune of 6 cents per share of its earnings in the third quarter. In November, it gave up and began selling some cars with open recalls (and full disclosures). The lack of Takata airbag replacements, the F. T. C. ’s decision and other anticipated regulatory rollbacks proved to be too much. “We are proud of the efforts we made, but sometimes the system beats you down,” Marc Cannon, the company’s chief marketing officer, said. Sounds kind of like what it feels like to be a consumer in the middle of all this. If you’re about to start shopping for a used car, begin at safercar. gov. There, you can look up cars  —   even the vehicle identification number of a specific car you’re considering  —   to see what recalls are in effect. A report from Carfax can help you figure out whether a recalled car has been fixed. But don’t stop there. Ask the dealer about any open recalls, as well as any proof they might have that they have gotten the recall fixed. Trust, but verify. (Actually? Don’t trust too much, and verify twice.) Worried about a car that you already have? You should be, both about future Takata recalls and others that we don’t know about yet. Rosemary Shahan of the Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety suggests registering your vehicle both with your car’s manufacturer and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration so that you get a notice if your airbag or anything else comes up for recall. Run the vehicle identification number through some checks yourself from time to time too, just to make sure you’re not missing anything. You might also hope that more dealers act out in the same way as Earl Stewart of Lake Park, Fla. He refuses to sell used cars with open recalls, but he doesn’t want to turn away people who are trading in cars with recalled Takata airbags that they have not been able to get fixed yet. This   policy isn’t just good customer service if he can’t take their trade, they might not buy another vehicle from him at the same time that they turn their old one in. As a result, however, he has 100 or so cars sitting in a lot waiting for repair. And when he sent secret shoppers into competing dealers to see how much disclosure they were doing about recalled cars they were selling, he was outraged at what he found. “Maybe this is unique to South Florida, but they are all extremely devious and proactively trying to sell recalled cars by saying there is no recall,” Mr. Stewart said. So he filed a lawsuit to try to swing others over to his way of doing things. “I don’t want the money  —   I just want to stop the practice,” he said. “We’re going to keep filing suits until they throw the towel in. ”"
"**Shop prices are falling in the run-up to Christmas as retailers race to clear stock amid a ""deepening"" High Street crisis, a report has said.**
Discounts are most common at retailers selling fashion and DIY goods, according to the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) Shop Price Index.
Overall, it found prices of goods excluding food fell 3.7% in November.
Market researchers Mintel and Springboard say they see similar trends and expect further falls in December.
The BRC said the discounting reflected ""an extremely challenging year"" for retailers after trade was put on hold because of lockdowns.
""As we approach Christmas, consumers will be glad to see another month of falling prices,"" said boss Helen Dickinson.
""Where demand was weak for some products, discounting has followed, with many retailers trying to encourage more consumer spending, particularly those selling fashion and DIY goods.""
The BRC's Shop Price Index tracked the price of 500 of the most commonly bought High Street products from 2 to 6 November - a period that crossed into the start of England's second national lockdown.
Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said pre-Christmas discounts were not new, but that there would be more deals than usual this year as non-essential shops tried to make up for lost sales.
""Many retailers will have committed to orders, not had enough time to cancel and then ended up lumbered with stock,"" she told the BBC.
""They won't be able to sell things like seasonal gift sets and certain fashion lines in the new year, so we expect lots of discounts on those.""
Retailers are also trying to get people to do their Christmas shopping earlier, fearing a spike in online orders that will be hard to fulfil, said Nick Carroll, associate director of retail at Mintel.
This partly explains why this year's Black Friday sale had lasted longer than usual, with deals available as early as 1 November, he said.
""We've seen huge pressure on logistics operations and people not able to get their goods on time, so the more demand is spread out out, the easier it will be.""
The pandemic continues to batter retailers, putting thousands of jobs at risks.
This week Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, while Debenhams announced it would shut its 124 UK stores after last-ditch rescue talks failed.
The BRC's Ms Dickinson said businesses shuttered during lockdown had ""lost billions in sales and many are now in a precarious financial position"".
She called for more government support saying that ""without such interventions, we will see countless more store closures and job losses""."

Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, said Thomas Jefferson, and that includes religious freedom. Religious persecution is tragically common abroad.



While members of all faiths are sometimes at risk somewhere, Christians are constantly victimized almost everywhere. And in many of these cases the threat is violence, imprisonment, and even death. Martyrdom apparently is more common today than during Roman times.



The California‐​based group Open Doors has released its latestWorld Watch List of the 50 worst persecutors of Christians around the globe. A Baker’s Dozen are communist or former communist states, led by North Korea. An incredible 38 are Muslim, including several of Washington’s allies. (Seven are both communist/​former communist and Islamic, truly a toxic combination.) The other six are a potpourri — Hindu India, Buddhist Burma and Bhutan, conflict‐​ridden Colombia, and Eritrea and Ethiopia, which are both repressive and religiously divided.



Topping the World Watch List is the so‐​called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which leads any parade of the world’s repressive, impoverished, or just plain awful places. Explains Open Doors: “Defiantly Communist in the Stalinist style, a bizarre quasi‐​religion was built around the founder of the country, Kim Il Sung. Anyone with ‘another god’ is automatically persecuted, which is why the 200,000–400,000 Christians in this country must remain deeply underground.” At least a quarter of them may be confined to labor camps.



Number two is Afghanistan, where Americans and Europeans continue to die trying to create a Western‐​style liberal democracy. The status of Christians continues to decline. Reports Open Doors: “Despite having signed all international agreements designed to protect the freedom of religion, the government in the current setting is not even able to guarantee the most basic tenants of this right.” To the contrary, mobs cheerfully murder Americans and other non‐​Muslims when copies of the Koran are accidentally burned.



Another “friend” of Washington, Saudi Arabia, is number three. “Religious freedom does not exist in this heartland of Islam where citizens are only allowed to adhere to one religion,” notes Open Doors: “Apostasy — conversion to another religion — is punishable by death if the accused does not recant.” Of course, the Saudi royals live licentiously when abroad while posing as defenders of Islam at home.



Fourth is Somalia, another Muslim land. This area no longer constitutes a traditional nation. Alas, says Open Doors, “The overall persecution situation in Somalia tightened a bit more in the country. The main persecution engine is Islamic extremism.”



Iran, most in the news over fears that it might be developing nuclear weapons, ranks number five. “Religious persecution of certain minorities has intensified in Iran since 2005,” concludes Open Doors, including of Baha’is, Sufi Muslims, and Christians. Indeed, the group adds, “almost all Christian activity is illegal, especially when it occurs in Persian languages.” The regime has publicly denounced the expansion of Christianity, which it blamed on “the enemies of Islam.”



The Maldives comes next at six, a small island nation which simply bans other faiths. States Open Doors: “As every Maldivian citizen has to be Muslim, all deviant religious convictions are strictly forbidden.” Believers must “practice their faith in utmost secrecy, always in fear of being discovered.”



Number seven is Uzbekistan, where “All activities of unregistered churches are strictly forbidden, both inside and outside the churches. Youth activities are forbidden, outreaches are forbidden, seminars and training are forbidden.” Uzbekistan is a Muslim state that spent seven decades under Communism, a tragic mix almost guaranteeing religious persecution.



Also in the news is Yemen, which falls to eight on the World Watch List. Reports Open Doors: “Islam is the state religion and sharia is the source of all legislation. There is some religious freedom for foreigners, but evangelism is prohibited; several expatriate workers were deported in the past for Christian activities. Yemenis who leave Islam may face the death penalty as a result.”



Persecutor number nine is Iraq, a nation nominally liberated with American blood. Unfortunately, the U.S. invasion unleashed civil chaos and conflict which may have consumed 200,000 lives. The Christian community ended up as collateral damage. Explains Open Doors: “A true exodus of Christians is going on in Iraq. Christians are fleeing the country.” And for good reason: “Christian individuals are still being threatened, robbed, raped, or kidnapped and churches attacked.” Moreover, the situation is deteriorating even in Kurdistan, which until recently had been relatively safe for Christians.



Another not‐​so‐​loyal ally, Pakistan, rounds out the negative top ten. “Christians are a beleaguered minority… caught between Islamic militant organizations that routinely target Christians for violence, and an Islamizing culture that makes Christians feel less and less a part of Pakistan,” says Open Doors.



In eleventh place is Eritrea, a religiously mixed state ruled by one of the most viciously repressive governments in the world. Reports Open Doors: “Christians from the evangelical minority are pressurized to change or renounced their religion. They are tortured and forced to revert to the registered denominations. While no Christian has been killed in the last year, five Christians died in prison due to illness.”



Next at twelve comes backward Laos, still ruled by communists in a world in which communism has been largely relegated to academia, requires registration of religious groups, which are then controlled. Open Doors explains that “Other small independent Protestant congregations are under pressure and have been refused recognition. The activities of unrecognized churches are considered illegal by authorities, who detain and arrest their members and leaders under various pretexts.”



Northern Nigeria, which is majority Muslim, puts this important African state at number thirteen. Reports Open Doors: “The main persecution engine in northern Nigeria is Islamic extremism.” A recent rise in deaths caused the organization to raise Nigeria from 23 to 13: “this change highlights the structural process in which social groups firmly linked to a dominating religion (Islam) and government drive each other into a ‘vicious circle’ of suffocating religious minorities (Christians) in the sharia dominated areas of Northern Nigeria.”



At number fourteen is another Islamic African nation, Mauritania. Says Open Doors, “Because of harsh government restrictions, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for Christian missions and Christians in general to operate in the country.” Like other Islamic states, Mauritania “does not include any provision for religious freedom in its constitution, and its laws prohibit conversion to Christian faith. The sentence for apostasy is death,” adds the group.



Another long‐​time persecuting U.S. ally is Egypt, which holds the fifteenth position. For Christians, at least, the Arab Spring has turned into an Arab Winter. Open Doors details the sad tale: “… as the Islamists succeeded in the events following the constitutional referendum, the government was unable to restore necessary law and order.” Violence is increasing and “Persecution of Christians in Egypt is on the rise, with a substantial increase in numbers killed, physically harmed and churches/​houses attacked.”



In recent decades Sudan has been among the most tragic of nations, with more than a million or more people killed in long‐​running domestic conflict. Despite a reduction in fighting, Sudan still comes in at number sixteen on the World Watch List. “The main persecution engine in Sudan is Islamic extremism,” observes Open Doors: “persecution has increased rapidly over the past 12 months.” Moreover, “The number of formally reported killings is limited, but the whole Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile area has seen thousands killed, religion being one factor.”



Next at seventeen is the small Himalayan (and largely Buddhist) country of Bhutan. The new constitutional monarchy is democratizing, with some improvement in the status of Christians. Reports Open Doors: “The church in Bhutan is no longer an underground church, since Christians are allowed to meet in private homes regularly on Sundays without any interference by authorities; Christians in remote villages encounter more difficulties, though.” Moreover, the parliament is debating legislation to criminalize conversions.



At number eighteen is the Islamic and former communist republic of Turkmenistan, where, notes Open Doors, “the tight grip of the authorities on Christians continues.” This state’s repression appears to more reflect Turkmenistan’s communist than Muslim heritage. Alas, “All unregistered religious activity is strictly illegal” and “For native Turkmen communities, being registered is simply impossible, for the others it is difficult.”



Although Vietnam has moved away from doctrinaire communism, it is nineteen on the Open Doors World ranking. The organization explains that “Vietnamese authorities keep a close eye on all Christian activities in the country. Believers face more problems by officials, often being accused of causing ‘social disturbances’, ‘fighting the local government’ or simply ‘subversion.’ Church leaders are carefully monitored.”



Completing the top twenty is Chechnya, formally a republic within the Russian Federation. “The general religious climate in Chechnya has always been Islamic, and the influence of Islam is growing.” The government has discussed implementing sharia law and “Slowly but surely, the country is Islamizing.” Moreover, Muslim converts to Christianity “suffer greatly from government and family oppression.”



The terrible list goes on. Leading the next ten is China, a still nominally communist state where the situation remains mixed — better than during the Maoist era but still repressive. Then comes Qatar, one of the Muslim Gulf sheikdoms, which restricts Christian worship and conversion. Another repressive North African Islamic state, Algeria, follows, where, unfortunately, “oppression of Christians has been constant.” Next is the Islamic island of Comoros, which restricts expatriate worship and punishes Muslims who convert to Christianity.



Azerbaijan is both Islamic and former communist, which leads to persecution of Christians, in this case police raids, imprisonment, and more. In “liberated” but Muslim Libya the situation of Christians has not improved from the Gaddafi era. Islamic Oman restricts Christian worship by expatriates and pressures Christian converts. Islamic Brunei tightly regulates Christians and plans to introduce Islamic criminal law. The situation for Christians has improved somewhat in Morocco, another Muslim North African state, where “the main source of persecution is Muslim fundamentalist influence on the authorities and in society.” Kuwait always has been a fairly liberal Islamic state, but pressure on Christians remain; “the main persecution engines are family and Muslims extremists, and to a lesser extent authorities.”



The next group of ten is: Islamic but nominally secular Turkey, where “various forms of persecution of Christians” nevertheless occur; Hindu India, where “The main persecutors are mobs organized by extremist Hindu organizations”; Buddhist Burma, where the army long has victimized largely Christian ethnic minorities such as the Karen and Kachin; Muslim and former communist Tajikistan, which recently implemented new restrictive church registration laws; Islamic Tunisia, where pressure on Christians has increased since the “Jasmine Revolution”; Muslim but secular Syria, where support of Christians for “the Alawite regime in the past has made them vulnerable to attacks from the opposition”; the Islamic United Arab Emirates, a relatively liberal Gulf sheikdom which nevertheless restricts Christian practices; religiously mixed Ethiopia, where persecution has come from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as well as Islamic extremists; Muslim Djibouti, where family law discriminates against Christians; and Jordan, where Christian proselytism is forbidden and Islamic converts to Christianity continue to suffer.



Bringing up the rear are communist Cuba, former communist and still repressive Belarus, Muslim Indonesia, the Islamic Palestinian Territories, former communist and Islamic Kazakhstan, Muslim Bahrain, democratic and Catholic Colombia (where organized crime targets Christian social reformers), former communist and Islamic Kyrgyzstan, Muslim Bangladesh, and Muslim Indonesia. Christians suffer from a variety of repressions, debilities, pressures, and discriminations in these nations.



Persecution of any religious believer is a moral outrage, a violation of individual conscience and assault on human dignity. But the principle source of religious persecution today is unambiguous: Islam. As Open Doors emphasizes, 38 of 50 persecutors are Muslim. Nine of the top ten and the three largest risers (Northern Nigeria, Egypt, and Sudan) are Muslim. Islamic extremism is the “usual suspect” among persecutors around the world.



The U.S. government should include religious liberty in its dialogue over human rights with other countries. Moreover, as individuals and in community with one another Americans — not just Christians or people of faith, but anyone who believes in human life, dignity, and freedom — should target persecutors and support the persecuted. If nothing else, those persecuted for their faith should not stand alone.

"Faiz Khalil was a colonel in the Iraqi Army whose work with the United States military may have provoked the killing of his    daughter. Mohamed Sharif was a student in Mogadishu, Somalia, an urban war zone terrorized by rival militias. Both arrived in the United States as refugees, through a yearslong process that involved hours of interviews and over a dozen background checks. In late January, President Trump signed an executive order to suspend that program, after months of claiming that the vetting process needed  . The State Department notes that refugees are the most rigorously examined travelers. As the program’s future hangs in limbo  —   last weekend refugees began coming in again,  after a legal challenge to the order  —   we trace the existing steps. Mr. Khalil, 54, now resides in Twin Falls, Idaho, as an American citizen, while Mr. Sharif, 26, lives in Aurora, Colo. as a legal permanent resident. The United Nations gathers the names of people who have fled persecution. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was in a daze when he arrived in Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad in July 2006  —   he had been unable to think clearly ever since his daughter Maha had not returned from school one day. Mr. Khalil had tried to keep his work with the United States military a secret, knowing it could make his family a target. But the day after Maha disappeared in 2004, he received a call from someone claiming to be from Al Qaeda. The man said that Mr. Khalil had been found out and would have to pay with Maha’s life. After learning that Maha was, indeed, dead, the family tried to stay in Baghdad. But they felt that the other children could be in danger, so, in 2006, Mr. Khalil left Iraq with his wife, Nahida Mohammad, their    son, Mamoon Jumah, and    daughter, Maryam Jumah. As unauthorized immigrants, they could not work and had to send the children to private school. Knowing that their savings would not last, Mr. Khalil registered them as refugees. ____ Mohamed Sharif At age 16, Mr. Sharif arrived alone at Kakuma, a desert camp for refugees in northwest Kenya, in 2007. Somalia had gone through more than a dozen attempts to form a government in his lifetime, and it was dangerous for him to return. Mr. Sharif moved into a   hut in the camp, where the temperature often topped 100 degrees, and registered as a refugee. There, he met Bisharo, a single mother from Somalia with two children, Adnan and Hodan. He picked up work as an electrician. They married, but there was no big wedding. “We didn’t have enough money,” he said. An officer hired by the United Nations asks questions about the applicant’s life. Then two officials review the case to determine if the person faces serious persecution back home. If concerns arise, the person is interviewed again or the case is closed. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil and his family arrived with their birth certificates, proof of Iraqi citizenship and marriage certificate, at a building in Amman. Armed guards were posted outside. Over seven hours, they were photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed. There were tears, yelling, frustration as other Iraqis were denied refugee status. When an official asked Mr. Khalil through an Arabic interpreter about Maha, he broke down in tears. “I could not control myself,” he said. As they waited for word, the family began to unravel. No one could sleep through the night. The parents walked their children to and from school each day, fearing something could happen. Then the call came. Mr. Khalil was to return with more documents, including Maha’s death certificate. ____ Mohamed Sharif It was a big day. By 2012, Mr. Sharif had waited years at Kakuma before an official arrived for an interview. Mr. Sharif wore a football    —   he had no dress clothes, and the camp was sweltering. Why did he leave, he was asked. Mr. Sharif described in Somali the way he had fled his home, fearing death. “I don’t have a home to go back to,” he later recalled having said. Months later, Bisharo gave birth to a girl, Nimo. But then Bisharo died. At 22, Mr. Sharif was the single father of three children. American contractors conduct   interviews to prepare for a visit from Homeland Security. Background checks begin. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was asked about his time in the Iraqi Army. Why did he enlist? Because of the promise of a stable life. Why did he become an officer? There were benefits: a new car and some land. He described teaching American soldiers about the Iraqi chain of command, and telling them to request receipts with serial numbers for deliveries of items like batteries or tires. Otherwise, he said, some could end up for sale on the Iraqi black market. Mr. Khalil answered his interrogators “like a robot,” he said. “I lost my daughter, I lost my house  —   everything,” he said. During this time, Mr. Khalil and his family watched nervously as their bank accounts dwindled. They had to pay $3 a day per person to the Jordanian government to live there without authorization. They could not afford enough diesel fuel to heat their apartment through the winter, so the parents took turns waking up in the middle of the night to turn on the heater an hour at a time. ____ Mohamed Sharif This round, in 2013, took three days. In the first interview, Mr. Sharif and his interviewer cried as he spoke. In the second and third, he had to repeat his story. They asked about his birthplace, his parents, their marriage, his schooling, his journey to the camp, his religion. Had extremists tried to recruit him? Would he do anything against the law? “The answer is no,” he said later. “The reason we are here is to get a better life. ” The interviewers requested documents. “I didn’t have any,” he said. “Most of our people,” he said, “they didn’t go to school, they weren’t born in the hospital. ” That year, Mr. Sharif met Ubah Isse Mohamed, a camp neighbor, and they married. “She was loving,” he said. “The right person for my kids. ” Officers visit the camp to verify stories and take fingerprints. Some nations skip this step and rely on United Nations interviews during the process. Faiz Khalil Winter receded and the family was called back for a   appointment. Ms. Mohammad and the children were interviewed together he was questioned alone. American immigration officials asked hundreds of questions  —   many of them repeats from before  —   but they wanted even more detail. The family was fingerprinted again and their retinas were scanned. ____ Mohamed Sharif In the summer of 2014, American officials went to Kakuma. Mr. Sharif had to tell his story again. Then came several    questions. Had he ever been recruited by terrorist agencies? By radical groups? No, he said. No. Then he waited. A medical exam is conducted to identify needs and ensure that people with a contagious disease do not enter the United States until they have been cleared. Faiz Khalil By the summer of 2007, the Khalil children had begun to speak Arabic with a Jordanian accent. The family was sent to a clinic for three days of health evaluations that included   blood work and immunizations. Mr. Khalil and his children received   stress disorder diagnoses. In early 2008, Mr. Khalil got a call. “Congratulations,” he recalled an official saying. “You’re moving to Twin Falls, Idaho. ” Mr. Khalil had never heard of it. “I said, ‘This is in the U. S.?’” He did a quick search online: “It really scared me more, because I said, ‘I am going to nowhere. ’” They were scheduled to leave in September. As the day drew nearer, Mr. Khalil felt conflicted. Maybe they would fail, he thought. He had heard that life in America was difficult. ____ Mohamed Sharif Later that year, he got a letter. The United States wanted to welcome him. His family, which was further behind in the process, would have to stay behind. Then came a   medical checkup at Kakuma. In early December, he left for a local airport and flew to Nairobi. On Dec. 10, at midnight, he left Kenya for good. Nine nonprofit organizations help refugees resettle. They decide where these new immigrants will live, often opting for more affordable midsize cities. Faiz Khalil On the morning they were set to leave, Mr. Khalil woke up in tears, and he struggled to compose himself. At one point, overcome by fear, he asked their taxi driver to turn around. “Don’t listen to him!” Ms. Mohammad shouted. At the airport, something changed. “I had to be strong to support the family,” Mr. Khalil explained later. They traveled for 36 hours on four planes: first to Frankfurt, then Chicago, Salt Lake City and, finally, Twin Falls. It was close to midnight when they arrived. The children were exhausted. “It was just dark, nobody in the streets, so I was kind of like, ‘Where we are? ’” he said. ____ Mohamed Sharif He touched down at the Denver airport on Dec. 12, in the early evening. A man from Lutheran Family Services took him to a new apartment. The following night, Mr. Sharif walked outside to take in his first snowflakes. “I looked up at the skies, and got it in my eyes,” he recalled. “It was really just something amazing for me. ” “Some refugees who were in my neighborhood have been in the camp from 1991 until now,” he said. “For me, I can say this: I was the luckiest guy ever. Ever. ” Refugees can receive federal cash assistance for up to eight months. They can tap into federally funded language instruction courses, employment services and social adjustment programs for up to five years. They are required to apply for permanent residence after their first year. Faiz Khalil In the morning light, Twin Falls did not appear as foreboding. The children learned English quickly, while Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad practiced by watching “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Titanic. ” Both work as interpreters for a refugee resettlement center, and Mr. Khalil still advises United States military troops on working in Iraq. Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad are registered independents and voted for Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump’s executive order on refugees was unfair, Mr. Khalil said  —   other Iraqis would suffer after working to help the American military. Maryam is now 14, but acts as if she were much older, her father said. Mamoon, 19, is “very American,” Mr. Khalil said  —   sometimes speaking to his parents with a “sharpness” to which they are unaccustomed. When Mr. Khalil thinks of Maha, he likes to look at old family photos. His children rarely bring her up in front of him. But when they do not know he is listening, he occasionally overhears them talking about her. “They have a good life, better than I had,” Mr. Khalil said. ____ Mohamed Sharif He is on the road constantly, working long hours as a truck driver to save for his family’s arrival. They live in Nairobi, but cannot go to school because they do not have Kenyan documents. Without them, he said, “I am alone. ” Mr. Sharif hoped to see them by Feb. 16, Nimo’s fourth birthday. His    in Indianapolis has already bought them toys. But a week into his presidency, Mr. Trump threw the future of Mr. Sharif’s family into uncertainty when he signed the refugee order. “My kids keep asking, ‘Daddy when are we coming? ’” Mr. Sharif has not told them yet. “They cannot know,” he said. “I don’t want to make them hopeless. ”"
"LONDON  —   In November 1967, four years after her husband’s assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy traveled to the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia on a   trip with David Ormsby Gore, a friend of her husband and himself a recent widower. There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down. In a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead. “If ever I can find some healing and some comfort  —   it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain,” she wrote. “I can find that now  —   if the world will let us. ” The letter was part of a set of papers found in locked   cases discovered only last month in Wales at the family home of Mr. Ormsby Gore, who died in 1985. They are being auctioned in London next month by his grandson to help restore the house. The letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time. Among them is the letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore, also known as Lord Harlech, dated Nov. 13, 1968, a month after her marriage to Mr. Onassis and five months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. In it, Mrs. Kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for Mr. Ormsby Gore, whose wife had died in a car crash in May 1967. “We have known so much  shared  lost so much together  —   Even if it isn’t the way you wish now  —   I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. ” Writing from Mr. Onassis’ yacht in Greece, on stationery with the ship’s crest, a clear if cold message, Mrs. Kennedy told Mr. Ormsby Gore: “You are like my beloved beloved brother  —   and mentor  —   and the only original spirit I know  —   as you were to Jack. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of Mr. Onassis, and she tried to respond. “Please know  —   you of all people must know it  —   that we can never really see into the heart of another,” she wrote. “You know me. And you must know that the man you write of in your letter is not a man that I could marry. ” Mr. Onassis, she wrote, is “lonely and wants to protect me from being lonely. And he is wise and kind. Only I can decide if he can, and I decided. “I know it comes as a surprise to so many people,” she continued. “But they see things for me that I never wanted for myself. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore was an old friend of John F. Kennedy, whose younger sister Kathleen, or Kick, married Mr. Ormsby Gore’s first cousin. After the election of the young president in 1960, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan sent Mr. Ormsby Gore to Washington as Britain’s ambassador. The two men, a year apart in age, were extremely close, and President Kennedy consulted with him on every key issue of foreign policy, especially during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and in discussions of Vietnam and nuclear disarmament. Robert Kennedy said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was “almost a part of the government,” adding that the president “would rather have his judgment than that of anybody else. ” Among the letters is one in which President Kennedy praised the ambassador: “I appreciate as you know, in all these critical matters your judgment  —   which I have found to be uniformly good and true. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore inherited the noble title, Lord Harlech, when his father died in 1964. His grandson Jasset, who inherited the title a year ago, is the one selling the papers, along with other possessions, at Bonhams, London, in an auction scheduled for March 29. Some of the letters will be on view on March 2 in New York at the Bonhams showroom, at 580 Madison Avenue. In total, there are 18 handwritten letters and one typed letter from Mrs. Kennedy to Mr. Ormsby Gore, as well as other papers. Those include a pass admitting him to the White House on Nov. 23, 1963, one day after the assassination a jocular 1963 letter from Robert Kennedy, signed “Bobby” and instructions for pallbearers for Robert Kennedy’s funeral. The papers also include a letter Mrs. Kennedy wrote to Mr. Ormsby Gore after the death of his wife, Sylvia, known as Sissie, which seemed to foreshadow his desire to marry her. “Your last letter was such a cri de coeur of loneliness  —   I would do anything to take that anguish from you,” she wrote. “You want to patch the wounds  match the loose pairs  —   but you can’t because your life won’t turn out that way. ” One of the most moving documents is a draft letter Mr. Ormsby Gore wrote to Mrs. Kennedy after she turned down his proposal. “All the pathetic plans I had brought with me for visits to Cyrenaica, holidays near one another and a whole variety of solutions to our marriage problem, including one for a secret marriage this summer  —   plans which I saw us eagerly discussing, calmly and with complete frankness as we did at the Cape and in Cambodia for the next wonderful ten days  —   all had become irrelevant trash to be thrown away within a few hours of my landing in New York,” he wrote. “As for your photograph I weep when I look at it. Why do such agonizing things have to happen? Where was the need for it?” The Kennedys and the Ormsby Gores socialized frequently, even stirring resentment among other diplomats and members of the administration. There were small dinners at the White House and shared vacations. One   “incoherent letter as written on Martini” from Mrs. Kennedy, in the spring of 1962, discusses their coming vacation at the America’s Cup races. Others mention her love of dance. Matthew Haley, the head of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams, said that “you just don’t get this quantity of insight into Jackie’s personal life and that level of intimacy. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore was her husband’s great friend, but “the fact that they developed such an intimate friendship in such a short space of time is important,” he said, even if built on shared sadness. Contacted about the letters on Friday, a representative of the Kennedy family said that they had decided not to comment. Barbara Leaming, who has written biographies of President and Mrs. Kennedy, said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was “the pivotal relationship Jack had in the presidency,” a man he trusted almost as much as Robert Kennedy. “Jackie loved in Jack the man he wanted to be, and David was the man helping him, in her eyes, to be the man Jack wanted to be,” she said. The distress that followed Robert Kennedy’s assassination in June 1968 was one reason she turned to the security of Mr. Onassis, Ms. Leaming said. “It was the second great trauma for her,” Ms. Leaming said. “She was very clear it was not a marriage of love, as she said to Joe Alsop in a letter. She was seeking safety. ” As for Mr. Ormsby Gore, “of course he fell in love with her  —   she understood him so well,” Ms. Leaming said. “But I have no idea if it was consummated or not. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore did marry again, in December 1969, to Pamela Colin, an American who bore more than a passing resemblance to Mrs. Onassis. He died in 1985, at 66, after a car crash. Mrs. Onassis attended his funeral."
"In its new special report on climate change and land, the IPCC calls for more effective and sustainable land management, and more sustainable food consumption. But who is the onus on to go vegetarian, or look after land better? You, me, the “global elite”? The world’s poorest people, or perhaps the many millions of newly-wealthy Chinese or Indians? Or maybe our governments? The answer depends on how you interpret the report, which can be read in two ways. On one hand, it is a moral call for individual consumers and food suppliers to become more sustainable. On the other, it is a call for governments to promote sustainable food consumption and production choices.  This is not an either/or situation – the report should be read in both ways but with recommendations for different population groups. To wit, whether someone is individually responsible for taking on board the IPCC’s recommendations depends on the extent to which they are subject to one or more of three forms of inequality. First and foremost, massive global wealth inequality affects the extent to which individuals and communities are able (or, rather, should be expected) to implement the recommendations of the IPCC report. It’s a lot easier to go vegetarian when you have the money to eat what you like. In the Global South, many have not benefited from industrialisation, while remaining in even more need of implementing measures to counter climate risks. Even in the more affluent countries of the Global North, many people live in abject poverty and have to make tough choices as how to spend their limited resources. This highlights the need to make sustainable food accessible and not just available. The authors of the IPCC report acknowledge as much, emphasising how rising costs may lead to undernourishment as people turn to cheaper replacements, such as fast food. This is why sustainable food must be promoted alongside poverty alleviation. In the Global South, green growth must be priority as long as it includes local stakeholders, who are often experts on sustainable land management. Carbon footprint is highly correlated with inequality. As a 2015-report by Oxfam showed, the top 10% of income-earners, mainly living in affluent countries, are responsible for almost half of global greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom half are only responsible for 10%. Even within affluent countries, there is a big divide between rich and poor. In other words global warming is not driven equally by everyone, but rather is highly correlated with income.  Of course, this does not mean that we should encourage unsustainable living in less developed countries. Rather, we should recognise that the consumption and production patterns of the world’s worst-off are not necessarily unsustainable. Although the world’s high and upper-middle income countries are home to about half the population, they are responsible for 86% of emissions. In comparison, Africa is home to 16% of the world’s population, yet only emits 4% of the global total. Meanwhile the very poorest countries – 9% of the global population, or 700 million people – emit just 0.5%. (Tellingly, the average per capita emissions of North Americans is more than 17 times that of the average African.)  Consequently, it would be possible to add several billion people in low-income countries, where population growth is already the highest, without massively changing global emissions, while adding just one billion individuals in high-income countries would increase global emissions by one-third. As the income of less-affluent populations grows, however, it does become necessary to encourage more sustainable practices.  But less-affluent people in the Global North aren’t entirely off the hook. While inequality of income and carbon footprint does mean they are absolved of some responsibility to act more sustainably, this group still benefits from better infrastructure and more equitable institutions which should shelter them from the worst impacts of climate change. Conversely, inhabitants of low and middle-income countries, especially those in fragile environments like rainforests, mountains or coastal regions, are particularly vulnerable.  So while taking action to mitigate climate change is necessary, we cannot lose sight of the fact that many communities require financial and institutional support to adapt to existing changes to their local environment as well as to build resilience to near-certain climate risks in the future. While most people in the Western world are still only beginning to see and feel the effects of climate change, they must continue to commit resources to those most vulnerable and worse-off communities, who are often invisible to them. In sum, whether someone can be held individually responsible for taking on board the IPCC’s recommendations crucially depends on whether they are able to do so without risking their life, livelihood, or well-being. Because inequalities in income, emissions, and vulnerability to climate change are still widespread, the report must first and foremost be read as a call for governments to make sustainable consumption and production options accessible. Addressing climate change and food security must go hand in hand with addressing global and local socioeconomic inequalities. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"Many of the world’s winter athletes, now preparing for the season’s championship events, are frustrated with the response of sports officials to the Russian doping scandal and are wondering why implicated Russian Olympians still turn up at the starting line. Hundreds of athletes from dozens of nations have signed petitions, threatened to boycott major events and called for sports authorities to act on evidence that the urine samples of dozens of Russian athletes were tampered with to conceal widespread doping at the last Winter Olympics, in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. Russian athletes implicated in the Sochi cheating have continued to compete, and none have been disqualified by the International Olympic Committee, as officials continue further inquiries of their own. “We will not sacrifice a full and thorough investigation that will be legally scrutinized simply to speed up the process,” Mark Adams, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said Tuesday. Revelations of Russia’s doping schemes have compelled Olympic officials to expand their retesting of summer Olympians  —   which have so far resulted in sanctions against dozens of athletes  —   but their scrutiny has not affected many winter athletes so far. The Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations cited four major competitions that had been moved out of Russia for the   season after an outcry from athletes, including the   skiing World Cup finals and the bobsled and skeleton world championships. Accused Russian athletes have continued to participate in those competitions, the winter sports organization said, because of “the presumption of innocence, the right to be heard and due process. ” Responding to a petition signed by more than 150 athletes, global officials for biathlon will meet in Austria on Wednesday, ahead of that sport’s world championships, to discuss the doping scandal and broader disciplinary policy. Prominent athletes, including the French biathlon champion Martin Fourcade, a winner of two gold medals at Sochi, had threatened to skip the competition unless officials addressed their concerns. The athletes have called for stricter penalties for drug violations  —   including longer bans of up to eight years and higher fines of up to 1 million euros  —   while also asking that officials, in scrutinizing the accused Russian athletes, balance thoroughness with speed in order to preserve the integrity of this year’s competitions. “Given the unprecedented and urgent nature of the current situation,” the athletes wrote, “we do not have time to wait” until 2018, when biathlon’s full leadership is next due to convene formally. The biathlon officials are also expected to vote this week on moving the 2021 world championships out of Russia. The competition was assigned to the nation in the fall, after the International Olympic Committee had expressly directed sports officials not to award new events to Russia in light of the doping scandal. Should the biathlon officials decline to move the event, the World   Agency could impose a penalty, possibly threatening the sport’s place at the 2018 Winter Olympics, in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Russia’s national team itself could face disciplinary action ahead of the 2018 Games, something some antidoping officials have called a parallel punishment for systemic cheating at the last Winter Olympics. As Olympic officials review the evidence delivered late last year by the World   Agency and an independent investigator, the Canadian lawyer Richard H. McLaren, they are considering not just the individual cases across sports but what collective punishment may be warranted in light of the Russian government’s involvement. Much of Mr. McLaren’s evidence was made public on a website, with individual names redacted. The identities of the implicated athletes were shared privately with sports officials, although some sports organizations have called the evidence insufficient. “In some cases, provisional suspensions have had to be lifted and procedures dropped due to a lack of evidence currently provided by WADA to issue sanctions able to stand up to legal challenge,” the winter sports organization said in a statement. WADA, the antidoping regulator, is scheduled to meet with the winter sports organizations this month to discuss the evidence. Meanwhile, athletes are considering the implications of sanctions. Katie Uhlaender, an American skeleton racer who placed fourth in Sochi, has wondered for months if she will inherit an Olympic medal, after learning that the Russian athlete who placed third in that competition, Elena Nikitina, was among those whose urine sample was manipulated. Uhlaender has faced Nikitina in competition several times in the last month alone, after bobsled and skeleton officials lifted a provisional suspension on implicated Russian athletes. Investigations into those cases are continuing, those officials said. “The I. O. C. needs to step up,” Uhlaender said. “The McLaren report seems very clear: There was tampering. All I’m asking for is an even playing field. If you let someone get away with something, why wouldn’t they just continue doing it? Why wouldn’t others do it?” Few Olympic sports have taken such strong action on the issue as track and field, which voted unanimously Monday to keep the ban on Russia in place until the nation demonstrated change and fulfilled specific conditions."
"Vital international climate talks due to be hosted by the UK are expected to be delayed until late next year because of the coronavirus crisis, it has emerged, dashing hopes they could be reconvened sooner. The UN talks, known as Cop26, were to be held in Glasgow this November, but in early April they were postponed as governments around the world grappled with lockdown. At that time governments thought the summit could be reconvened within the first three months of 2021.  However, at a follow-up UN meeting on 28 May the UK will try to persuade other countries and the UN that a much longer delay is necessary and talks should be moved to the first half of November 2021, the Guardian has learned. That leaves a hiatus of a whole year, although interim meetings might be staged to try to regain some momentum for the crunch negotiations. Governments are supposed to prepare detailed plans before Cop26 on how to cut their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement, which most have so far failed to do. Current pledges on emissions cuts, made in 2015, would take the world to an estimated 3C of heating above pre-industrial levels, far beyond the 2C limit set in the landmark Paris accord. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading body on climate science, has warned that the world must change course drastically by 2030, making this year’s deadline for revised national plans even more urgent. Experts told the Guardian they were concerned that a long gap before Cop26 would make it harder to gain the momentum needed to force reluctant countries to come up with new national plans on emissions cuts. A short delay to next spring was seen as a boon by some, as the US presidential election takes place this November. A spring conference would either have welcomed a new administration, or have given time for other countries to react to the reelection of Donald Trump, who is withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement. But the UK government is understood to believe that travel restrictions would impede any large-scale conference earlier in the year. With 196 nations expected to take part in Cop26, even if lockdowns were eased in many countries it is likely restrictions would still be in place in some parts of the world well into next year. Holding a virtual conference has been considered, but many civil society groups are wary, as they say activists in and around the talks play a vital role in pressing ministers to go further. Another concern is that separate UN environmental talks, on biodiversity, are being rescheduled to the first half of next year, and it is thought better to retain the original sequence, with the biodiversity conference preceding the Cop26 climate talks. Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen sharply as a result of lockdowns, with a 17% drop in daily emissions levels recorded by early April, according to recent research. Many experts are calling for a “green recovery” from the Covid-19 crisis, with an Oxford study showing that backing green projects would create jobs and provide a greater return on investment than pouring public money into business as usual. If Cop26 is delayed by a full year, those recovery plans – green or not – will be well under way before global governments are next required to account publicly for their stewardship of the climate. Commenting on the recovery plans, Chris Venables, the head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The really important thing now is to make sure the recovery from the coronavirus crisis is linked to climate change ambition and Cop26. It has to be a green recovery.”"
"Support among American high school students for the First Amendment is stronger today than it has been in the last 12 years, according to the latest in a series of large nationwide surveys of the nation’s rising voters. Some 91 percent of high school students say they believe that individuals should be allowed to express unpopular opinions, according to a Knight Foundation survey of nearly 12, 000 students conducted last year. The survey is the sixth in a series, the first of which was carried out in 2004, when 83 percent supported such rights. “What we’ve seen since 2004 is a slow but steady increase in support,” said Kenneth Dautrich, the study’s lead author and the president of the Stats Group, a statistical and data services firm. Here’s a look at some of the top findings. High school students may broadly back the First Amendment, but not without limits: Their support is tempered depending on the kind of speech and where it’s delivered. “While support for the First Amendment as a general concept has never been higher, the devil’s in the details,” said Jonathan Sotsky, director of strategy and assessment for the Knight Foundation.   percent of the students may support the right to express unpopular opinions in general, but only half as many  —   45 percent  —   support that right when the speech in question is offensive to others and made in public. Bullying speech enjoys slightly less backing, and students are even less supportive of either kind of speech when it’s delivered on social media. Many students find little sacred in professional reporting: More than half put as much or more trust in photos, videos and accounts shared by individuals online than in traditional news sources. The 726 teachers surveyed, however, were far more skeptical of the online postings. Students may have faith in firsthand accounts shared online, but they are still generally wary of the news they see there.   percent said they had “some” or “a lot” of trust in the information found in newspapers, compared with 77 percent for television news and 70 percent for news websites. Just 49 percent reported similar levels of trust in news shared on social media. The survey results suggest that high school students and adults differ greatly in how they consume news. Students are almost twice as likely as adults to “often” use mobile devices for news and nearly three times as likely to report “often” getting news from social media. Adults are much more likely to report “often” getting news from local TV and newspapers. Students are far less concerned about their privacy on the internet than adults, according to the survey. But that is changing: In 2016, 76 percent were somewhat or very concerned about privacy online, compared with 70 percent two years earlier."

Too many Taminos in Maine?
New Study Finds RPS Standards Hurting Maine’s EconomyGovernor LePage advocates for reforms in Maine’s energy lawsAUGUSTA – Today, Governor Paul LePage released the following statement in regards to the study, The Economic Impact of Maine’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, conducted by the Maine Heritage Policy Center and the Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research:“By 2017, this study predicts energy prices will increase by $145 million for consumers, costing the State of Maine about 1,000 jobs. We already pay a statewide total of approximately $220 million more per year for electricity than the national average. This study shows that special interests are hurting Maine’s economy and costing us jobs. We can no longer embrace the status quo. 

“Unfortunately, low cost, reliable, and green renewables, such as hydro power, are discriminated against in Augusta. Instead, those with powerful political connections have forced higher cost renewables onto the backs of Maine ratepayers. Common sense dictates that cost must be a factor when evaluating all new energy sources.
“Reforming our laws to optimize our renewable energy production will put more money in the pockets of Mainers, bring more jobs to our state, and improve our quality of life. I encourage the people of Maine to tell their legislators that we need to lower the cost of energy.”
Background:On September 26, 2012, the Maine Heritage Policy Center and Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research released a study which found that Maine’s current Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) Law, which mandates the minimum and maximum amount of energy consumers must purchase from various sources, will raise the cost of electricity in Maine by 8% in 2017. This 8% increase amounts to approximately $145 million in statewide consumption costs, and would cost Maine approximately 995 jobs, $85 million in real disposable income, decrease investment in the state by $11 million, and increase the average household electricity bill by $80 per year.

 **Press Statement:** Robin Grieve   
Chairman of Pastural farming Climate Research  
www.farmcarbon.co.nz



 ****“NZ must lead the way in pushing for change in the way methane emissions are regarded in the Paris climate accord at the UN Climate Action Summit this week.”Robin Grieve Chairman of Pastural farming Climate Research said today



“Globally there is a push for the politicians to listen to the science, and the science of methane has been ignored by politicians who decades ago adopted a carbon accounting system using the carbon dioxide equivalent model which scientists say failed to take in to account the cyclical nature of the methane emissions.



“NZ is one country with an emissions profile that has significant methane emissions compared to our CO2 emissions and which has the standing to influence change in international agreements to reflect the fact that not all carbon emissions are the same and it is not the equivalence unit it was intended to be and is portrayed to be in the Paris agreement. Carbon emissions are not a useful measure of anything for this reason.



“PM Ardern is likely to be wanting to show we are leading the way by pointing to her proposed carbon zero bill where some carbon emissions will reduce to zero but carbon emissions sourced from methane will only be required to reduce.



“Reducing emissions of methane however is not only unnecessary, it is undesirable because **it will only come at the expense of food production** , and given the growing population’s need for food there is no morality in that.



“Simply by pursuing policies that abdicate any responsibility to meet the world’s growing food demand, show we have learnt nothing from the inhumanity of the push for biofuel by politicians just a few years ago. Ardern’s methane reduction policies will also increase global emissions because the demand for food will have to be met by less efficient international producers.



“Farmers in NZ have to date been able to increase food output while maintaining methane emissions at a stable rate. That is the best outcome and has been **achieved with no regulatory impost.**



“It is also all that is needed, with the Ministry for Environment confirming, in its zero carbon consultation discussion document, that stabilizing methane emissions is all that is required to ensure they do not contribute to any further increase in global temperatures.



“NZ through its delegation must push for science to be respected and the methane mistake of the 1990’s, where politicians adopted the farcical carbon equivalence system, be fixed. This can be done with the Paris agreement recognizing that not all carbon emissions require the same reductions as others and more importantly that countries’ reduction targets must not be achieved by reducing the wrong carbon emissions and also **not by simply passing the buck to other countries, as NZ intends to do.**



“Jacinda Ardern called climate change her generation’s nuclear free moment and her policy response so far is similar in that it relies on other countries to take responsibility. In our nuclear free moment it was for the problem of maintaining peace, this time it is for the problem of feeding the world.



“NZ farmers’ record of increasing production whilst stabilizing methane emissions puts NZ in a great place to show the world what can be done, and our Prime Minister should send the message to the world that it is in the best interests of humanity and the planet that the Paris agreement changes its approach to methane and encourages national reduction targets that encourage what NZ farmers are already doing in NZ.”

Victorian premier, socialist left faction leader Daniel Andrews, seems determined to turn that state into Australia’s very own little Venezuela. Whether it’s promulgating the creepy Marxist nonsense of “Safe Schools” (the template for New Zealand’s “Mates and Dates”), greedily trousering billions from the Chinese communist regime, or fiddling in denial while African gangs run rampant in Melbourne suburbs, if there’s a useless watermelon cause going, all Red Dan wants to know is, “Where do we sign?”



Between its rampaging gangs and tottering infrastructure, Victoria is just a blackout away from turning into a _Mad Max_ dystopia. Fittingly enough, the original classic _Mad Max_ was filmed all around my home town, in Victoria.



The Victorian government has ruled out new dams, saying climate change means not enough water would flow into them to make them worthwhile.



 **“Even the rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and our river systems”** – former Climate Commissioner Tim Flannery in 2004.



 **“South East Queensland Water revealed the [Wivenhoe] dam was holding what was classed as ‘190 per cent’”** – _The Australian_ , 2011.



 **“Warragamba Dam full, set to overflow”** – News.com.au, 2016.



Water Minister Lisa Neville says water in the state’s rivers will halve by 2065, citing this forecast in her refusal to build even one dam, even though over that period the state’s population is expected to double.



Poor old Tim based his claim about dams, and similar claims that Perth would be “the 21st century’s first ghost metropolis”, on the same forecasts.



Lisa Neville, it should also be known, has also been Victoria’s Police Minister during the worst of its African gang crisis – a crisis the government has steadfastly denied even exists. She’s consistent in applying her competence and experience, I’ll give her that.



Rather, she said, Victoria would rely on its high electricity-consuming desalination plant, from which it has ordered $81m of water this year, costing average households what she said was “only” $10 […]



The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ central estimate for Victoria’s population in 2066 is 12 million.



In 2006, the then Labor state government rejected a dam for the Maribyrnong River, proposed by the Liberal Party and estimated to cost $80m. Ms Neville’s spokeswoman said it would have yielded about 25 gigalitres, whereas the desalinat­ion plant could provide up to 150GL independent of rainfall.



The Australian has calculated that, on this basis, the cost of the Maribyrnong Dam would have been $3.2m/GL of water yielded, whereas the cost of the desalination plant is $23m/GL.



Victoria’s desalination plant was rushed into construction during the last drought, costing $3.5 billion. By the time it was actually built, Victoria’s dams were back at over 80% capacity. Even sitting idle, the plant still costs Victorians nearly $2 million a day. Even when finally pressed into service in 2017, the plant failed to deliver its promised quota.



Still, the Water Minister places a standing order for water (whether it’s needed or not) on every April 1.

Well, we are all going to die; only that and taxes are certain on this planet.



However, the current tsunami of climate gloom, led by St Greta of Thunberg, the Extinction Rebellion crowd and school strikes for climate are having an actual and real harmful effect on children.



When you need to have experts warning parents against “terrifying” their youngsters with talk of climate catastrophe, the wheels really have fallen off.



A group of psychologists working with the University of Bath says it is receiving a growing volume of enquiries from teachers, doctors and therapists unable to cope.



The Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA) told The Daily Telegraph **some children complaining of eco-anxiety have even been given psychiatric drugs.**



I guess the next conspiracy theory will be that the climate crisis is being pushed by Big Pharma.



The body is campaigning for anxiety specifically caused by fear for the future of the planet to be **recognised as a psychological phenomenon**.



However, they do not want it classed as a mental illness because, unlike standard anxiety, the cause of the worry is **“rational”**.



Well, that must make _The BFD_ readers – irrational.



“A lot of parents are coming into therapy asking for help with the children and it has escalated a lot this summer,” said Caroline Hickman, a teaching fellow at Bath and a CPA executive.



“The symptoms are the same [as clinical anxiety], the feelings are the same, but the cause is different.



“The fear is of environmental doom – that we’re all going to die.” […]



“Parents need to find some words to talk about it that is age-appropriate and not terrifying,” she said.



“You need to separate what is fact from what is unknown: tell them some species are going extinct and some humans are being harmed, but don’t say we’re all going to die, because that isn’t true.”



Which humans are being harmed? Which species are going extinct because of CO2?



“What you don’t want is that child to collapse in a well of depression saying “what’s the point in going to university”, or “what’s the point of doing my exams”, which I have heard children say.”



The CPA recommends a four-stage approach to explaining responsibly climate change to children without scaring them.



Eco-anxiety is steadily gaining recognition in the academic community. […]

"**A council has been criticised for charging small businesses Â£20 each to join its virtual Christmas fair.**
One local trader described it as a ""cynical"" attempt by Wokingham Borough Council to profit from small companies trying to survive the current climate.
Julie LeFevre said: ""It doesn't seem a lot but they are profiting from small traders who are struggling.""
Councillor Stuart Munro defended the fees which go towards administrative support for those who sign up.
This includes help creating social media posts and promotion on the council's social media accounts, he said.
Conservative Mr Munro added: ""The virtual fair was intended to spread a little bit of festive cheer after the planned in-person market and ice rink had to be cancelled [due to coronavirus restrictions].""
But Ms LeFevre, who makes and sells needle-sculpted figures, said she believed the council ""has a responsibility"" to help all local businesses and people who pay council tax.
""This just doesn't seem right,"" she said, adding: ""I cannot see a difference between the council's online market and other virtual fairs that are not charging people to take part. It's just another way for the council to make money.""
Opposition Lib Dem councillor Imogen Shepherd-DuBey said she thinks the fees are too high.
She added: ""You've got businesses that are trying to survive and the council is clearly making a profit out of this.
""We should really be doing more to support these people and I'm not convinced the charges are appropriate.""
Mr Munro, business lead for the local authority, said about 40 small businesses have signed up for the virtual market so far.
He added that the council has given Â£19m worth of business rate relief and Â£20m in business grants to local companies during the pandemic."
"**As part of our CEO Secrets series, which invites business leaders to share their advice, we are focusing on start-ups that have launched during lockdown, looking at different types of entrepreneur. This week, we hear from people whose jobs are under threat in hospitality, a sector hit particularly hard during the pandemic.**
The hospitality industry has been left reeling after two national lockdowns and, although England is just emerging from the second one, things aren't necessarily looking better. The introduction of new tiered restrictions has been described in some quarters as a ""mortal blow"" for an industry ""bearing the brunt of the pain"".
Bruce Tate, 39, was in a bad place after the first lockdown.
His business in Newcastle, called Need Music, which handled live bookings for pubs and weddings, was forced to close, and he wasn't entitled to financial support from the government because he drew his income as company dividends.
But while contemplating his future, sitting at a picnic table outside his office, he had a ""light bulb"" moment.
A cyclist whizzed past. This was normal. The office garden overlooks Route 72, also known as Hadrian's Cycle Way, one of the UK's most popular cycle routes.
He suddenly thought: what if he turned this area, which his business was renting anyway, into a cafe, capitalising on the passing trade on wheels?
A few physical adjustments were necessary to make the idea possible.
Bruce created some covered wooden seating areas, added a serving hatch to his office kitchen, and Route 72 Cafe opened in July.
As predicted, cyclists have provided regular custom, stopping off for simple refreshments like cheese toasties, beans on toast and pannini.
In time Bruce added to the menu homemade pies and pulled pork sandwiches, made by his wife.
One particularly profitable day saw a group of 100 riders drop by, en route from Newcastle to Wylam.
The new business was gaining momentum and his investments were beginning to pay off when the new tiered restrictions arrived in the autumn, followed by a second national lockdown in November.
With lockdown now over, Newcastle is in tier three which means the cafe can open for takeaways only and Bruce has chosen to open only at the weekends for now.
He remains an optimist despite the huge upheavals to his life and business.
""I will come out of this pandemic stronger than I went in,"" he says. ""Hopefully I will have two successful businesses, instead of one.""
His advice to other people in the hospitality industry is to try different things with your existing resources and skills, but to build your new business around the restrictions - however frustrating that can be.
The hospitality industry includes businesses such as restaurants, cafes, pubs, bars, nightclubs, entertainment venues and hotels.
These types of businesses have lost more than 600,000 jobs this year, according to UK Hospitality.
The trade body estimates that previously expected annual growth of 5% has turned into a 40% contraction in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic.
What jobs are available at the moment?
Jessica Bond-Gallagher trusted her husband's cooking enough to let him do the catering for their wedding with nearly 200 guests. Then again, he is a professional chef. That was back in August 2019. Little did she know her husband's skill in the kitchen would also get them through coronavirus.
The couple both have careers in hospitality. Jessica, 29, works as a hotel manager, and Chris, 30, as a chef.
In March this year they took the first steps towards a long-term dream, which was to open a restaurant together in Staffordshire, where Jessica grew up. She had landed a job managing a lounge bar there, while Chris had a job offer to be head chef at a gastropub in neighbouring Cheshire - this meant they could both move from their temporary home in Cambridge.
""When Boris [Johnson] announced people had to avoid pubs, clubs and bars we immediately knew our jobs were lost,"" says Jessica.
Furthermore, they weren't on the payroll for their new roles yet, so they didn't anticipate any government help. ""I remember just saying, 'We have to do something,'"" says Jessica.
What they did was set up Gallagher's Home Kitchen.
They cleared out their kitchen in their house to make it resemble a commercial one.
They wanted to deliver food to people stuck at home during lockdown and thought there would be extra demand because of fears of food shortages. At first Chris just focused on making simple tray bakes.
They reached out to their local network of friends before trying social media to find customers. Jessica managed the orders and personally delivered them in a ""military operation"".
Deliveroo and Uber Eats were an inspiration, explains Chris. ""They showed people would buy food this way. But they also didn't serve our rural area, so there was a gap in the market.""
The demand was clearly there, so they scaled up the operation by renting a kitchen in a rugby club. Chris created a menu offering a different main dish for each day of the week, focusing on familiar favourites like lasagne and lamb stockpot.
On their first day in March they took one order. By the end of summer they were delivering 40 to 50 meals a day. The profits were more than enough to pay their bills and the couple also gave out some free meals to the elderly and NHS workers.
In September they downsized their successful lockdown enterprise into a once-a-month supper club, and used the money they made to secure something approaching their original dream: a grab-and-go deli shop on the High Street of the market town of Leek, Staffordshire.
""We want to reinvigorate our local High Street,"" says Chris, ""there's a lot of good will for independent shops.""
""In a way Covid was a blessing,"" says Jessica, ""in that it pushed us forwards, otherwise we'd still be in our old jobs.""
In south-east London another entrepreneur is pursuing a food dream, though he is learning from scratch.
Every Tuesday Andrew Woodhouse gets up at 3.30am to drive to Billingsgate Market. He buys a consignment of fresh salmon and takes it home, where he fillets it and leaves it to cure in trays of salt. He's finished by 6am. Then he can begin his day job.
This is Andrew's ""new normal"". He is an out-of-office fishmonger, thanks to Covid-19.
Since university the 27-year-old had worked in the financial events industry, organising conferences around the world.
These came to an abrupt halt when coronavirus struck.
""I was furloughed over the summer, which I expected, but I didn't want to waste my time sitting around,"" he explains. So he decided to work on a business idea inspired by a childhood passion.
He used to go coarse fishing on the River Mole near his home in Hampton, southwest London, catching carp, tench and pike.
By his twenties, he was fly fishing, and went on salmon fishing holidays as far afield as Iceland and North America.
In lockdown he decided to turn his catch into his product, selling smoked salmon, which he would prepare himself.
He built his own salmon smoker in his garden after researching some instructions online, and converted his basement into a curing room. ""My flatmates weren't too keen on smelly fish lying around,"" Andrew admits.
He has registered his food business Andrew's Smokehouse with the council and found a steady stream of customers by posting on Instagram the and Nextdoor app. At his peak he was fulfilling around 100 orders a month.
It was hard work over the summer when he devoted himself full-time to the start-up, but the profits topped up his wages back to100% (from the 80% furlough rate).
Andrew is now back working full-time from home organising virtual conferences, but still running his salmon business.
His advice for other entrepreneurs who are juggling paid employment and start-ups is this: ""You might feel time is the only thing stopping you, but you can always make time depending on what scale you want your business to operate. Why not give it a go?""

James Shaw took advantage of the economic havoc wreaked upon Saudi Arabia to tweet about the evils of oil.



Oil is unreliable, erratic and volatile. We should not be relying on it for fuel.



This is one of the many reasons why it is critical that we diversify our transport options; so that they are clean, green, and not derailed by overseas conflict.



  
As we all know, the wind blows at a steady, usable, velocity at all times and is a reliable source of energy for wind turbines. Yeah/Nah.



And, the sun shines upon our solar panels uninterrupted by clouds (or nighttime) allowing a steady and reliable generation of electricity. Oops, no.



If we did not want our energy supplies to be disrupted by overseas conflict we could always exploit our own oil and gas reserves here in New Zealand. Oh, wait – Captain’s Call.



Oil has many sources around the world with no one supplier having a monopoly. Unlike the rare earths used in electric motors for EVs and in generators for wind turbines, which are largely controlled by China.



And mining cobalt and lithium etc is such a ‘clean’, ‘green’ enterprise, isn’t it James? After killing off all mineral exploitation in New Zealand, the Greens want us to increase the mining of minerals in other, less developed, countries. 



Let’s not mention the child exploitation that occurs to get the batteries produced for the EVs, shall we?



Fortunately, Trump has had a part to play in turning the US into an exporter rather than just a consumer of petrochemicals, otherwise the price shock for us could be worse.



And we haven’t even touched on the end-of-life issues for wind turbines, solar panels and EV batteries.



 **The Greens are unreliable, erratic and volatile. We should not be relying on them for Government.**

Roland Eichhorn of the Bavarian Office of Environment explains how the temperature of the mountain is being monitored. The fear is that global warming will lead to a thawing of the permafrost and lead to dire consequences in the form of crumbling rock and ground instability.
Eight years ago a small diameter, 45-meter long hole was bored through the rock summit to allow precise temperature measurement and future assessment The film reports that permafrost measurements are also being taken at other places, such as inside a tunnel – as shown in the clip. The Environment Office hopes that the recent warming has had little impact on the permafrost. The film tells us the result:
Indeed, there has been no change. “
Eichhorn says that the temperature at the measurement location has remained constant between -1.3°C and -1.9°C. Bavarian public television says:

With current, the TU Munich is measuring the extent of the permafrost here. The results are reassuring. The warmth from outside has not had an impact, at least that of last summer’s.”
But Eichhorn and Bavarian television warn against assuming the situation won’t change, saying permafrost warming could start very quickly and soon. Eichhorn adds that:
Warming is taking place much faster in the Alps than it is in the lowlands. We have here almost double the warming over the last decade. That means that the eternal ice could begin to melt.”
Eichhorn and the Environment Office should not be surprised that the permafrost refuses to warm up, let alone melt. Perhaps they are not looking at the available data properly, or are ignoring it and spreading falsehoods.
Indeed other data show that the Alps over the past 2 decades in general have been COOLING. Recall how German meteorologist Dominik Jung wrote last year that also four other high elevation stations in the Alps had been assessed: Zugspitze in Germany, Schmittenhöhe in Austria, Sonnblick in Austria and Säntis in Switzerland. Result:
They all yielded the same amazing result: Winters in the Alps over the last decades have become significantly colder, the data show.”
No wonder the permafrost in the Alps isn’t melting or even warming.

"The UK government must urgently set out clear plans on a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis if the delayed UN climate summit is to be a success, say leading experts. The climate talks known as Cop26 and scheduled to be held in Glasgow, are expected to be postponed by a year from their original date this November, dashing hopes that the summit would be swiftly reconvened. A formal decision on the delay will be taken by the UN Thursday evening.  Tying the Cop26 talks to a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis is now essential to regain momentum and ensure the summit produces the fresh global commitment needed on the climate crisis, experts say. Mary Robinson, former UN climate envoy, and chair of the Elders group of international leader, said: “Very definitely we need to tie together a green recovery and Cop26 – that is imperative. UK leadership can and should urge forward a net-zero carbon transition from the Covid-19 crisis. Leadership is needed, moral, political, economic and social leadership.” Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said: “The UK presidency comes at an absolutely critical time. There is an extraordinary opportunity to restart the economy and look at creative ways [to recover]. We need to find ways to become more resilient.” The Cop26 talks are seen as vital because nations are obliged under the Paris agreement of 2015 to present renewed plans every five years on how to meet the legally binding goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably no more than 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels. Current commitments on curbing emissions, set in Paris, would take the world far beyond those limits, to about 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster around the world. That means fresh national commitments on carbon reductions by 2030 must be set this year, ahead of the Cop26 talks. As host nation the UK carries responsibility for bringing governments together to make Cop26, the most important conference since Paris in 2015, a success. Without a clear plan of its own to reach net-zero carbon emissions, a target enshrined in British law, the UK will struggle for credibility in urging other countries to come forward with national plans, according to participants and close observers of the talks. Some countries would like to see the UK present a formal submission to the UN, setting out its emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050. Known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC), these formal plans are a legal requirement under the Paris accord. “It would be a very welcome and important signal [to set out an NDC],” said Steiner. “We need to see a high level of ambition and a national strategy.” Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, told a committee of MPs last week: “It definitely would set a good example to other countries. I believe the UK should do it as soon as it responsibly can.” Developing countries are also anxious that NDCs should not be delayed by the long hiatus before Cop26. Janine Felson, Belize’s ambassador to the UN and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “All developed countries should bring forward their NDCs.” Few large-scale economies have submitted an NDC yet. Chile, the original host of Cop25, in 2019 (before the transfer to Madrid), submitted its plan earlier this year, Norway has strengthened its NDC, and Rwanda last week became the first African nation to do so. Japan set out plans that drew widespread criticism for lack of ambition but China, India, the EU, and other large green house gas emitters are still holding back. Leading figures have said that the formal submission of NDCs can wait while ministers and officials consider the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. Yet the UK has to urgently show leadership by announcing concrete measures for a green economic recovery. Lord Stern, a climate economist, said: “It’s more important to set out actions for a green recovery, that is key. We can do that now, bring forward these carbon reductions. Set out policies and then we can see how the NDC can become more ambitious.” The Committee on Climate Change, the UK government’s independent advisers, has delayed until December the publication of its advice on the country’s sixth carbon budget, in order to take account of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee, said it would be better for the government to delay the NDC too. Setting out a formal NDC was less urgent than setting out a clear direction for the economic recovery, added Robinson. “I was very close to despair in January,” she said, referring to a flawed start to the UK’s presidency, when the government fired its initial choice for Cop president, the former MP Claire O’Neill, and failed to produce a clear plan for the summit. “I could not see an ambition [to have a good Cop26]. Now Covid-19 has turned the world upside down. We have to get up momentum for a green and nature-based recovery.” The delay of Cop26 also means that other international meetings can lay the ground for success. The UK holds the 2021 presidency of the G7 group of industrialised nations, whose leaders are likely to meet in the summer when Cop26 will be discussed. Italy, co-host with the UK of Cop26, will chair the G20 with a similar aim. Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen sharply amid the lockdowns, by about 17% on average in early April, according to a recent study. But that will have no measurable effect on efforts to meet the Paris goals, as emissions will resume their rise as the lockdowns ease unless lasting changes are made to countries’ energy production and consumption patterns. A spokesperson for the UK government said: “As hosts of Cop26 and the first major economy to legislate for net zero, the UK is committed to delivering a clean and resilient economic recovery from Covid-19. “The great global challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss have not gone away and it will be the duty of every responsible government to see our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that stands the test of time. That’s why we’re calling on all nations to come forward with more ambitious climate plans.”"
"**It's a tough time in the jobs market, as firms struggle to operate or shed staff to cut costs.**
The collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia and Debenhams could ultimately lead to 25,000 job losses in the retail sector.
But job vacancies are being posted at 70% of last year's average, and there are sectors still hiring.
In the week to 20 November, the volume of online job adverts posted was at 71% of the same week last year.
Some sectors have recovered more strongly than others. Education vacancies are still at 80% of last year's, and the government is offering bursaries and scholarships for teacher training in certain subjects.
Healthcare vacancies are at a similar level, with funding has begun for hundreds of nurse apprenticeships in England.
By contrast, the rate of catering and hospitality vacancies is down by three quarters on the same time last year.
However there are still temporary seasonal vacancies at many supermarkets and retailers this year.
Jobseekers should be ''strategic'' and target sectors experiencing job shortages as well as those that are growing, says Gerwyn Davies, analyst at human resources body the CIPD.
The shortage occupation list \- used to offer work visas to people moving to the UK - quickly shows where workers are needed, and includes fields like engineering, web programming and graphic design.
Now could be a good time to join the public sector, he suggests, with initiatives like the national retraining scheme helping people move into areas like social work, teaching and healthcare.
Tech recruiter Amy Golding suggests applying to companies which are fully digital, regardless of the role you want, as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online working.
These could be online retail companies like Amazon, which is recruiting for 7,000 UK jobs by the end of 2020 \- or tech companies working in education or healthcare.
To maximise your chances, one strategy is to create an appealing online profile so that recruiters and companies will approach you, while you also actively apply for jobs.
Consider your core skills, rather than hunting for a specific job title, suggests Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management **.**
For example, if you work in retail customer service, this could translate to other people-facing roles such as sales.
She suggests searching for these core skills online, to see which jobs come up, while also listing them on your professional profiles.
Recruiters often search for people based on a list of desired skills, so this will make you more visible.
Many companies list jobs on their own website or on recruitment sites.
You can also sign up with a general or specialist recruitment agency.
If you want to work for a particular company, check if they hire directly or through a recruiter.
And if you want a specific job, be proactive and contact someone doing that role to discover how they got there.
Professional networks can also be useful. These could be LinkedIn or Facebook groups, or industry organisations, where jobs and events are posted and advice is available.
Some industries and employers have even set up virtual networking events and job fairs.
With thousands of people applying for some roles, your personal network should be your first port of call, Corinne suggests.
Friends, family and acquaintances will collectively know hundreds of people, and some should know of businesses which are hiring.
Many employers like a personal recommendation and you may hear about roles before they are advertised.
When compiling your CV, emphasise your skills which a prospective employer wants.
List past achievements clearly. For example, you finished a recent project on time and within budget, or brought in new clients.
Asking someone else to read your application helps spot any spelling or grammatical errors that could mean your CV goes straight in the bin.
Show enthusiasm and give reasons why you want to work for this employer in particular.
Tailor your CV and cover letter for each application, which is time-consuming but more likely to result in a job, suggests Amy Golding.
She adds: ''If you don't hear back within three days, call them - because that makes it harder for them to ignore you!''
The national careers service offers many tools. These include a skills assessment, a search tool for courses, and help with CVs. The government's ''find a job'' website also lists vacancies.
Gaining new skills could help you move into a new sector and shows employers you've been productive during lockdown. Many universities and other institutions are currently offering free training courses.
For example, the University of Edinburgh is offering free short courses in fields such as statistics and data, the University of Oxford has a free course on economic development, and the Open University offers many free courses too.
Many other platforms, such as Codeacademy and Coursera, offer online coding tutorial, some of which are free.
The Prince's Trust is offering free personal development sessions to help 18-30 year-olds get into the health and social care sector. The charity offers mentoring, CV help, and can match jobseekers with suitable local employers."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmists like claiming that a bit of global warming can lead to mass-scale species extinctions and even threatens the very survival of human civilization. It’s one of the media’s favorite scare stories after sea level rise and super storms.
It turns out that the IPCC is now having “great doubts” about that. Yet another scare-story gets debunked!
Yesterday online journalist Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here reports in a piece titled: Secret UN Report: IPCC Doubts Prognoses On Species Extinction.
H/t: DirkH
According to information obtained by Spiegel, the UN body “is now sowing astonishingly great doubt over its earlier predictions.”
Online Spiegel writes that scientists are now distancing themselves from their previous projections, and quotes the IPCC:

There is very little confidence in the models accurately predicting the extinction risks.”
Spiegel reports of an “acute lack of data” and that “biological findings have increased doubt over the expected species extinction“.
Spiegel adds:
Thus far, the IPCC admits, there has been no evidence showing that climate change has led to the extinction of a single species. […] With most life forms there’s a lack of data, says Ragnar Kinzelbach of the University of Rostock.”
Kinzelbach then says that climate change has been used as an excuse for inaction in other more urgent areas:
“Monocultures, over-fertilization or soil destruction destroy more species than do several degrees Celsius of temperature rise ever could.”

"Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, has been named a deputy managing editor of The New York Times, one of the top leadership positions at the newspaper. Ms. Blumenstein will become one of the   women in The Times’s newsroom. She will join three other deputy managing editors  —   Janet Elder Clifford Levy, who was promoted last week and Matthew Purdy. In a note to the staff announcing the appointment on Tuesday, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Joe Kahn, the managing editor, said that Ms. Blumenstein, 50, would help the newsroom “do all the big things we intend to do in 2017 and beyond. ” In particular, they said, Ms. Blumenstein “will focus on making sure we remain an essential destination for readers interested in business, finance, economics and technology. ” In recent months, the newsroom has had a dearth of female leaders. In September, Susan Chira stepped down as deputy executive editor to write about gender issues, and in December, Lydia Polgreen, an associate masthead editor, left to become the top editor at The Huffington Post. Ms. Blumenstein’s appointment will quite likely be seen as a positive step, though it is notable that The Times named an outsider rather than promoting a woman from within. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kahn said it was “absolutely not the case’’ that they could not find a woman within The Times to play a role in newsroom leadership. “This is about Rebecca, who I think has a skill set, a perspective and the experience running a big newsroom that Dean and I and the others at the top of the masthead felt that we needed, to make sure that we’re putting our best foot forward in terms of this digital transition,” Mr. Kahn said. He added that there would be other masthead announcements soon. Ms. Blumenstein was seen as a potential successor to Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Journal, and news of her departure was met with surprise and sadness in the Journal newsroom, where she is known for her passion for breaking news. Asked how it felt to lure someone of Ms. Blumenstein’s caliber from a highly respected competitor, Mr. Kahn was circumspect in his reply. “I can only say that I follow and deeply admire The Journal’s coverage, and they’re a fierce competitor and a constant source of concern for us,” Mr. Kahn said. “So of course it’s meaningful to have one of their top editors come and join us. ” In a note to employees, Mr. Baker called Ms. Blumenstein “a peerless exponent and advocate of the very highest quality journalism. ” “She has been a singularly principled and dignified leader and a great mentor and friend to so many colleagues here,” he wrote. The appointment comes as both news organizations work to determine a strategy for an increasingly digital world. Both have initiated sweeping newsroom strategy reviews that have left employees anxious and uncertain about their futures. Last month, The Times released the findings of its review in a report that called for rapid change. Ms. Blumenstein has worked at The Journal since 1995, where she has held numerous senior positions, including managing editor of WSJ. com and international editor. As the newspaper’s China bureau chief, she led her team to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. China was also where she and Mr. Kahn, who worked in the Beijing bureau for The Times, got to know each other, Mr. Kahn said. “She was unrelenting in pushing her team hard to beat us,” he said."

National Public Radio published a story last week on biomedical scientists “cutting corners” in pursuit of funding. It was about the search for a cure for that horrendous ailment, Amyotrophyic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Repeatedly, drugs that seemed to work in animal tests didn’t pan out when tried on humans.



NPR spoke with Story Landis, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who said that “part of the explanation relates to a growing issue in biomedical science: the mad scramble for scarce research dollars.” So, she said, “scientists are tempted to oversell weak results.”



She went on: “Getting a grant requires that you have an exciting story to tell, that you have preliminary data, and you have published. In the rush, to be perfectly honest, to get a wonderful story out on the street in a journal, and preferably with some publicity to match, scientists can cut corners.”





There’s strong evidence that the prevalence of bad science and ‘cut corners’ is increasing.



What’s happening is that scientists aren’t replicating the work of others. That’s viewed as a waste of time because it’s not flashy enough to attract money. And given that oodles of funding are required to publish the reams of papers required to get promotion and tenure at a tier‐​one research university, doing that kind of work is likely to endanger your career.



“Scarce research dollars” aren’t the problem. The number of practitioners of a given science is directly proportional to how much money floods the field. There’s no scientist struggling for promotion in high‐​end academia who thinks he or she is adequately funded. Dollars, by their very nature, are scarce. That’s why money has value.



The problem, instead, is the “American model” for professional advancement, which can be stated simply: “get funded, get published or get out.”



Take my specialty, climate change. Back when I started at this, in 1976, no one wanted to be a climatologist, in no small part because there was very little funding to go around. But as global warming became a political cause, the dollar flow increased from a few million a year to a current federal outlay of $2.3 billion.



And so everyone doing anything that could be vaguely related to climate change got into the act. On came the ecologists, the plant physiologists and even the psychologists.



You can see the results in the “national assessments” of the effects of climate change that are put out every few years by the federal climate bureaucracy. The 2014 version has been heavily cited by President Obama in support of his global warming policies, despite the fact that it simply ignores the growing disparity between the government’s climate models and reality.



According to Ross McKitrick, from Canada’s University of Guelph (and a Cato Institute scholar), we are now approaching two decades without any warming.



As a wonderful example of how money dilutes science, the 2014 report also says that global warming will increase the prevalence of mental illness in our cities. Are people really saner in the winters of Washington than they are in sunny Miami? Does moving there from New York threaten your stability?



Rest assured that if this research had shown no link between climate and mental health, there would also be no renewal of the associated research grant. Negative results get neither published nor funded.



There’s strong evidence that the prevalence of bad science and “cut corners” is increasing.



University of Montreal’s Daniele Fanelli examined over 5,000 published papers from around the world, and over many disciplines. His stunning 2012 finding was titled “Negative Results are Disappearing from Most Disciplines and Countries,” and it documented a systematic increase in the frequency of “positive” findings being published.



All the incentives push science in the direction of positive results, and there is every disincentive (such as loss of funding and therefore your job) to not report when your research hypothesis isn’t borne out by the data.



Fanelli also found, in separate work, that the addition of a single American author to a multi‐​authored international paper greatly raises the probability that it will report a positive result.



All of this is tragic. In biomedicine, people suffer and die because of falsely promised cures. In climate change, we get poisonous policies emanating from absurd results generated by climate models that can’t even get the last two decades right.



And around the world, the quality of science is in decline as nations increasingly adopt our model for professional advancement.

It can take years or decades for a bad economy to recover if government throws enough obstacles in the way, like high taxes, costly regulations and class warfare against “millionaires and billionaires.” But a turnaround can begin within hours when government gets out of the way.



That’s what happened in West Germany. The Nazis had established a regime with totalitarian control of the economy, and for four years after World War II the Allied occupation authorities continued to enforce Nazi economic regulations. “When I got out of the airport bus in Frankfurt,” recalled the American journalist William Henry Chamberlin, “A crowd of barefooted boys clamored for a chance to carry my bags to the hotel, where they expected compensation not in paper marks, virtually worthless at the time, but in the universal substitute currency — cigarettes. Such scenes suggested some poverty‐​stricken Asiatic country, not Western Europe.”



Ludwig Erhard, an economist who had participated in the anti‐​Nazi underground, repeatedly urged the Allies to phase out the controls, and eventually he prevailed. The Allied Occupation authorities appointed him director of economic policy. On Sunday evening, June 20, 1948, Erhard went on the radio and announced that the almost worthless Reichsmark would be replaced by a new currency, the Deutschmark. People would receive one Deutschmark for every 20 Reichsmarks they handed in. Exchange controls would be abolished, since these aimed to maintain currency at above‐​market exchange rates, discouraging foreigners from accepting it as payment and thereby making lawful trade impossible.



A new currency, however, wouldn’t buy anything as long as chronic shortages persisted, so Erhard announced that price controls and rationing regulations would be abolished. Price controls simultaneously (1) discourage suppliers from providing more goods and (2) encourage consumers to line up for whatever might be available, which is why such controls cause shortages. U.S. commander Gen. Lucius Clay reportedly warned Erhard, “My advisers tell me you’re making a terrible mistake.” Erhard said, “Don’t listen to them, General. My advisers tell me the same thing.”



Within hours after Erhard’s announcement, goods that had been reserved for black market deals began to reappear on long‐​empty store shelves. During the 1950s, West Germany’s industrial production soared 225 percent. West Germany became a leading exporter. Overall, West Germany turned in the best economic performance of any developed country during this period. West Germany charged through the 1970s without the stagflation that afflicted the United States and other countries.



Although it’s well‐​known that a devastated economy like Germany’s could grow at above‐​average rates, the fact is nobody predicted the German economic miracle. It didn’t encounter serious trouble until West Germany absorbed backward, bankrupt communist East Germany after 1989. “The turnaround in Germany in 1948 was nothing short of a miracle,” MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch observed. “From one day to the next, productive forces were unleashed to let recovery and growth proceed at breakneck speed.”



Japan also had an amazing recovery. In 1977, historian Edwin O. Reischauer wrote that Japan emerged from World War II “a defeated pariah among nations — its cities destroyed, its industry at a standstill, its people exhausted, confused and demoralized. Yet in only one generation the country has risen like the proverbial phoenix to become, next to the colossi of the United States and the Soviet Union, the greatest economic power in the world.” Historian Patricia Hagan Kuwayama added, “If there is one common theme running through the story of postwar Japan’s economy, it is rapid, unceasing change.”



American Occupation authorities broke up government‐​enforced cartels and implemented the 1948 Dodge Plan. This limited the Japanese government’s economic power and made it easier for new entrepreneurs to emerge. “For the first time,” reported economist Katsuro Sakoh, “practically any Japanese, regardless of age, class, or family background, could venture into business and succeed if the elements of hard work, imagination, willingness to take risks, and luck were present. Not only did established businesses prosper under fresher and younger management, but thousands of entirely new enterprises, such as Honda, Yamaha, Sony and Suzuki, to name but a few, were born in this new climate.”



Many people have claimed that Japan succeeded because of a government‐​driven “industrial policy,” but nothing could be further from the truth. Taxes were a smaller percentage of Japan’s GDP than was the case for England, France, West Germany or the United States. Japan had relatively small, balanced budgets — the opposite of what fashionable Keynesian economists recommended he private sector dominated Japanese capital markets, providing a reported 90 percent of outstanding loans and 75 percent of total capital. Government paid for a lower percentage of R&D funding in Japan than in West Germany, England or the United States. The principal Japanese government‐​owned manufacturer produced cigarettes, whereas in Europe government‐​owned businesses manufactured iron, steel, cars, airplanes and other products.



It’s true that the Japanese government “targeted” certain industries for development, but the top target was agriculture, because after World War II farmers made up about half the Japanese population. There was government assistance for forestry and fishing as well as rural areas such as Kyushu, Shikoku and Hokkaido. Infrastructure — roads and bridges — was another high priority. Losses from the government‐​owned Japanese National Railway consumed almost 20 percent of the national government budget. The fabled Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) mainly targeted heavy industries like shipbuilding, coal mining, hydroelectric power plants, nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants and oil refineries.



In other words, the Japanese government didn’t do many favors for popular exports like consumer electronics and cars. Indeed, MITI tried to obstruct some of Japan’s greatest entrepreneurs.



For example, in 1946 Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita started what became Sony Corporation. They wanted to license Bell Labs’ transistor technology, but MITI blocked Sony’s $25,000 payment for the license fee — scarce U.S. dollars shouldn’t be spent on something with unknown potential, MITI said. Eventually MITI relented, and in 1955 Sony began producing small transistor radios.



MITI tried to force seven Japanese automakers to merge, but four including Honda refused. Soichiro Honda fumed, “If you want to control us, you will have to be a shareholder. Only our shareholders have the right to dictate to the management of this organization. Then we will listen to you!” MITI had less power than many people realized. It was thanks to resourceful entrepreneurs that starting in 1950, Japan’s annual economic growth averaged 9.4 percent for the next 22 years — an extraordinarily long‐​lived boom.



There have been many other cases of troubled economies that recovered fast when government got out of the way. For example:



* **Chile.** September 1970 was the first time a Marxist was elected president of Chile, South America’s longest‐​running democracy. Salvador Allende seized businesses. He seized some 1,400 farms, and agricultural production collapsed. He seized banks, then went on a money‐​printing binge. Inflation hit 1,000 percent. Allende decreed price controls that caused severe shortages.



By 1972, investigative journalist David Meissner reported: “People line up for sugar. Beef can be bought only on Friday and Saturday. Toilet paper is the subject of a run on stores.” There were daily protests against Allende. On September 11, 1973, General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte led a coup, and Allende was killed.



The economic crisis continued until 1975 when Pinochet decided to cut spending, cut taxes, liberalize trade, privatize money‐​losing nationalized enterprises and convert the troubled, government‐​run retirement program into a system with individually‐​owned retirement accounts. Chileans became the most prosperous people in South America, and by 1988 there was a transition to free elections.



* **United States.** During the late 1970s, Americans were angry about gasoline shortages, seemingly endless gas station lines and double‐​digit inflation. After Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president, his first official act was to sign an executive order abolishing price controls. The resulting surge in gas prices sent a powerful signal that profits could be made by supplying more gasoline. Prices came down as gasoline became abundant, and gas station lines vanished.



In addition, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker was determined to squeeze inflation out of the economy, but he needed political support, something that Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter was unable to provide. That’s because the pain (higher unemployment) comes before the gain (lower inflation, then lower unemployment). Affected interest groups complained bitterly about Volcker, as did some of Reagan’s closest advisors who worried that Republicans would suffer a setback in congressional elections. Reagan remained steadfast with Volcker, double‐​digit inflation was vanquished, and a remarkable era of low‐​inflation prosperity began.



* **Bolivia.** Bolivia had Latin America’s worst‐​ever inflation, because the left political party in power was a coalition that wanted the government to spend more money on social welfare programs and hire more unionized government employees. But spending exceeded tax revenue, and there were no buyers for Bolivia’s risky government bonds​.In August 1985, inflation hit an annualized rate of 60,000 percent.



Then Victor Paz Estenssoro, a center‐​right politician, was elected president. He seemed to understand that fighting inflation would be hard on many people, so it made sense to get through the process as fast as possible. To cut spending, the government let go of 27,000 employees at the government‐​run oil and tin companies (Bolivia’s population at the time was 6 million). The Bolivian peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar, thereby getting control of the Bolivian money supply out of the hands of Bolivian politicians. Price controls, wage controls, exchange controls and interest‐​rate controls were abolished. Taxes were somewhat simplified. The runaway inflation was stopped in 10 days.



* **Hong Kong.** As a British colony (until 1997), Hong Kong endured shocks from Japanese invaders, communist revolutionaries who claimed Hong Kong for China and Chinese Nationalist agitators who claimed Hong Kong for Taiwan. Hong Kong was overwhelmed with some 3 million refugees, and the total population quadrupled in a few years. Ultimately China, which had cut itself off from the outside world, seems to have decided against an invasion because half their foreign income was earned in Hong Kong.



Meanwhile, Hong Kong offered more freedom than just about anyplace else on earth, thanks to colonial administrators like Financial Secretary John Cowperthwaite. He perfected a laissez‐​faire paradise that focused on protecting people from force and fraud, supporting free trade and stable money, maintaining low taxes and few regulations, with no special favors or bailouts. Hong Kong became a world‐​class manufacturing, trade and financial center. When China finally absorbed Hong Kong — and promised to leave it intact — its per capita GDP ($22,990)was 37 times larger than mainland China ($620.)



* **China.** The economic outlook for China began to improve after the eagerly‐​awaited death of Mao Zedong in 1976. His worst disaster was an insane Soviet‐​style five‐​year plan known as the Great Leap Forward that promoted heavy industry and sacrificed agriculture where China had comparative advantages, causing a famine estimated to have killed some 45 million people.



Deng Xiaopeng emerged as the new Chinese leader, and he insisted that the top priority must be reviving the economy. Although he never repudiated the deadly dogmas of Marx, Lenin and Mao, and the Communist Party continued to monopolize political power, Deng stimulated agriculture by dismantling communes that suffocated the initiative of peasants. The government encouraged foreign investment. Money‐​losing government enterprises continued, but private individuals were permitted to work for themselves and establish businesses, which had been unheard of under Mao. Deng declared, “to get rich is glorious.” A substantial private sector began to develop, and China has reported high growth rates for the last three decades.



* **Brazil.** For perhaps a half‐​century, the Brazilian government directed development, expropriated private property, inflated the money supply and maintained high tariffs to prevent Brazilian customers from shopping for the world’s best deals. Result: financial crises, soaring debt, runaway inflation, political turmoil and sometimes military coups.



But by 1990, there was a growing consensus in Brazil to curb inflation, privatize moribund government enterprises and liberalize trade. In 1995, annual inflation — that had peaked around 2,900 percent — was brought down to single digits. In 2002, former labor union official Lula da Silva won the presidential election. Widely expected to pursue an anti‐​business agenda, Lula turned out to be a very practical man. He affirmed that high inflation must not come back and that Brazilians would be smart to embrace global markets. Brazil became safe for investors and entrepreneurs, helping to usher in today’s remarkable economic boom.



So, there really isn’t any secret about what needs to be done. There is, however, a huge political challenge about how to do it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s no secret that many vegetarians are also radical environmentalists and climate alarmists who are obsessed and hysterical about the planet burning up. Perhaps the University of Graz in Austria has discovered one reason why: their “unhealthy” diet.

Study shows that big meat-eaters are healthiest. Photo credit: Alpha, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
A new University of Graz study concludes that vegetarians are more often ill and have a lower quality of living than meat-eaters. According to the German press release, vegetarians “have cancer and heart attacks more often”. The release also says that they show more psychological disorders than meat eaters. Consequently, the report writes, they are a greater burden on the health care system.
According to the press release the scientists evaluated data from the Austrian Health Interview Survey (AT-HIS), which is also part of an important and valuable EU survey (European Health Interview Survey).
The scientists examined a total of 1320 persons who were divided up into 4 groups of 330 persons each. All groups were comparable with respect to gender, age, and socio-economic status. The study also accounted for smoking and physical activity. Also the BMI was within the normal range for all four groups (22.9 – 24.9). The only thing that really was different among the four groups was the diet. The four groups were: 1) vegetarians, 2) meat-eaters with lots of fruit and veggies, 3) little meat-eaters and 4) big meat-eaters. More than three quarters of the participants were women (76.4%).
Vegetarians plagued by significantly more chronic illnesses
The press release states that the results contradict the common cliché that meat-free diets are healthier. Vegetarians have twice as many allergies as big meat-eaters do (30.6% to 16.7%) and they showed 166% higher cancer rates (4.8% to 1.8%). Moreover the scientists found that vegans had a 150% higher rate of heart attacks (1.5% to 0.6%). In total the scientists looked at 18 different chronic illnesses. Compared to the big meat-eaters, vegetarians were hit harder in 14 of the 18 illnesses (78%) which included asthma, diabetes, migraines and osteoporosis [1, p.4, Table 3].
The Medical University of Graz confirms the findings of the University of Hildesheim: More frequent psychological disorders among vegetarians, the press release states.
The roots of anxiety and depression?
In the analysis, the University of Graz found that vegetarians were also twice as likely to suffer for anxiety or depressions than big meat eaters (9.4% to 4.5%). That result was confirmed by the University of Hildesheim, which found that vegetarians suffered significantly more from depressions, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints and eating disorders [2]. The U of Graz scientists also found that vegetarians are impacted more by ilnessses and visit the doctor more frequently [1, p. 3, Table 2].
Big meat-eaters were also found to have a “significantly better quality of life in all categories”, the study found. The four categories examined were: physical and psychological health, social relationships and environment-related life quality [1, p. 5, Table 4].

Dubious science everywhere
Again this is not the first study that has recently contradicted the claims that vegetarians are healthier. The world’s largest study on nutrition (EPIC) indicated that vegetarians in general tend to die earlier [3].
Recently experts have shown that the alleged health benefits of a vegetarian diet are myths and fairy tales. For example, according to Professor Ulrich Voderholzer, Director and Chief Physician of the Schön Klinik Roseneck and an expert for eating disorders, promises made by vegetarian organisations “are not scientifically supported.”
The University of Graz press release writes [4]:
It’s more about an ideological message that suggests false promises.“
The press release also adds [5]:
Concerning cancer prevention through fruits and vegetables, Prof. Rudolf Kaaks of the German Cancer Research Center DKFZ recently stated: ‘There’s no relationship, zero-point-zero.’“
Gee, it all sounds as bad as the science we have been seeing that tries to link bad weather to CO2.
Not only are greens duped about climate science, many are also duped by nutritional science. Granola-eating tree-huggers are turning out to be the most ill-informed, unhappy and hysterical people on the planet.

Thinking about our relationship with the UN, who comes to mind? Her mentor would be proud of her pupil, and possibly even wrote Ardern’s National Statement for her, delivered at the UN General Assembly to a sparse, disinterested and partially comatose audience.



Predictably, Ardern spoke of “kindness” and “climate change” but nestled in there were a couple of never-before-mentioned nuggets. Thank goodness some people back home were paying attention!



Judith Collins was most unimpressed, her hackles rose and she tweeted **“Borderless!!! What in the world is this PM doing? Open borders??”**



Indeed, what was Ardern thinking? Well, first and foremost we must remember that Ardern is a UN sycophant, more than happy to sit back and let them tell her how best to run the country – including opening our borders.



But Winston Peters was also paying attention, but more likely he was privy to the speech before it was delivered, because three days ago (Ardern delivered her speech two days ago), he preempts the question, furiously backpedalling on his pre-election promise to “cut immigration by up to 60,000 people a year.”



“Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says the Government is striving to address the quality of immigration, saying ‘it’s not whether it’s too high **it’s whether you are getting the right people** ‘ that matters most.”



  
A divided CoL aside, Ardern, crucially, **gives us our first insight into her patsy role at the UN** for Aunty Helen which is much **more about driving change than about representing us**. She begins with Security Council reform.



“[…] ultimately it is up to us – the Member States – **to drive change at the UN. This includes reforming the Security Council**. 



If we want the Council to fulfil its purpose of maintaining international peace and security, its practices need to be updated so it is not **hamstrung by the use of the veto**.” 



  
The power of veto is available only to the **five permanent members** of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States) and can only be used to prevent the adoption of any “substantive” resolution. It is arguably the most important distinction between permanent and non-permanent members and also the most controversial aspect of UN operations. 



“Permanent members use the veto to defend their national interests, to uphold a tenet of their foreign policy or, in some cases, to promote a single issue of particular importance to a state. 



Since 16 February 1946—when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) cast the first veto on a draft resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Syria (S/PV.23)—the veto has been recorded 290 times.



 **In the early years, the USSR cast most of the vetoes** , with a considerable number of these used to block the admission of a new member state. Over the years, 



the **USSR/Russia has cast a total of 141 vetoes, or close to half of all vetoes**. **The US cast the first of its 83 vetoes to date on 17 March 1970** (S/9696 and Corr. 1 and 2).



  
Playing out in the UN is the struggle between the two most powerful nations – the USSR/Russia and the USA. The temptation for large nations to become catalysts for the decimation of much tinier nations in the Middle East and Africa because of their valuable national resources and strategic import can be too great to resist, and the UN has been largely impotent in stopping them. 



Until the USA began exercising its veto right at the UN the USSR/Russia had dominated the Security Council but they are now arguably neck and neck, meaning removing the right to veto will equally dis-empower both. **But behind this move is another.** For the past year, the UN has been discussing reforming the Security Council, whether to add to the five permanent members or abolish the permanent member’s veto power, or both, because African nations feel neglected and are clamouring for better representation. 



“Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking on behalf of the African Group, spotlighted that most issues discussed in the 15?member organ are related to his continent. Its 54 nations must be involved in decisions concerning not only international peace and security, but its own very continent. **Africa demands no less than two permanent seats, including the veto power, if it remains, and five non?permanent seats.** Widespread support from Member States for this position means that it is time to **“redress the historical injustice of not being represented in the permanent category”.**



  
It seems highly likely Ardern is preparing the ground for satisfying African demands by the UN granting them permanent member status, but not the power of veto which it will deprive them of by removing it entirely.



It appears Ardern has waded into the dispute at someone else’s behest and whether she represents our values or not, she represents us. 



“I’m struck as a leader attending my first United Nations General Assembly by the power and potential that resides here. But in New Zealand, **we have always been acutely aware of that**.”



  
Ardern’s claim of NZ awareness is not true. Given the UN’s ineffective history **most New Zealanders would not recognise either its power or its insidious destructive potential,** but Arden’s patsy role in driving change within the UN has become clear.

"A missile engine exploded at a naval test range, west of the city of Severodvinsk on Russia’s northern coast at 9am on August 8. At least five people were killed and several others injured. As it is associated with Russia’s defence programme, the incident is shrouded in mystery. But shortly after the explosion the state weather monitoring agency, Roshydromet, reported a spike in radiation 40 km away.  At first, the Russian authorities denied the radiation leak, then later confirmed it. There were conflicting reports of the source of the explosion and a planned, then later cancelled evacuation of a nearby village. Unsurprisingly, tabloid media speculation followed that the Russian authorities may be hiding a Chernobyl-like accident. Missile tests don’t usually involve radioactive materials, unless the missile in question is carrying a nuclear warhead (which is prohibited under the UN’s Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). So what is going on? No one outside of the Russian government and military can yet be entirely certain but, as an academic researcher in nuclear materials, I can do my best to piece together the available evidence.  Russian authorities have confirmed that the explosion involved “an isotope power source in a liquid propulsion system”. There’s nothing particularly new about the propulsion system – early ballistic missiles used a pressurised stream of liquid fuel and oxygen which, when ignited, expanded and rushed out of the bottom of the missile, propelling it in the opposite direction.  The “isotope power source” part is new though. Radioactive isotopes are unstable atoms that release excess energy by emitting radiation. So if the missile is powered by isotopes this indicates the Russians have  developed a mini-nuclear reactor – able to fit inside a missile – that is capable of using radiation to heat the liquid fuel for propulsion. This has never been achieved before.  This admission prompted American and UK experts to conclude the source of the radiation leak must be a type of long-range missile that Russia has previously claimed would be nuclear powered. It is known by the Russians as 9M730 Burevestnik, and by NATO as the SCC-X-9 Skyfall. The exact details of the mini-nuclear reactor that may have been developed to power a Russian missile are not known, but there are a few potential types that may be used. The key difference between a nuclear reactor used to generate energy and one that might be used to power a missile is the quantity of material required. The RBMK reactor that blew up at Chernobyl contained 200 tonnes of uranium dioxide fuel. A significantly smaller amount of fuel would be required — perhaps a few kilos at most — to lift a missile. One possibility is what’s known as a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). This converts heat from radioactive decay into electricity. Potential candidates for the fuel are plutonium-238, 4.8kg of which powered the Curiosity Rover on Mars, americium-241 – widely used to power smoke detectors – and polonium-210, infamously used in the poisoning of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. Strontium-90, which emits both beta and gamma radiation in its radioactive decay, has been used in both American and Russian applications of RTGs in the past, including inside Russian lighthouses. Given the measured increase in gamma activity at nearby Severodvinsk, the latter is certainly plausible. The second possibility is that the missile was powered by a nuclear thermal reactor. This is perhaps more likely given the authorities’ description of the accident. These reactors could use the heat generated from radioactive decay to heat liquid hydrogen fuel. Such a system could theoretically use a solid uranium core, a liquid radioisotope core, or even gaseous uranium to power a missile in flight for long distances. However, none of these technologies have been proven, at least with regard to missiles,  and it is not possible to guess the fuel type with any certainty, making the radiation in Severodvinsk difficult to explain. Whatever the source of radiation, the release seems to be relatively small. To the layperson, 16 times above background rate may sound like a lot, but that background rate is tiny and relatively harmless – for instance the English county of Cornwall has three times the background rate thanks to naturally-occuring uranium-bearing rocks in the earth there. Compare this with the Chernobyl accident, which released radioactivity 7,000 times above background.  Norwegian and Finnish authorities are monitoring the air but have not yet reported anything abnormal. Western scientists are even asking residents of Severodvinsk to donate their car air filters, so that, at some point, we may understand more about what was released and how harmful it might be. That should give some indication as to the threat posed by the testing of such weapons."

 **Beth Houlbrooke**  
Act Party Deputy Leader / Vice President 



When thinking about this week’s Ad Lib, all the immediate topics that came to mind caused me to roll my eyes involuntarily, so I’ll skip over them quickly:



 **Lowering the voting age**



Using the argument that 16 is the age of consent or conscription or to obtain other rights is irrelevant. What is relevant in this debate is the maxim “no taxation without representation”. That’s the only justification I can think of for under 18s to be given the vote, but then perhaps it should be based on minimum taxable earnings in a year before it becomes a right. That could be processed through the IRD. I reject the argument that it should only be available to net taxpayers – that would exclude superannuitants and those unable to work through sickness or disability.



 **Children protesting Climate Change**



Oh puh-leeze. What is this materially meant to achieve? When will the protestors have achieved their aims? When the sea has rolled back?



 **Wearing black-face nearly 20 years ago**



What Justin Trudeau dressed up as at a school benefit nearly 20 years ago does not interest me one bit. Times have changed and attitudes are thankfully more enlightened where true offence might be caused. But where does cultural appropriation begin and end now, and where is it moving towards? No more dressing up on St Patrick’s Day? I’m of both Irish and Scottish extraction, should I be concerned when people don red-haired wigs and tartan kilts for fun? What happens if you’re in the costume hire business?



 **[Protests by vegans](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/faces-of-the-day-12/) against meat eaters**



A blatant disregard for private property rights means whatever point they were trying to make was immediately lost on me, and I imagine many others.



 **CHEERS DAVID**



Saturday 21 September 2019 marked five years since David was elected to Parliament. In that five years he became ACT Party Leader; saw more partnership schools open to give more families more choice and access to better education; introduced probably the most significant bill for social change to be debated this decade – End of Life Choice; voted or spoke out consistently against non-core government spending such as corporate welfare, burdensome regulations, and additional taxes; has been the sole voice for freedom of speech and proper democratic process; and – who could forget – passed legislation allowing bars to open early in the morning for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.



Now the 2019 Rugby World Cup is upon us and occasional punters like me will be heading to the nearest friendly bar to watch the big matches, some of which aren’t starting till after 10 pm NZ time. That means without a special licence or change in legislation, there would be fewer options and many businesses would be put through a whole lot of red tape to be able to open. Once again thanks to David, we can find an open bar with a big screen, enjoy a beverage, or simply find some company with whom to watch the games. Please remind your friends, when you’re at the next late evening match, to raise a glass to David.



 **FLAVOURS UP IN SMOKE**



This is not new, ACT spoke about it [nearly a year ago,](https://www.act.org.nz/vaping_red_tape_protects_tobacco_revenue?utm_campaign=beth_ad_lib_44&utm_medium=email&utm_source=actnz) but the legislative changes to vaping products are now imminent.



You may have noticed the ads on TV in the evenings recently. Turns out my good friend Cameron Brewer’s [PR Agency is behind them,](https://www.mad-daily.com/vapes-target-big-tobacco/) and they make some very good points around the effects of the legislation.



Changes to advertising rules around vaping products may mean that the availability of a safer alternative to smoking remains a mysterious, almost underground scene to anyone curious about making the switch.



 _“Going forward we believe it’s critical to keep informing Kiwis that vaping is an effective tool for smokers to quit and is 95% less harmful than cigarettes. That’s the only way New Zealand will ever get close to achieving its ambition of being a smoke-free country.”_



The ban on flavours of nicotine liquids will also likely be counter-productive to meeting any smoke-free targets.



I have a good number of friends who have been able to quit smoking by transitioning to vaping products. Flavour is an important part of their new enjoyment. To allow only flavours that taste like the thing they’re quitting may make it tempting to return to cigarettes as soon as the opportunity presents itself. The old taste needs to be forgotten and replaced with a preferred taste.



Genuine ex-smokers are posting on-line images like the following:



As with all things that aren’t good for us, it is not for us to moralise over another’s choice unless that choice materially impacts on us or takes away our own choice, e.g. not to inhale second-hand smoke. Most general practitioners now recommend that smokers who are having trouble giving up the highly addictive, combustion and carcinogenic form of inhaling nicotine, try replacing it with the smokeless option.



On behalf of my many friends who have successfully quit smoking this way, and then some of them vaping, I’m promoting this [petition.](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/petitions/document/PET_91278/petition-of-nancy-loucas-sutthoff-for-aotearoa-vapers-community)

"**First Minister Mark Drakeford has come under pressure from his own Labour backbenchers over his ban on the sale of alcohol in Welsh pubs.**
Alun Davies demanded to see evidence underlying the decision.
Meanwhile Hefin David said information from a group advising ministers should have been published when the decision was taken.
Mr Drakeford said the case for the need for the restrictions - aimed at easing a rise in cases - was ""compelling"".
Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in from 18:00 GMT on Friday.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies said many businesses will ""not survive"" the decision.
Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was a ""mistake"", said the changes were ""not comprehensible"" and could damage public trust.
Earlier the boss of Wales' biggest brewery called the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be shut from Friday.
During a debate in the Welsh Parliament, Mr Drakeford told Senedd members: ""If I have to make an unpopular decision because it is the right decision, I will make the right decision and not just the one that makes me popular.""
Wales is facing a ""public health emergency"", he told members, and that the Welsh Government was relying on evidence used to close pubs in other parts of the UK.
Blaenau Gwent's Mr Davies told the first minister that if he ""wants myself and others to support him in these regulations, he must provide the evidence and advice has received from his advisers"".
He said that was needed so members could ""explain those decisions to the people we represent"".
The Welsh Government has cited advice from UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), as well as its own Technical Advisory Cell (TAC).
Mr Drakeford told Mr Davies that when he ""has a chance to study what Sage has already said, what the TAC will tell him what the figures of positivity, transmission, hospitalisation and death in his part of Wales tell him, he will see very plainly why the actions we are taking are necessary and necessary now"".
Mr David was more supportive of the first minister, saying there was ""a logic behind what the government has done"", based on advice from Sage.
However he added: ""There is a lot of frustration and anger out there with regard to this decision.""
The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell usually publishes its latest Covid-19 advice on Thursdays.
""It should be when the decision is announced,"" Mr David said.
Mr Drakeford said ""we will do our best to expedite"" TAC advice but he said they ""provide it when they are confident that they've got it ready for publication, and it's very important that I do not attempt to try to influence them in the work that they do"".
Over the course of the day in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford faced calls from the opposition for the scientific basis of the decision to be published.
Mr Drakeford said the evidence is there ""in the public health emergency we are facing"".
""Two of our local authorities in Wales have rates of more than 400 per 100,000 of the population; seven of them rates of over 300; 11 of them rates over 200, and those rates are growing - growing across Wales.
""The evidence for the actions we are taking is there to be seen in the reviews published by Sage on 11 and 19 November, reviewing the measures that have succeeded across the United Kingdom, and we have drawn on that to put in place in Wales those steps that will reduce the flow of coronavirus and save lives that need not be lost.
""It's the same evidence that [the UK government] has drawn on to close pubs and prevent the sale of alcohol in tier 3 levels in England; it's the same evidence that led the SNP Government in Scotland to close pubs and to prevent the sale of alcohol in level 3 areas in Scotland. It's why hospitality is closed in Northern Ireland today.""
Pubs are closed in tier 3 areas in England, while in level 3 areas in Scotland they are not able to serve alcohol.
During First Minister's Questions, Paul Davies described the decision as ""catastrophic"" and ""devastating"" for businesses.
""Pubs and restaurants in areas where transmission rates are low will rightly feel upset that their businesses is being put at risk, through no fault of their own,"" he added.
Adam Price has called for ministers to allow alcohol to be served until 1900, with a ban on off-licence sales after that time, in what he said would be a ""sensible compromise"".
""Off licences and supermarkets should not be allowed to sell alcohol after this time to discourage people from going into each other's homes,"" he said."

At the beginning of the year, Jacinda returned from 7 weeks holiday. 7 weeks you may say sounds like an awful lot! But anyway, she attended her first press conference on that day and it did not go well.



  
Tova Obrien:  




‘Her first press conference (after 7wk break) she was on the defensive, shutting things down, not wanting to talk about things or engage’



  
Andrey Young:  




In the substance of the press conference, Ardern sounded exasperated at questions about the failure of KiwiBuild to meet its first milestone of 1000 houses by July, and by questions about the capital gains tax report.  
Ardern’s tetchiness perhaps reflects a raft of challenging issues facing the Government.  
Ardern became impatient when questions turned to the undisputed veto that NZ First will have on any capital gains tax  
She also became exasperated when questioned about the failure of KiwiBuild targets — so much so that she could not bring herself to actually say “No” when repeatedly asked if the July target would be met



Most of us could only dream of a seven-week break and then we would be fresh, calm and ready for the new year.  
But Jacinda returned in a mood so gloomy that her very first day back when she should have been fresh, she was the opposite.



She had come to the realisation over the break that data just doesn’t stick in her mind as stories do. These stories have emotions that can get people to do all type of things good or bad. She had emotional appeal, trust with these people. The Labour people, Winston, lots of voters and the international observers. But things were falling apart at the end of 2018. Internal staffing issues, staff turnover, Ardern walking out of meetings in tears and so on. The strain of constant work was too much for her and she was physically ill and mentally exhausted.



What Ardern was seeing was that her stories, her dreams, her ideologies were not turning into reality. She had realised over the holidays that she simply did not have the skills to do the role of PM. She had lost her own confidence and this came out in that very first press conference of the year.



We all have periods of self-doubt. Some of us never get over these periods, some of us fight, the best of us put our heads down and grind out the problems. Jacinda did not have the ability to do this. She does not have the mental stamina to read, to understand, to analyse – she only does stories!



She was lonely and distant (as any PM is) from her colleagues. She had Grant Robertson but he was very busy in Finance an area that she (and Grant) had little understanding of. It was interesting on the eve of the launch of Grant’s and Jacinda’s ‘welfare budget’ that when there were ‘hacks’ and ‘leaks’ rather than round up the team on the 9th floor and get to the bottom of it, Jacinda went home early to give Neve a bath.



She was out of her depth, lonely and helpless at the top. Her close minders isolated her from the rigours of work and sent her to visits at schools, kindergartens and protected her constantly from hard questions. She would light up when talking about climate change and other areas of interest to her. But ask her outside of that, and as Mike Hosking finds weekly, she simply umms and arghs her way through interviews without actually answering the questions.



March 15 Christchurch, hit her very hard. Whilst many were positive about her dress up and kindness towards the victims in the aftermath of the shootings, some thought she went too far. I disagree that she was play-acting to gain support. Instead my view is somewhat more serious. Her reaction was over the top because she was already struggling with her own coping mechanisms and March 15 provided her with another matter which she had no choice but to confront. The sad glum faces she showed over the next few weeks/months was in some part for the families and victims but more importantly, it was for her.



During the mid-year break her minders managed to stretch out her break from the 9th floor by first having a ‘fishing break’ then a brand Jacinda excursion to socialist Melbourne and then a trip to Tokelau. This resulted in the now-familiar ‘Part-Time Prime Minister’ slogan coined by Simon Bridges.



Whilst this is a catchy term and was picked up by the Jacinda doubters, it was actually true and worthy. Jacinda was being managed. Her workload was managed, her visits were carefully managed so she would come across as knowledgeable in those areas of her interest, but would not need to know about the areas she was not interested in.



Importantly, some key areas of her responsibilities were kept from her. The most visible of these were the sex assaults from within her own office. This controversy alone struck more against everything she had portrayed herself to stand for. Women in her very own office were not protected and she was (or was not) complicit in its cover-up. Complicity or not, she had responsibility, a concept she has yet to develop a mature understanding of.



We can see Ardern now. Thin, gaunt, irritable, pale and whilst I am no medical person, others have pointed out the suggestion of medication to assist her in day to day life.



And still every day the hits keep coming. Failure after failure, non-performance in her so called ‘year of delivery’. There are wins, and they are celebrated, but a realistic analysis of these shows that these are small wins and will not help New Zealand any more than provide some token virtue signalling.



New Zealand’s economy is slowing, all the indicators that matter are negative, we have a weak and failing PM who has no real answers to help New Zealand.



It is going to be a very very long 12 months for Jacinda and her Government which I would give a 50/50 chance of surviving full term.

"WASHINGTON  —   Republicans seized her microphone. And gave her a megaphone. Silenced on the Senate floor for condemning a peer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, emerged on Wednesday in a coveted role: the avatar of liberal resistance in the age of President Trump. Late on Tuesday, Senate Republicans voted to halt the remarks of Ms. Warren, already a lodestar of the left, after she criticized a colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, by reading a letter from Coretta Scott King. Instantly, the decision  —   led by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who invoked a rarely enforced rule prohibiting senators from impugning the motives and conduct of a peer  —   amplified Ms. Warren’s message and further inflamed the angry Senate debate over Mr. Sessions’ nomination. He was confirmed on Wednesday. For Ms. Warren’s supporters, it was the latest and most visceral example of a woman muzzled by men who seemed unwilling to listen. Critics saw something else: a senator who has rankled members of both parties with her nose for the spotlight lobbing a    salvo in the next presidential race. “A lot of that’s about 2020 politics,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, grumbled on MSNBC. Mr. McConnell’s subsequent explanation for his maneuver seemed destined for a future Warren campaign ad: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. ” After an unsuccessful effort to draft her for the 2016 presidential race, Ms. Warren is considered a very early   for 2020, should she run. Mr. McConnell’s coda has already been repurposed as a sort of rallying cry. Across social media, Ms. Warren’s allies and supporters posted with the hashtag #shepersisted, calling to mind some Democrats’ embrace of the term “nasty woman” after Mr. Trump deployed it to describe Hillary Clinton during a debate. Appearing with Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire in October, Ms. Warren reminded Mr. Trump that “nasty women vote. ” After the vote to bar Ms. Warren from speaking further about Mr. Sessions, other senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Tom Udall of New Mexico, read Mrs. King’s letter without facing any objection, prompting some activists to raise charges of sexism. Ms. Warren has long displayed an instinct for capitalizing on highly visible fights. After she was barred from speaking on the Senate floor, she began reading the 1986 letter from Mrs. King on Facebook. By Wednesday evening, the video had attracted more than nine million views. In the letter, Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. took aim at Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights as a United States attorney in Alabama, saying he had used “the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. ” She called on the Senate not to confirm Mr. Sessions to a federal judgeship, and his nomination to that post was ultimately rejected. On Wednesday morning, in a conference room in the Capitol  —   the vote prohibited Ms. Warren from speaking about the nomination only from the Senate floor  —   Ms. Warren addressed civil rights leaders, recounting her long night. “What hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,” she said. “It’s about trying to shut people up. It’s about saying, ‘No, no, no, just go ahead and vote. ’” She went on. “This is going to be hard,” she said. “We don’t have the tools. There’s going to be a lot that we will lose. But I guarantee, the one thing we will not lose, we will not lose our voices. ” As Democrats strain to navigate the early days of the Trump presidency, weighing the merits of the blanket opposition that many in their base seem to crave, the latest rancor appeared to raise the likelihood of further confrontation in the Senate chamber. Some   groups seemed comfortable with that. “What the public needs to see from Democrats right now is more backbone and more standing on principle,” said Adam Green, a   of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Elizabeth Warren continues to be the model for good behavior. ” The timing is fortunate for Ms. Warren, whose fiery denunciations of corporate greed have long made her a Democratic celebrity. Her new book deal was announced this week. Its title: “This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class. ” Shortly after Mr. McConnell’s objection on Tuesday, Ms. Warren called a favorite TV anchor, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, and spoke live on the air. On Wednesday, Republicans betrayed no regret for their move, accusing Ms. Warren of ignoring repeated warnings to avoid violating the Senate rule, known as Rule XIX. She had also read a letter from Edward M. Kennedy, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate, disparaging Mr. Sessions. “You don’t insult  —   whether it be from a letter, or from a message from God, or on golden tablets,” said Senator John McCain of Arizona. “That’s the rules of the Senate. They want to complain about it, complain about it. ” Democrats and their allies resumed their protest against Mr. Sessions on Wednesday with renewed swagger, despite their long odds of blocking his confirmation. “If Mr. McConnell or anybody else wants to deny me the right to debate Jeff Sessions’s qualifications, go for it,” Mr. Sanders said from the Senate floor hours before the vote. Since the election, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been among the lawmakers jockeying to be leading messengers for Democratic politics under the Trump administration. There have been bumps. Last month, Ms. Warren faced rare criticism from liberals after voting in a Senate committee to approve Ben Carson as Mr. Trump’s secretary of housing and urban development, infuriating voters who had hoped for uniform opposition to Mr. Trump’s cabinet. Defending herself on Facebook at the time, Ms. Warren wrote that she appreciated the feedback. “Unlike the new administration,” she said, “I don’t believe in ignoring or silencing people who disagree with the choices I make or the votes I take. ” This week, it seemed, all had been forgiven. MoveOn. org, the liberal political group, said it had collected about $300, 000 in contributions for Ms. Warren since Tuesday night. And by midafternoon, a   email from Ms. Warren had arrived in the inboxes of her supporters. “I’m still banned from speaking on the Senate floor  —   but there’s still time for you to make your voice heard,” the email read, with a link to a page for contributions. She signed off with a familiar message: “Keep fighting. ”"

I have long held A Newspaper in such regard that I refuse to pay for its premium content. The few articles worth reading amongst endless pieces of mundane dross means the economics just don’t stack up. Content about Ardern is freely available as she doesn’t rate premium content in this newspaper, which is quite understandable. With President Trump, it also appears that she doesn’t rate premium time, which is also quite understandable. Compared to the treatment Scott Morrison has just received, our little lady rated a twenty-five-minute chit chat.



According to the NZ Herald Trump asked for the meeting because he was particularly interested in meeting Ardern. I wonder where their source for that startling fact came from? The Washington Post maybe, or the New York Times. Evidently Ardern emerged from the meeting with warm smiles and high praise for Trump. Hypocrite. Or maybe she thought she was in Canada talking to Justin Trudeau.



“President Trump views New Zealand very warmly, views the relationship very warmly and holds New Zealand in very high regard,” she told reporters. Yes, New Zealand, not you sweetie.



“He was interested in everything from tourism to what occurred in Christchurch. We even had a conversation about our gun buyback and the process we had gone through there.” Amazingly, Trump asked her about this unprompted. Are we to assume he normally has someone in attendance telling him what questions to ask? I bet she didn’t let on it’s been a flop.



A free trade deal was also discussed which, according to Jacinda, he’s very enthusiastic about. I wonder if it’s even slightly occurred to her that, being the dealer and trader he is, he might just want a teensy weensy bit in return. Or more likely quite a lot in areas she won’t be happy with like agreements in foreign affairs and defence. I watched a video of her talking to the media after the meeting and as usual, she was full of earnest enunciation and fervent facial contortions.



She delivered the keynote address on climate change in which she stressed that no countries, even non-believers, should cop-out. In her subsequent meeting with Trump then, she should have asked him why the US had not signed up for the Paris Accord. In her speech, she reeled off a whole list of things her Government had announced in the area of climate change and all in just two years. The audience would not have been nearly so impressed had they realised that in reality very little has been implemented.



She talked about March 15 but again she failed to ask Trump why he had not signed up for the Christchurch Call. Here we have a Prime Minister who avoids the hard questions. A Prime Minister who can’t deliver on the job she’s been given. Actions speak louder than words, but this will never happen while we are burdened with a flaky Prime Minister whose most obvious traits appear to be obfuscation domestically and an inability to give New Zealand the presence it deserves on the world stage.

"In the forests of northern Sweden, a major train line cuts through land originally protected for migratory birds – so new seasonal wetlands have been established for the birds nearby. In southern Uganda, a huge hydropower dam has flooded swathes of tropical forest – so degraded forests nearby have been restored and the lands they sit on protected. On the remote, wild shores of the Caspian Sea, a strategic port runs the risk of disturbing threatened seals – so entire islands have been created to ensure the mammals have sufficient habitat.  All of these projects are examples of what’s referred to by planners and developers as biodiversity offsets. But does any of this really make a difference and genuinely prevent new infrastructure from harming biodiversity overall? The idea is simple: to generate biodiversity gains that fully compensate for damage caused by a new development. In theory, it is a last resort, used only after all attempts have been made to avoid, reduce or remedy any loss of wildlife or their habitats.  The goal is to ensure that biodiversity is left no worse off overall than before the development (a so-called “no net loss” policy). In practice, offsets often come in the form of restoring or protecting habitat elsewhere (assuming it would be lost without protection) similar to the one that has been destroyed by the development. It’s much more than a boring technicality in the planning process: biodiversity offsetting is actually a highly controversial and globally-significant biodiversity conservation practice.  In 2018, one of us (Joseph) led the first ever global assessment of biodiversity offsetting in terms of implementation, and the results were astonishing: research found that the total area managed for conservation under biodiversity offsets was roughly 150,000 square kilometres (with large uncertainty around this number because data is difficult to come by) – an area the size of Bangladesh. It also found that most offsets are established because of legal requirements in national regulation, and that most offsets are offsetting impacts within forest ecoregions – more on the significance of that later.  Even more importantly, however, it appears as if the use of offsets is likely to keep on growing, as the underlying driver of why we supposedly need them – the rapid expansion of human impacts on natural ecosystems – continues to increase. At the latest count, 108 countries now have or are developing policies that make provisions for offsetting. So, given that offsetting is emerging as a key tool for mitigating the impacts of increasing human pressures on ecosystems, what is the evidence that they actually work?  To address this question, we recently reviewed with colleagues the actual real-world outcomes of offsetting and no net loss policies around the world. We looked at academic studies from ecosystems spanning streams and wetlands in North America, to European tidal mudflats and ponds, to Australian forests. Our results, published in the journal Conservation Letters, were surprising. We found that around a third of the biodiversity offsets we studied did indeed achieve no net loss. However, these successes occurred in wetland ecosystems like ponds, marshes or streams: we found no evidence that offsets applied in forest systems have successfully achieved no net loss. Recall earlier that two-thirds of all offsets globally were found to be in forest ecosystems. Our study demonstrates that without serious changes in the way offsets are conducted and monitored in these ecologically rich and complex habitats, there is insufficient proof that offsets are enough to achieve no net loss of biodiversity from land clearing. We also found no evidence that offsets which protect ecosystems that might otherwise have been cleared (so called “avoided loss” offsets) have achieved no net loss. This is likely because the biodiversity “gains” from protection were often overestimated – for example, perhaps the offsets were located in an area that was not really under threat, and so protecting it did not significantly reduce the probability of habitat loss. Another important finding was that the way that most studies have measured the outcomes of no net loss policies is by assessing changes in the area of habitats under the jurisdiction of these policies.  From an ecological perspective, this is a somewhat rudimentary way of assessing changes in biodiversity, as it does not distinguish between high-quality, biodiverse habitats and biodiversity-poor habitats. Therefore, information on the “true” biodiversity outcomes of no net loss policies is still in short supply. Returning to our railway in Sweden, our dam in Uganda and our port in Kazakhstan, two things are immediately clear. First, without naming names, the ecological effectiveness of no net loss policies can be highly variable. Second, many developments are crucial to people and their well-being, but come at a cost to nature that must be managed somehow given ongoing global biodiversity declines. In the face of the rapid global increase in human impacts on natural systems, it is essential that we find a way to mitigate the biodiversity losses. With constant adaptive improvements in line with the best science, biodiversity offsets may have an important role to play – but we need to accept that there are significant limits to what offsetting can achieve.

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



In 2016, Sharon Stewart and Dick Quax were re-elected to represent this two councillor ward. Following Quax’s death in May 2018, Paul Young won the resulting by-election.  




[ **David Collings**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9917f043-2f01-446b-9381-b20828b6ad1c&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Collings for Council **$$$**



The electoral officers are getting pretty loose in terms of what they accept to be an affiliation these days. In the information booklet supplied to all candidates it states:



 _The nomination paper provides for a candidate to have an affiliation. An affiliation is described in section 57(3) of the Local Electoral Act 2001 as ‘an endorsement by any organisation or group (whether incorporated or unincorporated).’_



 _A candidate claiming a specific affiliation should supply with their nomination paper an authority to adopt the affiliation for the organisation or group concerned (i.e. letter of consent to use the affiliation from the organisation or group). This is a safety measure to avoid any illegal adoption of affiliations._



 _Affiliations that will not be accepted are ones:_



 _that might cause offence or_



 _are likely to confuse or mislead electors or_



 _are election slogans rather than the name of an organisation or group._



Is there truly an organisation called **‘Collings for Council’** that has given a written authorisation to David Collings to use that affiliation and has he supplied that with his nomination form? If that is the case, why is the [website advertised](http://collingsforcouncil.nz/) in his candidate profile empty? How is it that he is affiliated to C&R for his Local Board and DHB candidacies? There will be plenty more of these suspect affiliations as we get through all the candidates.  




That put aside, Collings has been in local body politics a loooooong time, having spent 3 years on Pakuranga Community Board, 9 years on Manukau City Council and a further 9 years on Howick Local Board. He has been the Chair since 2013, surviving a challenge, temper tantrum and resignation from Lucy Schwaner, wife of infamous Botany MP Jamie Lee Ross in 2016.



While clearly on the centre-right side of the political spectrum, he also holds typically NIMBY views when it comes to development in Howick, saying the ward “needs to protect its’ heritage.”



Stockade Hill, with a ‘viewshaft’ to the Hauraki Gulf continues to be an issue that ignites great passions amongst the locals, even inspiring a [protest song](https://youtu.be/8I-D0YD1ptw). While the ‘viewshaft’ is now protected, a battle continues in the Environment Court to secure the protection of 360-degree views from the top, mandating maximum building heights around the hill. Collings pledges to continue fighting to secure that 360-degree planning restriction.



Collings is on the saner side of transport planning, sceptical of AT plans to implement T2/Bus lanes on major arterial roads, and says he will see the Reeves Road Flyover completed.



Collings also inadvertently elbowed his way into the 2018 controversy over [whether a woman could be hired to play Santa](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/christmas/108841714/santa-stoush-auckland-politician-says-he-prefers-a-santa-with-boobies) in the annual Farmer’s Christmas parade:



 _Howick Local Board chairman David Collings waded into the debate on Saturday morning, saying in a public Facebook post that Farmers was “getting a bit too PC for my liking”._



 _“I don’t think [Baker’s] comments meant any harm. Cripes I would have loved as a kid a Santa with boobies, just like mummy,” he wrote._



 _“Boobies are very important when you’re a young child, they provide comfort. I to this day still remember that comfort.”_



 _He later admitted he was being “a bit silly” over Baker’s “boob” comment._



[ **Damien Light**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=8446fff4-1f7e-4340-9084-a7197d09fb36&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Independent **$$**  




I’ve had several interactions with the former United Future Leader. He’s a genuinely nice guy (probably too bloody nice), with an authentic desire to work for the community, somewhat naively viewing politics as a community service rather than the nasty, petty shit fight for table scraps it really is. Since United Future closed shop, Light has essentially been an unelected, unpaid and very active advocate for Howick, even live-tweeting at local board meetings (which is a bit bloody weird, I think).



Unfortunately for Light, and maybe mankind as a whole, he stands absolutely no chance of being elected to Council in Howick. The area votes solidly blue in local and parliamentary elections, while Light is anything but.



His [website](https://www.damianlight.co.nz/en/my-priorities) contains a respectably detailed outline of his policies; something many other half-arsed troughers standing for election could learn from. For starters, unlike David Collings’, it actually works. Damien wants to stop endless rates rises, challenge reckless spending and drive cost efficiencies. However, just about every candidate uses that sort of language including Phil Goff. Light’s mention of using bonds as an alternative form of funding hints at his liberal-left leanings, though I don’t dispute the current funding model for local government is broken.



On transport, Light is a public transport fanatic, advocating just about every form of communal vehicle and network known to man (plus bikes) and I would put money on him inventing some we haven’t thought of in the near future. 



His green views, including the belief Council needs to achieve a plan to make Auckland carbon neutral before 2050 and support for Council declaring a ‘climate emergency,’ guarantee Damian will not be Howick’s next councillor.



[ **Tofik Mamedov**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e69e9278-78b8-4a94-abd5-aaac0d64cedd&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– East Vision **$**



Being a left-wing immigrant from Azerbaijan running on a ticket called East Vision is a little bit funny. Apparently East isn’t just a coincidental name for a ticket in East Auckland but is also an anagram for Environment, Arts & Culture, Safer Community, Transport.



Tofik’s candidate profile is not particularly informative, but his candidacies for Labour in 2017 and 2014 hint at his politics. Another candidate on the ticket standing for Howick Local Board, Morgan Xiao, is a rabid supporter of the Chinese Communist Party and even [nutty City Vision have spoken out to ](https://tewahanui.nz/politics/city-vision-distances-itself-from-similar-sounding-party-with-chinese-nationalist-candidate)disassociate East Vision with their brand.



[ **Sharon Stewart**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a0818d43-3ddf-4961-af20-a7423160d8ba&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Independent **$$$$$**  




Stewart is a legend in East Auckland, having served on Manukau City Council since 1998 then topping the polls in the first Supercity election in 2010. As Citizens and Ratepayers (now known as Communities & Residents) collapsed around Albert-Eden councillor Christine Fletcher’s ears, Howick Councillors Stewart and Dick Quax ditched the mouldy brand to stand as Independents, being re-elected unopposed in 2013. ****



Sharon Stewart is a woman of strong political principle, unyielding in her fight to oppose rates increases, stupid spending and the centre-left council majority. There has always been a small and stubborn bloc of councillors opposing first Brown, then Goff on Council and Stewart has always been on its vanguard.



Stewart absolutely deserves to stay on as the Councillor for Howick, but the voters in her ward know that already.



[ **Paul Young**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b4e67313-d263-4728-80f1-e8e6f79d4ad4&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Independent **$$$**  




I’m a bit ‘meh’ on the other incumbent councillor for Howick. He has only held the seat for about a year, since winning the by-election resulting from the death of the legendary Dick Quax, so maybe I just need to see a bit more.



His candidate profile has just two “priorities.” The first; a public transport system featuring trackless trams running on roads with rubber wheels looks loony but it is clear Young hasn’t sought the help of a marketing guru to sell this idea. His other priority, law and order is a predictable offering that will go down well with his constituency, but I’m not sure how many “ever more CCTV cameras” actually is and it creeps me out a bit. 



Young was the wildcard in the 2011 Botany by-election, finishing third as the New Citizen Party candidate and then later stood for the Conservative Party. Before being elected, he has had a successful business career, running Paul Young International, something few around the Council table can claim.



 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** You may cast up to 2 votes in this FPP contest

"Rebecca Willis has done a great service in confirming that there has long been a deeply rooted socially constructed silence on climate change among MPs (‘I don’t want to be seen as a zealot’: what MPs really think about the climate crisis, Long read, 21 May). However, there is a silence within that silence: namely the refusal of MPs who do engage with climate change to acknowledge it as first and foremost a global issue, and not merely an international or even national one. It is no longer tenable for the world to rely solely on individual countries such as the UK to blaze trails towards net-zero emissions in the hope that others will voluntarily follow at their own pace. World leaders need to wake up to the looming security threats from burning fossil fuels (and forests) and start tackling them at their sources – in the first instance by setting enforceable controls on extraction of fossil fuels, akin to controls on nuclear arms.  Perhaps this is the “story on climate change” that Rebecca Willis discerns to be lacking on the political right (although its few advocates so far seem to be on the left). It need not be in conflict with the left’s desire for a “green new deal”, or any sane person’s wish for a sustainable world beyond the Covid-19 crisis.Hugh RichardsStroud, Gloucestershire • Rebecca Willis’s excellent article portrays clearly why our government is unlikely to lead the world by example during its presidency role for the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26). Ministers know that people will only vote for things that they want. With Covid-19, the public have willingly sacrificed many rights and liberties because the threat to their health and wellbeing has been repeatedly explained. But the government consistently fails to explain that the world is headed for warming well in excess of the safe limit of 1.5 degrees which was identified in the IPCC special report in 2018. We need degrowth, with regard to both population and all those non-essential indulgences that come with a significant carbon footprint. Already the UK cannot sustain its growing population with its own resources. If told the truth, the public will be selfless and courageous. We cannot negotiate with physics, we cannot say: “Hold on, we’re dealing with another crisis.” While the government continues to seek a return to business as usual, we are failing to set an example for other world leaders. An honest public awareness campaign, led by a cross-party emergency UK government and the media, would lead the way for the world at Cop26. Thank you, Guardian, for your courage and honesty in reporting climate and environmental issues.Barbara WilliamsLong Hanborough, Oxfordshire • Rebecca Willis’s article struck me as just not long enough. It revealed much about the shortsightedness of British politicians and citizens alike, and of the masters of British capitalism. The Nobel-winning Al Gore (unmentioned by Ms Willis) has the grasp and vision needed to tackle climate change; Keir Starmer promises to match those qualities.Jinty NelsonLondon • Rebecca Willis’s in-depth article is enlightening and disturbing. It is an important exposé of how democracy is addressed, or not, in parliament and a wakeup call to the serious mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians. I commend it to all who have children, as the planet we will leave them is in serious jeopardy.Richard VernonOxford"
"What if it had just fizzled out? What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? The infection might have been traced to animal carcasses piled in a seafood market’s lanes, and after they were destroyed – and experts issued their usual warnings that a more serious outbreak was inevitable – the coronavirus story might have ended. What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments. In the middle of the night in Baghdad, on 3 January, a US drone fired the most consequential shot in the Middle East in a generation, killing 10 people including Qassem Suleimani, leader of the expeditionary force of Iran’s Revolution Guards. The 62-year-old general had been a thorn in the side of the American-led occupation of Iraq, overseeing the Islamic republic’s campaign in Syria and nurturing proxies that turned Iran into a regional player. He was thought to be untouchable. Donald Trump marked his killing with a wordless tweet of a grainy American flag. The chaotic days following the killing involved a deadly crush at one of the general’s public funerals, Iran’s first ever missile strikes on US troops, the accidental shooting down of a passenger jet over Tehran – killing all 176 aboard – and an outburst of anti-regime protests in Iranian cities. The reverberations may be felt for years: nearly all the regional projects Suleimani was overseeing when he died have faltered, the Observer reported this month, and the al-Quds force is struggling to manage its network of proxies without his giant presence. The largest swarms of locusts in decades have descended on farms in parts of Africa, south Asia and the Arabian peninsula this year, posing “an extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods”, according to the UN. The pests form vast, destructive clouds that can travel about 55 miles (90km) in 24 hours. A swarm about a square kilometre large can consume the same quantity of food in a day as 35,000 people. The risk of second waves is said to still be critical, including in Yemen, where food security is already dire amid the ongoing civil war. Hostility towards Indian Muslims has crept further into the Indian mainstream in the past five years since the country’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected. In February, it boiled over during a state visit by Donald Trump, culminating in the country’s worst religious violence in decades. The catalyst was widely acknowledged to be a ruling party leader, Kapil Mishra, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum that if the police did not clear the streets of mostly Muslim protesters, his supporters would be “forced to hit the streets”. At least 50 were killed in the ensuing violence between Hindu and Muslim mobs, amid allegations that the Delhi police stood back to allow Hindus to commit violence while beating to death some of the Muslim men in their custody. The riots and killings contributed to growing unease about the kind of India that may emerge from Modi’s years in power. After nearly 19 years, more than 43,000 civilian casualties and three US presidents, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban on a Saturday afternoon in late February. It was a good deal for the Taliban: they managed to exclude elected officials in Kabul and deal with the Americans directly. On paper, US troops could be gone from the country by spring 2021. The Taliban have promised to sit down with their Afghan government counterparts and make a separate peace deal later, but there is no guarantee they will do so, and their attacks on the Afghan army and police continue. The US says the ongoing violence means their troops may stay, but it is clear, not least to the Taliban, that Washington is desperate to get out of the war. For a few days after Bernie Sanders swept the Las Vegas Democratic primary, it appeared that a self-described “democratic socialist” was going to win the nomination of a major American party. Instead, the Democratic establishment rallied behind former vice-president Joe Biden, the campaign’s standard-bearer for the liberalism of the Obama and Clinton eras. Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday and soon after clinched the nomination, but there was no victory tour, nor conciliatory rallies with his opponents. Instead, the 77-year-old appeared to vanish from view as the scale of the coronavirus emergency finally broke through to policymakers and the public. He is currently campaigning from the basement of his Delaware home. On 6 February, an Argentine weather station on Antarctica’s northern tip recorded a temperature of 18.4C (65.1F) – roughly the same as Los Angeles that day, Nasa noted.  It was part of the longest stretch of warm weather ever recorded on the continent, a nine-day heatwave that melted 20% of one island’s snow cover. “I haven’t seen melt ponds develop this quickly in Antarctica,” Mauri Pelto, a glaciologist at Nichols College, told Nasa’s Earth Observatory. “You see these kinds of melt events in Alaska and Greenland, but not usually in Antarctica.” The freak temperatures were attributed to the confluence of warmer than average sea surfaces, a high pressure system over South America and a warming phenomenon known as the foehn effect. They come against a backdrop of another looming crisis: an almost 3C temperature increase on the Antarctic peninsula over the past 50 years, part of a pattern of unusual weather events associated with global heating, including Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season. A legislative change in Sudan could improve the lives of millions of women. About 87% of girls and women in the country have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), according to the UN. Most are cut between the ages of five and 14. Campaigners in April hailed the passage of a new law that makes the practice punishable by up to three years in prison, but were sober about its impact. The practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture and will take time to be eradicated entirely. “There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,” Fatma Naib, a Unicef communication officer in Sudan, told the Guardian. A dawn raid in a Paris suburb in May snared one of the world’s most wanted men. Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy Rwandan businessman, is accused of creating and funding the notorious Interahamwe militia that carried out the 1994 killings of about 800,000 people in less than three months. His radio station, the Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, allegedly helped lay the groundwork for the genocide with its relentless dehumanisation of the Tutsi population. “You have missed some of the enemies,” it said in one notorious broadcast during the killings. “You must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full.” A 2003 attempt to capture Kabuga in Nairobi ended with the mysterious death of the man who was supposed to give up his location. French police said the 84-year-old had also spent time in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. He is yet to enter a plea in a French or international court, but his lawyers said last week that he had the right to be presumed innocent. The fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African American, as he jogged in a coastal city in the US state of Georgia in February, initially received little national attention. The two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in self-defence. Police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case. That changed with the 5 May release of a video depicting Arbery’s last moments. The man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street. He reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear. A struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off. The last scene shows Arbery dying in the street. The shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting, and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities, and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths. Once a fringe notion espoused by Israel’s far right, the idea the Jewish state would simply declare swaths of the Palestinian territories – where its settlements have been proliferating for decades – its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream. It may soon become Israeli law. The new governing alliance of Benjamin Netanyahu and his former election rival Benny Gantz, plans to advance legislation in the next few months aimed at eventually declaring about 30% of the occupied West Bank to be Israeli territory, in line with the “peace plan” released by Trump in January – and roundly rejected by Palestinian leaders. The Trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with Palestinian leaders, but it is unclear what conditions – if any – the White House would impose on the Netanyahu-Gantz government. The annexation was “an Israeli decision”, Mike Pompeo said recently. European leaders, the UN and scores of retired Israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan, arguing that it would isolate Israel and pour petrol on the volatile region. It would also signal the death of the two-state solution, the 1994 outline for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations, but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years. Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault in a landmark trial. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’s phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message sent by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, according to digital forensics experts. A man described as “Britain’s most prolific rapist” was convicted in January. The court heard that Reynhard Sinaga may have assaulted at least 159 men over several years by luring them to his house and drugging them. Warring leaders in the world’s newest country, South Sudan, signed a fragile peace deal in February. The UK formally left the European Union on 31 January."
"**Fifteen further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in Northern Ireland bringing the Department of Health's recorded total to 1,011.**
Seven of the deaths occurred within the current reporting period, with eight outside it.
Health Minister Robin Swann said Tuesday's death toll was a ""sad milestone"" for Northern Ireland.
He also says the health service is ""primed"" and ""ready"" to deliver a vaccination safely and systematically.
Mr Swann said an effective vaccine was the biggest breakthrough since the pandemic began but that delivery will not be fast.
""There is no way around this and there is no quick fix,"" he said.
""We expect it to take many months before the vaccination programme is complete and we need to recognise that we are not through this yet.""
Health service staff will begin receiving a vaccine later this month.
Patricia Donnelly, head of the Covid-19 vaccine programme, says Northern Ireland is ""good to go"" from 14 December, pending the necessary approval of vaccines.
The department's daily figure is based on a positive test result having been recorded in the previous 28 days.
A further 391 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.
Mr Swann said the new death toll was another ""harsh reminder"" of the threat of coronavirus and said people should not ""delude themselves"" by thinking otherwise.
""We always have to remember that we are not talking about statistics but much-loved people who are desperately missed.
""No-one should underestimate the virus, or delude themselves that it could never affect them.""
He said a ""small and vociferous minority"" continued to try and play down its risk.
Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster met Mr Swann on Tuesday, ahead of an executive meeting on Thursday.
Ms O'Neill said they were working through detail of plans for the Christmas period and this needed to include plans for visiting arrangements at care homes.
""It won't be a normal Christmas and our guiding principle should be what is the advice of health officials,"" she added.
People from three households in Northern Ireland will be allowed to meet indoors for five days over the Christmas period.
NI's chief medical officer says surpassing a death toll of 1,000 is a ""grim reminder"" that Covid-19 is a ""very serious infection"".
Although Dr Michael Bride described the prospect of a vaccine as ""encouraging"", he also warned members of the public not to become complacent.
""That will not begin to do the heavy lifting until the spring,"" he said.
""It is only when we have those who are extremely clinically vulnerable, those older people vaccinated in sufficient numbers, that we will see the reduction on pressures on our health service, reduction in deaths and that we can begin to, with some confidence, look back to restrictions as increasingly a thing of the past.
""But, that is not today, that is not tomorrow, not next month.""
On Tuesday Northern Ireland hospitals were at 100% occupancy, with 419 inpatients with Covid-19, of whom 38 are in ICU, according to the Department of Health.
There have been 52, 856 positive cases in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began, with 2,523 people testing positive in the last seven days.
Tougher lockdown measures came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday 27 November, which are set to expire on 11 December.
In the Republic of Ireland, another 18 Covid-19 related deaths have been reported, bringing the death toll to 2,069, according to the Irish Department of Health.
A further 269 new cases of Covid-19 were also recorded in the country, bringing the total number to 72,798."

UPDATE: graph of damage losses including 2012 posted below. It says all that needs to be said.
This ad is running in rotation at the NYT today, and it needs an application of Dr. Roger Pielke Jr.’s handy bullshit button.


Steve Milloy writes at junkscience.com:
Insurers know that bad weather comes and goes… and after it comes, it’s not likely to come again for a long time… that’s why they’re called “100-year” storms.
Click for the Hartford’s “Weathering the Storm” web site.
There at that website they write:
Superstorm Sandy devastates the east coast with heavy winds and storm surges that flood major cities and shorelines while dumping record snow in West Virginia and knocking out power as far away as Cleveland, OH.
…
Unpredictable weather seems to be the new norm.
I call BS on that last sentence.

Sandy was not only predicted, many meteorologists nailed the path well in advance.  In fact, some have called it ‘Their finest hour’:
From CCM Mike Smith:
Here is the European computer model’s forecast made at 2pm last Wednesday. It shows a hurricane near the coast of New Jersey or DelMarVa yesterday evening. The computer models showed more and more of the details of this ferocious storm as the time grew nearer.

The U.S. models didn’t do well, at first, taking the storm out to sea. But, human forecasters at AccuWeather and elsewhere put their knowledge and experience to work and leaned on the European heavily to get preliminary warnings and preparatory advice 4.5 days in advance. Those forecasts stayed consistent and got more detailed as time passed. By Saturday, we were predicting the flooding of the subway and two airports in NYC.
You’d think The Hartford insurance group would have experts for this and would have looked at the IPCC SREX report. But then again, they may just be out for gouging profiting at the expense of the stupid.
Dr Roger Pielke Jr observes:
===============================================================
The full IPCC Special Report on Extremes is out today, and I have just gone through the sections in Chapter 4 that deal with disasters and climate change. Kudos to the IPCC — they have gotten the issue just about right, where “right” means that the report accurately reflects the academic literature on this topic. Over time good science will win out over the rest — sometimes it just takes a little while.
A few quotable quotes from the report (from Chapter 4):


“There is medium evidence and high agreement that long-term trends in normalized losses have not been attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change”


“The statement about the absence of trends in impacts attributable to natural or anthropogenic climate change holds for tropical and extratropical storms and tornados”


“The absence of an attributable climate change signal in losses also holds for flood losses”


The report even takes care of tying up a loose end that has allowed some commentators to avoid the scientific literature:
“Some authors suggest that a (natural or anthropogenic) climate change signal can be found in the records of disaster losses (e.g., Mills, 2005; Höppe and Grimm, 2009), but their work is in the nature of reviews and commentary rather than empirical research.”
He was prescient with this:
You may find yourself having to use the bullshit button in locations that are supposed to be credible, such as Nature Climate Change and the New York Times.
But, I’ll bet he didn’t think it would be used on advertising.
===============================================================
If I were a Hartford customer, I’d be on the phone with my agent, and not to order additional insurance.
UPDATE: Pielke Jr. adds this. 2012 was no Katrina year.

The graph above shows an updated estimate of the 1900 to 2012 normalized hurricane losses for the United States. The normalization methodology is described in Pielke et al. 2008 (here in PDF) and the data presented in the graph comes from the ICAT Damage Estimator, which extends the analysis of Pielke at al. through 2011.

 **Auckland Mayoralty**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



I had initially planned to complete all the ward contests before moving on to the Auckland Mayoralty, but that meant it may not be completed until early October. Due to the Mayoral race being the only contest that every Auckland voter participates in, I think getting this published next is the right thing to do.



As of September 26, just 3.19% of votes have been counted. At the same stage in 2016, it was 5.79%



The scheduled ward and some local board races will resume following my article on the Auckland Mayoralty; starting with Devonport-Takapuna Local Board then Orakei ward and local board races.  




[ **Tricia Cheel**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=37655be1-da03-42db-8e1c-1d37ea62f0b6&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– STOP Trashing Our Planet[ ****](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=37655be1-da03-42db-8e1c-1d37ea62f0b6&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)  




So far this election, I’ve never rated any candidate higher than 4 clowns. Congratulations Tricia Cheel on becoming the first to get a **5 clown rating!** For every loony, unscientific, paranoid conspiracy you can think of Tricia has so many more that you could never imagine.



Cheel also wants to ban fluoride, 5G and genetic engineering. She is vocally opposed to vaccines. Will be interesting to see how her vote in South Auckland compares to the rest of the country. If that didn’t trigger enough laughs, check out these:  




[The coalition’s website laying out the platform for STOP Trashing Our Planet.](https://stop366.wordpress.com/)



[The chemical braindrain.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/philippe-grandjean/)



[The Dangers of 5G](https://www.facebook.com/5GFreeNewZealand/)



[ **Michael Coote**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=79c4049e-3121-467f-b398-2641c846d879&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– Independent **$**



Coote has just one priority if elected Mayor of Auckland. That is strictly equal treatment of all races by Auckland Council. He targets special rights and privileges granted to Maori first and foremost.



In principle I agree with him but there are two reasons why I hesitate to give him a ringing endorsement. Firstly, the Council has no power to remove the Independent Maori Statutory Board, it exists as a consequence of central government legislation. Secondly, organisations set up for the purpose of implementing racial equality such as 1 Law 4 All, Hobson’s Pledge etc. tend to attract nasty racist white people. I’ll probably attract a bit of flak for saying so, but I’ve associated with enough groups and people interested in that issue and they quickly become riddled with genuine racists.



Coote is also running in Waitakere ward, so I had a look at his profile to see if there is anything else that interests him. Just dogs. He is really anti-dog. I sympathise a little but hating dogs is not a tenable campaign platform.



[ **David Feist**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=0f71d784-540f-4378-a95f-8843672a1b02&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– LiftNZ **$$$$**



Feist is using the mayoral race to launch a new political party called [LiftNZ](https://www.liftnz.org.nz/). The policies are actually pretty good but have really been written with a central government election in mind. It is not currently a registered party.



Feist opposes the current compact city model Council planners have been pushing since the super city formation. Feist will abolish the urban boundary, permit housing on rural land, encourage targeted rates and widen motorways (not a Council responsibility). 



He would like to draft a new Unitary Plan with affordable housing as it’s main priority. The plan will have a “price trigger” inserted so more land is automatically released when rural land just outside the boundary is 20% more expensive than land just inside the boundary. I think he’s gotten a bit confused – land inside the boundary is 8 times the price of land outside. Maybe he should just stick with the original, sensible urban boundary abolition.



He will also allow residential subdivision on all land zoned rural in Auckland.



[ **Genevieve Forde**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5a6f9a7b-67e8-4f94-9cde-fef0e52bc624&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=) ****



Genevieve looks one of those nosey neighbours who sticks their head over the fence to complain when your grass grows a bit too high.



The number one concern she has is the climate and she wants to create a plan that will reduce GHG emissions 45% by 2030 as the UN advocates.



She wants to achieve this by marginalising private cars, providing free public transport, electric buses and more safe priority lanes for bikes. By Marginalising cars, she means a 30km/h speed limit everywhere unless you’re driving a bus, except schools and hospitals which will be 5 km/h. OMFG, Are hospitals causing car accidents? Lime Scooters will be banned.



There will be a train to the greenhouse gas producing airport after the CRL is finished, then a train over the harbour bridge. A TRAIN OVER THE HARBOUR BRIDGE!



She also wants to protect Auckland’s environment by leaving Chamberlain Park as it currently is. Golf courses aren’t actually good for the environment so I wonder if she literally means leaving it as it currently is and removing golfers.



No concrete, sediment or untreated sewage in the ocean. Banning all plastic bags and drink bottles with zero waste to landfill. She also wants to plant native trees everywhere (on Chamberlain Park or not?), return Ihumatao to Maori guardianship (destroying the entire Treaty settlement process), stop all cruelty to sentient beings (need a lot more detail on what that could mean) and provide homes for all homeless people. Apparently, this is a “more humane, feminist attitude.” 



I initially felt a little bad about saying Genevieve Ford looks like a nosey neighbour sticking her head over the fence. Not any more.



[ **Phil Goff**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=761e0967-f8a3-4172-a310-3ea0ff04a863&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– Independent **$$**



Len Brown with his pants on isn’t the worst Mayor Auckland has had. That was Len Brown. Rates increases have been capped at 2.5% as Goff promised in 2016 but he has no intention of doing that if re-elected. He claims to have saved hundreds of millions of dollars through improved efficiency in the Council. “Hundreds of millions” is one of those phrases people use when they actually have no idea what the figure is.



Kinda like this excerpt from his [website](https://www.philgoff.org.nz/about) where I have no idea what he is saying 



“In 2016, we set out to plan to million years to make our city greener and combat the effects of climate change. This year, we will supersede that number.”



His other policies are a review of the performance of CCOs. AT is barely accountable and it was Phil Goff who removed councillors from the board of AT. He wants to plant 1.5 million trees over the next three years. He will reduce the cost of public transport for children, costing $4.1m a year. From 2020 the Council will only purchase electric or hybrid cars. All cleaners contracted to Auckland Council will be paid the Living Wage of $21.15 and work to end homelessness by identifying every homeless person by name and target services to those individuals.



This isn’t ground-breaking or revolutionary stuff. This isn’t visionary blue sky thinking. It’s minor window dressing.



On September 9, a [complaint related to Phil Goff’s 2016 electoral return was lodged with the Chief Electoral Officer. ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/115795846/auckland-mayoral-election-complaint-lodged-over-phil-goffs-2016-election-expenses)John Tamihere says it hasn’t come from his campaign “We know nothing and you have a cheek to cast aspersions, but not surprising.”



I was unlikely to support Goff but after looking at his website, I can’t understand why anybody else would either.

Alezix is also running for Albany ward and Hibiscus & Bays Local Board. Disappointingly she has just used the same candidate profile for each. Lazy.  
  
I’ll just link to the crazy [2016 Auckland Mayoral debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFR6QNjYzAg). She’s the lady in orange.

Jannaha Henry isn’t a politician but at least she isn’t motivated by identity politics. She’s just putting her hand up. She’s on LinkedIn if you want to know more.  
  
I don’t.

John has taught English in Universities for 10 years, which is quite surprising. He has been a representative for global companies and has extensive experience in government sectors in Auckland.



He knows what Aucklanders need and want. He’s not telling us though. His [website](https://www.johnhong4mayor.com/) does a good job of giving the impression that I got from his corflute signs. He looks like a politician standing for election in a democratic but highly authoritarian country like Singapore.



His campaign videos are…[different.](https://www.johnhong4mayor.com/post/choose-john-hong-choose-your-future-%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E6%B4%AA%E6%89%BF%E7%90%9B%E3%80%81%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E6%82%A8%E6%9C%AA%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%81)

Ted kinda reminds me of a brash, hard-arsed Republican politician. That image is hurt a bit by his A3 hand painted, recycled signs. [You can see him](https://www.facebook.com/tedformayor.johnston.3) hammering these into the ground with a giant hammer, wearing a vest. It’s a pretty cool look.



He’s a 58 year old criminal lawyer from Otara, who stood for TOP in 2017. He wants to ban bikes from the city to reduce congestion, a rapid frequent rail system that takes people where they want to go and set up giant warehouses for homeless people in South Auckland so they would have somewhere to eat, shower and sleep.



Johnston also wants an amnesty for the parking and bus lane tickets issued by Auckland Transport.

Kruger has run for Mayor several times. As far as I can see, she does it to promote her self-help courses rather than actually get elected. Her candidate profile links you to [susannakruger.co.nz](http://susannakruger.co.nz/)



The website for [Justice for Families](http://justiceforfamilies.org.nz/) links you to more of these courses. Manurewa-Papakura candidate Veronica Turner is also promoting some of her own.



It’s pretty pathetic.

In what threatened to be a two-horse race, Craig Lord has worked very hard to set himself up as the underdog third candidate. His campaign platform began as being proudly policy free, though he seems to have moved away from that as the election moved into voting mode. He is running a very professional campaign and invested in an [attractive website.](https://www.craiglord.nz/)



Quoting Dr Ben Carson “We’ve been conditioned to think that only politicians can solve our problems. But at some point, maybe we will wake up and recognise that it was politicians who created our problems.”



He wants council to forget about the niceties and focus on the necessities. Instead of increasing rates, get smarter about financial operations. Lord advocates building a waste to energy plant, stop building park n rides in favour of [comb parking towers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCX349hPtpk). Fuel tax is a blunt and regressive instrument, Lord would start a conversation about replacing it with an electronic tolling system.



He also says the building consents process needs a reset and review of the fines for breaches while finding better processes to control rogue developers and builders.



I like him. He’s certainly in the top tier of candidates in 2019.

B, as his friends call him, thinks we urgently need to find a better way to deal with plastic. He will build roads from it.



He didn’t want to run for Mayor but couldn’t wait for someone suitable to do it. [He is a roading](http://www.b4mayor.org.nz/index.html) candidate, but one who wants to use plastic waste to build roads. Could he bring car lovers and environmentalists together into a giant coalition and win the mayoralty?



No.

Nobody will ever believe Nguyen is going to demilitarise the waterfront if he keeps using Kim Jong Un’s barber. He ran in 2016 on a platform of building tidal power generators.



In 2019, he has 5 general resolutions for the governing of Auckland Transport. They include words and phrases such as Liberate the Auckland Waterfront, demilitarize the harbour, withdrawing all heavy military hardware and weapon systems. Evacuate all ordnance and explosive. Complete troops withdraw by 2030. Liberate the airspace above Devonport for public transport.



It sounds like he is taking the piss but I don’t think he is.

Phil has been running for Mayor for a long time. I don’t know how long but he beat me by a slim margin in 2004. It is the same modus operandi every time. No face pic. Refuse all interviews. Attend no debates. Put up no signs. Campaign against abortion for a position that has nothing to do with abortion.

When New Zealand tries to do a kiwi version of something overseas, we do it on a lower budget, less dramatic music, NZ accents and a much smaller prize pool. Wheel of Fortune, Sale of the Century, Family Feud, Keeping Straight (our $10,000 prize copy of $100,000 prize Fear Factor).



Our comedians are similar. Jono and Ben, Guy Williams… He calls himself a comedian…I suppose his Dad might. 



I hadn’t really seen any of Tom Sainsbury’s stuff prior to the Mayoral race though I understand he had previously impersonated Paula Bennett. He is standing for Mayor as Fiona, the wine reviewer.[ It’s quite good.](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=536959526795103)



“I’ll give running the city a good go. I think raising three children has given me a lot of know-how. I haven’t worked a job, per se, as my Stanley was the breadwinner, but I helped him with his books occasionally, so I know a little about finances.”



That is literally what some local board candidate profiles look like.



The clown rating isn’t meant to be complimentary. It’s meant to be mean. The dollar sign rating isn’t really appropriate either. Smiley face rating?  




[ **Glen Snelgar**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=eda56aeb-7adb-4255-8092-e2cff3ef8dc7&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– Old Skool 



I never really wanted to comment on people’s appearance but for the Mayoral race, I’ve done it multiple times. Glen’s picture looks like one of those computerised wanted criminal images the police create. 



Glen is promising to freeze rates, claiming the policy is so popular it has been copied by other candidates. [On his website](http://oldskool.nz/) he says his policy is to cap rates, not freeze them, so rates will go down. Confused? He is.



Wai te Mata is an ancient riverbed flooded by seawater. A new agency, _environment auckland,_ will map the seafloor to determine the historical extent of the riverbed. Then it will be reserved for aquatic recreation and excluded from any other development except new harbour bridges.



He would like to build a museum on the waterfront called Te Mata made out of floor to ceiling smoke-glass that mimics Auckland’s obsidian glass. However, he promises not to do that because it is a vanity project.



He will also scrap the 11.5c fuel tax.



[Snelgar was an honours student of Dr Paul Buchanan at Auckland University.](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10456689) He emailed the lecturer asking for notes because work commitments prevented him from attending the first day of a military politics course. Buchanan told him he was not a suitable student if he could not make it to the first class and told him he should drop the paper.

I hope it is OK to call him Tim. Tim wants to raise funds through local bonds rather than selling assets. Isn’t raising bonds just borrowing money? 



Tim likes the Old Council Flats at the bottom of Western Park. He wants to build more, using Local Bonds, for Aucklanders to ‘rent to buy.’



He also wants to use Ports of Auckland land to create a world class waterfront by making Ports of Auckland invest in NorthPort.



[ **John Tamihere**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=68f84c52-138f-437e-95e1-56c3787c4bd3&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– JT for Mayor.co.nz **$$$$$**



Tamihere shoots from the lip and sometimes it gets him in trouble. Actually, it gets him in a lot of trouble, a lot. His sacking from cabinet by Helen Clark was the first time I’d heard of ‘front bum.’



John has accomplished a lot outside of politics, in his career as a barrister he argued cases in front of the Privy Council, eventually working for the Maori Land Court and the Department of Maori Affairs. In 1991 he became the Chief Executive of the Waipareira Trust, providing health and education services to Auckland Maori and he was elected back onto the board after leaving Parliament in 2005. He’s also been selected as Person of the Year by the Sunday Star Times, New Zealander of the Year by North & South and Man of the Year by Metro magazine.



JT is a divisive figure, with supporters as passionate as his opponents, due to his blunt and outspoken style. In Maori politics, Tamihere has been an advocate for urban Maori who often don’t have any links to tribal iwi, labelled by Tamihere as “feudal tribal structures” and dominated by elites. Tamihere says Maori need to “take responsibility for our own actions” rather than “blame others for our failure.” It would be easier to write a list of the people Tamihere hasn’t offended. I’d be on it.



Tamihere has injected excitement into 2019’s Mayoral election with his candidacy which it bloody needed. Previous challengers to the incumbent have been John Palino, Vic Crone and Mark Thomas, none of whom have brought the energy to the race JT has.



He might have been a Labour party man for many years and if it were the 1980s that would make sense but in 2019 the Labour brand has nothing in common with John.



Tamihere has unveiled some really bold and innovative ideas which have been measured, costed and are workable. Freezing taxes might make the existing Mayor and Councillors baulk, but it can be done if you’re not a flimsy ‘efficiency finding’ seat warmer. I ran on a rates cutting platform in 2013 and 2016 before withdrawing due to the overcrowding of candidates on the right. The sums added up then and John Tamihere has done that this time.



Plans to sell 49% of Watercare and Ports of Auckland while retaining ownership of the land the ports sit on will also generate extra funds for Council instead of repeatedly screwing the Auckland ratepayer. [Ports of Auckland paid $60m for 3 new cranes ](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/09/auckland-ratepayers-to-miss-out-on-at-least-100-million-after-much-touted-ports-of-auckland-cranes-go-unused.html)it hasn’t been able to use yet, resulting in the dividend paid to Auckland Council dropping by $100m. 



The proposal to turn the Harbour bridge into an 18 lane double decker with bus and rail added has been sneered at by biased reporters on the Herald (looking at you Simon Wilson) and criticised by Goff as unaffordable with a $10 billion price tag. Sources within the Tamihere camp ridicule that figure which has been costed by professional transport engineers as closer to $2b. Removing public transport from private transport on different levels will also remove additional pinch points on the motorway leading to the bridge.



Additionally JT has a plan to pay for the additional roading infrastructure using congestion charges and electronic road pricing. That’s the fair way to pay for roads instead of the regressive regional fuel tax, another soon to be casualty if John wins.



The tram from nowhere which hasn’t got anywhere but would ruin Dominion Rd will be scrapped under a Tamihere mayoralty. If you visit the Mt. Roskill shops on the intersection of Mt Albert and Dominion Rd, the tram has already destroyed local business areas and construction is still yet to start.



John Tamihere is a maverick and a straight shooter. He isn’t going to play backroom politics or follow in the footsteps of earlier dullards. Shake it Up and Sort it Out is his campaign slogan and I’m confident that is exactly what he will do.



[ **Peter Vaughan**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=d4ebb7d3-127f-4b5c-a307-8bcc68e67716&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=) ****



I’d heard Vaughan was a numerologist, which is a bit strange though up until writing this article I figured he was sane.

He won an egg and spoon race but he isn’t going to win the Mayoralty. He wants to stop Round Up, 1080 and 5G.



5G is like 4G but better. 4G was an improvement on 3G. Before 3G was the equally terrifying but absolutely safe 2G. All that stays the same is the crowds of loopies who think it causes brain cancer. They survive because they lack the one thing brain cancer needs.



His first priority as Mayor will be to get all Councillors and senior executives to introduce themselves to one another if they don’t all die from 5G first.

I am Patrick J. Michaels, Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit, non‐​partisan public policy research institute located here in Washington DC, and Cato is my sole source of employment income. Before I begin my testimony, I would like to make clear that my comments are solely my own and do not represent any official position of the Cato Institute.



My testimony concerns the selective science that underlies the Obama Administration's determination of the Social Cost of Carbon and how a more inclusive and considered process would have resulted in a lower value for the social cost of carbon.



Earlier this month, the Administration's Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon (IWG) released a report that was a response to public comments of the IWG determination of the social cost of carbon that were solicited by the Office of Management and Budget in November 2013. Of the 140 unique set of comments received (including a set of my own from which this testimony in drawn), the IWG adopted none.



Here, I address why this decision was based on a set of flimsy, internally inconsistent excuses and amounts to a continuation of the IWG's exclusion of the most relevant science—an exclusion which assures that low, or even negative values of the social cost of carbon (which would imply a net benefit of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels), do not find their way into cost/benefit analyses of proposed federal actions. If, in fact, the social cost of carbon were near zero, it would eliminate the justification for any federal action (greenhouse gas emissions regulations, ethanol mandates, miles per gallon standards, solar/wind subsidies, DoE efficiency regulations, etc.) geared towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions.



 _Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity_



In May 2013, the Interagency Working Group produced an updated SCC value by incorporating revisions to the underlying three Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) used by the IWG in its initial 2010 SCC determination. But, at that time, the IWG did not update the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) employed in the IAMs. This was not done, despite there having been, since January 1, 2011, at least 14 new studies and 20 experiments (involving more than 45 researchers) examining the ECS, each lowering the best estimate and tightening the error distribution about that estimate. Instead, the IWG wrote in its 2013 report: ""It does not revisit other interagency modeling decisions (e.g., with regard to the discount rate, reference case socioeconomic and emission scenarios, or equilibrium climate sensitivity).""



This decision was reaffirmed by the IWG in July 2015. But, through its reaffirmation, the IWG has again refused to give credence to and recognize the importance of what is now becoming mainstream science—that the most likely value of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower than that used by the IWG and that the estimate is much better constrained. This situation has profound implications for the determination of the SCC and yet continues to be summarily dismissed by the IWG.



The earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity is defined by the IWG in its 2010 report (hereafter, IWG2010) as ""the long-term increase in the annual global-average surface temperature from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration relative to pre-industrial levels (or stabilization at a concentration of approximately 550 parts per million (ppm))"" and is recognized as ""a key input parameter"" for the integrated assessment models used to determine the social cost of carbon.



The IWG2010 report has an entire section (Section III.D) dedicated to describing how an estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the scientific uncertainties surrounding its actual value are developed and incorporated in the IWG's analysis. The IWG2010, in fact, developed its own probability density function (pdf) for the ECS and used it in each of the three IAMs, superseding the ECS pdfs used by the original IAMs developers. The IWG's intent was to develop an ECS pdf which most closely matched the description of the ECS as given in the _Fourth Assessment Report_ of the United Nation's Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change which was published in 2007.



The functional form adopted by the IWG2010 was a calibrated version of Roe and Baker (2007) distribution. It was described in the IWG2010 report in the following Table and Figure (from the IWG2010 report):









The calibrated Roe and Baker functional form used by the IWG2010 is _no longer scientifically defensible_ ; nor was it at the time of the publication of the IWG 2013 SCC update, nor at the time of the July 2015 update.



The figure below vividly illustrates this fact, as it compares the best estimate and 90% confidence range of the earth's ECS as used by the IWG (calibrated Roe and Baker) against findings in the scientific literature published since January 1, 2011.



Whereas the IWG ECS distribution has a median value of 3.0°C and 5th and 95th percentile values of 1.72°C and 7.14°C, respectively, the corresponding values averaged from the recent scientific literature are 2.0°C (median), 1.1°C (5th percentile), and 3.5°C (95th percentile).



These differences will have large and significant impacts on the SCC determination.







_CAPTION: The median (indicated by the small vertical line) and 90% confidence range (indicated by the horizontal line with arrowheads) of the climate sensitivity estimate used by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon Climate (Roe and Baker, 2007) is indicated by the top black arrowed line. The average of the similar values from 20 different determinations reported in the recent scientific literature is given by the grey arrowed line (second line from the top). The sensitivity estimates from the 20 individual determinations of the ECS as reported in new research published after January 1, 2011 are indicated by the colored arrowed lines. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95% confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing._



The IWG2010 report noted that, concerning the low end of the ECS distribution, its determination reflected a greater degree of certainty that a low ECS value could be excluded than did the IPCC. From the IWG2010 (p. 14):



“Finally, we note the IPCC judgment that the equilibrium climate sensitivity “is very likely larger than 1.5°C.” Although the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution, for which the probability of equilibrium climate sensitivity being greater than 1.5°C is almost 99 percent, is not inconsistent with the IPCC definition of “very likely” as “greater than 90 percent probability,” it reflects a greater degree of certainty about very low values of ECS than was expressed by the IPCC.”



In other words, the IWG used its judgment that the lower bound of the ECS distribution was higher than the IPCC 2007 assessment indicated. However, the collection of the recent literature on the ECS shows the IWG’s judgment to be in error. As can be seen in the chart above, the large majority of the findings on ECS in the recent literature indicate that the lower bound (i.e., 5th percentile) of the ECS distribution is lower than the IPCC 2007 assessment. And, the average value of the 5th percentile in the recent literature (1.1°C) is 0.62°C less than that used by the IWG—a sizable and important difference which will influence the SCC determination.



In fact, the abundance of literature supporting a lower climate sensitivity was at least partially reflected in the new IPCC assessment report issued in 2013. In that report, the IPCC reported:



Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C ( _high confidence_ ), _extremely unlikely_ less than 1°C ( _high confidence_ ), and very unlikely greater than 6°C ( _medium confidence_ ). The lower temperature limit of the assessed _likely_ range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4 … 



Clearly, the IWG’s assessment of the low end of the probability density function that best describes the current level of scientific understanding of the climate sensitivity is incorrect and indefensible.



But even more influential in the SCC determination is the upper bound (i.e., 95th percentile) of the ECS probability distribution.



The IWG2010 notes (p.14) that the calibrated Roe and Baker distribution better reflects the IPCC judgment that “values substantially higher than 4.5°C still cannot be excluded.” The IWG2010 further notes that



“Although the IPCC made no quantitative judgment, the 95th percentile of the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution (7.1 °C) is much closer to the mean and the median (7.2 °C) of the 95th percentiles of 21 previous studies summarized by Newbold and Daigneault (2009). It is also closer to the mean (7.5 °C) and median (7.9 °C) of the nine truncated distributions examined by the IPCC (Hegerl, et al., 2006) than are the 95th percentiles of the three other calibrated distributions (5.2–6.0 °C).”



In other words, the IWG2010 turned towards surveys of the scientific literature to determine its assessment of an appropriate value for the 95th percentile of the ECS distribution. Now, more than five years hence, the scientific literature tells a completely different story.



Instead of a 95th percentile value of 7.14°C, as used by the IWG2010, a survey of the recent scientific literature suggests a value of 3.5°C—more than 50% lower.



And this is very significant and important difference because the high end of the ECS distribution has a large impact on the SCC determination—a fact frequently commented on by the IWG2010.



For example, from IWG2010 (p.26):



“As previously discussed, low probability, high impact events are incorporated into the SCC values through explicit consideration of their effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density function for equilibrium climate sensitivity. Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results in more high temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages. Although FUND does not include catastrophic damages (in contrast to the other two models), its probabilistic treatment of the equilibrium climate sensitivity parameter will directly affect the non‐​catastrophic damages that are a function of the rate of temperature change.”



And further (p.30):



 _Uncertainty in extrapolation of damages to high temperatures_ : The damage functions in these IAMs are typically calibrated by estimating damages at moderate temperature increases (e.g., DICE was calibrated at 2.5 °C) and extrapolated to far higher temperatures by assuming that damages increase as some power of the temperature change. Hence, estimated damages are far more uncertain under more extreme climate change scenarios.



And the entirety of Section V [sic] ""A Further Discussion of Catastrophic Impacts and Damage Functions"" of the IWG 2010 report describes ""tipping points"" and ""damage functions"" that are probabilities assigned to different values of global temperature change. Table 6 from the IWG2010 indicated the probabilities of various tipping points.





The likelihood of occurrence of these low probability, high impact, events (""tipping points"") is greatly diminished under the new ECS findings. The average 95th percentile value of the new literature survey is only 3.5°C indicating a very low probability of a warming reaching 3-5°C by 2100 as indicated in the 3rd column of the above Table and thus a significantly lower probability that such tipping points will be reached. This new information will have a large impact on the final SCC determination using the IWG's methodology.



The size of this impact has been directly investigated.



In their _Comment on the Landmark Legal Foundation Petition for Reconsideration of Final Rule Standards for Standby Mode and Off Mode Microwave Ovens_ , Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2013) ran the DICE model using the distribution of the ECS as described by Otto et al. (2013)—a paper published in the recent scientific literature which includes 17 authors, 15 of which were lead authors of chapters in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report. The most likely value of the ECS reported by Otto et al. (2013) was described as ""2.0°C, with a 5–95% confidence interval of 1.2–3.9°C."" Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC by 42 percent, 41 percent, and 35 percent (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). This is a significant decline.



In subsequent research, Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) examined the performance of the FUND model, and found that it too, produced a greatly diminished value for the SCC when run with the Otto et al. distribution of the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC produced by the FUND model to $11, $6, $0 compared with the original $30, $17, $2 (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). Again, this is a significant decline.



The Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) results using FUND were in line with alternative estimates of the impact of a lower climate sensitivity on the FUND model SCC determination.



Waldhoff et al. (2011) investigated the sensitivity of the FUND model to changes in the ECS. Waldhoff et al. (2011) found that changing the ECS distribution such that the mean of the distribution was lowered from 3.0°C to 2.0°C had the effect of lowering the SCC by 60 percent (from a 2010 SCC estimate of $8/ton of CO2 to $3/ton in $1995). While Waldhoff et al. (2011) examined FUNDv3.5, the response of the current version (v3.8) of the FUND model should be similar.



Additionally, the developer of the PAGE (Policy Analysis of Greenhouse Effect) model affirmed that the SCC from the PAGE model, too drops by 35% when the Otto et al. (2013) climate sensitivity distribution is employed (Hope, 2013).



These studies make clear that the strong dependence of the social cost of carbon on the distribution of the estimates of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (including the median, and the upper and lower certainty bounds) requires that the periodic updates to the IWG SCC determination must include a critical examination of the scientific literature on the topic of the equilibrium climate sensitivity, not merely kowtowing to the IPCC assessment. There is no indication that the IWG undertook such an independent examination. But what is clear, is that the IWG did _not_ alter its probability distribution of the ECS between its 2010, 2013, and 2015 SCC determination, despite a large and growing body of scientific literature that substantially alters and better defines the scientific understanding of the earth's ECS. It is unacceptable that a supposed ""updated"" social cost of carbon does not include updates to the science underlying a critical and key aspect of the SCC.



We note that there has been one prominent scientific study in the recent literature which has argued, on the basis of recent observations of lower tropospheric mixing in the tropics, for a rather high climate sensitivity (Sherwood et al., 2014). This research, however, suffers from too narrow a focus. While noting that climate models which best match the apparent observed behavior of the vertical mixing characteristics of the tropical troposphere tend to be the models with high climate sensitivity estimates, the authors fail to make note that these same models are the ones whose projections make the _worst_ match to observations of the evolution of global temperature during the past several decades. The figure below shows the observed global surface temperature history from 1951-2013 compared with the temperature evolution projected by the collection of models used in the new IPCC 2013 report. We broke the climate models down into two groups—those which have a climate sensitivity greater than 3.0°C (as suggested by Sherwood et al., 2014) and those with a climate sensitivity less than 3.0°C. The Figure shows that while neither model subset does a very good job is capturing evolution of global temperature during the past 15-20 years (the period with the highest human carbon dioxide emissions), the high sensitivity models do substantially worse than the lower sensitivity models.





_CAPTION: Observed global average temperature evolution, 1951-2013, as compiled by the U.K's Hadley Center (black line), and the average temperature change projected by a collection of climate models used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report which have a climate sensitivity greater than 3.0°C (red line) and a collection of models with climate sensitivities less than 3.0°C (blue line)._



While Sherwood et al. (2014) prefer models that better match their observations in one variable, the same models actually do worse in the big picture than do models which lack the apparent accuracy in the processes that Sherwood et al. (2014) describe. The result can only mean that there must still be even bigger problems with _other_ model processes which must more than counteract the effects of the processes described by Sherwood et al. After all, the overall model collective is still warming the world much faster than it actually is (see Figures below). In fact, for the observed global average surface temperature evolution for the past 30 years largely lies below the range which encompasses 95% of all climate model runs—an indication that the observed trend is statistically different from the trend simulated by climate models. And for periods approaching 40 years in length, the observed surface trend lies outside of (below) the range that includes 90% of all climate model simulations—and indication that the observed surface trend is marginally inconsistent with climate model simulations.





_CAPTION: The annual average global surface temperature from 108 individual CMIP5 climate model runs forced with historical (+ RCP45 since 2006) forcings were obtained from theClimate Explorer website. Linear trends were computed through the global temperatures from each run, ending in 2014 and beginning each year from 1951 through 2005. The trends for each period (ranging in length from 10 to 64years) were averaged across all model runs (black dots). The range containing 90 percent (grey lines), and 95 percent (dotted black lines) of trends from the 108 model runs is also indicated. The observed linear trends for the same periods were calculated from the annual average global surface temperature record compiled by the U.K. Hadley Center (HadCRUT4) (colored dots). Observed trend values which were less than the 2.5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored red, observed trend values which were between the 2.5th and the 5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored yellow, and observed trend values greater than the 5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored green. ( Source: Michaels and Knappenberger, 2014)_



We note that our statistics are based upon both the warm and the cold departures from predicted trends. In reality, the cold departure is what is of most interest from a policy perspective—for if warming is being demonstrably overpredicted, then policies based upon models that are in error are a substantial regulatory overreach. Our probability estimates are conservative as values at the .05 level are actually at the 2.5th percentile for warmth from the model ensemble.



The divergence between observations and climate model projections is even worse in the earth's low-to-mid atmosphere (Figure below). As shown by Christy (2015), there is a gross departure of ""reality"" from model predictions. Christy (2015) noted that ""On average the models warm the global atmosphere at a rate three times that of the real world.""





_CAPTION: Five-year running mean temperatures predicted by the UN's climate models, and observed lower atmospheric temperatures from weather balloons and satellites._



These results argue strongly against the reliability of the Sherwood et al. (2014) conclusion and instead provide robust observational evidence that the climate sensitivity has been overestimated by both climate models, and the IWG alike.



 _Agricultural Impacts of Carbon Fertilization_



Carbon dioxide is known to have a positive impact on vegetation, with literally thousands of studies in the scientific literature demonstrating that plants (including crops) grow stronger, healthier, and more productive under conditions of increased carbon dioxide concentration. A recent study (Idso, 2013) reviewed a large collection of such literature as it applies to the world's 45 most important food crops (making up 95% of the world's annual agricultural production). Idso (2013) summarized his findings on the increase in biomass of each crop that results from a 300ppm increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide under which the plants were grown. This table is reproduced below, and shows that the typical growth increase exceeds 30% in most crops, including 8 of the world's top 10 food crops (the increase was 24% and 14% in the other two).



Idso (2013) found that the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide that took place during the period 1961-2011 was responsible for increasing global agricultural output by 3.2 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars). Projecting the increases forward based on projections of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, Idso (2013) expects carbon dioxide fertilization to increase the value of agricultural output by 9.8 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars) during the 2012-2050 period.





This is a large positive externality, and one that is insufficiently modeled in the IAMs relied upon by the IWG in determining the SCC.



In fact, only one of the three IAMs used by the IWG has any substantial impact from carbon dioxide fertilization, and the one that does, underestimates the effect by approximately 2-3 times.



The FUND model has a component which calculates the impact on agricultural as a result of carbon dioxide emissions, which includes not only the impact on temperature and other climate changes, but also the direct impact of carbon dioxide fertilization. The other two IAMs, DICE and PAGE by and large do not (or only do so extremely minimally; DICE includes the effect to a larger degree than PAGE). Consequently, lacking this large and positive externality, the SCC calculated by the DICE and PAGE models is significantly larger than the SCC determined by the FUND model (for example, see Table A5, in the IWG 2013 report).



But even the positive externality that results from carbon dioxide fertilization as included in the FUND model is too small when compared with the Idso (2013) estimates. FUND (v3.7) uses the following formula to determine the degree of crop production increase resulting from atmospheric carbon dioxide increases (taken from Anthoff and Tol, 2013a):





Column 8 in the table below shows the CO2 fertilization parameter ( _γr_ ) used in FUND for various regions of the world (Anthoff and Tol, 2013b). The average CO2 fertilization effect across the 16 regions of the world is 11.2%. While this number is neither areally weighted, nor weighted by the specific crops grown, it is clear that 11.2% is much lower than the average fertilization effect compiled by Idso (2013) for the world's top 10 food crops (35%). Further, Idso's fertilization impact is in response to a 300ppm CO2 increase, while the fertilization parameter in the FUND model is multiplied by ln(CO2t/275) which works out to 0.74 for a 300ppm CO2 increase. This multiplier further reduces the 16 region average to 8.4% for the CO2 fertilization effect—some 4 times smaller than the magnitude of the fertilization impact identified by Idso (2013).



Although approximately four times too small, the impact of the fertilization effect on the SCC calculation in the FUND model is large.



According to Waldhoff et al. (2011), if the CO fertilization effect is turned off in the FUND model (v3.5) the SCC increases by 75% from $8/tonCO2 to $14/tonCO2 (in 1995 dollars). In another study, Ackerman and Munitz (2012) find the effective increase in the FUND model to be even larger, with CO2 fertilization producing a positive externality of nearly $15/tonCO2 (in 2007 dollars).





Clearly, had the Idso (2013) estimate of the CO2 fertilization impact been used instead of the one used in FUND the resulting positive externality would have been much larger, and the resulting net SCC been much lower.



This is just for one of the three IAMs used by the IWG. Had the more comprehensive CO2 fertilization impacts identified by Idso (2013) been incorporated in all the IAMs, the three-model average SCC used by the IWG would be been greatly lowered, and likely even become negative in some IAM/discount rate combinations.



In its 2015 _Response to Comments Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866_ , the IWG admits to the disparate ways that CO2 fertilization is included in the three IAMs. Nevertheless, the IWG quickly dismisses this as a problem in that they claim the IAMs were selected ""to reflect a reasonable range of modeling choices and approaches that collectively reflect the current literature on the estimation of damages from CO2 emissions.""



This logic is blatantly flawed. Two of the IAMs do not reflect the ""current literature"" on a key aspect relating to the direct impact of CO2 emissions on agricultural output, and the third only partially so.



 _CO 2 fertilization is a known physical effect from increased carbon dioxide concentrations_. By including the results of IAMs that do not include known processes that have a significant impact on the end product must disqualify them from contributing to the final result. The inclusion of results that are known a priori to be wrong can only contribute to producing a less accurate answer. Results should only be included when they attempt to represent known processes, not when they leave those processes out entirely.



The justification from the IWG (2015) that ""[h]owever, with high confidence the IPCC (2013) stated in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that ̣'[b]ased on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive ones'"" is completely irrelevant as CO2 fertilization is an impact that is apart from ""climate change."" And further, the IAMs do (explicitly in the case of FUND and DICE or implicitly in the case of PAGE) include damage functions related to the climate change impacts on agriculture. So not only is the IWG justification irrelevant, it is inaccurate as well. The impact of CO2 fertilization on agricultural output and its impact on lowering the SCC must be considered.



 _The Misleading Disconnect Between Climate Change and the Social Cost of Carbon in the Integrated Assessment Models_



It is generally acknowledged, the results from IAMs are highly sensitive not only to the model input parameters but also to how the models have been developed and what processes they try to include. One prominent economist, Robert Pindyck of M.I.T. recently wrote (Pindyck, 2013) that the sensitivity of the IAMs to these factors renders them useless in a policymaking environment:



Given all of the effort that has gone into developing and using IAMs, have they helped us resolve the wide disagreement over the size of the SCC? Is the U.S. government estimate of $21 per ton (or the updated estimate of $33 per ton) a reliable or otherwise useful number? What have these IAMs (and related models) told us? I will argue that the answer is very little. As I discuss below, the models are so deeply flawed as to be close to useless as tools for policy analysis. Worse yet, precision that is simply illusory, and can be highly misleading.



…[A]n IAM‐​based analysis suggests a level of knowledge and precision that is nonexistent, and allows the modeler to obtain almost any desired result because key inputs can be chosen arbitrarily.



Nevertheless, federal agencies, such as the EPA and DoE incorporate the IWG determinations of the SCC into their cost/benefit analyses of proposed regulations—ill-advisedly so in my opinion.



Consider the following: the social cost of carbon should reflect the relative impact on future society that human-induced climate change from greenhouse gas emissions would impose. In this way, we can decide how much (if at all) we are willing to pay currently to reduce the costs to future society. It would seem logical that we would probably be more willing to sacrifice more now if we knew that future society would be impoverished and suffer from extreme climate change than we would be willing to sacrifice if we knew that future society would be very well off and be subject to more moderate climate change. We would expect that the value of the social cost of carbon would reflect the difference between these two hypothetical future worlds—the SCC should be far greater in an impoverished future facing a high degree of climate change than an affluent future with less climate change.



But if you thought this, you would be wrong.



Instead, the IAMs as run by the IWG2013 (and reflected in the July 2015 update) produce nearly the opposite result—the SCC is far _lower_ in the less affluent/high climate change future than it is in the more affluent/low climate change future. Such a result is not only counterintuitive but misleading.



I illustrate this illogical and impractical result using the DICE 2010 model (hereafter just DICE) used by the IWG (although the PAGE and the FUND models generally show the same behavior). The DICE model was installed and run at the Heritage Foundation by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer using the same model set up and emissions scenarios as prescribed by the IWG. The projections of future temperature change (and sea level rise, used later in the Comment) were graciously provided to us by the Heritage Foundation.



The figure below shows the projections of the future change in the earth's average surface temperature for the years 2000-2300 produced by DICE from the five emissions scenarios employed by the IWG. The numerical values on the right-hand side of the illustration are the values for the social cost of carbon associated with the temperature change resulting from each emissions scenario (the SCC is reported for the year 2020 using constant $2007 and assuming a 3% discount rate—numbers taken directly from Table A3 of the IWG2013 report). The temperature change can be considered a good proxy for the magnitude of the overall climate change impacts.





_CAPTION: Future temperature changes, for the years 2000-2300, projected by the DICE model for each of the five emissions scenarios used by the IWG2013. The temperature changes are the arithmetic average of the 10,000 Monte Carlo runs from each scenario. The 2020 value of the SCC (in $2007) produced by the DICE model (assuming a 3% discount rate) is included on the right-hand side of the figure. (DICE data provided by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation)._



Notice in the figure above that the value for the SCC shows little (if any) correspondence to the magnitude of climate change. The MERGE scenario produces the greatest climate change and yet has the smallest SCC associated with it. The ""5th Scenario"" is a scenario that attempts to keep the effective concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 550 ppm (far lower than the other scenarios) has a SCC that is more than 20% greater than the MERGE scenario. The global temperature change by the year 2300 in the MERGE scenario is 9°C while in the ""5th Scenario"" it is only 3°C. The highest SCC is from the IMAGE scenario—a scenario with a mid-range climate change. All of this makes absolutely no logical sense—and confuses the user.



If the SCC bears little correspondence to the magnitude of future human-caused climate change, than what does it represent?



The figure below provides some insight.





_CAPTION: Future global gross domestic product, for the years 2000-2300 for each of the five emissions scenarios used by the IWG2013. The 2020 value of the SCC (in $2007) produced by the DICE model (assuming a 3% discount rate) is included on the right-hand side of the figure._



When comparing the future GDP to the SCC, we see, generally, that the scenarios with the higher future GDP (most affluent future society) have the higher SCC values, while the futures with lower GDP (less affluent society) have, generally, lower SCC values.



Combining the results from the two figures above thus illustrates the absurdities in the IWG's use of the DICE model. The scenario with the richest future society and a modest amount of climate change (IMAGE) has the highest value of the SCC associated with it, while the scenario with the poorest future society and the greatest degree of climate change (MERGE) has the lowest value of the SCC. A logical, thinking person would assume the opposite.



While we only directly analyzed output data from the DICE model, by comparing Tables 2 and Tables 3 from the IWG2010 report, it can be ascertained that the FUND and the PAGE models behave in a similar fashion.This counterintuitive result occurs because the damage functions in the IAMs produce output in terms of a percentage decline in the GDP—which is then translated into a dollar amount (which is divided by the total carbon emissions) to produce the SCC. Thus, even a small climate change-induced percentage decline in a high GDP future yields greater dollar damages (i.e., higher SCC) than a much greater climate change-induced GDP percentage decline in a low GDP future.



Who in their right mind would want to spend (sacrifice) more today to help our rich decedents deal with a lesser degree of climate change than would want to spend (sacrifice) today to help our relatively less-well-off decedents deal with a greater degree of climate change? No one. Yet that is what the SCC would lead you to believe and that is what the SCC implies when it is incorporated into federal cost/benefit analyses. In principle, the way to handle this situation is by allowing the discount rate to change over time. In other words, the richer we think people will be in the future (say the year 2100), the higher the discount rate we should apply to damages (measured in 2100 dollars) they suffer from climate change, in order to decide how much we should be prepared to sacrifice today on their behalf. Until (if ever) the current situation is properly rectified, the IWG's determination of the SCC is not fit for use in the federal regulatory process as it is deceitful and misleading.



 _Sea Level Rise_



The sea level rise module in the DICE model used by the IWG2013/2015 produces future sea level rise values that far exceed mainstream projections and are unsupported by the best available science. The sea level rise projections from more than half of the scenarios (IMAGE, MERGE, MiniCAM) exceed even the highest end of the projected sea level rise by the year 2300 as reported in the _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see figure).





_CAPTION: Projections of sea level rise from the DICE model (the arithmetic average of the 10,000 Monte Carlo runs from each scenario ) for the five scenarios examined by the IWG2013 compared with the range of sea level rise projections for the year 2300 given in the IPCC AR5 (see AR5 Table 13.8). (DICE data provided by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation)._



How the sea level rise module in DICE was constructed is inaccurately characterized by the IWG2013 (and misleads the reader). The IWG2013 report describes the development of the DICE sea level rise scenario as:



“The parameters of the four components of the SLR module are calibrated to match consensus results from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).6″



However, in IWG2013 footnote “6” the methodology is described this way (Nordhaus, 2010):



“The methodology of the modeling is to use the estimates in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).”



“Using estimates” and “calibrating” are two completely different things. Calibration implies that the sea level rise estimates produced by the DICE sea level module behave similarly to the IPCC sea level rise projections and instills a sense of confidence in the casual reader that the DICE projections are in accordance with IPCC projections. However this is not the case. Consequently, the reader is misled.



In fact, the DICE estimates are much higher than the IPCC estimates. This is even recognized by the DICE developers. From the same reference as above:



“The RICE [DICE] model projection is in the middle of the pack of alternative specifications of the different Rahmstorf specifications. Table 1 shows the RICE, base Rahmstorf, and average Rahmstorf. _Note that in all cases, these are significantly above the IPCC projections in AR4_.” [emphasis added]



That the DICE sea level rise projections are far above the mainstream estimated can be further evidenced by comparing them with the results produced by the IWG-accepted MAGICC modelling tool (in part developed by the EPA and available from http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/wigley/magicc/).



Using the MESSAGE scenario as an example, the sea level rise estimate produced by MAGICC for the year 2300 is 1.28 meters—a value that is less than 40% of the average value of 3.32 meters produced by the DICE model when running the same scenario (see figure below).





_CAPTION: Projected sea level rise resulting from the MESSAGE scenario produced by DICE (red) and MAGICC (blue)._



The justification given for the high sea level rise projections in the DICE model (Nordhaus, 2010) is that they well-match the results of a ""semi-empirical"" methodology employed by Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009).



However, subsequent science has proven the ""semi-empirical"" approach to projecting future sea level rise unreliable. For example, Gregory et al. (2012) examined the assumption used in the ""semi-empirical"" methods and found them to be unsubstantiated. Gregory et al (2012) specifically refer to the results of Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009):



The implication of our closure of the [global mean sea level rise, GMSLR] budget is that a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR is weak or absent in the past. The lack of a strong relationship is consistent with the evidence from the tide‐​gauge datasets, whose authors find acceleration of GMSLR during the 20th century to be either insignificant or small. It also calls into question the basis of the semi‐​empirical methods for projecting GMSLR, which depend on calibrating a relationship between global climate change or radiative forcing and the rate of GMSLR from observational data (Rahmstorf, 2007; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Jevrejeva et al., 2010).



In light of these findings, the justification for the very high sea level rise projections (generally exceeding those of the IPCC AR5 and far greater than the IWG‐​accepted MAGICC results) produced by the DICE model is called into question and can no longer be substantiated.Given the strong relationship between sea level rise and future damage built into the DICE model, there can be no doubt that the SCC estimates from the DICE model are higher than the best science would allow and consequently, should not be accepted by the IWG as a reliable estimate of the social cost of carbon.



And here again, the IWG (2015) admits that these sea level rise estimates are an outlier on the high end, yet retains them in their analysis by claiming than they were interested in representing a “range” of possible outcomes. But, even the IWG (2015) admits that the IPCC AR5 assigned “a low confidence in projections based on such [semi‐​empirical] methods.” It is internally inconsistent to claim the IPCC as an authority for limiting the range of possibilities explored by the IAMs (which it did in the case of equilibrium climate sensitivity) and then go outside the IPCC to justify including a wildly high estimate of sea level rise. Such inconsistencies characterize the IWG response to comments and weaken confidence in them.



I did not investigate the sea level rise projections from the FUND or the PAGE model, but suggest that such an analysis must be carried out prior to extending any confidence in the values of the SCC resulting from those models—confidence that we demonstrate cannot be assigned to the DICE SCC determinations.



 _High Social Cost of Carbon Estimates_



A few papers have appeared in the recent scientific literature that have argued that the SCC should be considerably higher than that determined by the IWG. However, these papers suffer from serious flaws.



For example, Van den Bergh and Botzen (2014) purport to make a “conservative” estimate of the SCC that is nearly four times larger than the central estimate made by the IWG. This estimate suffers from the many of the issues described previously—a low discount rate, high climate sensitivity, and little to no positive benefits from agriculture. By including all sorts of imagined bad climate outcomes—with high monetary damages—and being largely dismissive of positive impacts, high SCC values are readily created by the authors.



Another recent analysis which arrived at an estimate of the social cost of carbon that was considerably higher than those made by the IWG was conducted by Moore and Diaz (2015). However, a careful examination shows that the assumptions made and methodologies employed therein produce a non‐​robust and ultimately unreliable result (McKitrick, 2015). Applying a better and more thorough methodology leads to results which are virtually opposite to those initially reported by Moore and Diaz (2015)—one in which the social cost of carbon is quite low and perhaps even positive.



According to McKitrick (2015), the major underlying flaw in the Moore and Diaz paper is the reliance on the results of Dell et al. (2012) in which a warming climate was linked to economic declines in both rich and poor countries. Using a more up‐​to‐​date dataset, McKitrick shows that the negative economic linkage to a warming climate is statistically insignificant and “not a robust basis for a policy assertion.”



Furthermore, McKitrick (2015) shows that if a the more standard methodology is applied, where the temperature changes are areally‐​weighted rather than weighted by country‐​level population, the relationship between economic growth and temperature change reverses for rich countries and becomes statistically significant. According to McKitrick (2015), “each degree of warming significantly _increases_ the annual income growth rate in rich countries by over 2 percentage points,” while in poor countries, the relationship “is statistically insignificant.“  
In conclusion, McKitrick (2015) finds:



The fact that the relevant poor‐​country coefficients are statistically insignificant implies they should not have been relied upon in Moore and Diaz (2015). And since the rich country coefficient corresponding to the [integrated assessment model] IAM structure is positive and significant, Moore and Diaz (2015) should actually have reported an acceleration of economic growth in rich countries associated with rising temperatures and a correspondingly reduced SCC. Also, since the rich countries begin with a larger GDP it is also likely that the overall global effect of warming on income growth would be positive, even applying the poor country coefficient. In any case the computations in Moore and Diaz (2015) are uninformative since they used coefficients from DJO based on an incomplete sample and a definition of temperature incompatible with their IAM.



Bottom line is that the Moore and Diaz (2015) high SCC estimates as well as the Dell et al. (2012) results upon which they were based, do not stand up under careful re‐​analysis. In fact, when assessed properly, they produce a low SCC estimate, in support of our overall analysis.



Overall, these new papers provide additional evidence as to the non‐​robust nature of current SCC determinations.



 _Conclusion_



The social cost of carbon as determined by the Interagency Working Group in their May 2013 Technical Support Document (updated in November 2013 and July 2015) is unsupported by the robust scientific literature, fraught with uncertainty, illogical, and thus completely unsuitable and inappropriate for federal rulemaking. Had the IWG included a better‐​reasoned and more inclusive review of the current scientific literature, the social cost of carbon estimates would have been considerably reduced with a value likely approaching zero. Such a low social cost of carbon would obviate the arguments behind the push for federal greenhouse gas regulations.

"As thousands of fires rage across the Amazon, world headlines have highlighted the associated illegal deforestation and international outcry. But the implicit categorisation of all these fires as “wildfires” or even just “bad” fires hides the fact that fire is also used sustainably in the region. In fact, for numerous smallholders and Indigenous peoples, it is part of their livelihood and cultural practices. The Amazon isn’t one continuous block of lush rainforest as in the Western imagination, but rather a landscape of multiple ecosystems including forest, wetlands and savannas. Indigenous and local communities use fire within these habitats in different ways. For example, fire is used in small-scale rotational forest farming where typically half hectare plots are cut, burned and planted for a number of years, before being left to regenerate. And in the fire-prone savanna, Indigenous people use fire to drive and trap game such as deer or the pig-like peccary. Key to traditional fire management is the burning of small areas at different times over the whole dry season, thus producing a mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches across the landscape. This reduces fuel loads, introduces natural firebreaks, and limits the potential for catastrophic fires. For many Indigenous groups in the Amazon, their entire way of life is predicated on sustainable fire. For example, the Mebêngokrê (Kayapó) people, who live in a remote region of the Brazilian Amazon, use fire to hunt for tortoises. Fire is used to clear tall savanna grasses thus making tortoise burrows more visible and accessible. Hunts like this form part of extended traditional festivals with implications for social processes including courtship, community cohesion, youth initiation and inter-generational knowledge transfer.  The Wapishana and Makushi, in neighbouring Guyana, use fire for gathering resources such as burning along swamps before cutting palm leaves, smoking bees before collecting honey, and stimulating certain trees to fruit, as well as using fire to protect important areas such as sacred forests, farming plots and homes. For all these groups, fire intimately connects livelihoods, culture, history and beliefs.  Indigenous management has a wider impact: evidence from several satellite studies indicate that Indigenous lands have less deforestation and habitat conversion compared to surrounding areas. This means these areas are more biodiverse and store more carbon. Yet, there is still a pervasive anti-fire discourse targeting Indigenous peoples and smallholders in the Amazon. In Venezuela, for example, the Indigenous Pemón have been labelled with the derogatory phrase “Pemones los quemones” (crudely translated as “Pemón the pyromaniacs”), and in Brazil there is a notion that Indigenous burning activities represent an inherently destructive mentality. This anti-fire rhetoric is widely used by interest groups in the Amazon, such as the powerful agribusiness lobby, to discredit Indigenous and local communities and as political narratives contesting rights to land.  It does not help that the satellite imagery currently used to monitor fires in the Amazon is typically 4km x 4km resolution – that is, it can only “see” in blocks of four kilometres. That means it cannot distinguish between small, controlled fires – perhaps only the size of a field, but large enough to trigger the satellite – and much larger wildfires. Conflating distinct fire types – small, large, controlled, uncontrolled, intentional, accidental, sustainable, unsustainable – raises more problems. It impedes our understanding of the root causes of destructive wildfires, and aids the formulation of restrictive policies that further disempower already marginalised groups while giving more power and control to established hierarchies. Climate change is a reality for marginalised groups in the Amazon, where drought produces more flammable forests. In a vast region with limited infrastructure, resources and on the ground enforcement, firefighting alone is not viable and not effective, today or in the future.  At the G7 summit, a group of wealthy nations pledged US$22 million for firefighting planes and military support to tackle the Amazon fires. But it’s a top-down, sticking plaster approach. That money may be much better spent on strengthening Indigenous and local community land rights, while supporting local communities to share their fire knowledge with decision-makers in order to revalorise and implement traditional fire management grounded in local realities and a changing climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing from alarmists that if we sacrifice by giving up carbon based fuels and bring atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 350 ppm, then we will get nice weather with far fewer extremes – like in the 1930s.
Reader Jimbo however shows that this is all bogus. Now he has compiled a list of extreme weather events occurring in 1936…before 15 billion “Hiroshima bombs worth of heat” were added to the climate system by humans – and at a time when CO2 were well below the “safe level” of 350 ppm.

"The latest greenhouse gas emissions data released on Friday were a mixture of some good news combined with the sorrow of how far we have to go and how much time we have wasted. Once the carbon price was removed in 2014, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions took off – rising ever higher under the lack of climate change leadership of Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. In less than two years under the carbon price, Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 2.4%, and in the same time after the carbon price was repealed they rose 2.8%.  By September 2018 our emissions, excluding “land use”, were 5% above the lowest point achieved during the carbon price period and were the highest they had even been. And so it is good news that finally our emissions are falling – and falling quite quickly: But that good news comes with a couple of caveats. The first is that even with the recent falls, Australia’s annual emissions still remain nearly 4% above the low point of March 2014: Secondly, the main reason for the fall in emissions is the large introduction of renewable energy in 2018. But as Adam Morton noted last week, that was driven by the national renewable energy target, which “was filled last year and has not been replaced”. Morton also notes that a Reserve Bank research paper published in March found that “investment in renewable energy has moderated from its recent peak and is likely to decline further over the next year or two”. So the good news is decidedly muted.  We should note that the emissions produced by the bushfires over the summer do not count towards the total account. It is assumed the trees will grow back, and thus, unlike logging, it is not technically a land use measure. Land use of course has a long history of being used for very dodgy purposes. We alone get to count it towards our Paris target of 26% below 2005 levels, which makes our task absurdly easier: Excluding land use, Australia’s 2019 emissions were 4.5% above 2005 levels, but when you include it, our emissions have fallen 13.3%! Land use is also subject to some pretty bizarre measurement changes.  This time last year the government estimated that in 1990 (the base year for our Kyoto target, which in turn affects our Paris target) Australia emitted 172.9Mt of CO2; now the government estimates it was 183.2Mt.  It’s amazing that we can discover, nearly 30 years after the fact, that we had emitted 6% more than we once thought:  When you exclude land use, the government’s target of a 26% cut from 2005 levels becomes a mere 12% - absurdly small, and pointless. And yet even that looks beyond this government. There has also been some silly reporting of this latest release, suggesting it shows we are on track to meet the 26% cut target (when including land use). The Australian’s Graham Lloyd, for example, led his report stating, “Australia is halfway towards meeting its 2030 Paris agreement target for greenhouse gas emissions”. That is true enough, but you could have almost said the same thing six years ago. At the end of 2013 we were 47% of the way towards the 2030 target, now we are 51% of the way.  Bragging about being halfway is like getting driven in a car to the 20km mark of a marathon, waking slowly for 1,500m and then boasting that you have run half a marathon.  And it ignores that we also need to increase the pace to achieve the final half of the 26% cut: But we must always remember that it is not just about the target, but the path there – every year’s worth of emissions adds to the overall total.  That is why a 50% cut by 2030 is so important – it not only leads to a lower level, it reduces the amount of greenhouse gas we emit from now until 2030. A 50% cut target would see us emit around 880Mt of CO2 less between now and 2030 than we if we did actually reach the current 26% target – equivalent to around 20 months’ worth of current emissions: But had we continued on the path we were on from 2009 to 2013, things could have been so much better.  Not only were we on the path to a 59% cut in emissions, we would have emitted just over 2,000Mt less of CO2 by 2030 – or just under four years worth of current emissions.  Not cutting emissions now only means needing to cut more later, and at a certain point no matter how much we cut, it won’t be enough.  • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"

Dominant powers rarely give way graciously. Great Britain only reluctantly accepted America’s rise and refused to similarly yield to the emerging German giant on the European continent. The U.S. has discouraged independent European actors, advanced NATO to shrunken Russia’s borders, and ringed China with bases and forces.



Conflict often results during power transitions. It took two world wars to sort out Britain’s and Germany’s roles: both receded from the international summit though, ironically, the latter, while the military loser, is the greater economic power today. While most of Europe would fight for little if anything, Moscow recently beat up two of its weaker neighbors to force Washington to respect Russia’s much diminished interests.





Washington continues to insist on running the globe, setting the rules, and ordering everyone about. However, the world increasingly is unwilling to cooperate.



The U.S. and People’s Republic of China have yet to come to blows, but escalating tensions before Donald Trump even took office highlighted the potential dangers of estrangement. Washington continues to insist on running the globe, setting the rules, and ordering everyone about. However, the world increasingly is unwilling to cooperate. Certainly Beijing is in no mood to kowtow to America.



Since the end of the Cold War the U.S. has been the most aggressive nation on earth and possesses the world’s most powerful military. But Washington has grown used to threatening or battling military midgets: Haiti, Panama, Somali warlords, Bosnian Serbs, Serbia, Afghanistan’s Taliban, Iraq, Libya’s faltering Khadafy regime, the Islamic State. And most of these conflicts ended unsatisfactorily, sometimes even embarrassingly.



Backing into war with the PRC would be far worse. China possesses nuclear weapons—far fewer than in America’s arsenal, but enough to loose mass death and destruction on any nation targeted. The People’s Liberation Army would be no pushover, and the PRC is far too big to conquer, occupy, and remake.



Nor is the international climate conducive for American dominance. The Obama administration, with full support of the Neoconservative hawks who dominate the Republican Party, especially in Congress, have managed to reverse Richard Nixon’s great strategic opening to the PRC and pushed Russia and China together against the U.S. Much naturally divides Moscow and Beijing, but Washington’s militaristic meddling is encouraging the two to cooperate. Nor are America’s allies and the PRC’s neighbors nearly so enthused about the potential for conflict as are the GOP’s hawks.



Worse, even victory in war would only set the stage for future conflict, just as the Versailles Treaty proved to be but a truce for a generation while the combatants recovered their wind. Beijing and Washington need to peer into the future, however darkly, and choose a different course.



The U.S. should learn from Great Britain’s policy toward the rabidly nationalistic rising giant on the North American continent. After fighting two wars with its one‐​time colonists, Britain wisely chose peace. London settled border disputes despite America’s unreasonable demands; accepted an outrageous diktat excluding European powers from Latin America; avoided conflict despite American maritime violations of neutral rights during the Civil War; and accepted U.S. naval parity and eventual superiority. As a result, an important international partnership endures today.



Unfortunately, the Trump administration appears inclined toward conflict. The President seems determined to trigger a trade war, apparently believes Beijing can be bullied into imposing regime change in Pyongyang, and even before placing a foreign policy team in place challenged the PRC with U.S. encouragement of Taiwanese independence. Trump is pouring gasoline all over the relationship. Alas, it didn’t take long for a match to be lit, in this case the Chinese seizure of the underwater drone, which could have ended very badly.



Adviser and former CIA Director James Woolsey proposed “a grand bargain in which the U.S. accepts China’s political and social structure and commits not to disrupt it in any way in exchange for China’s commitment not to challenge the status quo in Asia.” However, that’s no deal from the PRC’s standpoint. Despite Chinese insecurities, there’s little in practice that Washington can do to overthrow the quasi‐​fascist regime which currently governs China. And for a rising power, one that may eventually match U.S. economic and military strength, to complacently accept permanent American dominance along its border would be intolerable.



Imagine London insisting that residents of the U.S. acquiesce to British naval patrols up the East Coast and throughout the Caribbean. Britain dictating American behavior toward Cuba and other nearby territories. British military bases in Mexico, Canada, and throughout the Caribbean. A “pivot” or “rebalance” through which Britain moved military units from Europe and Asia to the Americas. Public debates in London about the potential for war with the U.S. America’s reaction would not have been polite.



Washington is almost frivolously courting conflict. There is no clash of fundamental interests. The two nations are not striving to control the same land mass. There are no disputed territorial claims. Beijing is not threatening to invade America or seize America’s Pacific possessions. There is no danger of military domination of Eurasia. Indeed, China is encircled by potential adversaries—India, Russia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan—several of which are backed by Washington.



The U.S. has legitimate interests, but they are limited: free navigation, which the PRC has not threatened; commercial cyberwar, which apparently has been tamed by agreement; abusive trade practices, though the U.S. is no economic virgin; violation of human rights, but Washington ignores equal crimes in Saudi Arabia, Central Asia, Egypt, and other “friendly” states; security of allied nations, though Beijing has threatened the independence of no state other than Taiwan, which historically was controlled by China; and North Korea, but Washington’s containment strategy discourages Chinese action against Beijing’s sole military ally.



None of these cases warrant the possibility of war.



Perhaps President Trump is playing an elaborate geopolitical game for diplomatic advantage. If so, he will need to deploy more than bluster and provocation. And he will need to plan carefully lest his policies trigger a violent reaction. Peace and security for both America and China, and East Asia, are at stake.

"No planes in the sky, empty hotels and deserted attractions: with the world at a standstill, tourism has been one of the industries worst-hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. International arrivals this year could be down by 80% compared with 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, and more than 100 million jobs are under threat. But as destinations slowly start to emerge from lockdown and borders tentatively reopen, many in the sector are wondering if this is a chance for tourism to rebuild in a greener, more sustainable way.  “Of course, it’s completely devastating – but it’s also provided a much-needed chance for introspection,” said Sam Bruce of Much Better Adventures, who is a co-founder of campaigning group Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency. “Things needed to change. It’s an opportunity for everyone from tourist boards to tour operators to reset and to look at how things can be better – for the planet, for local communities and for travellers.” In Venice – one of the most overtouristed cities, with an estimated 25 million foreign visitors a year – officials are using the pause to rethink “an entire Venice system”, with sustainability and quality tourism at its core, said Paola Mar, the city’s councillor for tourism. Part of the plan is to lure locals back to live permanently in the city. The mayor is in discussions with universities, aiming to offer tourist rentals to students, and old buildings are being restored for social housing. Measures to control visitor numbers – including a tax on day trippers, which was due to be introduced in July – will go ahead next year, while the debate around cruise ships continues. “Our goal is to trigger a renaissance of the city,” said Mar. “We want to attract visitors for longer stays and encourage a ‘slower’ type of tourism. Things can’t go back to how they were.” City authorities in Amsterdam – which was struggling to cope with an estimated 18.3 million overnight tourist stays in 2019 – are also quietly hopeful that the pandemic will be a catalyst for change. Last week the mayor urged extreme caution in reopening to tourists, while nonprofit group Amsterdam&Partners believes the tourist hiatus pushes to the top of the agenda plans to cut numbers, give Amsterdam back to locals and attract the “right” kind of visitor, and has launched a sustainability taskforce to map the way forward. “We are working with partners to discuss how we can restart in a more sustainable and responsible way,” said Amsterdam&Partners spokeswoman Heleen Jansen. “The main focus is that we want a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the livability of our city. If you have the right balance between living, working and visiting, you can have the right visitor economy. That’s what went wrong in the last years in the old city centre, and we have to entice locals to discover their city centre again.” Meanwhile, the suddenly empty streets of Barcelona have made local businesses and the tourist board re-evaluate their priorities too. “While we couldn’t continue at the speed things were, this is showing us that no tourists is no good either – there needs to be a more moderate way,” said Mateo Asensioof the Barcelona tourist board. “Our first task is getting locals back out into the city, then the domestic market and our neighbours. When the international market returns, we’ll focus more on specific sectors. It’s an opportunity to change the rules.” With the world’s “new normal” including social distancing, an increased fear of crowds and busy places – and the future of airlines in the balance – over-tourism may not be a pressing issue for some time. Other changes in cities around the world include  reshaping in favour of cyclists and pedestrians: Athens is accelerating plans for a car-free historic centre, Berlin is introducing 14 miles of new bike lanes, and Paris is also significantly increasing its bike lanes, to ease potential overcrowding. Destinations likely to see the first surge in visitor numbers are remote coastal and rural areas, places seen as “safe”, said Patricia Yates, acting CEO of Visit Britain/Visit England. It will be longer before cities bounce back. “Our weekly consumer sentiment surveys show that the domestic market is very nervous – so we will be focusing initially on reassurance,” she said. “But beyond that we will be looking at promoting areas outside the honeypots. What is needed is destination management to rebuild tourism more slowly and keep residents, visitors and businesses that depend on tourists happy – it’s quite a balancing act.” Some of the progress made on sustainable tourism is likely to go into reverse at first, she added – with people eschewing public transport in favour of car travel and infection control measures leading to more single-use plastic. Many tour operators, however, believe the pandemic could engender a positive change in client behaviour. Intrepid Travel CEO James Thornton said: “During this hibernation period we’ve seen the benefit to nature and the climate – fish spotted in Venice’s clearer canal water, the Himalayas visible in India – and people have had time to reflect. I think customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on the environment and the communities they visit, and make more considered choices.” A renewed focus on slower travel, including train journeys and cycling, as well as keeping experiences as local as possible and offering more off-season departures are part of Intrepid’s post-Covid plans, with wilderness and wellness trips tipped to be of most interest. Launching new adventures in even more remote destinations to assist with economic recovery is on the agenda for Much Better Adventures when tourism opens up again. “The crisis has shown just how much communities in less-developed parts of the world rely on tourism,” said Sam Bruce. “We will look to spread tourism to areas that would genuinely benefit. But it has to be done in the right way. We risk a flood to remote places that aren’t prepared and could be taken advantage of. “I’m hopeful that a new, slower tourism will emerge – but the recovery needs to be slow enough for the industry to make the right decisions as it rises from the ashes.” G Adventures founder Bruce Poon Tip – who has just published Unlearn: The Year the Earth Stood Still, an e-book looking at the impact of the pandemic on tourism – believes the industry can emerge as a stronger force for good. “People will travel again. We don’t yet know when, but we know that they will. I want to challenge everyone who travels to ‘unlearn’ what they think they know. We have the opportunity to use this reset to be more conscious about how we can improve, as individuals and as a wider travel community.” The biggest issue in the move to a more sustainable tourist industry, though, is air travel – aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon emissions in 2019 and was one of the fastest-growing polluters. With airlines grounded, emissions from aviation declined by about 60% in early April compared with 2019, according to the journal Nature Climate Change. With the pause likely to be temporary, campaigners from Greenpeace to Flight Free are demanding that airline bailouts come with strict conditions on their future climate impact and say Covid should be the catalyst for greening the world’s airlines. But in a race for economic recovery, rebuilding the industry quickly could sideline climate change and aviation issues, said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, who is calling for a “green flying duty”, with more regulation and tax revenues invested in renewable fuels. The cost of flights is likely to rise in the long term, he added. “Short term, the where and how we travel has had to change. But new, more entrenched, norms could form from that. Many people were hooked on frequent short breaks, but key to more sustainable tourism is taking far fewer flights – we may now see a return to longer, less frequent holidays, with more time spent getting to know a place, and a rise in slower forms of travel.” Whatever happens, it’s unlikely travel will ever be the same as in pre-Covid days. An industry known for its resilience will find a new way forward, adapting to an unknown global market, but whether sustainability can be at the heart of a new model of tourism is hard to predict. “Tourism will be smaller, and so more sustainable per se. Fewer flights means less C02, fewer guests means less waste, and there will be much more focus on localism, at least initially,” said Graham Miller, professor of sustainability in business at the University of Surrey. “How the nature of the product changes, however, remains to be seen. There are huge vested interests to contend with – like the cruise industry in Venice and big businesses – but it feels like the moment we have been waiting for. If we are going to redesign tourism, this is about the best chance we can wish for.”"
"AURORA, Colo.  —   It took 11 days of calling lawyers, beseeching immigration officials and trying to book   plane tickets, but on Tuesday, Osman Nasreldin got the love of his life back. His fiancée, Sahar Fadul, had been detained late last month after arriving at Dulles International Airport from her parents’ home in Sudan and put on a plane back to Africa, the visa it had taken a year for her to acquire stamped “CANCELLED” in purple ink. They were reunited on a mild afternoon in Colorado, joining a flood of other travelers taking advantage of the temporary suspension of President Trump’s immigration order restricting the entry of refugees and arrivals from seven largely Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa. Other couples across the world were still in limbo. “What does it mean if you live in heaven and don’t have the person you love?” asked Mr. Nasreldin, a   dental hygienist in Aurora. For couples of different nationalities trying to navigate America’s immigration system, the president’s executive order and the legal upheaval it created have thrown relationships and marriages into turmoil. Americans with Syrian and Sudanese partners outside the United States are staying up past midnight to buy   plane tickets and plan harried reunions while enforcement of the order is still suspended. Legal challenges aside, couples of mixed Iranian and American backgrounds are rethinking their plans to build lives together in a country where one partner no longer feels welcome. Engagement parties abroad have been scrapped, a wedding dress returned. Mr. Nasreldin and Ms. Fadul were among those racing to reunite, hoping to bind themselves together no matter the outcome of federal court cases challenging the legality of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban. Many of the couples touched by the executive order are accustomed to living apart. They had met online, on business trips or on return visits to countries that one or both had left years ago. What changed, they said, was their certainty they would make it through the immigrant vetting process and one day live together in the United States. “It’s all up in the air,” said Guy R. Croteau, a psychotherapist in Boston who met his fiancé, an Iranian, through Facebook and became engaged after a few whirlwind visits in Istanbul and Malaysia. His fiancé  —   Mr. Croteau publicly refers to him as “M” because he is concerned about M’s safety as a gay man living in Iran  —   received a   fiancé visa that is valid until July, one of 30, 000 to 40, 000 such visas granted each year. But the couple are unsure whether the visa will still be valid after the administration’s   immigration hold passes. They are waiting it out apart. “We don’t know,” Mr. Croteau said. “Will there be additional vetting? We don’t know. ” In the meantime, couples are trying to bridge the divide digitally. Olivia Cross chats by video with her husband, Yahya Abedi, an Iranian, as she walks between classes at the University of Michigan. Mr. Abedi has taped photos of the couple’s wedding to the wall of his apartment in Bandar Abbas so Ms. Cross, an American citizen, can see them when she calls. After meeting online, they married last February in Tbilisi, Georgia, and had been threading their way through the visa process when Mr. Trump signed the order. Iran retaliated, saying it would bar American citizens from traveling there. And there went the couple’s plans for a reunion in Iran this May. “I just feel like whatever I do, however I try to pivot, it’s all blocked,” Ms. Cross said. “We just want to be able to live our life together. ” When Michelle Brady chats by video with her husband, a   aid worker recovering in Poland after heart surgery, their    son, Jad, recognizes his father’s pixelated face on the screen. When they disconnect, Jad tries to find his father in the computer. “He’s crying and upset that his dad is not there,” said Ms. Brady, who is now unsure when her husband can join them at their home in the Washington area. Even those who aren’t separated say the order has scrambled their plans for weddings and engagements. Relatives from Iran or Syria aren’t sure whether they will be able to attend summer weddings in the United States. Couples with immigrant parents say they are hesitant about traveling to their familial homelands to celebrate. Dr. Arash Afshinnik, who leads a neurointensive care unit in Fresno, was married three weeks ago in California and planned to fly to Iran with his wife, Sandra Shahinpour, for a second ceremony with her family. He has been in the United States since he was 3 months old, but she spent part of her 20s in Iran and is close to friends and cousins who had wanted to celebrate. “We’ve scrapped the plans,” Dr. Afshinnik, 40, said. His wife returned the dress she had bought for the ceremony. “While everything’s getting sorted out, what hasn’t changed is the uncertainty. Why even dip your toe in the pool? It just seems too hot. ” For much of their   courtship, Jehan Mouhsen and Khaled Almilaji lived apart. She studied medicine in Montenegro. Dr. Almilaji, 35, a Syrian physician well known among   workers, was in Turkey, saving lives, he said, by supporting doctors in the Syrian conflict zone. He is a romantic who sent Dr. Mouhsen, 26, “buckets of roses” and surprised her with visits to Montenegro. They married in July, and in August they settled in Rhode Island, where Dr. Almilaji had received a scholarship for a master’s degree in public health at Brown University, studying on a student visa. He was excited to be sharpening skills to help rebuild his country. She was excited because it seemed their days apart were over. Now Dr. Almilaji is stranded in Gaziantep, Turkey, near the Syrian border, after what was supposed to be a   visit to take care of personal and professional affairs. His original return visa was not honored. He went to the American Consulate in Istanbul on Jan. 20 to get a new visa to return, and has not heard back. Dr. Mouhsen fled the loneliness of their apartment in Providence to stay with friends in New York City, where she is studying for her medical board exams and wrestling with morning sickness. She is pregnant. “He tells me to eat fruits and vegetables, take care of me and the baby,” she said. Although Dr. Mouhsen has Montenegrin roots, they both grew up in Aleppo, Syria, and plan to return someday. In 2013, Dr. Almilaji’s early detection system found that polio was making a comeback in   Syria, and he coordinated a campaign the next year that vaccinated more than a million Syrian children. Though his work was supported by powerful organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, Unicef, the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, there is little they can do to help him now. Early in the civil war, Dr. Almilaji was arrested, tortured and jailed for six months by the regime. But he says he feels even more powerless now that his wife is suffering from an abrupt separation caused by the action of the United States government. “I’ve been arrested, and I’ve been tortured and everything,” he said in a phone conversation from Turkey. “But my wife, she doesn’t have to suffer this. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski at the online Spiegel writes a report on the warming stop, reaffirming that it indeed has stopped for 16 years. But at the same time the article says, citing NASA, we that could  see a record warm 2014. The heat is out there, somewhere.
Interestingly, Spiegel now says it’s the atmosphere near the surface that has paused, and not the globe or climate. 10 years ago, on the other hand, atmospheric warming was called global warming.
More than 97% of all models are wrong
The big questions is why the near-surface atmosphere has not warmed like all the models said it would. Spiegel writes:
Computer models did not predict the development. Only three of 114 climate simulations have correctly shown the trend of the last years, summed up the UNIPCC in September in its fifth assessment report.”
A variety of possible explanations
The reason for the pause, Spiegel writes, is unknown. Spiegel describes 5 different reasons: 1) drying out of the upper atmospheric layers, 2) Pacific oscillations, 3) weak solar activity, 4) increased levels of aerosols and 5) well, warming hasn’t really stopped – a gap in Arctic data is concealing the warming.
And in almost every case, data are sorely lacking and so no sound conclusions can be drawn. This is the state of the science that scientists claim is more than 95% certain. We notice that all the warming still remains hidden in model projections, oceans and missing data. They tell us it’s there, but they just haven’t measured it yet.

NASA moves the goal posts to 30 years 
Spiegel then cites NASA in claiming that 16 years are not enough after all, and that at least 30 years are needed.
Temperature developments over a few years are in any case not sufficient to establish a trend says NASA: Data from at least 30 years are necessary.
Will 2014 be hottest ever?
Next Spiegel writes about NASA’s prediction that 2014 may be the globe’s hottest year ever, but that it depends on the ENSO. Spiegel writes:
A new El Niño could put 2014 at the top, NASA explained – also the 16-year temperature trend could once again head upwards.”
That makes perfect sense: 16 years is not a trend, but one single year can make a whole new warming trend!
Overall it was an overly warmist article from the somewhat usually a bit more skeptical Bojanowski. The editorial desk must be pressuring him.

"Hours before the start of the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, every Metro car leading to the National Mall was packed so tight that it could take on no more riders. At station after station, the train doors would open, and the passengers would look out on throngs of fellow protesters  —   women, men, children, babies, the occasional dog  —   waiting on the platform. As people emerged from underground into the morning air, it was hard to tell where to go, so they found their way by gauging the human density, moving until they reached a spot so full of people that they could no longer move at all. There was an enormous rally happening somewhere in there  —   activists and celebrities speaking into microphones  —   but much of the crowd couldn’t see or hear anything except rumbling waves of cheers. By the time they were meant to march, the crowd was so large that it already stretched across the entire route, from the rally site near the Capitol to the Ellipse near the White House. The signs they carried spoke to any number of issues: immigration, abortion, race, the environment, inequality, the new president. REFUGEES WELCOME, KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA, BLACK LIVES MATTER, SCIENCE IS REAL, FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER, NOBODY LIKES YOU. The handmade pink “pussyhats” that many marchers wore  —   a reference to Donald Trump’s    boasts about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals  —   had been sneered at in the days before the march. They were called corny, girlie, a waste of time. Seen from above, though, on thousands of marchers, their wave of color created a powerful image. It was, somewhat unexpectedly, one of the largest mass demonstrations in American history. Millions of protesters  —   estimates range from three to five million  —   took to the streets of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Fla. Boise, Idaho, even Fargo, N. D. Sister demonstrations were held in Thailand, in Malawi, in Antarctica. The energy of almost every group alarmed or incensed by Trump’s election seemed to have poured into a single demonstration. That it happened on the day after his inauguration was not surprising. What was striking was that all these people had come together under the auspices of a march for women. Just two months earlier, the left did not appear to be a unified front. The polls had barely closed before the infighting began. Some blamed Hillary Clinton for ignoring Wisconsin, or the Democratic National Committee for boxing other candidates out of the primary field. Some blamed identity politics, which made   white voters “feel excluded,” according to Prof. Mark Lilla of Columbia. Others blamed white people, particularly the coastal ones who couldn’t get their heartland relatives on their side. But a crew of   angry women was still aiming its ire at Trump. In the hours after his victory on Nov. 8, Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer in Hawaii, posted to Facebook, suggesting a march on Washington. Some women on the East Coast had the same idea. At first, these suggestions were so impulsive that they seemed almost metaphorical. But within days, tens of thousands of women had pledged to join in. Over the course of two months, the idea became something far bigger than initially imagined. Eventually, an entire organizing team would have permits,   fleets of buses, portable toilets, celebrity sponsors and support from Gloria Steinem. Men meekly asked their female family members and Twitter followers: “Are we allowed to join?” By the middle of January, with the event shaping up to be the   demonstration, the New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait worried that “Women’s March” was too niche an organizing principle  —   it was a “bad name,” he tweeted, a divisive “brand. ” The opposite turned out to be true: Women led the resistance, and everyone followed. A march for women managed to crowd a broad opposition force onto its platform. In the weeks since the march, that energy has only spread. After Trump’s executive order halting travel from seven   countries, the march’s striking proof of concept  —   hit the streets, and a surprising number of others will join you  —   fueled more spontaneous actions in unexpected places: outside courthouses, Trump hotels, airport terminals, the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell. At each protest, you were likely to see a few pink cat ears poking out of the crowd, a reminder of the opposition’s first gathering. It seems unlikely that any other kind of march would have turned out quite this way. In this moment, it happened that “women” was the one tent large enough to contain almost every major strain of protest against Trump. Those who know their feminist history might see a paradox here. The women’s movement has not always been a site for unity. It has been marked just as deeply by its fractures, failures and tensions. But more than a century of internal turmoil has also forced the movement to reckon with its divisions. Now, the question is whether it can bring even more Americans into the fold. Clinton’s loss on Nov. 8 was a pivotal,   moment in the course of the American women’s movement. In an evening, the   first female president was shoved to the side by what a sizable chunk of the nation saw as that classic historical figure: the male chauvinist pig. In parts of the popular imagination, it wasn’t just a loss for Clinton or for the Democratic Party. It was a repudiation of feminism itself. But Clinton has always been a wary avatar of feminism. In 2008, she didn’t run for president as a “women’s candidate” if anything, she campaigned with her sex in the closet and the strategist Mark Penn advising her to harden her image into an American Iron Lady. “They do not want someone who would be the first mama,” he wrote in one memo. Years later, HBO’s “Veep” would satirize that posture through its own fictional politician. “I can’t identify myself as a woman!” she tells her staff. “People can’t know that. Men hate that. And women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women. ” In the eight years between Clinton’s first and second presidential campaigns, though, something shifted: Feminism became fashionable. By the start of the Obama era, incisive women’s blogs like Jezebel and Feministing had already hit the web and started throwing popcorn at the big screen of American culture, covering the same topics that women’s magazines did  —   fashion, movies, sex  —   but taking on the women’s magazines too. By Obama’s second term, this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a   of the sports website Bleacher Report started his own women’s site, Bustle. Soon enough, no corner of culture was safe from a feminist critique, from Christmas songs to “manspreading. ” Pop stars  —   people like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift  —   were asked if they were feminists, and if they shied away from the label, outrage would greet them online. Feminism became increasingly popular, but in a very specific way  —   one attuned to the concerns of people with office jobs and time to spend online. The feminist priorities of this new media landscape tended to involve topics that   women would experience firsthand: reproductive rights, catcalling, campus rape, professional opportunity,   representation. The writers setting its tone tended to be young women who were asked to produce large amounts of clickable copy, for not much money, in very little time, exploring feminist issues not through   reporting but through “takes” on the women already making news: the   balance of Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer the pay gap between Jennifer Lawrence and her male  . Some content chased sexist slights down to the most passing personal concerns, like an item from The Huffington Post that sighed: “There is no proper way for a woman to cut her hair, let alone do anything right in this world. ” It’s not that women’s activist groups vanished or political organizing stalled. But it did become possible for an American woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist: There were feminist TV shows to watch, feminist celebrities to follow, feminist clothes to buy. Unlike many other major social movements, women’s liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic, a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago. In 1908, the advertiser J. Walter Thompson hired suffragists to address the growing women’s market. Over the next decades, the industry would slip women’s rights messaging into ad copy. Old Dutch Cleanser offered “freedom from household drudgery” Shredded Wheat promised a “declaration of independence” from cooking. These days, even our bath products have achieved empowerment. Ads for Secret deodorant nudge us to ask for a raise, and those for Always prompt us to challenge stereotypes about girls. Dove wants us to feel beautiful at any size. It’s telling which strand of feminism these brands have deemed marketable: the one that doubles as  . This is a vision of feminism in which the primary thing that needs to change is a woman’s frame of mind. Something similar happened to the pop stars who once hesitated to call themselves feminists  —   they came around to feminism by redefining feminism around themselves. To Lady Gaga, feminism was about protecting “the integrity of women who are ambitious. ” Taylor Swift realized, she said, that she had “been taking a feminist stance without actually saying so. ” Feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation. It was less a political platform than a brand identity. In 2013, “Lean In,” by Sheryl Sandberg, raised this   subtext to the level of text. Sandberg called the book “sort of a feminist manifesto,” but it preached individual solutions to systemic problems, encouraging women to focus on “internal obstacles” and “dismantle the hurdles in ourselves. ” This feminist mode, where personal success becomes synonymous with social progress, can be plugged into any number of political orientations. The latest model for the   feminist brand is Ivanka Trump, who has built a lifestyle company under the hashtag #WomenWhoWork. A recent pitch neatly weds activist language with shoppable solutions: “We’re committed to solving problems. If we can’t find a solution, we’ll make it ourselves (case in point: the Soho Tote, the ultimate work bag). ” By the time the 2016 campaign rolled around, Clinton wasn’t just permitted to run as a feminist  —   she was practically obligated to. Her messaging shifted accordingly. Years of women’s debating the right way to be a feminist had the side effect of forcing the first female   candidate to the left. In 2008, she argued that she wanted abortion to be “safe, legal and rare  —   and by rare I mean rare. ” In last year’s debates, she stopped qualifying her support. “I will defend Planned Parenthood,” she said in one. “I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions. ” Meanwhile, her campaign mimicked the aesthetics of the   feminist mode. The candidate affirmed her feminism in a video interview with Lena Dunham, posed in a Kim Kardashian selfie and made a cameo on “Broad City. ” Her campaign posted a   listicle informing Latinos that Clinton was “just like your abuela. ” (With the Twitter hashtag #NotMyAbuela, those voters begged to differ.) Her site sold embroidered pillows that said “A Woman’s Place Is in the White House” and a   with a big “YAAAS, HILLARY!” printed over her senior portrait from high school. After Trump accused her of playing “the woman’s card,” her campaign introduced a free   “Official Hillary for America Woman Card” that drove more than $2 million in donations within days. One young woman earnestly prodded her at an Iowa campaign event: “If you could choose, would you rather be the president or Beyoncé?” Pop feminism, having been washed of its political urgency, was now being integrated back into politics at the highest level. The candidate who once shrank from feminism was positioning herself as an icon of the movement. Her image became closely aligned with two metaphors  —   the pantsuit and the glass ceiling  —   that speak to a particular kind of woman: a corporate careerist at the top of her field. A “secret” Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, popped up to encourage Clinton supporters to wear pantsuits to the polls. When she clinched the Democratic nomination for president last June  —   the one she would formally accept the following month, dressed in suffragist white  —   Clinton called back to the Seneca Falls convention of 1848, where “a small but determined group of women, and men, came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights. ” The feminist project started there, she implied  —   and she was going to finish it. When Clinton lost, pop feminism suffered a crisis. As everyone pored over exit polls, some of the   fractures between different groups of women exploded into view.   percent of black women voted for Clinton, but 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, perhaps more likely to see themselves in his vision of the world than in the pop feminism that fed Clinton’s campaign. Despite Trump’s palpable, eminently bloggable disrespect for women  —   and that infamous tape  —   he had successfully courted a faction of female voters. His win suggested that Americans were more comfortable with misogyny than many had thought, but it also burst the bubble of cheery pop feminism, which had achieved its huge popularity at the expense of class consciousness and racial solidarity. In some places, you could watch the mood turn in a matter of days. The Pantsuit Nation Facebook group ceased its celebrations and became a site for sharing stories of pain and resilience. But when the group’s founder, a Maine educator named Libby Chamberlain, announced a plan to channel the power of the group in real life, it wasn’t exactly a call to activism  —   it was a   book. “You are a force, Pantsuit Nation,” she wrote. “Let’s see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world. ” The idea brought on a revolt. “The N. R. A. with its five million members has a stranglehold on Congress,” one commenter wrote. “Pantsuit Nation has four million members and decides its main mission is ‘storytelling’ and now, selling books. What a colossal waste. ” But for some outside observers, this was a productive comeuppance. Rhon   an associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts, published “An Open Letter to White Liberal Feminists,” on the website Black Perspectives, expressing her disappointment that it had taken Donald Trump to shake them into her reality. “I am delighted that you have received the potential awakening of a lifetime, and that now you might actually get what so many of us have been describing all along,” she wrote. “Welcome to that deep perpetual angst. Embrace it, and allow it to motivate you to a deeper form of action. ” In those same November weeks, the nascent    project was navigating its own identity crisis. Some of the early organizers had    jobs  —   pastry chef, yoga instructor. One of the women, Bob Bland, a fashion designer, had amassed a small online following by designing “NASTY WOMAN” and “BAD HOMBRE”   and selling them online. “I had this whole network of ‘nasty women’ and ‘bad hombres,’’u2009” she told me. “After the election, they were looking to me like, ‘What are we going to do next? ’’u2009” Disparate organizers convened around a Facebook event announcing a Million Women March. There was one major problem with this: In 1997, activists organized a Million Woman March in Philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women. When this new march on Washington unwittingly chose a very similar name, it crystallized the idea that the nascent movement was being run by a handful of white women with no organizing history. Comments began pouring in from all sides. The organizers had stumbled into a conflict that has dogged women’s organizing from the very beginning: Of all the tensions that have coursed through the women’s movement, none has ever been quite so pronounced as the one between white and black women. Consider what happened when Sojourner Truth showed up at a women’s rights convention in Ohio in 1851. Frances Gage, the woman running the show, recalled the scene 12 years later: “The leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps. ” A “buzz of disapprobation” spread through the church. White women in attendance complained that a black woman’s testimony would distract from the convention’s focus. “Don’t let her speak, Mrs. Gage  —   it will ruin us,” one said. “Every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced. ” Throughout the convention, men arrived to speak out against women’s suffrage. Women, they said, were too weak and helpless to be trusted with the power of the vote. Because “there were very few women in those days who dared to ‘speak in meeting,’’u2009” as Gage put it, their points went unchallenged until Truth stepped forward. White women hissed, but Truth’s very identity nullified the arguments coming from both men and women in attendance. “That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere,” she said. “Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm!” She rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder. “I have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain’t I a woman?” In that moment, Truth shattered an idea of white femininity that had been used to both underpin and undermine the cause of suffrage. As a slave, she had worked in the fields like a man as a free black woman, she could not rely on the offerings of white male gentility. Gage wrote that Truth’s testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her “with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude. ” But two years later, Truth still drew jeers from white crowds when she attended women’s meetings. A vision of whiteness was ingrained in the leaders and the arguments of the mainstream movement. Even the suffragists’ signature white clothes were deliberately chosen to signal purity. This ideal of feminine virtue did not extend to black women, or   ones. Some suffragists made their racism and classism explicit. In 1894, a white woman at a meeting of the Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association complained that New York had become an “asylum for the trash of all nations,” arguing that women’s suffrage ought to be restricted. “Think what it means to give it to all women,” she said. “Our criminal and pauper men have wives there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor there are probably two million Negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals. ” One curious point of this history is that so many suffragists came from the antislavery movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, whose partnership would come to define the suffrage movement in the United States, started their activist careers as abolitionists. But after the Civil War, as black men and all women agitated for the right to vote, a political battle broke out over who would be enfranchised first. (Either way, black women would be last.) In 1865, Stanton lamented having to “stand aside to see ‘Sambo’ walk into the kingdom first,” as she put it in The National   Standard. Over time, these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions. When women’s social clubs spread across the United States at the turn of the century, two models emerged.   clubs leveraged   women’s leisure time to campaign for social reforms. Black women, who largely worked outside the home, came together around urgent needs. One of the first actions of the black Chicago Women’s Club was to raise money to prosecute a police officer who killed a black man. The main distinction between clubs, the black activist Fannie Barrier Williams wrote, was that for black women, “it is not a fad. ” Black women distinguished themselves not only as suffragists but also as vocal critics of a movement that pushed one kind of justice aside in pursuit of another. In 1913, when thousands of suffragists marched on Washington to agitate for the vote, black women were instructed to march in the back. Ida B. Wells defied the order and marched with the delegation from Illinois, her home state. She wasn’t just protesting for her right to vote. She was protesting the protest too. This dynamic is not only a thing of distant history: In the thick of feminism’s second wave, women were often still divided along lines of identity. In 1967, as the   author Betty Friedan called the first meeting of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, she found herself at odds with a black activist and lawyer named Flo Kennedy, who pushed the women around her to make common cause with the antiwar and Black Power movements. Friedan and the meeting’s host  —   Muriel Fox, the   female executive at the world’s largest   agency  —   were not pleased. As Kennedy put it in her memoirs, they “went bonkers. ” Friedan’s 1963 book, “The Feminine Mystique,” had been an awakening for a class of white, married,   women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a “mainstream” feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program. Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements. At one point, Friedan admonished her to leave the feminist movement alone and “focus her attention on matters of Black Power. ” As the second wave matured, black women found themselves continually calling on it to consider a new approach, one that acknowledged the different needs of different women. As the black feminist and leftist Barbara Smith told the National Women’s Studies Association in 1979, any feminism that didn’t account for the specific concerns of black women, poor women, disabled women, lesbians and others was not really feminism  —   it was “merely female  . ” There has never been one women’s movement. It’s difficult, for example, to say that the American feminist project started in Seneca Falls, N. Y. in 1848, because black women were not invited to that convention. It’s hard to say that electing a woman as president would have been feminism’s crowning achievement, because the success of one woman does not naturally trickle down to all. The history of the women’s movement is one of warring factions and sharp  . But its 150 years of navigating internal disputes put it in a position to lead what seemed, at the end of last fall, like a highly divided left. “It’s embarrassing to me now to say it, but I didn’t know the term ‘intersectionality’ when we started,” Bob Bland, the Women’s March   told me. Now she deployed it often to emphasize the growing diversity of the march. She told various reporters that she had met women working “in so many different intersectionalities” and hoped to reach a “a wide intersectionality of people” in a march that reflected “all of the different intersections of human rights. ” That magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw that was published in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. Crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be “compound discrimination”  —   both racial and gender biases. But they were often told they lacked legal standing: Laws protected them from discrimination as   or as women, but not specifically as black women. Crenshaw used a traffic metaphor to describe the interlocking forms of oppression a person might face. Cars flowed through an intersection in all directions when an accident happened, it could be caused by cars from any number of sides, or even all sides. That metaphor would be plucked from Crenshaw’s paper and grow in resonance over the next two decades, until “intersectionality” became a rallying cry  —   the main point of rhetorical resistance against the tide of   feminist conversation. Even beneath the shiny surface of   pop feminism, dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness, its lack of   its sometimes shallow concerns. Women of color convened on Twitter under hashtags like #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to detail their experiences of being sidelined in feminist conversations, and many on the left criticized the way a     feminism was becoming popular just as income inequality between women was ballooning. (It’s hard to “lean in” to a job cleaning hotel rooms.) In recent years, intersectionality even popped up in People. com, on Bustle and in a tweet from Clinton. Often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off, met with defensiveness, taken personally. (As the founder of Pantsuit Nation wrote to critics of her book deal: “This is not the place for divisiveness. ”) Women turn to feminism because they want to stand up and say something it can be jarring for them be told to sit down and listen to someone else. But the concept became a useful tool for the march on Washington, which set about the task of uniting feminism’s mainstream, popular arm and its dissenting factions  —   all in the space of two months. Soon after the suggestion to march raced across the web, Vanessa Wruble  —   a white producer and   of the media company OkayAfrica  —   made a pivotal intervention in its planning. “I thought the stakes were so high,” she told me. “It needed to be an inclusive movement, or it was going to be a total disaster. I felt that it could damage the country. ” At this critical moment, with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own, Wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name Million Women March. Then she linked them up with her network, and soon three seasoned activists  —   Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory  —   got on board. These women hadn’t necessarily supported Clinton, and they didn’t necessarily identify as feminists. But they had experience organizing in communities of color and saw the march as an opportunity to reach a large new audience. When Sarsour got the call, she had just posted a comment on the march’s Facebook page: “Can you include Muslim women and Muslim communities in the list?” The three women  —   one Chicana Latina, one   one black  —   met through their involvement in Justice League NYC, a   initiative. In 2015, they organized a   march from New York to Washington, ending in a rally at the Capitol that drew a small crowd. Now hundreds of thousands of women whose previous interest in justice may have been abstract at best were turning to them for leadership. The question, Perez told me, was “How do we get them to understand that their liberation is bound with ours?” Meanwhile, the three had some catching up to do with the mainstream feminist perspective. “I don’t have a lot of what I would consider to be deep, transformative relationships with white women,” Sarsour told me. “I’ve been learning a lot,” she said, and working toward becoming “more comfortable around this movement of feminism that I always felt didn’t particularly include Muslim women. ” The organizers appeared on the   radio morning show “The Breakfast Club” and loaded their Instagram page with black feminist heroes. But they also posed for windswept photos in Vogue, and some dropped by the Wing, a private Manhattan women’s club with a $2, 250 annual membership fee. Their rally put Angela Davis on the same stage as Scarlett Johansson. When I called Kimberlé Crenshaw in January, she had just returned home to Los Angeles from the march on Washington, where she walked with a group of women from the African American Policy Forum. Her group was so far back in the crowd that they couldn’t hear the rally, and “I’m kind of glad about it,” she told me. “We were in this sea of humanity. ” Wading through the crowd, she said, “I saw all the different issues and people that had found their way under the banner of the Women’s March. It was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time. ” The women’s movement’s tendency toward a singular perspective is “not an exceptional problem for feminism,” Crenshaw told me. “Patriarchy works in such a way that these critiques never even surface in a lot of movements led by men. This conversation isn’t always happening in other spaces. And if the conversation leads to more robust ways of thinking about women, feminism and social justice, it can be a very good thing. ” “The   question is: Can these feminisms live together under an   banner?” Crenshaw said. “It happened for 24 hours all across the world. ” When I made my way back to my hotel after the march, the cheers of the crowd fading into the distance, I opened my laptop and saw a different version of what I had just seen in person. Now it was all filtered through my own   bubble  —   that of a   white woman who lives in Brooklyn. Facebook’s trending topics, tailored to fulfill each user’s particular online habits, served me up a   version of the day’s events. It pointed me toward the speeches of Scarlett Johansson and Madonna, and nobody else. As scenes of the march traveled through the media and across the web, the story spun out in even more directions. Twitter lit up with notes of internal dissent and snapshots of signs from the march: DON’T FORGET: WHITE WOMEN VOTED FOR TRUMP and BLACK WOMEN TRIED TO SAVE Y’ALL and I’LL SEE YOU NICE WHITE LADIES AT THE NEXT #BLACKLIVESMATTER MARCH, RIGHT? But for the moment, at least, Trump appears to be the great uniter. In the days and weeks since the march, its energy spilled into spontaneous actions across the country, with protesters coming together on behalf of Muslims and immigrants. Donations poured into Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Congressional switchboards were inundated with calls. When The Washington Post polled Americans   it registered a huge shift in energy among Democrats, especially Democratic women, 40 percent of whom said they planned to get more involved in activism. But liberals are not the only ones drawing inspiration from the protests. Flip to Fox News, click around conservative blogs or browse   Twitter, and you can watch the demonstrations fuel a different kind of opposition narrative. After the march, Fox News set clips of rally speeches to foreboding music. Breitbart published photos with the headline “See what a massive, Hillary shaped bullet America just dodged?” The   Media Research Center aggregated the most “vile and ridiculous signs. ” Twitter exploded with   attacks on Linda Sarsour, who was called a “terrorist” who “loves ISIS. ” When the annual March for Life hit the Mall to demonstrate against abortion rights, The Blaze called it “the real women’s march. ” (The Women’s March did, at one point, remove the name of an   group from its list of partners, after an uproar.) According to Public Policy Polling, 48 percent of Trump voters think the protesters who convened at airports to protest the travel ban were paid by George Soros. Trump tweeted recently: “Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the factions that split over his election are deepening along the same lines. Each side seems oddly confident in its political position. Trump supporters call themselves “the silent majority,” while his critics identify as the “popular vote. ” When I called Eleanor Smeal, a   of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and asked her whether the organization had any plans to reach out to the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump, her response was to question the margin of error in the polls. “We don’t really know if we lost the majority or not, and I believe that we did not,” she told me. “I think they’re with us. ” For now, the factions of the left seem to have found an accord. But to regain any power in Washington, they will need to sway the center too  —   including some of those women who voted for Trump. The white women of the left, many of whom are just now finding their footing as activists, have been eager to dissociate from that group. Mention the 53 percent, and they’re quick to tell you that they’re of the 47. But of all the people who marched on Washington last month, they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle. “I know of no other time when it would be more important,” Barbara Smith, the black feminist and leftist, told me. “That’s not my work to do, but somebody ought to do it. ”"

From the:

…comes this press release that makes me wonder why the University of Virginia spent close to a half million dollars trying to keep Dr. Michael Mann’s emails out of an FOIA request and lawsuit by the State attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli and the American Tradition Institute. I think with this new revelation of apparently widespread funding duplication in science, and the active reticence to produce those emails demonstrated by UVA, the justification to see those emails has now increased.
“… over the past two decades funding agencies may have awarded millions and possibly billions of dollars to scientists who submitted the same grant request multiple times — and accepted duplicate funding.”
I’m sure that if there is no issue, UVA will work quickly to put the issue at rest. It may be nothing, and there may be no duplication of any kind, but it would benefit everyone involved to put all the UVA email issues to rest. As it says in the Nature article: “There is no implication that McIntire or any of the other researchers connected to the cases in this news story committed any wrongdoing.”. However, I don’t think that “academic freedom” ensures full autonomy with grant money. Grant recipients are still beholden to the issuing agency and the taxpayer. I’m sure if nothing else, this revelation will cause some additional investigations, and if there was any grant duplication at UVA, it can likely be determined independently as the authors have demonstrated, and confirmed with grant papers and emails.
Scientists may have received millions in duplicate funding
Virginia Tech scientists use text-mining software to find cases of duplicate funding
Big Data computation at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech reveals that over the past two decades funding agencies may have awarded millions and possibly billions of dollars to scientists who submitted the same grant request multiple times — and accepted duplicate funding.  
An analysis led by Harold R. Garner, a professor at Virginia Tech, not only indicates that millions in funding may have been granted and used inappropriately, it points to techniques to uncover existing instances of duplicate funding and ways to prevent it in the future. The analysis was presented in the comment section of this week’s Nature.
Submitting applications with identical or highly similar specific aims, goals, objectives, and hypotheses is allowed; however, accepting duplicate funding for the same project is not.
To estimate the extent of double-funding, Garner and his team, including programmer Lauren McIver, systematically compared 858,717 funded grant and contract summaries using text-similarity (text mining) software followed up by manual review.
These summaries were downloaded from public websites in the U.S. for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
Although the researchers could not definitively determine whether the similar grants were true duplicates — this would require access to the full grant files, which were not publicly available — they found strong evidence that tens of millions of dollars may have been spent on grants where at least a portion was already being funded. In the most recent five years (2007-2011), they identified 39 similar grant pairs involving more than $20 million.
“It is quite possible that our detection software missed many cases of duplication,” Garner said. “If text similarity software misses as many cases of funding duplications as it does plagiarism of scientific papers we’ve studied, then the extent of duplication could be much larger. It could be as much as 2.5 percent of total research funding, equivalent to $5.1 billion since 1985.”
Co-researcher and medical science ethicist Michael B. Waitzkin said, “In line with the Government Accountability Office report issued February 2012, these findings suggest the research community should undertake a more thorough investigation of the true extent of duplication and establish, clearer and more consistent guidance and coordination of grant and contract funding across agencies, both public and private.”
The researchers did not reveal specific principal investigators or research organizations identified as double-dippers, but said that no instances of double dipping were found at Virginia Tech.

"When fish get thirsty do they drink sea water? – Torben, aged nine, Sussex, UK. This is a great question, Torben, thanks very much for sending it in.  The short answer is yes, some fish do drink seawater – but not all of them. Fish are amazing animals, and have some very cool solutions to living in water. Naturally, different types of fish have evolved different solutions.  The bony kinds of fish that live in the sea – such as cod, herring, tuna and so on – have a few ways of getting water in and out of the body. As well as swallowing and peeing, like humans do, these fish can pass it through their skin and gills. Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskids@theconversation.com. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our very best. To understand how this works, you first need to know that bony fish have a different concentration of salt in their bodies to their environment. This means they’re more or less salty than the water they swim in.  The bodies of marine fish (which live in the sea) are less salty than the water they swim in, while the bodies of freshwater fish (which live in rivers and lakes) are more salty than the water they swim in.  Both marine and freshwater fish have to control the amount of water and salt in their bodies, to stay healthy and hydrated.  Bony marine fish are constantly losing water from their body, through a process called “osmosis”“. During osmosis, water moves through a membrane (like skin), from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration.  Remember, the body of a marine fish is less salty than the seawater it swims in – which means it has a lower concentration of salt. So these fish actually lose water through osmosis: it passes from their body, through their skin and gills, out into the sea.   Since they’re constantly losing water this way, these fish have to drink a lot of seawater to stay hydrated.  You might be interested to know that the opposite happens in freshwater fish. Water flows into their body through osmosis, instead of out. This means they don’t generally need to drink – but they do have to pee a lot. We all know that too much salt is bad for us. So of course, an animal that drinks seawater must have a way to get rid of excess salt.  Marine fish have kidneys, which pump excess salt into their pee so they can get it out of their bodies. They also have special cells in their gills that pump excess salt out into the sea. Together, these two systems mean that marine fish can stay hydrated.  Sharks have evolved a completely different system. Their bodies have a slightly higher concentration of salt than seawater. This means they don’t have the problem that bony fish have, of losing water through their skin all the time. Sharks have high levels of waste chemicals – called urea and trimethylamine N-oxide – in their body, which other animals would usually get rid of. Sharks keep them in their body, which keeps them ""salty”.  Sharks take in small amounts of water through their gills (by osmosis – because they are slightly saltier than the sea) which means they don’t directly have to drink.  Sharks also have a salt gland (in their rectum) to get rid of any excess salt they may have.  The problem of drinking seawater isn’t just for fish. Some seabirds – albatrosses, for example – have to drink seawater too. Like sharks, these seabirds have a salt gland to get rid of excess salt. But on an albatross it is found at the top of the bird’s beak.  Children can have their own questions answered by experts – just send them in to Curious Kids, along with the child’s first name, age and town or city. You can: Here are some more Curious Kids articles, written by academic experts: Why do some animals have two different coloured eyes? – George, aged ten, Hethersett, UK. How high could I jump on the moon? – Miles, aged five, London, UK. Why are the bubbles in fizzy drink so small? The ones I blow are much bigger - Alison, aged seven, Aberdeen, UK."
"**Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are two of only three areas in England which will be in tier one from next Wednesday.**
MPs and businesses have welcomed the news and spoken of ""relief"" at ""the end of a difficult year"".
The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are the only areas in tier one.
One Cornwall MP warned against the grading being ""grounds for complacency"".
Amy Newland, from the White Hart pub in Chilsworthy, said: ""I'm extremely relieved, at least we know that we can trade normally.""
She added that she felt sorry for pubs in neighbouring Devon which will be under tougher tier two restrictions.
""It's mixed emotions but a huge relief for us,"" she said.
Paul Eaton, who runs the Royal Inn at Horsebridge, near Tavistock, just inside the Devon border, said: ""Some of my regulars are already planning where they can go in Cornwall.
""It's a long border, with pubs scattered both sides.""
Kim Conchie, chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said it had been ""a difficult year"" but this marked ""the first stage of securing jobs and companies for our future"".
Holiday homes letting agent Lin Wallis in Cornwall tweeted she had five inquiries in 10 minutes after the announcement.
In the seven days to last Saturday the rate of infections in Cornwall was 59 per 100,000 people, the England average was 169.
In the same period there were 337 new cases, down by 176 on the previous week.
Steve Double, Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, said Cornwall returning to tier one restrictions was ""particularly good news for the thousands of hospitality businesses"".
He added: ""However whilst we can welcome this news it should be no grounds for complacency.""
Tier one means people can meet indoors and out up to a maximum group of six, pubs and restaurants can re-open, closing at 23:00 GMT but people will still be encouraged to work from home.
Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up:
The system will be regularly reviewed and an area's tier level may change before Christmas - the first review is scheduled for 16 December."

By Viv Forbes

A scheming cabal of green bureaucrats, academics and corporate speculators is trying to scare us into a mess of energy taxes, subsidies and rationing in order to combat what they call “catastrophic man-made global warming”.
Climate alarmists speculate that if the level of harmless carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is doubled (which may or may not happen in a century or so), world temperature may be one or two degrees warmer than it would have otherwise been.

The proposition that this mild warming, if it occurs, would be “catastrophic” is so laughable that they had to invent “positive feedbacks” to multiply this scare to maybe six degrees in a century. However the emerging evidence, and Earth’s past history, show that feedbacks are negative – the vast oceans tend to stabilise warming temperatures so that even the two degree forecast is probably excessive.
In many places in Australia, temperature rises about sixteen degrees from dawn to mid-afternoon – over say eight hours, or two degrees per hour. So people who can cope with a daily warming of 16 degrees over 8 hours are supposed to panic about a fudged forecast of two degrees over a century – about the warming we feel in just one hour every morning. Even less “frightening” is the less than one degree of warming that has occurred over the last 200 years.
Why worry about warming anyhow?
The world has never suffered “runaway global warming” even when carbon dioxide levels were far above those of today. But it does suffer regular ice ages. It is not warmth that causes hardship and mass extinctions – it is the deathly grip of ice. The Little Ice Age that ended just 150 years ago was a time of failed crops, abandoned farms, advancing glaciers and famines. Even in modern times, there are more deaths caused by winter cold snaps than by summer heat waves. And those people free to move (tourists and retirees) always flock to warm places like Florida, Bali and the Riviera, not to frigid climes like Siberia, Alaska or Antarctica.
Moreover, more warmth always causes extra evaporation from lakes and oceans. What goes up, must form clouds and come down somewhere as extra precipitation. And if there is more carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, plants will grow better. Why do we need carbon taxes and ration cards to protect us from a warm moist climate with more luxuriant plant life?
The whole climate scam is just a smoke screen to hide the UN inspired grab for more taxes and more power.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Westfalen-Blatt quotes Russian news agency Itar-Tass:
After a failed rescue attempt by an icebreaker sent to free 74 participants of an Antarctic expedition that became trapped in polar ice, a large number of them are to be rescued by air.
It has been decided to rescue 52 passengers and four crew members using a helicopter from the Chinese “Snow Dragon” ice breaker, so reports the Itar-Tass news agency Monday, refering to the Russian Foreign Ministry.”
It appears the Russians see no further purpose for the scientists to remain on their MS Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel, which they’ve hired out to them, and will leave behind a bare crew of 18 in the hopes of salvaging the ship. The Akademik Shokalskiy has been trapped in unexpected dense, thick sea ice since December 24.
Stormy forecast
Whether conditions will allow a helicopter rescue on Tuesday is questionable. The weather forecast for Mawson shows blizzardy conditions through Tuesday. Currently winds are blowing at near 70 km/h from 120° east-southeast. Temperatures will fall over the course of the next 10 days.

The Westfalen-Blatt writes that there is no information on when and how the remaining 18 will be rescued.
Turney gets dose of “shocking” reality
The last rescue attempt by an Australian icebreaker was abandoned due to a “dangerous snowstorm” which expedition leader Chris Turney called “shocking”.
Imagine that: global warming causing a million extra square kilometers of thick, impenetrable sea ice and dangerous, “shocking” snowstorms.
This is what we call fantasy being contradicted by reality.

I would not have believed this if I didn’t see it in print. It’s another example of the playbook pioneered by the late Dr. Steven Schneider. Bolding mine.

“This is a Sophie’s Choice: If we respond to the moral imperative to raise public awareness and alarm about climate, we have to be deceptive.
If we are committed to truth and scientific accuracy, we have to talk in hedged, caveat-filled, probabilistic language that is utterly ineffectual in reaching and activating a tuned-out public.” -David Roberts, Grist

h/t to Tom Fuller
UPDATE: 11/2/12 On Twitter, David Roberts is claiming that I’ve misrepresented his position, and called me a “hack” for printing this.



  

David Roberts


 @drgrist 





@wattsupwiththat I called it a “false dichotomy.” You presented it as my view. Don’t blame your hackery on me.



I replied that the article was misleading:



  

Watts Up With That @wattsupwiththat
01 Nov





@drgrist then learn not to write misleading articles






  

Watts Up With That @wattsupwiththat
01 Nov





@drgrist if you have a disclaimer, such as should have been with original, happy to add it. Post stays because your wrote those words, notme







  

David Roberts


 @drgrist 


@wattsupwiththat I didn’t do enough to prevent your misunderstanding, so you’re sticking with it?






  

Watts Up With That @wattsupwiththat
01 Nov





@drgrist just add disclaimer that you don’t endorse what u wrote in that para to ur article, assuming isn’t insult re: this, I’ll add it.







  

David Roberts


 @drgrist 


@wattsupwiththat It’s not my job to correct your posts. You know it’s wrong & misleading. You can choose to leave it up or not.



From my perspective, it looks more like he’s embarrassed about it after the fact, maybe because he was getting some flak. The problem with his argument is that his “false dichotomy” statement is three paragraphs above the one where he talks about the “Sophie’s Choice” and to me there’s not an obvious statement that he doesn’t believe what he wrote.
My offer is that if he wants to distance himself from that paragraph, he can add a disclaimer or clarification, and I’ll be happy to follow up with that here. I think it is a fair offer.
Why don’t I believe him about his “Sophie’s Choice” paragraph as not being his view? it has a lot to do with statements like this:
Grist Magazine’s staff writer David Roberts called for the Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” who were members of what he termed the global warming “denial industry.”
Roberts wrote in the online publication on September 19, 2006, “When we’ve finally gotten serious about global warming, when the impacts are really hitting us and we’re in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage, we should have war crimes trials for these bastards — some sort of climate Nuremberg.” (http://gristmill.grist.org/print/2006/9/19/11408/1106?show_comments=no )
Source: http://epw.senate.gov/fact.cfm?party=rep&id=264568
When a person has tendency to make such hateful and outlandish claims, one tends to believe that he’d make another similar claim, especially since he has not retracted his Nuremberg claim.
If Mr. Roberts does not believe what he wrote about “Sophie’s Choice” I’ll happily issue a correction here if he makes a caveat, disclaimer, or clarification to that effect on his own article.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s becoming very clear that the real thrust behind the anthropogenic global warming movement is the systematic denial of cheap, efficient energy for the poor world so that they never attain a standard of living that developed countries have long been enjoying. Bill Nye confirms it in a debate with Marc Morano on FOX.

Image cropped from www.mrctv.org/videos.
In a FOX News debate here Bill Nye keeps repeating that the big problem today is that the planet is inhabited by more than 7 billion people. Yes it’s a grave problem that so many people are living, he would like us to think.
At the 9:30 mark he says the problem is that poor people “are using more energy than they ever used to use“. Yet Bill Nye has no qualms whatsoever about his comfortable and prosperous life, which is in large part due to the exploitation and amazing use of the energy he now says has to be denied to the poor.

Marc Morano’s shocked reaction is palpable: “Who is Bill Nye to tell them they cannot have more carbon-based energy?“.
If the global warming fraudsters ever got their way with energy policy, the chances are high we’d see a mass die-off and extremely violent uprising. People with nothing to lose usually react like they’ve got nothing to lose. Thankfully, the poor aren’t listening: India, China and many developing countries are building fossil fuel power plants faster than ever.
Even in rich Germany the government is scaling back on green energies because the population here is so angered over the high energy prices and the false promises made.
Moderator John Stossel at the end adds: “This idea that politicians can fix the climate strikes me as arrogant.”
It is. No one has that kind of power. Anyone claiming they do is either totally ignorant or just a plain fraudster.

"David Attenborough is to publish his “vision for the future” of Earth this autumn, laying out “the dreadful damage” done by humanity, and the ways “we can begin to turn things round”. A Life on Our Planet, which the 94-year-old has described as his “witness statement”, will cover his career documenting the natural world and his first-hand observations of the decline of the planet’s environment and biodiversity, as well as possible solutions.  “This book records some of the dreadful damage mankind has already wrought upon the natural world, and the real and imminent danger that things could get much, much worse if we do not act now,” said Attenborough. “But it is also a hopeful book: it offers a different future. It describes some of the ways in which we can begin to turn things around, if only we all have the will to do so. Surely together we must now find that determination, and begin to make that change, for the sake of all the inhabitants of our planet.” The broadcaster and natural historian said he has had “an extraordinary life”, and that “it’s only now that I appreciate how extraordinary”. He added: “As a young man, I felt I was out there in the wild, experiencing the untouched natural world – but it was an illusion. The tragedy of our time has been happening all around us, barely noticeable from day to day: the loss of our planet’s wild places, its biodiversity. I have been a witness to this decline, and this book contains my witness statement, and my vision for the future – the story of how we came to make this, our greatest mistake. And how, if we act now, we can yet put it right.” Attenborough, whose career with the BBC spans six decades, has written several bestselling books including Adventures of a Young Naturalist, Journeys to the Other Side of the World, Life on Air and Life on Earth. Publisher Ebury described A Life on Our Planet as “legacy-defining” for Attenborough. It will be released in October, coinciding with a Netflix documentary film of the same name commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund. “It’s David’s masterpiece – a book with huge heart and urgency, and a message the world needs now more than ever,” said publisher Albert DePetrillo, who is using the book as the launch title for a new imprint devoted to natural history books by writers who help us “see the world, and make it better”."

As I’ve noted previously in this space, the Justice Department has been strenuously ramping up prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the law that criminalizes many of the sorts of official payments that alas typify the business climate across much of the globe. Per Shannon Green at Corporate Counsel, “2011 Was a Banner Year for FCPA Enforcements and Trials.” Unfortunately, as I argued in that earlier post, the law is so vague, uncertain and unpredictable in its reach that many businesspersons risk prosecution even though it is far from clear that their actions actually did violate the law.   
  
  
Don’t just take my word for it: ask federal judges. Over the past two months alone they’ve thrown out three high‐​profile FCPA prosecutions in whole or part after finding the Department hadn’t proved its case.   
  
  
On Monday U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston, after hearing the prosecution case, dismissed the jury and summarily tossed out DoJ’s 12‐​count FCPA indictment against John O’Shea, an executive with the Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd., over allegedly improper payments in Mexico. Judge Hughes “said O’Shea’s conduct was reasonably explained by lawful motives,” to quote FCPA Blog. He also dismissed a conspiracy count. C. M. Matthews at the WSJ’s Corruption Currents Blog has more on the case. (O’Shea continues to face some other counts, in particular under the federal “money laundering” statute, itself a case study in rampant overcriminalization.)   
  
  
Last month district judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C. dismissed conspiracy charges against six defendants caught in an African arms‐​trade “sting” operation, which resulted in the outright acquittal of one of the defendants, Stephen G. Giordanella, who unlike the others faced no substantive FCPA charges. Earlier, Judge Leon criticized federal prosecutors for “sharp” tactics in handling evidence of interest to the defense.   
  
  
And DoJ’s most stinging embarrassment of all came last month as well, when federal judge Howard Matz in Los Angeles — quoting the WSJ again — “threw out the landmark FCPA conviction of Lindsey Manufacturing Co., the first company convicted under the law, and offered a scathing assessment of the Justice Department’s handling of the case.” Specifically,   




it is with deep regret that this Court is compelled to find that the Government team allowed a key FBI agent to testify untruthfully before the grand jury, inserted material falsehoods into affidavits submitted to magistrate judges in support of applications for search warrants and seizure warrants, improperly reviewed e‐​mail communications between one Defendant and her lawyer, recklessly failed to comply with its discovery obligations, posed questions to certain witnesses in violation of the Court’s rulings, engaged in questionable behavior during closing argument and even made misrepresentations to the Court.



Efforts to reform the substance of FCPA are picking up steam in Congress, and that’s all to the good. But equally or more vital to the public liberty is countering the danger of out‐​of‐​control federal prosecution, which we’ve seen lately in fields ranging from environmental enforcement to dubious obstruction‐​of‐​justice charges. Isn’t it time for Congress to use its oversight powers more vigorously?

"Rates of climate change in the world’s ocean depths could be seven times higher than current levels by the second half of this century even if emissions of greenhouse gases were cut dramatically, according to new research. Different global heating at different depths could have major impacts on ocean wildlife, causing disconnects as species that rely on each other for survival are forced to move.  In the new research, scientists looked at a measure called climate velocity – the speed at which species would need to move to stay within their preferred temperature range as different ocean layers warm. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found different parts of the ocean would change at different rates as the extra heat from increasing levels of greenhouse gases moved through the vast ocean depths. By the second half of the century, the study found “a rapid acceleration of climate change exposure throughout the water column”. The study used climate models to first estimate the current rates of climate velocity at different ocean depths, and then future rates under three scenarios – one where emissions started to fall from now; another where they began to fall by the middle of this century; and a third where emissions continued to rise up to 2100. Prof Jorge García Molinos, a climate ecologist at Hokkaido University and a co-author of the study, said: “Our results suggest that deep sea biodiversity is likely to be at greater risk because they are adapted to much more stable thermal environments.” At present, the world’s heating was already causing species to shift in all layers of the ocean from the surface to more than 4km down, but at different speeds. But even under a highly optimistic scenario, where emissions fell sharply from now, the ocean’s mesopelagic layer – from 200m to 1km down – climate velocity would change from about 6km per decade to 50km by the second half of the century. But over the same period, climate velocity would halve at the surface. Even at depths of between 1,000 and 4,000 metres, climate velocity would triple current rates, even if emissions dropped sharply. Prof Anthony Richardson, of the University of Queensland and the CSIRO and one of the study’s 10 authors, told Guardian Australia: “What really concerns us is that as you move down through the ocean, climate velocity moves at different speeds.” This could create a disconnect for species that rely on organisms in different layers. For example, Richardson said tuna lived in the mesopelagic layer between 200 and 1,000 metres deep, but they relied on plankton species near the surface. He said because the planet’s oceans were so large and stored so much heat, “warming already absorbed at the ocean surface will mix into deeper waters.” “This means that marine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now.” Isaac Brito-Morales, the study’s lead author and a researcher at the University of Queensland, said: “Because the deep ocean has a more stable temperature, any small increase will have an impact on species – they’re more at risk than those at the surface.” Richardson added it was “concerning” their results showed, as well as different rates of climate velocity at different depths, the direction that species would need to move wasn’t uniform either. This could mean that marine park areas designed to protect different species or habitats could become compromised as species moved out of the protected areas into unprotected areas."

As if we didn’t already know…



Bryce Edwards writes for _The Guardian_ this week and expresses disappointment that Jacinda, known as the anti-Trump, is clearly nothing of the sort. To be honest, I am somewhat relieved that she does not appear to have been as rude to him as she was at their first meeting. Maybe Jacinda has realised that diplomacy is the only way to get what you want, and calling the POTUS ‘orange’ is probably not the way to get a reduction in tariffs or a free trade deal. She got neither, of course, but at least she appears to have remained civil, thereby increasing our chances for concessions from zero to not much.



Ardern’s liberal supporters see her as the polar opposite of the US president, and she has even been labelled the “anti-Trump”. They expected her in some way to speak truth to power when meeting the man who has become synonymous with the most reactionary problems in politics today. More than anything, Ardern might have been expected to use the opportunity to push Trump hard on the issue of climate change.



Instead, Ardern came out of the meeting typically upbeat, exuding her trademark diplomacy. She described the meeting as a “perfectly productive, warm, solid bilateral”, trotting out the usual platitudes about US-NZ relations, and highlighting Trump’s purported interest in New Zealand.



Her ‘trademark diplomacy’? Is Bryce Edwards being facetious here, or has he forgotten her scowling at Mike Pence, calling Trump ‘orange’ and railing against him when he told the four troublesome Congresswomen to go back to their own countries and fix up the mess there?



Unfortunately for Ardern, the New Zealand media is now giving plenty of coverage of her positivity towards Trump, mixed with reports of dissatisfaction over her failure to push climate change action at the meeting. And to make matters worse for her, Trump has now tweeted that the good news stories about their conversation are “true” and that it was “A wonderful meeting!” 



He is still a democratically elected premier (which is more than can be said for Ardern) and deserves some respect as a result. For once, Jacinda seems to have behaved herself.



It will not please many of her supporters though.



Ardern isn’t supposed to be a traditional PM. She came to power riding a wave of enthusiasm for being different. Jacindamania was based on the expectation that she would do politics differently and would reject business as usual. She promised “transformational change”. 



Now this anti-Trump politician has had her first formal meeting with the real Trump, and nothing much has changed. While no one can have reasonably expected that her meeting with Trump would produce immediate results, there was certainly an expectation that she would at least emphasise the need for action on climate change. 



It seems she was more interested in getting Trump to break the Second Amendment (which he will never do) or pushing her Christchurch Call agenda, where she thinks she can stop the next massacre by depriving law-abiding citizens of guns and stopping downloading live streams on the internet. It is a bit like having to declare all liquids and cosmetics on an aeroplane; the next massacre will use a different method. But Jacinda doesn’t seem to realise that yet.



Ardern is also fighting a rising tide of cynicism at home over whether her actions match her rhetoric. The New Zealand Labour party and, crucially, Ardern’s own office, is currently embroiled in a major sexual assault scandal. This is on the heels of failures to deliver promised changes – most notably the flagship housing policy has turned into a train wreck that her government is trying to salvage, without much success. 



It is worse than that. For all that Ardern tries to paint herself as a champion of climate change, the reality at home is somewhat different. The Zero Carbon Bill is failing on all fronts, because there is no agreement between the coalition partners, and it is most unlikely that it will be saved by the opposition. To continue to wear her halo on the international stage, Jacinda has to walk the walk. Much to our relief back home, she clearly isn’t doing that. 



It is all very well to parade this virtuous position to the eco-warriors at the UN, but at the moment, this is not being matched with domestic reality. Jacinda will not be able to get away with telling two different stories for much longer. 



Ardern’s performance in New York is not going to be enough to assuage the uneasy feeling that for all Ardern’s claims to be different, it’s very much business as usual.



She described climate change in her speech at the UN as an “extraordinary threat” but, right now, her response to that threat is looking – as we say _–_ “pretty ordinary”.



  
Don’t get me wrong. The last thing I want is for our farmers to be forced into bankruptcy because of the Zero Carbon Bill, but Jacinda will not be able to have it both ways. Very soon, the world will be able to see that she is nothing more than hot air and good intentions. We already know this, of course, but Jacinda’s saintly international reputation is taking a hit. 



I cannot wait for the world to realise how hypocritical and ineffectual Jacinda really is. She is good at championing minor causes that may look good, but will never change anything. We know this.



Now the rest of the adoring world are going to see it too. Yee ha.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Well, folks have been asking me about my autobiography. It’s not done. Dunno what to say except that writing about my life is a long and slow task, partly because of the variety in my life, partly because there’s no surprises ’cause I’ve heard the whole thing so it gets boring at times, and mostly because far too often my monkey-mind sees something shiny and goes haring off after it, leaving autobiographical scribing for a future date.
So anyhow, to fill in the time until the autobiography is finished, here’s part of the story of my looney life. This was something that occurred back in 1984, and it has nothing to do with weather or climate at all. A friend and I had been hired to go to Fiji, with my lovely ex-fiancee of over 30 years now, to install a blast freezer on a beautiful 60-foot (18 metre) steel sailboat called the Askoy II. We just called her “the noble Askoy”, we lived on her while we did the work. My wife was ship’s nurse and cook, my friend and I built and installed the freezer.

Figure 1. The noble Askoy under sail off of Suva Harbour, 1984.
A few years after the crew and I finished installing the blast freezer and we left the boat, the Askoy was later bought by smugglers, used in some illegitimate ventures, and subsequently seized in Fiji. There she sat at the dock for a few years, eventually sinking and being refloated there, still tied to the dock. A friend of mine named Lindsay bought her at auction for a thousand bucks. He fixed her up and went to take her to his home, New Zealand. Just as he arrived, the engine died and she went up on the beach …


where she sat for years before being rescued by some Belgians. Turns out the boat was once owned for a few years by Jacques Brel, one of the few Belgian stars, and before that, she was the pride of the Royal Belgian Yacht Club, so a bunch of Belgican folks put together a foundation and salvaged her from the beach and took her back to Belgia, her ancestral home, as you see below

where she’s now been refitted and is almost ready for sea again. Lindsay’s story of the Askoy and the wreck and the subsequent salvage is here. … but dang it, the story of the noble Askoy, that’s another story, not the story I set out to tell. See, that’s the problem with writing an autobiography, you get side-tractored all over the dang place, it’s hard to hold a fixed course in that kind of weather. Anyhow, the noble Askoy now looks like this, hooray, she lives again,

and is slated to put to sea again in the New Year, 2013. The history of the Askoy is here, and of Harlow Jones, her erstwhile captain that I worked for at the time, and the Harlow Island Packet Trading Company … but there it is, I’m getting diverticulated again, that’s enough about a marvelous boat returned Lazarus-like from death on a distant beach. Here’s the story I started to tell you, a story of modern piracy, from the time when my gorgeous ex-fiancee and I were living on the noble Askoy and working on the blast freezer, anchored up just offshore from the Royal Suva Yacht Club.
==================================================
“Piracy?? … You boys don’t know what piracy is these days …”
I was in a group of sailors sitting in the bar at the Royal Suva Yacht Club, some of us from the Askoy crew and some off other boats, watching one of those lovely Fijian sunsets and talking over stories we’d heard about recent acts of piracy — yachts lost in the Southern Philippines, Vietnamese boat people savaged by Thai ‘fishermen’, rape and murder in the Straits of Singapore. This was back in the eighties, before the Somalis pretty much got a lock on that particular sector of the black economy.
Old Bill sat next to the group of us, about six beers into his usual evening. Bill was an Englishman, who usually bored everyone with his highly doubtful story that he was married to Samoan royalty. He must have been listening in on our conversation, because he said “I had the bad luck to find out about modern piracy. You think it’s all pistols and eye patches? Well, that was in the old days. Modern piracy’s different, let me tell you.”
We waited for him to ‘tell us’, but he just sat quietly looking at the bar. After a while, the message got through, and we asked Waisaki to bring him another beer. “Better make it a Black Russian,” Bill said. Waisaki brought the Black Russian, smiled, didn’t say anything, just listening to the story. Bill drank it in one swallow. “Black Russians lubricate the throat, y’know. Medical fact … now, where was I?”
“Modern piracy.”
“Oh, yes. Well, this all started when I was fishing up in Samoa. Tuna fishing on my own boat, as sweet a boat as you might ever want to see. Fifty-six foot long, all the modern gear. Name of the ‘White Star’. I was making good money fishing it, I was sitting pretty. Fridays, I would come back into Apia, spend the weekend with my young wife. Did I ever tell you I was married to Samoan Royalty?”
We allowed that yes, he had indeed told us that.
“They must have been watching me and knew my schedule, because one Monday morning, I came down to the docks, and my beautiful boat was gone! … Gone, dammit! When I asked around, some people said that three guys had come down on Friday night, gone on board, started it up, and drove it out of the harbor.
“I called the authorities, we put the word out, I even hired a helicopter, but that was a thousand bucks an hour for nothing. I was furious, all my money was tied up in that boat, gone …”
The word “gone” reminded him of his glass, and he looked at it until we signaled to Waisaki to fill it up again. Waisaki smiled. “Make it a double,” Bill said. When it came, he drank it in one swallow … “Where was I?”
“Gone.”
“No I wasn’t, I was telling a story.”
“Modern piracy.”
“Oh, right. Well, we didn’t find the boat. I was in a blue funk. Then, about three weeks later, I flew from Samoa to Fiji on some business, and damned if the ‘White Star’ wasn’t sitting at the dock in Suva, looking pretty run down. I went to the police, filled out the forms, and had the boat impounded.”
“What luck!”, someone said, “did you get it back?”
“I’m coming to that. The guys on board claimed to be the real owners of the boat … said they had a Bill of Sale from me, with what they claimed was my signature at the bottom. Bunch of damned forgers, they were. So I filed a complaint and took ‘em to court. The court said the calendar was crowded, it would be a couple of weeks until the case would be heard, so they put a guard on the boat and we all settled down to wait.”
“Who were these guys?”
“Well, they claimed that they were part of some corporation called ‘Deep Sea Limited’, out of Australia.”
“Couldn’t you prove it wasn’t your signature on the Bill of Sale?”
“I figured I might, but I talked to a barrister and found out how that one goes. You get an expert to say it isn’t your signature, they get two experts to say it is, you get three experts, they get four … it goes on forever.” The word ‘forever’ seemed to send him into a brown study … or perhaps it was a Black study, so we gave Waisaki the high sign again. “Make it two doubles,” Bill said. I doubted very much if one of them was for any of us. He drank the first one in a single swallow. … “Where was I?”
“Signatures.”
“Right … Turned out the signature didn’t mean a damned thing anyhow, ‘cause one morning I was driving down the hill into Suva, you know the road by the old cemetery with the view of the harbor, and I saw the ‘White Star’ heading out the channel past the wreck of the old ‘Nam Hai’ … sonsabitches had gotten the guard drunk, and made off with my boat again. I drove like hell over to the Fiji Navy Base. The Commander got their boat fired up, guys were running all around, the Commander said ‘How fast does your boat go?’ I said ‘Eleven knots’ … all the activity died down. ‘Let’s go, they’re getting away,’ I shouted. The Commander said ‘Our fastest boat only does 10 knots …’”
“A trifle slow for a stern chase,” I commented.
“Modern piracy,” Bill said, and drank down the second double.
“What did you do?” There was another long pause, and another nod to Waisaki … “Make it a pitcher,” he said, “saves trouble in the long run.” Waisaki brought the pitcher of Black Russians and smiled, a big easy knowing Fijian kind of smile. He’d heard all of Bill’s stories more than once. “Where was I?” Bill asked.
“Moving a little bit slow to catch the boat.”
“Oh yes. Well, they had let slip that the ‘Deep Sea Limited’ corporation was based out of Brisbane. I’d be buggered if I’d let them get away with it, and the boat was worth about two hundred thousand dollars, so I flew down to Oz, and started searching the harbors. Before too long, a little harbor north of Brisbane, bingo, there she was. Repainted, with a different name, but the same boat, same hull number welded over the bulkhead. I went down to the Australian authorities, swore out a complaint, and had the boat impounded again.
“Just like in Fiji, the Aussies told me that the court calendar was a bit crowded … only the Aussies said that it would be fourteen months before they could hear my case, guess there’sa lotta pirates in Australia. Anyhow, they put a guard on the boat, and said that the two parties to the case had to share the cost of the guard. And the Australians had a real guard service, not another alky like in Fiji.”
“How much did that cost?”
“Fourteen hundred Australian a month.”
“Not cheap, but I guess it’s worth it. So what happened?”
“Well, nothing’s happened yet, that was all only seven months ago … no, no, something has happened. The goddam corporation filed for bankruptcy. They said that I had tied up their only asset, that they had no money … of course it was all a scam to get out of paying for the guard. So now, I’ve either got to drop the case, or pay for the guard by myself, fourteen hundred a month … I’ll be bankrupt for real myself before the goddamn case even gets to court, and if I can’t pay for the guard service, then the case is dropped and I’ve lost my boat. Now that, boys, is what I call modern piracy. No AK-47 machine guns, no eye patches, no rape and pillage, no walking the plank … just courts and writs and signatures and impoundments and guards and you get a bill from the pirates for fourteen hundred a month to guard your own damn boat … real modern, all right.”
By this time, we had all started helping ourselves to Black Russians from the pitcher, and we were young and full of fire, so we started to figure out how we might be able to help old Bill get his boat back. He assured us that yes, the Australian Navy definitely did have boats that would do more than eleven knots, so no, we couldn’t just drive the boat away. However, he had a complicated plan that involved getting the boat out of the harbor and then painting it at sea, and using some plywood to make a false superstructure which might pass inspection from a distance, and sailing it back to Samoa where his relatives in the Government would keep the boat safe … but by that time, the velvety tropical russian blackness had started to close in around everyone’s brain, and the rest of the evening is unfortunately lost to history.
In the morning we all went back to our boats or our jobs or both. The plan to save the ‘White Star’ from the modern pirates remained, though, and it was discussed with old Bill, and improved on for a few days. But then new interests came up, and it gradually faded, and eventually was not heard of again.
And that might have been the end of it, except that it was such a good story to tell.
I told people about the modern pirates with their writs and their court cases on various occasions, and one day a few years later in the ’90s, through a series of misunderstandings and coincidences I chanced to be sitting once again in the very same bar of the Royal Suva Yacht Club. Waisaki was still behind the counter. There I met an interesting man and we got to talking about piracy back in the ’80s.
“The best story about piracy I’ve heard was the story of old Bill and the ‘White Star’,” I said.
“Yeah, I heard all about that,” he said.
“Oh, you heard the story?”
“I knew Bill,” he said. “In the end, the whole thing drove the corporation bankrupt.”
“Of course, that was all a scam,” I said.
“Yes, that was finally proved in court,” he said.
“Oh, it finally went to trial?” I asked. “Did he get his boat back?”
“Whose boat?”
“Old Bill’s boat. The ‘White Star’.”
There was a long pause, and then in a slightly incredulous tone of voice he said “Old Bill’s boat?” I nodded assent.
“What’re you talking about? Bill never owned that boat in his life!”, he said scornfully. “The ‘White Star’ belonged to three Australian farmers who’d had a good year and figured they would buy a boat. But the poor buggers didn’t know anything about fishing, so they set up a corporation to fish it, looked around for somebody to run it for them, and had the bad luck to find old Bill.
“He took the lease on the boat all right, ran it up to Samoa, and then he had a Bill of Sale made out and forged the signatures on it. When they heard about it, they went to the Samoan authorities, but the Samoans just laughed. Did he tell ever you he was married to Samoan royalty? Turns out he was. He used his connections to hold on to the boat. In desperation, they finally had to steal it themselves, and he chased those poor farmers around half the Pacific trying to steal it back again. He knew that if he could just get it back to Samoa, he and his relatives would make sure that it would never be lost again. I even heard rumors at one point that he’d recruited a bunch of young studs with more balls than brains, he’d conned them with some story, the fools were going to go down to Australia and help him steal the boat away from the Australian courts, but I guess that never came to anything …”
Since his tale was in full spate, I considered it an act of mercy not to increase the burden of his store of knowledge on that particular point … he continued:
“In the end, the farmers almost lost the court battle when Bill came up with two bullshit experts to claim that the signatures on the Bill of Sale were real. The case went right down to the wire before the farmers won, and even then all they got was their own boat back, never mind all the time and money they had lost, and their corporation bankrupt … yeah, you’re right, that is about the best story of modern piracy that I’ve heard.” We both laughed. His laugh was somewhat more hearty than mine. I didn’t press the subject after that, and in a bit he left the bar.
I sat there in the lovely Fijian warmth … I thought about all of that for a while as I watched the sunset … asked Waisaki to bring a couple of Black Russians. He brought the drinks … smiled … didn’t say a word. He’d heard all the stories. I lifted the glass, and I drank one of the Black Russians straight down in one swallow as a toast, and then sat and nursed the other one until the bar closed, gazing out over the night-time harbour toward the mooring spot where my love and I had once lived and worked with Harlow and the crew on the noble Askoy.
w.
PS—Of course, the South Pacific being a tiny place in some ways, it was fated that I would run into old Bill again, when he managed to sink an sixty foot (18 m) barge in Lautoka Harbour in Fiji, and my friend and I had to get out the scuba tanks and the underwater welding gear and go down and refloat it from where it was sitting, 30 feet (9 m) down on the bottom of the briny blue … but again, that’s another story, and I’m out of Black Russians.
Bill was a classic character of the South Pacific, though, and a con artist through and through. A friend of Bill’s once told me “Most con artists, their problem is they can tell you a story that is so good, so well crafted, that you’ll believe it without question. But Bill’s worse than that, he’s got it so bad he can’t escape—that poor boy tells his stories so damn well that he’s ended up believing all of them himself”.

It seems disdain for “consensus” as we know it is nothing new:

“A consensus means that everyone agrees to say collectively what no one believes individually.”

"EVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It’s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable. Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the   bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one. Take Evernote, the   app. After nearly a decade attracting millions of users, the company last year severely restricted free use of its software while raising prices for its plans by as much as 40 percent. This month, Evernote also released a redesign for its mobile app, which users complained was bloated with unnecessary features that have made note taking too complex. Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy. ”We understand those kind of changes don’t make everyone happy,” said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. “In fact, we’ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years. ” People deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break. No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can’t recognize the warning signs. An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple’s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn’t show up. (It wasn’t the first time this happened, either.) Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving. “It’s still functioning, but you don’t see any changes in it for a very long time,” he said. “It’s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point. ” Another sign that it’s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app’s audience is a ghost town  —   like Yahoo’s   app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile   services like Instagram emerged  —   then it’s probably time to leave. Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr. The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs. As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive. Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around. “It’s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can’t take your furniture and your books with you,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. Evernote is a good example. It includes an “Export notes” feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other   apps. Microsoft’s   app OneNote, along with Apple’s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app. Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of   images, and then upload them to a new photo service. When companies don’t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you. If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don’t need    notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app. On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app  —   which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement. The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in. Ditching Apple’s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple’s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better. After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app. Mr. Fitzpatrick recently decided to cut ties with Google Voice, the search giant’s calling and texting service, because it had remained unchanged for years. So he made backups of his call history, text messages and address books using Google Takeout, a web tool that he helped develop for easily downloading personal data stored on Google services. Then he switched to Signal, the encrypted messaging service, which has more modern features for messaging and phone calls, and disconnected his Google Voice. Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick. “A lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?” he said."

Sometimes, science does things just to see if it is possible. This seems to be one of those times. While I really wanted to have my long promised flying car by now, this is pretty cool too.

Controlled clockwise and anticlockwise rotational switching of a molecular motor

U. G. E. Perera, F. Ample, H. Kersell, Y. Zhang, G. Vives, J. Echeverria, M. Grisolia, G. Rapenne, C. Joachim & S-W. Hla


Nature Nanotechnology 8,46–51 (2013) doi:10.1038/nnano.2012.218

Abstract
The design of artificial molecular machines1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 often takes inspiration from macroscopic machines13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. However, the parallels between the two systems are often only superficial, because most molecular machines are governed by quantum processes. 
Previously, rotary molecular motors3 powered by light4, 5, 6 and chemical7, 8, 9, 10, 11 energy have been developed. In electrically driven motors, tunnelling electrons from the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope have been used to drive the rotation of a simple rotor12 in a single direction and to move a four-wheeled molecule across a surface13. Here, we show that a stand-alone molecular motor adsorbed on a gold surface can be made to rotate in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction by selective inelastic electron tunnelling through different subunits of the motor. Our motor is composed of a tripodal stator for vertical positioning, a five-arm rotor for controlled rotations, and a ruthenium atomic ball bearing connecting the static and rotational parts. The directional rotation arises from sawtooth-like rotational potentials, which are solely determined by the internal molecular structure and are independent of the surface adsorption site.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a blackout within the mainstream media in Germany. If one googles “Kältewelle USA” (cold wave USA), a common term used by Germans to describe a spell of cold weather, only 6 sites are offered for the last 24 hours!
One example is from the German online FOCUS magazine. It presents 2 blurbs at its news ticker. it writes:
20.44: The so-called Super Bowl will take place this coming Sunday in the US state of New Jersey. A report in the newspaper ‘New York Times’ wrote that it could be the coldest Super Bowl of all time – because for the first time it will take place at an especially northern region of the country.
20.30: The USA is also struggling with a new cold wave. At the east coast and in the midwest many schools and highways have been closed. As the National Weather Service predicted, the Arctic weather front could reach all the way into the normally warm southern states, bringing near freezing temperatures. In Chicago temperatures could drop to minus 20° Celsius.”
But that’s about it when it comes to news from Germany on the US cold wave. Unfortunately for European climate activists, the Super Bowl will certainly bring vivid photos of the bitter cold that’s gripping the US to millions of viewers in Europe, thus potentially making it the Inconvenient Super Bowl.
63 people die of “unusual cold” in Thailand – coldest in 30 years!
Meanwhile not only is cold gripping North America and Eastern Europe, but it has also plunged all the way down into Thailand. The German-language Farang.com reports of a brutal winter taking place in the normally tropical Asian region this year. It writes:

In Bangkok the temperature dropped to 15.6°C. Authorities reported on Thursday a new cold record and are speaking of an unusually cold winter in Thailand. It hasn’t been this cold in Bangkok since 1983, said Songkram Aksorn of the weather authority.”
The Farang.com also writes of 63 deaths due to cold over the last three months.
This cold spell is the longest in a decade, said Khun Songkram. Also the rice harvest has been impacted sei, exporters said.”
Cooling leads to more protests
But not everyone minds the cold weather. Farang.com adds:
The organizers of street protests against the government have been satisfied: The weather was good for demonstrations. Thais like the cooler weather“, said Akanat Promphan, a leader of the government protesters.”

"“It doesn’t matter whether a cat is black or white so long as it catches mice.” The maxim attributed to Deng Xiaoping comes to mind in relation to the federal government’s technology investment roadmap discussion paper and its response to the King review. If we look beyond the headlines, both interventions provide some reason for optimism. As Frank Jotzo notes, the discussion paper acknowledges that Australia’s future lies with low-carbon energy, industry and transport. That’s a step forward – and it should be acknowledged as such. Some have complained that, by surveying 140 technologies, the paper takes too broad a view. Actually, the acknowledgement of a wide array of technologies for carbon abatement methods constitutes positive progress given Australia’s climate policy history. In a report entitled Decarbonisation Futures, ClimateWorks modelled multiple pathways by which Australia might reach net zero emission by the year 2050, in accordance with the Paris climate agreement goal. Those models show that decarbonisation won’t be the result of a single technology, but rather that different solutions (from renewable power to sustainable transport to new forms of energy efficiency) will play important roles in particular economic sectors. Fortunately, the priority technologies identified in Decarbonisation Futures all feature in the roadmap discussion paper. Much commentary has focused on the government allowing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to support loans for carbon capture and storage. We have entered a crucial decade in the race against climate change In the past, that technology was associated with proposals to extend the life of coal-fired power stations. With renewables becoming far cheaper, far more quickly than expected, we now know that CCS is not competitive in the electricity supply. But that doesn’t mean that it can’t play a role elsewhere. The Decarbonisation Future modelling identifies CCS as necessary, not in power generation, but in harder-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, where it can help capture non-energy emissions such as fugitive methane from gas extraction and process emissions from cement. That’s a position accepted by both the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If speed weren’t a factor, we could probably rely on the market to incentivise the uptake of green technology at its own pace. Battery costs per kilowatt hour are now 80% less expensive than in 2010; new renewables generate power more cheaply than fossil fuels, and this year the US will probably produce more electricity from renewable power than from coal for the first time. But time isn’t on our side. We have entered a crucial decade in the race against climate change, with the UN and scientists declaring that emissions must halve in the next 10 years, and halve again in the 10 after. That’s why the actions arising from the roadmap need to accelerate the deployment of abatement technologies, stimulating the market so widespread deployment occurs, which both brings down emissions and brings down cost. In an interview with the ABC’s AM program, Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, explained that the government would “love to achieve net zero by 2050”, before adding that the target will “depend on the pathways of technologies to deliver … without damaging the economy”. In fact, it’s precisely by setting targets that we can ensure decarbonisation and robust economic growth go hand in hand. Research by ClimateWorks shows that incentives to use technologies matter as much as initial investment in their development, with deployment spurring improvements in price and performance. Those incentives can take many different policy forms. Investments of the kind discussed in the government’s technology roadmap paper can foster development and commercialisation of zero-emissions emerging solutions like renewable hydrogen and green steel for harder-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry, agriculture and land. At the same time, commitments in government procurement might, for instance, scale up the deployment of emerging technologies, as might the establishment of industry standards in particular sectors. By setting targets immediately, decision makers (in business as well as in government), can support technology development, demonstration and deployment, and capitalise on opportunities for investment. Innes Willox of the Ai Group is right when he says, in his responses to the King review and to the technology investment roadmap, that we still need “a clear long-term vision and strategy”. Yet behind the government’s careful rhetoric, we can see the first substantive movement on climate policy for some time. The recommendations accepted by Taylor aim, for instance, to give industry greater incentive to embrace new climate solutions as they emerge, something demonstrably necessary for decarbonisation to proceed on track. Willox cautions – correctly, I believe – that the government must back its vision with “adequate funding”. But if that funding materialises, along with clear signals of longer term demand for the technologies, it could spur the kind of response that rapidly drives down costs of emissions-saving technology. In that respect, both the response to the King review and the new technology investment roadmap discussion paper provide a better basis for accelerating action than Australia has had for some years. With the climate clock ticking, now the focus must be on the accelerant that is applied to these foundations. We can’t afford to debate the colour of the climate cat. It’s way past time to catch some mice. • Anna Skarbek is the chief executive of ClimateWorks Australia, an independent not-for-profit organisation working within the Monash Sustainable Development Institute"

When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, pundits were certain that Thomas’s confirmation hearings would focus on his positions on abortion and affirmative action. Although those issues did come up at the hearings, the Democratic senators saved their most probing and hostile questions for the issue of constitutional protection of economic liberty. They grilled Thomas about his professed affinity for the writings of Stephen Macedo of Harvard University and Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago Law School, two exponents of greater judicial protection for economic liberty.[1] And they also asked Thomas narrower, more specific questions, such as: Did he think that minimum‐​wage laws violated the Constitution? Should judicial protection of property rights be expanded at the expense of Congress’ regulatory power? What is the scope of Congress’ power to regulate commerce?



That constitutional protection for economic liberty should have been a major focus of a Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991 is an extraordinary development in the history of American constitutional law. During the New Deal era, a liberal Supreme Court reversed dozens of precedents that had restricted the power of government to regulate economic activity. From that time until the late 1970s, there was almost unanimous agreement among legal scholars on both the left and the right that the Supreme Court’s pre‐​New Deal protection of economic liberty–stretching back for a century and a half–was a mistake that should never be repeated.



Beginning in the late 1970s, however, a few dedicated legal scholars began to revive the idea that the Constitution limits government power in the economic sphere and that the judiciary should enforce those limits.[2] At first the mainstream legal community ignored the works of those scholars. But as the Reagan Revolution transformed the ideological character of the federal judiciary, the intellectual climate changed as well. Suddenly, scholars who had been dismissed as eccentrics by mainstream legal academia had the attention of the federal bench.[3] Meanwhile, scholarship and discussion relating to economic liberties exploded.



Yet, despite all of that activity, there has been relatively little movement in the courts toward greater protection of economic liberty.[4] The biggest obstacle has been the Supreme Court’s refusal to reconsider the decisions of the last six decades that have eviscerated constitutional protection of economic liberty. Even under the current conservative Court, the best one can say is that things have not deteriorated further. Yet, with the Court’s opinions often focusing on the original intent and plain meaning of the Constitution, there is still hope that economic liberty may once again take its place among the constitutional rights strongly protected by the Constitution.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how alarmists say that the variation in solar irradiance was too small to have any real impact on the earth’s climate, and thus gets neglected by the IPCC?
Reader GuarionexSandoval has written a comment which I’m elevating to a post, see below. It too shows that if the variation solar irradiance from the 11-year cycle is negligible, then so must the alleged 400,000 daily Hiroshima bombs of heat that alarmists insist are being added to the climate system.
===================================
By GuarionexSandoval
I remember first reading about this in some moronic piece of agit-prop on Market Watch called New ‘War of Worlds’: Capitalism vs. Planet Earth Opinion: Global-warming rate today has impact of 400,000 daily A-bombs by Paul B. Ferrel.
400,000 daily A-bombs by Paul B. Ferrel
My reply:
Let’s crunch some numbers. The author claims that human effect on “global warming” is equivalent to 400,000 atomic bombs going off per day. We’ll assume he meant that all human activity results in a temperature rise per day the energy of which is equal to 400,000 atomic bombs. Since he didn’t specify what kind of atomic bomb, we’ll use Hiroshima since that’s usually the one used by those trying to score polemical points. The yield of the Hiroshima bomb was around 64.5 terajoules (TJ). So 400,000 of these would be about 25,800,000 TJ. The total amount of energy in TJ released by all nuclear explosions to date is around 2,135,000. So, he’s claiming that human effect on temperature each day is 12 times greater than all the nuclear weapons ever exploded. Gee, that sounds so horribly ominous.
But let’s compare that to the amount of energy on average that reaches the earth each day from the sun. The average influx is somewhere near 81,660 joules per square meter per minute. Given that the earth has a surface area of 510 trillion square meters, the energy is 41,646,600,000,000,000,000 J/minute or 41,646,600 TJ/minute or 59,971,104,000 TJ/day. But consider that over the 11 year sunspot cycle the energy output reaching the earth can vary by 0.1 percent (but other solar cycles can increase this up to 0.6 percent). So at maximum, it varies between 60,001,089,552 TJ/day to 60,151,017,312 TJ/day.
Just the variation of the 11-year sunspot cycle is responsible for a change in the daily solar energy influx equivalent to 930,249 atomic bombs per day. At the maximum the change would be equivalent to 5,581,494 atomic bombs per day. So, even if his claim were true, which it isn’t, the effect would be less than the natural variation from just the sunspot cycle alone without even considering other cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation that cause a large fluctuation in average global temperature or the 200 year de Vries cycle that does the same or the progression from grand solar maxima to grand solar minima that does the same or regular changes in the earth’s orbit that do the same or changes in the solar magnetic field that controls cloud formation by changing cosmic ray flux that do the same or combinations of all these cycles that can really shift temperature radically in one or the other direction–like between the 100,000 year glacial periods and the approximately 10,000 year interglacial periods, such as our current interglacial, the end of which we are nearing. 
Bombs are equal to only 37 seconds of sunlight
So against all this, let’s compare his deliberately scary sounding atomic bomb imagery to the actual daily energy that reaches the earth from the sun: 59,971,104,000 TJ/day. That is 2,324 times larger than 400,000 atomic bombs or, rather, those bombs are equal to about 0.043% of the sun’s daily energy influx or 37 seconds of sunlight.

Now, let’s put this into the context of what’s actually been happening to global temperatures over the past 10,000 years. Over the past 9,000 years there has been a downward trend; over the past 3000 years, a steeply downward trend. From the Minoan Warm Period to the tiny little blip of warmth between about 1860 to 1998 (3 roughly equal periods of roughly equal increases of temp), the trend has been to ever colder warm periods and to ever colder intervening cold periods. The last cold period, referred to as the Little Ice Age, was the coldest the planet has been since the last worldwide glaciation. We are still warming up from the LIA and have far to go to reach the warmth of the Medieval Warm Period, farther still to reach that of the Roman Warm Period (according to Greenland ice core temperatures) and very far to reach the warmth of the Minoan Warm Period. The 20th century was also special in that there was a grand solar maximum that exceeded anything for millennia. We’re now on the down slope toward a grand solar minimum. By the end of the 1990s we reached the end of the positive phase of the Pacifical Decadal Oscillation and are headed in the negative or colder direction. We also reached the peak of the 200 year de Vries cycle and are headed back down. None of these predicts higher temperatures. He should hope that anthropogenic CO2 has the effect climate alarmists claim for it.
CO2 near 500 million year low
As far as his professed fear and trembling over CO2 being higher than any time in “recorded history,” first, it’s not true. There were times in the 19th century that atmospheric CO2 was measured at over 400 ppm. And, second, “recorded history” is a cute way to avoid looking at all the other ways that atmospheric CO2 concentrations are measured for times before “recorded history.” Again, he either lacks perspective or is deliberately failing to provide it. In the geological time frame, the current amount of atmospheric CO2 is near an all time low, vying with the Carboniferous and Permian Periods for the lowest atmospheric CO2 in over 500 million years. Its decline over the past 150 million years has been almost linear and completely unconnected with any sort of human activity, as was its abrupt increase at the end of the Permian period from about where it is now, just barely enough to sustain life, to over 2500 ppm.
Against this, the author’s piece can be seen to be one of two things: 1. Ignorant and uncritical re-posting of hysterical claims that make Orson Well’s War of the World hoax look like a Hello Kitty cartoon. 2. Deliberate deception in the service of a political agenda.
Given that his bullet points were either inaccurate, irrelevant, or completely untrue, I’d be tempted to say number 1.
But given his absurd allusion to 400,000 atomic bombs per day, I’m sort of leaning toward number 2.
And especially so when I consider Al Gore’s statement that he. Al, believes “…it is appropriate to have an over-representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is, as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are, and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis.”
H.L. Mencken described these types well:
“The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed–and hence clamorous to be led to safety–by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.”
“The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it.”

"In my day job, I am a scientist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland studying things such as how agriculture contributes to climate change and what we can do about it. Recently, though, I found myself in Geneva, to take part in my fourth “adoption plenary” for a report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  The report in question was the recent Special Report on Climate Change and Land, and I was one of its 15 convening lead authors, responsible along with two others for a 300-page chapter on links between desertification, land degradation, food security and climate change. The adoption plenary is the process by which the 195 governments who are part of the IPCC reach consensus on the wording of a much shorter (40 or so page) “Summary for Policymakers” (SPM) of an entire IPCC report, and thereby adopt its findings. The process of approval is gruelling for all concerned: it’s allocated five days, with an additional reserve day allocated which is often used. During this period, every word of the policymakers’ summary has to be agreed and approved, line-by-line, with delegates from all governments in the room. As an author, I had to respond to comments from the governments and, for example where language was unclear, to suggest another form of words that was consistent with the findings of the underlying report. Since the whole process of how IPCC reports are approved will be a mystery to most, I want to look at how this adoption process works and why we need to have them. When certain text is contested, the chairs can propose a “huddle”, which is a short, unofficial, offline discussion between the authors and any interested government delegates to resolve the issue. The newly agreed text is then brought back to plenary for approval. For very complex issues, “contact groups” are established. A contact group is an official break out group, chaired by two governments, and includes delegates from any other government who wishes to participate, along with the report authors, to clarify complex issues in detail.   Contact groups may continue for several sessions over a number of days. One contact group, for example, spent two days hammering out the exact form and wording of the summary’s Figure 3. This summarised the findings of the whole report on the complex interactions between desertification, land degradation, food security and climate change. When agreement is reached, the outcomes still have to be approved in full plenary.   In terms of work involved, sessions each day often run well into early hours of the morning. On the final day of the land report, discussions ran all through the night and finished after midday the following day. It is extremely tiring for the government delegates and for the report’s authors. As a younger scientist, I certainly didn’t imagine I would sometimes end up working the hours of an investment banker. But the key reason I think it’s worth it is to do with the weight that the report carries after it has been adopted by governments. Once it has been adopted, it stops being our (the authors’) document, and it becomes their (the governments’) agreed document. Governments can contest the findings of even the best peer-reviewed study – but with an IPCC report, once it is adopted, the government has already agreed to the findings and the report immediately gains more weight. IPCC reports are used by governments across the world to guide policy, and it is for this reason that scientific authors continue to put themselves through the hell of government adoption plenary.  In the past, those sceptical of the government adoption process of IPCC reports have compared the final wording of the policymakers’ summary to earlier leaked versions and cite this as evidence of government interference in the scientific outcomes. But there are a few important things to note about this process. Changes to the summary can only be made to better reflect the underlying report. Governments can’t simply propose statements to better fit their domestic agendas. Any changes to the summary do not change what is written in the underlying report, except through what is called “trickle-back”. For example, if a name of a practice is changed to be more easily understood in the summary, it will then be changed too in the underlying report to maintain consistency. If certain figures or paragraphs of the SPM cannot be approved by governments, as sometimes happens (although not this time), this draws more attention to those sections and readers often go to find them in the underlying report to see what all the fuss was about.  For instance the section on “international cooperation” in the summary of the IPCC’s 2014 report on climate mitigation (section 5.2 here) was much shorter than the version that appeared in the technical summary. So people went to read the text there to find out what was missing. If any government ever wanted to suppress the science, failing to approve part of the Summary for Policymakers would be a sure-fire way to draw attention to the contested findings. As well as the fatigue, all participants at various stages feel frustration when things are progressing slowly, and relief when agreement is eventually reached. Yet, at the end of this hellish process, I am really pleased with the outcome. But I’m also very happy to wait a few years until my next adoption plenary.

"**Canada's federal government will spend C$100bn ($77bn, Â£58bn) to kick-start the country's post-pandemic economy.**
It is ""the largest economic relief package for our country since the Second World War"", Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Monday.
The spending will bring the deficit to a historic C$381.6bn by March 2021.
The wide-ranging plan includes targeted relief for hard-hit business sectors, investments in long-term care homes and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine.
The announcement - the first full fiscal update from Canada's Liberal government since the onset of the pandemic - comes as the country battles a steep second wave of Covid-19 infections. The number of active cases in Canada has more than doubled in November alone, bringing the total number of infections to more than 376,000 - according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. So far, more than 12,000 Canadians have died.
""When the virus is under control and our economy is ready for new growth, we will employ an ambitious stimulus package,"" to be spent over the next three years, Ms Freeland said in the House of Commons on Monday. The spending will amount to 3-4% of Canada's GDP.
Monday's fiscal plan pledges C$1bn to help provinces and territories improve Covid-19 infection control in long-term care facilities. Industries that have been particularly vulnerable to economic shutdowns like tourism, travel and arts will be eligible for business loans up to C$1m, with a 10-year term. And for Canada's lower and middle income families, package promises up to C$1,200 for each child under 6.
An additional C$1bn will also be directed to vaccine agreements. ""Canada has secured the most diverse vaccine portfolio in the world,"" Ms Freeland said. Canada has secured seven different vaccine purchase contracts, she said, enough for each Canadian to receive 10 doses, free of charge.
And to pay for the expansive plan, Canada will see its largest budget shortfall since World War Two.
On Monday, Ms Freeland defended the record deficit as affordable - thanks to low interest rates - and necessary for Canada's economy. ""As we have learned from previous recessions, the risk of providing too little support now outweighs that of providing too much,"" she said. ""We will not repeat the mistakes of the years following the Great Recession of 2008.""
Speaking in the House of Commons, opposition leader Erin O'Toole dismissed the Liberal's proposal. ""Without a plan for vaccines, there can be no long-term plan for our economy,"" the Conservative leader said.
Despite Ms Freeland's assurances that each Canadian would have access to several doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, Canadians still ""don't know the first date vaccines will be received,"" Mr O'Toole said.
As infections climb, coronavirus shutdowns have battered the country's economy. Last month, Statistics Canada reported an unemployment rate of 8.9%, meaning there are 1.8 million Canadians unable to find a job.
Monday's announcement is among the first major challenges for Ms Freeland, who took over the role of finance minister in August, after her predecessor, Bill Morneau, suddenly stepped down from the post amid an ethics scandal. Ms Freeland, 52, is the first woman to hold the position in Canada. She also serves as the country's deputy prime minister."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBefore the Obama administration charges blindly into a European-style feed-in act to promote renewable energies, they may want to look at what experts in Europe are saying about how well their own feed-in efforts are actually doing.
All pain and no gain – certified flop
An independent committee of expert advisors to the German government is recommending in a report that the country’s once highly ballyhooed EEG renewable energy feed-in act be scrapped altogether because it is 1) “not doing anything for the climate”, 2) “not promoting inn0vation” and 3) driving up the cost of energy.
The report will be officially presented to the government today.
In summary, the once highly touted German EEG renewable energy feed-in act has been all pain and no gain, and the experts see no reason to continue it.
$30 billion a year…yet “does not provide more climate protection”
According to the online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeiting (FAZ) here, the Research and Innovation commission of experts assigned by the German government says in its report that “there is no longer any justification for continuing the EEG Act.”
The experts cite “additional costs of 22 billion euros [$30 billion] per year” and conclude that the renewable energies have an “exaggerated impact on climate change“. Also the reports says the Act has not measurably boosted innovation.
“No measureable impact on innovation”

The results of the experts’ report are damning in the harshest terms. The FAZ writes, quoting the report:
The conclusion of the expert commission is devastating: ‘The EEG act in its current form is not justifiable from an innovation-political view.”
The report also writes that “there has been no measureable impact on innovation“.
Well, why innovate if profits are guaranteed by massive subsidies?
The most damning text in the FAZ article probably is (my emphasis):
That’s why the EEG’s initiated expansion of renewable energies has led to no additional avoidance of CO2 emissions across Europe, rather they have only been shifted elsewhere. ‘The EEG Act thus does not produce more climate protection, rather it just makes it considerably more expensive.'”
Green energy proponents and lobbyists will certainly move quickly to ferociously attack and dismiss the report. The FAZ writes, however, that the expert recommendation is the latest in a series of expert reports that have reached the same conclusion. But the FAZ does not expect the government to follow the recommendations.
But the pressure on the German government to radically scale back the EEG act is mounting as citizens struggle with skyrocketing electricity prices. Germany has also come under heavy fire from other European countries who accuse the German government of misusing the feed-in act in ways to provide competitive advantages to certain companies.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



Greenhouse‐​effect theory has predicted—first written by Svante Arrhenius in 1895—that lower atmospheric warming from increasing carbon dioxide would preferentially warm high latitude (polar) regions of the Northern Hemisphere. A hundred years later, computer models still predict the same, and it is a fact that this region has warmed much more than the rest of the globe.



Back‐​of‐​the‐​envelope reasoning (usually not a good idea when addressing the incendiary minefield of global warming) suggests that this should produce weaker midlatitude storms. These are the garden‐​variety low‐​pressure systems (cyclones) that form as a result of bursts of kinetic energy (motion) supplied by the jet stream. The jet is a fast‐​moving current in the mid‐​and‐​upper troposphere that is nature’s way of dissipating the potential energy difference between the (hot) tropics and the (cold) poles. Warm the poles preferentially and this temperature contrast declines, and so does the energy for cyclones. Less energetic cyclones generally means less severe weather, like floods, tornadoes and other pestilences.



Well, maybe not.



There is a new paper about to be published in _Geophysical Research Letters_ that claims a positive relationship between the “Arctic amplification” of global warming and extreme weather outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere mid‐​latitudes. This is a significant finding if it proves to be true. However, the authors, Jennifer Francis and Steven Vavrus—despite being very enthusiastic—fail to convincingly make their case in light of other previous publications in the climate literature.



In their paper “Evidence Linking Arctic Amplification to Extreme Weather in Mid‐​Latitudes” Francis and Vavrus argue that the differential rates of warming between the Artic and the mid‐​latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere cause a slowdown in the eastward progression of weather systems driven by the jet stream, “which may lead to an increased probability of extreme weather events that result from prolonged conditions, such as drought, flooding, cold spells, and heat waves.”



(This statement is reminiscent of the infamous phrase in the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change _Second Assessment Report_ in 1995 that moved global warming from science to what the philosopher Karl Popper called “pseudo‐​science.” The difference is that science (example: classical physics) can be “falsified” by critical observations, and pseudo‐​science purports to explain everything. As the IPCC said, “Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle; this translates into prospects for more severe droughts and/​or floods in some places and less severe droughts and/​or floods in other places.” So much for falsifiability.)



The jet stream circumnavigates the North Pole, and “waves” move along it, such that its shape in not perfectly circular, but rather more meandering and ever changing. Like waves on a stretched string, short‐​wavelength ones (of about 400 miles from peak‐​to‐​peak) move through the jet stream faster than long waves (which can cover thousands of miles). In fact, long waves can get ”stuck,” for various and sundry reasons, with little net movement. This is a situation known as “blocking,” and results in the same type of weather occurring over a particular region for a prolonged period of time. If that’s good weather, don’t look for scientists to blame greenhouse gases (where’s the incentive for that?); but if it’s bad weather, well, global warming!



Francis and Vavrus prefer the latter approach. From their conclusions:



Can the persistent weather conditions associated with recent severe events such as the snowy winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 in the eastern U.S. and Europe, the historic drought and heat‐​wave in Texas during summer 2011, or record‐​breaking rains in the northeast U.S. of summer 2011 be attributed to enhanced high‐​latitude warming? Particular causes are difficult to implicate, but these sorts of occurrences are consistent with the analysis and mechanism presented in this study. As the Arctic sea‐​ice cover continues to disappear and the snow cover melts ever earlier over vast regions of Eurasia and North America (Brown et al, 2010), it is expected that large‐​scale circulation patterns throughout the northern hemisphere will become increasingly influenced by Arctic Amplification. Gradual warming of the globe may not be noticed by most, but everyone — either directly or indirectly — will be affected to some degree by changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Further research will elucidate the types, locations, timing, and character of the weather changes, which will provide valuable guidance to decision‐​makers in vulnerable regions.



Hello, Karl Popper!



Francis and Vavrus hypothesize that two processes are involved in slowing the progression of the weather; 1) a weakening of the mid‐​level atmospheric winds; and 2) increased amplitude of the waves moving through the flow in jet stream.



To demonstrate a weakening of the winds in the mid‐​levels of the atmosphere, Francis and Vavrus take the difference between a measure of integrated temperature of the lower atmosphere (called the “1000–500mb thickness”) in the latitude zones 60–80°N and 30–50°N.



The “1000–500mb thickness” is related to the distance that a weather balloon must rise in order for its onboard barometer to read one‐​half of an atmosphere. Thanks to the ideal gas law (pv=nRt), the volume of the atmosphere varies proportionally with temperature (p, pressure, is constant at ½ an atmosphere, R is a constant, and, in this case so is n, the number of molecules). So all that is left is v (volume, or “thickness”) being scaled by t (temperature). Izzat clear?



The difference in the thickness in these two regions is therefore a direct measure of the atmospheric temperature difference which is directly related to the strength of the mid‐​atmospheric wind. However, the difference between the average temperature in two rather large areas is a very gross estimate of the average wind speed.



Further, it is really not the _average_ wind speed that drives weather systems along, but rather the wind speed in the jet stream—a much narrower and closer defined region of fast flowing air that is usually located somewhere in the general region that Francis and Vavrus are averaging over. But just because the average wind speed in the region between 60–80°N and 30–50°N may be slowing down, doesn’t mean that the winds in the region of fastest flow have declined.



In fact, my former colleague Bob Davis at the University of Virginia as worked with several of his grad students through the years to investigate changes in the Northern Hemisphere jet stream and circumpolar flow. And the general finding from that research is that the speed of the jet stream flow has been increasing over the past several decades (after a period of decreasing flow ending in the early, to mid‐​1970s).



For instance, from research published in the _Journal of Geophysical Research_ (Frauenfeld and Davis, 2003), they found that:



“During the early period [1949–1969] when the vortex was expanding, the westerly flow was therefore weaker, and during the later period [1970–2000] when the vortex was contracting, the westerly flow across the Northern Hemisphere has been much stronger.”



And from more recent research published in the _Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society_ (Strong and Davis, 2007), they reported:



[Jet stream] core speed… increased over the midlatitudes (40–60 °N), with changes as large as 15%.…



The reason that the jet stream winds have increased despite a weakening mid‐​latitude to polar temperature gradient is that the width of the jet stream has contracted somewhat. Davis and co‐​researchers have found that during cooler periods the jet stream is located further south, but that it is also wider in spatial extent (with lower wind speeds), and that during warmer periods, the jet stream is located further north and is contracted (with high wind speeds).



While the north/​south migration of the jet stream is in accordance with the findings of Francis and Vavrus concerning the arctic amplification of a general warming of the hemisphere, the more detailed research of Davis et al. shows that the behavior of the jet stream flow is the opposite to that which was reported by Francis and Vavrus who used a less detailed methodology—a methodology which Strong and Davis suggest “can generate false, or mask actual, variability patterns including trends.”



So when it comes to Francis and Vavrus’s first explanation for more extreme weather events—a weakening of the mid‐​level atmospheric wind—it turns out that a more detailed and comprehensive analysis finds that the speed of the winds of import (those in the jet stream) are in fact, speeding up.



When it comes to Francis and Vavrus’s second mechanism—increased amplitude of the waves moving through the flow—the Davis and colleagues’ work gives mixed results. Fraunfeld and Davis (2003) reported that over North America (the primary region examined by Francis and Vavrus), that the changes to the position of the jet stream “can also be argued to represent and enhancement of the PNA pattern.”



The PNA, or the Pacific‐​North America pattern, is a typically winter atmospheric flow pattern that is characterized by the jet stream flowing northeastward towards Alaska and then southeastward to the eastern U.S. Such a pattern can lead to frequent cold outbreaks and snowstorms in the eastern portions of the country and protracted pleasant and mild conditions in the western half of the country. If the PNA pattern is enhanced, it would tend to exacerbate these conditions.



However, in Strong and Davis (2007), not only was an enhancement of the PNA pattern much less pronounced but it also was somewhat dependent on which upper‐​air data set was being analyzed. (just like the situation with the surface temperature, there are several different research groups producing compilations of upper‐​air data).



The dataset with a slight PNA enhancement (produced by the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR) was the one used by Francis and Vavrus. The other dataset (produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, ERA-40) showed a tendency for reduced PNA conditions and instead of an amplified wave pattern, and the general flow flattened from west‐​to‐​east, which moves storms quickly across North America and produces weaker cyclones, contrary to Francis and Vavrus’s assertion.



So where does this leave us? When the new paper by Francis and Vavrus comes to the attention of the mainstream press (the paper is still in the “in‐​press” stage at _Geophysical Research Letters_ ), it’ll play as if a warming Arctic and declining sea ice—an asserted consequence of human greenhouse gas emissions—has been definitively tied‐​in to all sorts of weather extremes across the U.S. No mention will be made to the fact that other research, which is many cases is more robust and detailed, has concluded nearly the opposite.



As with most issues related to climate science, the truth is significantly more complex than what is in the media. To increase your chances of getting “the rest of the story,” check your monthly “Current Wisdom”.

"The Nationals senator Matt Canavan has been grilled over his criticism of action against climate change during an episode of Q+A where he was also asked to clarify his family’s links to the coal industry.  In an episode that also featured opposition agriculture and resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon defending his call for Labor to adopt the government’s target of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2030, and independent MP Zali Steggall attacking Fitzgibbon for his views on gas extraction, Canavan was pushed by host Hamish Macdonald about his “interests” in the coal industry.  Canavan’s vocal support of the coal industry has included calls for new coal-fired power stations, despite his moderate government colleagues opposing the idea. But the senator pointed out he had disclosed his brother’s senior position in the coal industry during his maiden speech to the Senate.  “I hardly started talking about the coal industry yesterday ... I have been elected on that platform, to develop our country and keep our jobs here. I think the best way of doing that is making sure we do not deny ourselves the cheapest form of power and energy,” Canavan said.  “The Australian people have never voted for net zero emissions ... We seem to try and get bullied into these positions that the Australian people didn’t vote for.” Why should new coal-fired power stations be part of Australia’s energy mix? #QandA pic.twitter.com/2TucJy7wQR When asked why the government was able to accept experts’ views when forming its coronavirus response but not when its climate change response, Canavan likened conflicting views of the impact of climate change to epidemiologists who differed on how drastic they thought lockdowns should be.  “There are very, very different scientific views being put on this issue. So it’s not quite right to say that we just accepted the science,” he said, noting some experts have said governments are too strict, while others have said governments, like in Sweden, are too relaxed about lockdowns.  “These are very hard questions ... And it’s the same thing with climate change science.  “If you read the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report, the level of uncertainty around temperature increases from a doubling of carbon emissions has increased in the last 10 years. Increased. There’s no consensus on exactly what that figure will be,” Canavan said.  Has the Government taken expert advice on COVID-19 more seriously than the expert advice provided on climate change? #QandA pic.twitter.com/q3XAAFdEKS Canavan also criticised the Paris climate agreement – something he has called for Australia to abandon – arguing the agreement is “transferring industrial wealth from the west and from Australia to China, a country that’s bullying and threatening us”. Fitzgibbon argued “the market will never” build a new coal-fired power station in Australia, and defended his position for Labor adopting the government’s climate targets, “if we can get there [26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030] without causing people economic harm, then surely then we’ve got a stronger platform from which to sell a more meaningful policy”. He also reiterated his support for coalmining – a significant employer in his electorate of Hunter – and said his backing of zero net emissions and support for the industry were not mutually exclusive.  In calling for greater gas extraction to fill any shortfalls in energy production left by reductions in coal-fired power, Fitzgibbon said, “our manufacturing plants will not compete either domestically or internationally if we don’t get more gas out of the ground”. “Domestic prices will go up if we do not get more gas out of the ground. And I get angry when I see state governments putting bans or moratoriums on gas in their own states, and then importing it from other states, and allowing others to take any environmental risks that might be involved,” he said.  Steggall called Fitzgibbon’s argument “completely inconsistent”. “You’ve just indicated that you’re committed to net zero. We cannot be increasing gas out of the ground ... gas is as high in terms of emissions as coal,” she said.  Fitzgibbon responded: “Do you really think, Zali, really, that we’re going to have enough renewables in the system to replace that baseload power and battery storage? No.” Steggall replied: “Absolutely.”  Zoe Whitton, Citi ESG analyst and Investor Group on Climate Change, also criticised increased gas extraction, saying “investors are very uncertain and hesitant about it”. Macdonald asked Steggall if she was “picking and choosing” when to use experts’ opinions, after she cited chief scientist Alan Finkel’s work when making a point earlier in the program, but later rejected his views on gas being a transition fuel in 30 years. Steggall denied she was picking and choosing when to rely on experts’ arguments, and said she disagreed with Finkel on gas because his view was at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan."

=======================
Hopefully this will be my last word on this matter.
Christopher Monckton, 3. Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, has responded to the PRP journal cancellation affair, which has created quite a stir within the skeptic climate science community. In it he has some deservedly harsh comments, which I steeply tend to agree with.
He calls the PRP shutdown a “21st century equivalent of Nazi-era book-burning“, led by “a vicious campaign sedulously waged by the canting profiteers of doom“. He calls the publisher’s director Rasmussen “a formless lump of lard“.
And unfortunately it seems a few skeptics played into the hands of the campaign or, for selfish reasons, even played along with the shenanigans, so some have claimed.
In his forceful piece, Christopher Monckton offers a persuasive defence of Niklas Mörner, the distiunguished Swedish scientist and PRP editor who has more than 500 publications to his credit. Mockton writes (my emphasis):
Unlike Galileo, who also got into trouble over the theological implications of the interaction between the Sun and the planets, professor Mörner did not even get a trial in front of the Holy Inquisition. For the Thermageddon Cult is, to its very roots, instinctually Communist. Fair trial, Tovarishch? No way, Josevich.”
And kudos to Anthony Watts, who hardly emerges unscathed in this matter, for featuring Monckton’s response at his blog. Anthony still appears to maintain a hardline against the science floated by the special PRP issue and its authors, which is fine. But I think he should not slam the door entirely on them. From a reader comment he wrote, I got the feeling he belittles the journal in calling it “a repository for way out there ideas“. A premature dismissal on his part? Time will tell. But let’s keep in mind that Galilieo’s and Wegener’s ideas also were also once called “way out”. In the end, it turned out that it was the mainstream itself who were way out. Anthony also called Monckton’s piece “emotional”.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that a certain WUWT contributor is having perhaps too much influence at the number one skeptic blog, a blog to which we owe so much to. As talented as that person may be, it seems odd he would take it upon himself, given his relatively scant scientific credentials, to tell the rest of us which science is to be believed. One paper or two doesn’t make a person the authority. There were other self-anointed climate science quality czars who came out of the woodwork and over-extended. I was particularly disappointed with Poptech, from whom we found plenty of childish comments, like here.
At NTZ my first reaction to the PRP shutdown, I admit, was on the overly harsh side. I also unwisely allowed myself to be spurred on in part by emotion, i.e. my frustration arising from the systematic and institutionalized attempts here in Germany to marginalize and silence legitimate skeptic voices. With PRP I thought: Here we go again.
But then Anthony came out with his strong critique of the scientists behind PRP group and that really got me to rethink my original position. On the surface Anthony made a very convincing case, and many of his points had merit, and still do. Maybe the journal is bogus, I wondered.
But since then background details and responses from the other side have emerged and indicate that, under the bottom line, the original NTZ position was not far off after all. And some of the “nepotism” allegations leveled at WUWT remain just that: allegations that still have to be looked into. Christopher Monckton’s essay confirms my original position that this was for the most part a sloppy and mean-spirited attempt by Copernicus to silence one side.
Everyone hopes that the dust will settle soon. As far as I’m concerned, the whole thing for me is a bygone. Hopefully this will be my last word on it. We are all going to make mistakes at one time or another. I urge readers here not to hold anything against anyone: forgive and forget.
In the future we have to work to ensure that other opinions and positions get heard without unnecessary attacks. Getting views on the table unhindered and leaving egos aside is what climate science needs more than ever today.
I really do hope the PRP journal sees success and I look forward to writing about it in the future.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The Syrian government has executed 5, 000 to 13, 000 people in mass hangings in just one of its many prisons since the start of the    uprising against President Bashar   Amnesty International contends in a new report. The report on the Saydnaya military prison, which Amnesty said was based on interviews with former detainees there, prison employees, judges and others, accuses the Syrian government of systematically executing perceived opponents after sham trials that lasted just a few minutes. Inmates are kept under conditions so dismal  —   including regular, severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, medicine and basic sanitation  —   that they amount to deliberate extermination, defined under international law as a crime against humanity, the report said. While inhumane prison conditions in Syria have been known for decades, the Amnesty report laid out what it described as new details  —   not documented by any human rights monitoring group to date  —   about the scale of the killings and the state systems required to facilitate them, including approvals by   officials. “We now know where, when and how often these hangings are taking place, as well as which elements of the Syrian government have authorized them,” said Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty researcher specializing in detention issues and one of the report’s authors. Mr. Assad, in an interview with The New York Times and other journalists last year, insisted that detainees were being treated according to Syrian law and that their families could locate them by appealing to the judicial system. But the report corroborates numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across Syria, detailing regular torture and deprivation. It also echoes reports from families of detainees that the government has refused to provide even basic information such as where they are and whether they are alive. According to former officials cited in the report, detainees  —   most of them accused of nonviolent offenses, such as participating in demonstrations  —   are tortured into giving confessions, then taken to   military field courts, where they undergo trials lasting two to three minutes. At regular intervals, the Amnesty report said, they are gathered in the middle of the night from their cells and taken blindfolded to an execution room on the grounds of the prison near Damascus, where they are hanged. Some prisoners have managed to stand on toilets to look out windows and see bodies carted away, and the number of slippers left lying on the ground. “If there were 30 slippers, then we knew that 15 people had been executed,” Abu Osama, a former military officer detained in the prison, was quoted as saying. “There were usually between 30 and 80 slippers outside. ”"
"**The government has been setting out its case for tougher coronavirus measures. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said England's second national lockdown was brought in to stop the health service being ""physically overwhelmed"".**
The lockdown - which started on 5 November - is due to be replaced tomorrow by a stricter tier system.
Mr Gove was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for the evidence behind the government's decisions.
He made a number of claims:
He's pretty much right. We make average bed occupancy in England over that weekend 87%, but on average - between 1 November and 22 November - it was about 88%.
Bed occupancy can be used to measure pressure on the health service, and hospitals are meant to try to keep occupancy rates below 85% to have some wriggle-room in case of a surge in patients.
But in previous winters it has often exceeded this. For example, on average over the past four years, the first week in December (we don't have comparable November data) has an occupancy rate of 95%.
This appears to show that hospitals are under less pressure than usual.
However, this is a very different year, says Helen Buckingham, director of strategy at the Nuffield Trust.
""The hospitals have significant constraints in how they can use their beds compared to previous years in relation to infection control and Covid. The measures they have to put in place mean they cannot use all the capacity they've got.""
For example, NHS Providers points out that hospitals are arranged differently this year, effectively split into three zones: beds for those with coronavirus, those awaiting test results and those who are negative.
And issues such as increased infection control - including cleaning and putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) - will take up more staffing time, reducing the number of beds that may be used.
""Another thing that's different this year is the availability of staff. We tend to think of beds as a piece a furniture, but a bed is no use to people unless you can staff it,"" says Ms Buckingham.
Staff absences due to illness or self-isolation will have an impact. During the last peak in April, absence rates hit 6.2% compared with 4% in the previous year.
So lower bed occupancy does not necessarily mean that demand or pressures are lower. NHS Providers says these pressures are currently more similar to a normal year than the figures suggest.
Finally, some of this lower bed occupancy is by design.
Surges in cases can happen very quickly. It took just a month for the number of people in hospitals with coronavirus to triple between October and November.
Mr Gove pointed to the R number when England entered its second lockdown on 5 November as evidence of the need for tighter restrictions.
The R number refers to the rate of reproduction of the virus. An R rate of one means that each infected person is passing it onto one other person.
Mr Gove was correct. Analysis from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which was published on 6 November but relied upon data up to 3 November, estimated the R rate was between 1.1 and 1.3 in England.
In the North West, the range of R was between 1.0 and 1.2. This was probably because Liverpool and Manchester had entered tier three by that point and had been under enhanced restrictions for months.
Mr Gove also claimed in the interview with the Today programme that ""as a result of the steps that we took, we were able to bring the R rate down and it's now below 1 across the country"".
According to data up to 24 November gathered by Sage, the R number in England has now fallen to between 0.9 and 1.0.
However, in five out of the seven regions in England, the upper limit of the range remains above 1.
The relevant ONS data is its infection survey, which is published weekly.
This doesn't normally include growth rates but the ONS published a special dataset on 31 October that did include these.
The special dataset shows the infection doubling time for the six-week period 12 Sept to 23 October, so not quite the ""six weeks before the announcement"" claimed (the lockdown was announced on 31 October).
The average over the six-week period was indeed that infections doubled in 15 days.
The regional figures show that the West Midlands and East Midlands, not the East of England as Mr Gove claimed, had a doubling rate of 12 days over this period.
However, neither the West Midlands nor the East Midlands are low-prevalence areas in terms of their infection rates.
The main infection survey report published at the same time shows infection rates in the East of England, South West and South East as less than half that of the two Midlands regions.

As a guy who has dedicated a significant part of his life to uncovering environmental scams, naming this year’s Truth Teller is a no-brainer for me.  
The winner is the man who just brought down the head of Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency: Christopher Horner.
Chris is a skilled lawyer and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. About a decade ago he wrote, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming, which caused liberal heads to explode. This year he penned, The Liberal War on Transparancy, a book detailing how the Obama administration’s claim of being “the most transparaent” in history is pure hog washed propaganda.

"The word “climate” makes most of us look up to the sky – however, the IPCC’s new special report on climate change and land should make us all look under our feet.  Land, the report shows, is intimately linked to the climate. Changes in land use result in changes to the climate, and vice versa. In other words, what we do to our soils, we do to our climate – and ourselves. The first part of the report makes for difficult reading. Humans, it says, now exploit more than 70% of the Earth’s ice-free surface, and more than a quarter of land globally is suffering degradation as a result of human activities.  Soil is being lost up to 100 times faster than it is formed, and desertification is growing year on year. Temperature increases and heavy rains associated with climate breakdown are further degrading already damaged soils.  All this is already causing food insecurity, and unless action is taken the impacts will only get worse. The report states that unless we stop and reverse land degradation, food supply chains will become unstable, and nutrient levels in foods will decrease. These impacts will hit those living in precarious situations and in poverty the hardest, but the effects will be felt around the globe. How is it possible that soils have become so degraded? Don’t we need well functioning soils to produce food? The truth is, the modern farming system is based around oil, not soil.  For most of our history, humans could only produce as much food as the local ecological and soil conditions could support. Every time a crop was taken from the fields, nutrients were removed, making the soil less fertile. To cope, some societies developed complex and sustainable systems in which nutrients were returned to the soil in the form of organic waste. Using the local environment and labour to maintain soils in a good state was the key to survival. Modern farming, in contrast, has been shaped by the power of fossil fuels. The problem of limited soil fertility was overcome through fertilisation, mainly with synthetic nitrogen, which is made using natural gas or coal.  Today, emissions from nitrogen fertilisation are a major source of greenhouse gases, and the emissions produced in making that nitrogen are the biggest carbon cost in a loaf of bread.  In addition, the development of diesel-powered machinery made it possible to cultivate land which was previously inaccessible. As a result, more land is brought into cultivation, further destroying natural ecosystems such as forests. As the IPCC points out, deforestation is indeed the biggest source of agriculture-related CO₂ emissions. Machines and fertilisers enabled more intensive farming, in which organic material is not returned back to the soil and organisms such as earthworms and microbes which make soils function are constantly disturbed through ploughing and compaction – such intensive farming leads to soil degradation and exhaustion. Until recently, the “tractors and chemicals” recipe for food production served humanity well. It drove huge increases in global yields, and made the human population boom possible. But today the extent and severity of soil degradation through human over-exploitation is such that no amount of chemicals and machinery can compensate.  In Australia, years of irrigation have turned soils saline and toxic to crops. In the UK, the drained peatland soils of the Fens, which produce the most high-grade foods, are disappearing at a rate of 2cm a year. Spain, a huge producer of fresh fruits and vegetables, is in danger of desertification due to increasing temperatures and droughts. In sub-Saharan Africa, a quarter of the land is degraded, while 20% of China’s soils are polluted.  Across the world, soils have been pushed beyond their capacity to recover, and humanity’s ability to feed itself is now in danger. To ensure that we eat well and live well in the future, we’ll need to reverse the trend towards greater homogenisation which drove food systems so far. The future is localised and diverse, because while the “tractors and chemicals” recipe worked well across the world, at least for a time, there is no easy solution for sustainable land use.  The IPCC report recognises that reversing land degradation is a socio-ecological issue, and one that requires locally appropriate action. It stresses the importance of land rights and secure access, driving home the message that land and its peoples are indivisible.  Going forward, what does “restoring land” mean for our food systems? It means supporting the invaluable bottom-up experimentation being practiced by farmers and land managers and helping them develop and share their expertise. It means making sure that public subsidies to agriculture support restorative farming practices. It means working with big buyers and farmers to encourage land-stewardship and growing a greater diversity of crops. It means putting soils and their health at the centre of all land policies.  Regenerating land is a win-win, for humans and their ecosystems, if we dare to look beyond the immediate short-term horizon. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate scientist Michael Mann’s perception of reality may be formed more by what he desires to see than what he actually sees. For example:
1.)  Despite reams of proxy data and historical records showing that the Earth’s temperature behaved sinusoidally over the last 1000 years, Mann only sees a hockey stick behavior.
2) Despite the Nobel Prize Committee specifically stating that IPCC lead authors were not the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize, Michael Mann saw himself as a Nobel Prize winner.
3. Despite the fact that the Oxburgh report never exonerated Michael Mann, Michael Mann insists it did.
4. Despite the fact that most climate science skeptics get very little or no funding from Big Oil, Michael Mann insists that they get funded generously.
5. Despite Mann’s insistence climate science is settled, never has it been more in dispute.
And on it goes.
Now Mann’s longtime nemesis, Steve McIntyre, writes in his latest post that also the Muir Russell inquiry did not exonerate him, thus contradicting Mann’s claim that it had. What is now appearing is a pattern of Mann possibly confusing reality with his own personal desires of how he wishes things to be.
Yesterday McInytre wrote (my emphasis):

…Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Oxburgh inquiry had no more validity than Mann’s claim to have won a Nobel prize. In today’s post, I’ll continue my series on the “investigations” by showing that Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Muir Russell inquiry is equally invalid.
In my most recent post, I showed that Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Oxburgh inquiry had no more validity than Mann’s claim to have won a Nobel prize. In today’s post, I’ll continue my series on the “investigations” by showing that Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Muir Russell inquiry is equally invalid.
In their memoranda supporting their original motions to dismiss, both National Review and CEI had observed (correctly) that the Muir Russell panel had limited their findings to “CRU scientists” and contested Mann’s assertion that the Muir Russell panel had made any findings regarding Mann himself, let alone “exonerated” him.
In Mann’s Reply Memorandum, he vociferously rejected the (correct) assertion that the Muir Russell had not exonerated Mann himself, describing such assertion as merely an attempt to “obfuscate and misrepresent”. Mann supported this bluster with an apparent quotation from the Muir Russell report, but the phrase within the quotation marks does not actually occur within the Muir Russell report.  As shown below, Mann and/or his lawyers subtly altered the quotation to more supportive language.”

Again, if Steve McIntyre’s assertions are accurate, and I have little doubt they are, it appears Michael Mann tends to believe and cling to things that he desires to see, and not what is plainly real. This is troubling because Dr. Mann is not alone in struggling with the growing gap between what one wishes to see and what reality plainly is. Today we are witnessing the same exasperation and desperation throughout much of the established climate science community in its dealing with the unexpected 17-year temperature plateau. Many scientists just refuse to see it and insist the temperature is still rising rapidly – elsewhere…somewhere. It’s there, they insist – even if we can’t see it!
Another example are the severe winters and record ice we’ve been seeing. Some insist these are actually signs of warming! Naturally for an objective outside observer, it all looks a bit nutty.
Climate science finds itself in dire psychological circumstances. Therefore, as reality continues unfolding, we should not be surprised if climate science suddenly finds itself having a nervous breakdown. That’s what happens to anyone when reality becomes too much to take.

"Up to 800,000 hectares of the unique Chiquitano forest were burned to the ground in Bolivia between August 18 and August 23. That’s more forest than is usually destroyed across the country in two years. Experts say that it will take at least two centuries to repair the ecological damage done by the fires, while at least 500 species are said to be at risk from the flames. The Chiquitano dry forest in Bolivia was the largest healthy tropical dry forest in the world. It’s now unclear whether it will retain that status. The forest is home to Indigenous peoples as well as iconic wildlife such as jaguars, giant armadillos, and tapirs. Some species in the Chiquitano are found nowhere else on Earth. Distressing photographs and videos from the area show many animals have burned to death in the recent fires. The burnt region also encompasses farmland and towns, with thousands of people evacuated and many more affected by the smoke. Food and water are being sent to the region, while children are being kept home from school in many districts where the air pollution is double what is considered extreme. Many families are still without drinking water. While the media has focused on Brazil, Bolivians are asking the world to notice their unfolding tragedy – and to send help in combating the flames. It’s thought that the fires were started deliberately to clear the land for farming, but quickly got out of control. The perpetrators aren’t known, but Bolivian President Evo Morales has justified people starting fires, saying: “If small families don’t set fires, what are they going to live on?” The disaster comes just a month after Morales announced a new “supreme decree” aimed at increasing beef production for export. Twenty-one civil society organisations are calling for the repeal of this decree, arguing that it has helped cause the fires and violates Bolivia’s environmental laws. Government officials say that fire setting is a normal activity at this time of year and isn’t linked to the decree. Morales has repeatedly said that international help isn’t needed, despite having sent just three helicopters to tackle the raging fires. He argued that the fires are dying out in some areas – although they continue to burn in others and have now reached Bolivia’s largest city, Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Many say that the fires could have been contained far sooner with international help, as videos show volunteers trying to beat back the fires with branches. As the fires worsened, people gathered to protest in Santa Cruz state. Chanting “we want your help”, they complained that the smoke was so bad they were struggling to breathe. They want Morales to request international aid to fight the fires. While firefighters and volunteers struggle to tackle the blaze in 55℃ heat, Bolivians have set up a fundraiser to tackle the fires themselves.  A fortnight after the fires began, a supertanker aeroplane of water arrived, hired from the US. But if the reactions to the president’s announcement on Twitter are anything to go by, many Bolivians think this is too little, too late. Morales is fighting a general election and has faced criticism for staying on the campaign trail while the fires spread. Some Indigenous leaders are asking for a trial to determine responsibility for the fires, and the response to them. Alex Villca, an Indigenous leader and spokesperson, said:  It is President Evo Morales who should be held accountable. What are these accountabilities going to be? A trial of responsibilities for this number of events that are occurring in the country, this number of violations of Indigenous peoples and also the rights of Mother Nature. President Morales came to power in Bolivia in 2006, on a platform of socialism, Indigenous rights, and environmental protection. He passed the famous “Law of the Rights of Mother Earth” in 2010, which placed the intrinsic value of nature alongside that of humans. His environmental rhetoric has been strong but his policies have been contradictory. Morales has approved widespread deforestation, as well as roads and gas exploration in national parks. While the fires in the Chiquitano have dominated the media within the country, hundreds more rage across Bolivia, assisted by the recent drought. It’s unclear whether the response to these fires will affect the October election outcome, but sentiments are running high in the country, where more than 70% of people prioritise environmental protection over economic growth.  Bolsonaro and Brazil might grab the headlines, but Bolivia too is now host to a desperately serious humanitarian and environmental situation. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Smoke emitted by simple wick lamps, similar to the one shown here, was found to be a significant but previously overlooked source of global black carbon. These lamps are used by hundreds of millions of households, and can be replaced by cleaner, affordable alternatives. (Ajay Pillarisetti photo)
Interesting point, but I wonder how such a change would come about when people often can’t afford an alternative?
Let there be clean light: Kerosene lamps spew black carbon, should be replaced, study says
By Sarah Yang, Media Relations BERKELEY —
The primary source of light for more than a billion people in developing nations is also churning out black carbon at levels previously overlooked in greenhouse gas estimates, according to a new study led by researchers at UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois.
Results from field and lab tests found that 7 to 9 percent of the kerosene in wick lamps — used for light in 250-300 million households without electricity — is converted to black carbon when burned. In comparison, only half of 1 percent of the emissions from burning wood is converted to black carbon.
Factoring in the new study results leads to a twentyfold increase in estimates of black carbon emissions from kerosene-fueled lighting.

The previous estimates come from established databases used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others. One kilogram of black carbon, a byproduct of incomplete combustion and an important greenhouse gas, produces as much warming in a month as 700 kilograms of carbon dioxide does over 100 years, the authors said.
“The orange glow in flames comes from black carbon, so the brighter the glow, the more black carbon is being made,” said study principal investigator Tami Bond, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “If it’s not burned away, it goes into the atmosphere.”
The findings, published online this month in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, are coming out at the same time that the United Nations Climate Change Conference kicks off in Doha, Qatar. While officials from around the world are seeking effective policies and guidelines for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the study authors note that the simple act of replacing kerosene lamps could pack a wallop toward that effort.
“There are no magic bullets that will solve all of our greenhouse gas problems, but replacing kerosene lamps is low-hanging fruit, and we don’t have many examples of that in the climate world,” said study co-author Kirk Smith, professor at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health and director of the Global Health and Environment Program. “There are many inexpensive, cleaner alternatives to kerosene lamps that are available now, and few if any barriers to switching to them.”
Smith pointed to lanterns with light-emitting diodes that can be powered by solar cells or even advanced cookstoves that generate electricity from the heat produced. Such technology, said Smith, is already available in developing countries.
The researchers used kerosene lamps purchased in Uganda and Peru and conducted field experiments there to measure the emissions. They repeated the tests in the lab using wicks of varying heights and materials, and kerosene purchased in the United States as well as in Uganda.
The study authors noted that converting to cleaner light sources would not only benefit the planet, it would help improve people’s health. A recent epidemiological study in Nepal led by Smith and other researchers at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, for example, found that women who reported use of kerosene lamps in the home had 9.4 times the rate of tuberculosis compared with those who did not use such lamps.
“Getting rid of kerosene lamps may seem like a small, inconsequential step to take, but when considering the collective impact of hundreds of millions of households, it’s a simple move that affects the planet,” said study lead author Nicholas Lam, a UC Berkeley graduate student in environmental health sciences.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, U.S. Agency for International Development and Environmental Protection Agency helped support this research.

"Revered French gastronome Jean Brillat-Savarin coined the phrase: “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are”. He wasn’t wrong. If you’re someone who thinks about your food choices, its probably in terms of health or ethics. But they are also intimately connected with identity, class, and ideology.  Kosher and Halal foods are a signal of religious affiliation. Caviar and gold leaf hint at wealth. The enjoyment of wine has as much to do with what it’s served in as its taste. But what of meat? Due to its cost, meat consumption in Western societies has been linked with higher status, power, wealth and masculinity for centuries. In medieval England, peasant diets would be almost wholly vegetarian. Meat was the preserve of royal and aristocratic households, where the hunt became part of male rites of passage, but also power over the natural world. This gendered and class-based structuring of access to meat continued well into the second half of the 20th century, since the best cuts were reserved for the patriarch of the family. In many ways, veganism challenges these traditions. Vegans, for instance, are more likely to be young and female than old and male. The lifestyle also challenges traditional norms of masculinity. And instead of the hedonistic consumption associated with the upper classes, veganism is associated with restraint and discipline. Yet, this restraint comes with its own social implications. As our new research shows, plant-based diets come with burdens – and successfully navigating them can help vegans to promote an image of upward mobility in contemporary consumer society. We first studied how veganism was represented in more than 2,000 articles in the UK media. Then we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with middle-class consumers who were either vegans or closely acquainted with vegans. We mapped how they perceived veganism, including its relationship to class and character. Analysing data from the interviews and the media together, we identified five key burdens associated with the vegan lifestyle, and the social signals that successfully navigating them sends. The first burden relates to knowledge. Vegans generally need to be not only vigilant about ingredients, but able to unpack their meaning for animal welfare, climate change, sustainability, and personal health. The accomplished vegan therefore signals a wealth of knowledge in a society where educational attainment has high social value. Financial wealth is useful too. Vegan products and replacement ingredients are often expensive, and not within every household’s budget. It is possible to eat vegan cheaply, but doing so costs time for a diet that is already time-intensive – both in terms of shopping and food preparation. Navigating these demands signals that you have at least a little money – or at least time – to spare, as well as efficiency and time management skills, which are desirable qualities in the world of work. Finally, veganism often requires fortitude and discipline – both to deny oneself short-term hedonistic pleasures in the commitment to ethical principles, and to fend off the typical perception of vegans as troublesome or challenging guests. Managing these emotional and social burdens signals resilience and goal-seeking behaviour in a competitive environment, and the likely presence of a strong social network support. Consumers are rarely actively pursuing social goals when going vegan. But at a sociological level, it does present opportunities to communicate personal attributes that are considered useful in contemporary society: knowledgeable, disciplined, able to support oneself, but also able to form social connections. Rather than only engaging with food for pleasure, our respondents recognised that the challenges of veganism can be used to signal social status and, if originating from a lower socioeconomic class, an upward trajectory in one’s fortunes. Of course, the ethical and environmental aspects are still – for many people – the major motivation to be vegan. But as other recent research of ours shows, thanks to recent celebrity uptake of the diet, veganism is no longer a purely moral movement at the periphery of society, but also a desirable lifestyle choice considered trendy in mainstream culture. Indeed, Beyoncé’s undertaking of a 22-day vegan challenge helped interest in veganism to explode – despite her wearing leather and fur to a restaurant during the challenge. The ethos of veganism itself is an admirable and strongly held altruistic conviction among many of its practitioners – but it also plays an important role in curating your personal image. Perhaps Brillat-Savarin’s dictum should now read: “Tell me who you want to be and I will tell you what to eat!” Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"**There have been 96,762 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 3,797 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to Scottish government figures.**
This page is updated regularly and analyses the key figures for the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland.
Figures updated at 14:00 on 2 December 2020.
Over the past seven days there have been **5,801** cases detected following a test, with **951** confirmed on Wednesday.
This next chart shows the number of daily confirmed cases after an NHS Scotland or UK government test since 1 August, along with a seven-day average.
The actual number of people infected since February will be far higher than the overall confirmed cases figure, as most people who had Covid-19 during the peak of the outbreak were not tested.
Scotland's ""second wave"" has seen a much bigger surge in the number of cases because many more people are being tested.
The weekly number of positive tests per 100,000 people in each of Scotland's 32 local authorities is now a key indicator of which Covid level a council area will be placed in.
The Scottish government works to a system of thresholds, while also considering other indicators such as hospital admissions when reviewing the levels.
The number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.
The most recent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart uses figures from four days ago.
Looking at the total number of cases by health board, the highest number has been in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, reflecting the fact it is the most populous part of Scotland.
The first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March and the number of daily deaths peaked on 15 April when 84 were reported.
Over the summer, Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19, but the rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn.
There are three ways to measure deaths from Covid-19.
The Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.
The NRS also publishes monthly data on excess deaths in 2020, compared with a five-year average.
At its peak in the spring, the coronavirus outbreak created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals, with more than 1,500 patients in hospital and over 200 being treated on intensive care wards.
Numbers reduced over the summer, but rose steadily again throughout the autumn before starting to decline again.
Only patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.
They are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the percentage of positive test results is a key measure when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.
The organisation has stated that if less than 5% of samples from a comprehensive testing system return a positive result over two weeks then it is one indication an epidemic is under control.
Other indications include a continuous decline in hospital admissions and a decline in the number of new deaths over at least three weeks.
This chart shows the ""positivity rate"" in Scotland since 18 August.
The Scottish government changed the way it measures this rate on 19 October.
Previously, the government calculated it by dividing the number of positive cases with the number of newly-tested individuals each day.
However, it now calculates the rate using the number of positive tests reported each day.
The Scottish government said it changed the method to bring it into line with the WHO's criteria, and because the previous measure was ""likely to over-estimate the positivity rate"" as more people were repeatedly tested.
The R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.
If the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.
The Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
England's month-long lockdown ends on Wednesday, with a ""three-tier system"" due to return following a vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.
All areas in the Eastern region were due to be in tier two - high alert, meaning people cannot socialise with other households indoors and the rule-of-six applying outdoors.
The rate in Luton was above 250 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 27 November - the 32nd worst council district in England - but it continues to see a fall in cases week on week.
Northampton, Peterborough, and Broxbourne in Hertfordshire have a rate above the England-wide average, but all have fallen week on week.
Every district in Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire have falls in their case rates, except for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire.
Below is a table showing the rate of cases per 100,000 people by council district in the week to 27 November, and the figure at the same point a week ago.
Below is how many people have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 November per county, and the figure at the same point a week ago.

"The human fingerprint on the climate is now unmistakable and will become increasingly evident over the coming decades, the UK Met Office has confirmed after 30 years of pioneering study. Since the 1990s, global temperatures have warmed by half a degree, Arctic sea ice has shrunk by almost 2 million km2, sea-levels have risen by about 10cm and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 60 parts per million (17%), according to figures exclusively compiled for the Guardian to mark the 30th anniversary of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre for climate science and services. The data highlights how a young generation has grown up in a climate unprecedented in a millennium. Future projections suggest that by mid-century a 60-year-old Briton is likely to be living in a climate 1.2C warmer than when they were born. Scientists at the Hadley Centre, which has been on the global frontline of climate monitoring, research and modelling since it opened in 1990, said early theories about fossil-fuel disruption have been proven by subsequent facts. “The climate now is completely different from what we had 30 years ago. It is completely outside the bounds of possibility in natural variation,” said Peter Stott, a professor and expert on climate attribution science at the centre. In the Hadley Centre’s early projections, he said, scientists forecast 0.5C of warming in the UK between 1990 and 2020 as a result of emissions from oil, gas and coal: “We got it spot on.”  With new heat records being broken with increasing frequency, he said global temperatures were now above any level in the Met Office measurements since 1850, or indirectly calculated through tree rings going back thousands of years. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are also higher than anything seen in million-year-old ice cores. “We are seeing an unprecedented climate,” Stott said. “The human fingerprint is everywhere.” The impact was less obvious in 1990, when the centre opened in conjunction with the publication of the first report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - both were overseen by the UK scientist John Houghton, who died earlier this year. At the inauguration, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said the UK needed a world-leading climate centre to assess the “serious consequences” of greenhouse gas emissions. “What it predicts will affect our daily lives. Governments and international organisations in every part of the world are going to have to sit up and take notice and respond,” she said. Thatcher, who studied science at Oxford, needed little convincing, but she had to overcome a sceptical cabinet. Atmospheric physicists had been warning oil companies and policymakers about the dangers of fossil fuels for decades, but the “greenhouse effect” was still a relatively novel concern for the broader public. Nobody felt a change. The world had already warmed by about half a degree from pre-industrial levels, but this was low enough to be within natural variation. Few people knew the difference between short-term “weather” and the “climate”, which is usually measured over a much longer period of 30 years. Back then, there was also considerable scepticism about the ability of meteorologists to forecast change, even on a daily basis. Memories were fresh of the BBC weatherman Michael Fish infamously reassuring viewers that fears of a hurricane were unfounded, just hours before the fiercest storm in generations hit the UK. “It was unglamorous” recalls James Murphy, a science fellow who was posted to the Hadley Centre from the beginning. “But the mood in the first decade was one of great excitement, because it was a chance to do a lot of pioneering research in a growing field.” As acceptance and importance grew, so did scepticism. Critics, often funded by oil firms, pushed back against climate science because they did not like its political and economic implications. Ahead of the climate summits in Kyoto (1997) and Copenhagen (2009), fossil fuel companies funded misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on climate models. The Hadley Centre remained focused on science. Researchers expanded and refined their models by incorporating new knowledge on biological carbon cycles and the likely impact of fossil fuels not only on temperature, but on Arctic ice, sea-level rise, flooding, storms, droughts and other atmospheric phenomena. Supercomputer advances enabled much greater precision. Early models mapped the impact on grid cells of 300km on each side. Today that is down to 2.2km, which allows detailed predictions of which stretches of river basins and coastlines will need the most protection. Researchers are discovering the impacts go far beyond the initial focus on average temperature. Heat records are being set with increasing frequency. Rainfall patterns are noticeably shifting beyond natural variation. Arctic ice is shrinking faster than expected. The rising seas have already left some places, such as Fairbourne in Wales, below spring-tide levels. By 2050 – the year the UK plans to achieve carbon neutrality – the direct impact on Britain will be moderated by the surrounding ocean and there may be opportunities to plant new crops, but these benefits will be dwarfed by trade disruption, migration, humanitarian disasters and shifting ecosystems. “Overall it’s bad. The negatives outweigh the positives,” said Richard Betts, a Met Office scientist who is leading scientific analysis for the next UK climate change risk assessment. “It stands to reason that if the world keeps gets hotter and hotter, sooner or later we’ll reach the point where it is first uncomfortable and then hard to function. This won’t be seen in the UK, but in parts of the world that are already hot and humid it could increasingly get too hot to function.” The Hadley supercomputer calculates myriad possible pathways depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. The good news is that the worst-emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, is considered less likely than before because the global coal industry has not grown as feared. The bad news is current emissions trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea-level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer. The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation. Even the current best-case scenario – RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement – would leave the world hotter than today. “What stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We’ll need to prepare and adapt,” says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley. He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception. “As a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.” More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet. “There are still dangers out there that we don’t fully understand,” said Stott. “Much of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?” Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre’s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them. “Reality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,” Stott said. “The worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don’t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue. Scientific evidence has been around for a while. It is time it was taken seriously.” Observed September Arctic sea ice extent from HadISST.2.2.0.0 (selected as single source from Met Office climate dashboard.)

"One of the most powerful tropical storms ever recorded, Typhoon Haiyan rampaged across the central Philippines in 2013, causing the deaths of more than 7,000 people. The devastating consequences were not simply the result of a 7.5 metre “storm surge” but also down to the fact that few people actually knew what it meant when there were warnings of the phenomenon, and the threat it posed to the population. Storm surge does not occur as inland flooding caused by heavy rainfall, or as coastal flooding that occurs any time low-lying land is inundated by seawater. Storm surge is an abnormal rise in water levels over the estimated high tide. Simply put, it is ocean water forced by powerful hurricane winds towards the coast. Such hurricane-force winds are always hazardous to coastal communities and infrastructure, but often the most devastating consequences for local populations are due to storm surge.  Storm surges are unique in their characteristics, because of their high sensitivity to the slightest change in storm parameters such as speed, pressure, intensity, direction of approach, position of the coast or the depth of the ocean. Storm parameters tend to change rapidly during the lifecycle of a hurricane, increasing uncertainty around storm surge water levels. Despite being regarded as a secondary hazard, storm surge often poses more of a threat than strong hurricane winds, usually regarded as the primary hazard. Coastal areas are largely altered by various other factors such as erosion and depletion of storm buffers such as reefs, wetlands and salt marshes through day-to-day interaction with the dynamics of the sea. So the coastline is constantly changing, making it more vulnerable and paving the way for new inundation levels from the next storm surge. Sometimes storm surge is confused with tsunamis (as both involve a wall of water rushing towards the coastline), or storm tides, which are a combination of storm surge and tide over and above the normal water level. Both phenomena result in coastal inundations and can cause substantial loss of life and economic damage. Tsunamis can be seismic, meaning they can result from the vibrations of the Earth such as earthquakes, or non-seismic – caused by phenomena such as meteorites or asteroids. But storm surge is only associated with tropical or extra-tropical cyclones where heavy winds trigger the abnormal rise in water levels. A typical effect of a tsunami is the receding of the sea – identified during the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 – before it banks up  to create a huge wall of water. This was also witnessed during Hurricane Irma in 2017, when the storm exhibited a “negative storm surge effect”. This happens when seawater is sucked away from the shore uncovering the seabed or leaving it in a dry state. A study from 2018 claimed that the death rate from storm surges is decreasing thanks to improved forecasting technologies, early warning systems, coastal protections and speedy evacuations. However, recent storms like Cyclone Idai remind us that storm surge has not gone away. Counting deaths attributed to storm surge over a period of time seems to give a misleading picture of reduced impact, plus signs of a decreasing trend may not indicate the actual risks associated with storm surge.   In 2018, Edward Rappaport, acting director of the US’s National Hurricane Center, carried out an analysis on direct deaths from Atlantic tropical cyclones over three decades from 1970-1999. His study recorded that most of cyclone-related fatalities were associated with rainfall and not attributable to storm surges. The 1,800 deaths from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and significant economic damage that occurred during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, majorly altered his claim, and he later reported that 49% of deaths from Atlantic hurricanes are directly associated with storm surge. The increase in tropical cyclone-generated storm surges that occurred around the world between 2015 and 2018 and the human and economic cost that resulted, clearly contradicts any claim that death rates from storm surges are decreasing. During the course of Cyclone Idai, which struck Zimbabwe and the coast of Mozambique on March 14, 2019, mud houses were washed away and sea defences were damaged. Towns were cut off from rescue operations, and the death toll exceeded 800 people with hundreds reported missing. Winds of up to 177kmph (106mph) resulted in 90% of the city of Beira in Mozambique being destroyed. With airports closed, rescuers could only reach survivors by land, which not only protracted the rescue process but also complicated the deployment of food, water and emergency medical services. This is what typically happens when a storm surge hits. Cyclone Idai is a deadly example of the power of a storm surge, and the cities in its path are still recovering from the impact, with the death toll expected to exceed 1,000. This would certainly indicate that storm surge is not a declining trend. Which is all the more reason to help people in vulnerable parts of the world to understand what storm surge is and just how much a threat to life it can be."
"**Surgeons from across Northern Ireland are to carry out operations at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen to reduce a backlog of surgery as a result of coronavirus.**
The Belfast Trust, which operates the Nightingale facility at Belfast City Hospital, is the first to relocate surgery to Enniskillen.
Priority gynaecology and renal cases are being scheduled first.
Urgent general surgery cases are being planned for December.
The potential for urgent paediatric orthopaedic cases is also being explored.
Health Minister Robin Swann said while the initiative was initially focussed on ""high priority"" patients, officials were also looking at making the most of the available capacity at the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in the long term.
The Health and Social Care Board said work was ongoing to identify further high-priority elective work from across Northern Ireland that could be delivered at SWAH.
Mark Taylor, from the Royal College of Surgeons, said the additional capacity was ""urgently needed"" to reduce the backlog of surgical patients on waiting lists.
""It is important that Northern Ireland 'COVID-light' sites are delivered on a regional basis so that surgical capacity can be rebuilt and can keep going during this time,"" he said.
""We also need a longer-term strategy to look at how elective and emergency surgery are carried out in Northern Ireland's hospitals and how these sites are staffed.""
Chief executive of the Western Trust, Dr Anne Kilgallen, welcomed the move.
""This initial phase of regional collaborative working in respect of elective in-patient surgery at South West Acute Hospital has very much highlighted the excellent facilities and opportunities which are available there,"" she said.
""This development work will continue and other specialties will be explored.""
The Western Trust, which has struggled in the past to recruit staff to work in the south-west, also confirmed it had made offers to fill three permanent consultant surgeon vacancies.
Jill Weir, from Unison, said it was an opportunity for the hospital to showcase its ""fantastic"" facilities, and medical and nursing staff, in order to attract people to work here in the future.
""We would welcome anything that is NHS work locally as well, but our concerns would be we've already overstretched staff here and as long as this isn't taking away from local services and not stressing out our nursing staff we would welcome it,"" she said.
Fermanagh GP Dr John Porteous said it was an example of how services will have to be delivered in the future.
""Our national health service has shown itself to be extremely flexible and adaptable in the face of this pandemic so this is just another example of how we are going to need to think creatively about how to maximise the use of the resources available,"" he said.
""This is a fine building with excellent accommodation and facilities so I think it's only right that the health minister and the department are looking at maximising the potential of this building and these facilities."""

To: Dr. Roger Wakimoto



Director, National Center for Atmospheric Research



Boulder, Colorado



Roger, you are the head of what is perhaps the most prestigious atmospheric science laboratory on the planet, and, as such, I presume that you will always go the extra mile to protect the reputation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and its related University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).



I’m sure you have seen and discussed with your staff many of the “Climategate” emails released first in November, 2009, and then more recently, earlier this month.



Everyone agrees that the tone and content of many of them is a bit shrill and occasionally intolerant (kind of like University faculty meetings), but there is one repeating thread, by one of your most prestigious employees, Dr. Tom Wigley, that is far beyond the pale of most academic backbiting.



The revoking of my doctorate, the clear objective of Tom’s email, is the professional equivalent of the death penalty. I think it needs to be brought to your attention, because the basic premise underlying his machinations is patently and completely false. Dr Wigley is known as a careful scientist, but he certainly was careless here.



The global circulation of this email has caused unknown damage to my reputation. Also, please note that all communications from Dr. Wigley to his colleagues on this matter were on the NCAR/UCAR server.



The relevant email was sent to Rick Piltz, a UCAR employee at the time, and copied to Michael Mann, Pennsylvania State University, James Hansen and Gavin Schmidt, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Benjamin Santer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,the late Steven Schneider, Stanford University, and several other very prominent climate scientists. The influence of these individuals is manifest and evidence of a very serious attempt to destroy my credential.



What Dr. Wigley wrote to this group of individuals was:



“You may be interesting [sic] in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?”



As I said, revoking the doctorate of a scientist is the equivalent of imposing a professional death penalty. Unfortunately, Wigley’s rationale for organizing this effort was based upon a pure fabrication.



Wigley’s call for a “re‐​assessing” of my dissertation stems from his contention that I either misled my academic committee or my committee was guilty of professional malfeasance, both very serious charges. (His email is reproduced in its entirety at the end of this note.)



My 1979 dissertation was a model relating interannual and interseasonal variations in the shape of the atmosphere, as reflected by the surface barometric pressure field, to variations crop yields across the United States.



In this type of model, one usually factors out the technological component of crop yields (which, incidentally, explains much more variation than any climate component) and then models the remaining variation in yield with the climate factor, in order to “isolate” the climate component. The explained variance of this residual yield by climate is generally about 50%, which is very close to the average I found for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat.



Wigley said in his email that I claimed to have explained 95% of the variation in crop yield, which he said “would have been a remarkable results” [sic]. In fact, there is no such statement, nor anything related to that, in my dissertation. He went on to state that I did this by simultaneously modelling the technological, spatial and climate components of agricultural yield, instead of separating out technological components first.



Despite his claimed familiarity with my dissertation, I did no such thing. Table 2, beginning on page 154 of the dissertation, is labelled “DETRENDING FUNCTIONS”, and gives the equations that were used to remove the technological component. All subsequent analyses were on the detrended data.



Wigley then alleged that either I lied to my examination committee, or that they were buffoons. It is worth noting that the committee included the famously tough Reid Bryson, father of the modern notion that human beings could change the climate.



“Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.”



This came to my attention with the release of the first East Anglia emails in November, 2009. This email and other, new statements by him about my dissertation have surfaced with the recent release of additional emails, and his letter about my dissertation is again being circulated around the web.



I think you will agree that it is time for Dr. Wigley to state that his attempt to generate a movement to remove my doctorate was based upon clear errors on his part, errors that he should have known about, and yet he has let the record stand for over two years. What he “discovered years ago” was certainly not in my dissertation.



Roger, I don’t think you would put up with this, and I think Wigley must be compelled to come forth. Remember that he did this on NCAR’s (and the taxpayer’s) dime.



Thank you very much.

Dear folks,



You may be interesting in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?



Michaels’ PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt with statistical (regression‐​based) modeling of crop‐​climate relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical model showed that weather/​climate variations could explain 95% of the inter‐​annual variability in crop yields. Had this been correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it was at odds with all previous studies of crop‐​climate relationships, which generally showed that weather/​climate could only explain about 50% of inter‐​annual yield variability.



How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels’ regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability, so that, in Michaels’ regressions, weather/​climate explains just 5 of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels’ claim that weather/​climate explains 95% of the variability is completely bogus.



Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.



As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop‐​climate modeling. We used a spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.



Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983: Crop‐​climate modelling using spatial patterns of yield and climate: Part 1, Background and an example from Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.



There never was a “Part 2.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Spiegel here has a piece by science journalist Axel Bojanowski about Richard Tol quitting the IPCC in protest: “Alleged panic-making: Leading scientist leaves the head of the IPCC. The dispute surrounding the UN IPCC escalates.”
Spiegel writes how Tol complains that the IPCC has “wiped away decisive formulations” from the final version and that the language of the report has been written by the “horsemen of the Apocalypse“.
Spiegel writes:
A ‘stupid statement’ in the report is the claim that people in war areas are especially vulnerable to climate change.”
Tol thinks that the people in Syria “are far more afraid of chemical weapons“.
Spiegel adds that Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change aimed criticism at Tol” resignation, claiming his criticism came too late. Tol rejects Ward’s assertion: “Material was not submitted too late, rather it was moved from one chapter to another.”
Spiegel then writes that Ward subscribes to the more pessimistic view when it comes to the economic impacts that climate change may have, a view that Tol outright dismisses.
SPIEGEL ONLINE claims to have a draft of the “secret report” and writes that in it assumptions have been “significantly corrected downwards” and that the IPCC expects an economic loss that is only “a tenth of that claimed by the Stern Report“.
Although Spiegel does not take a side in the article, Bojanowski’s report shows just how discordant, contentious and disharmonious the IPCC has become.

"You never know when a frog playing an electronic game will lead to an experiment on the physics of saliva. But then, who even knew that frogs could play electronic games? So let’s start with that. Alexis C. Noel, a Ph. D. student in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech, and her supervisor, David L. Hu, were watching a viral YouTube video in which a frog is attacking the screen of a smartphone running an   game. It appears to be winning. They started wondering how  —   in reality  —   frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them, and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying. “It’s been an adventure ever since,” Ms. Noel said. First, the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye, requiring Ms. Noel and her colleagues to shoot   video of a variety of frogs at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta. Then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue. Ms. Noel fondly recalled spending hours at night in the lab scraping tongues from dissected frogs donated by a biology class at the university. “I needed about a fifth of a teaspoon of saliva,” she said. With data on the speed of the tongue shot and retraction, the viscosity  —   or stickiness  —   of the saliva, and the softness of the tongue tissue, they came up with a computer simulation to test their ideas of what was going on. What they found was that frog saliva, which is normally 50, 000 times stickier than human saliva, flows freely when it hits an insect. That makes the saliva a   fluid, which means that the speed at which it flows (to be precise, its shear rate) changes how viscous it is. In the case of frog saliva, the faster it is forced to flow, the looser it gets. When the frog tongue hits a cricket, the saliva becomes 100 times less viscous and flows around the cricket into every little crevice. By the time the frog starts to pull its tongue back, in a much smoother and slower motion than the body slam attack, the saliva has gotten thick and sticky again and the tongue has wrapped all around the cricket. There is one more step. The frog has to get the cricket unstuck and into its stomach. What helps here is that frog swallowing involves retracting its  eyeballs  —   so violently that it loosens up the saliva again. The researchers published their findings in Royal Society Interface. Dr. Hu said the detailed understanding of how the process worked had obvious applications for the growing field of soft robots made of very flexible materials. Not that they will have tongues, but they may need to grab and release  —   who knows what  —   with appendages more like tongues than metal claws. Ms. Noel said her research was “all about how you grab things with very soft surfaces. ” She is also studying cat tongues, for instance. They are covered in tiny little curved spikes, like claws, which, oddly enough, are very good at detangling snarls in fur."

Stability in Central Asia is threatened by Pakistan’s slow surrender to extremism. Many of Pakistan’s problems are rooted in the spread of hateful and intolerant beliefs.



The U.S. State Department should cite Pakistan as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act. Pakistan illustrates why religious persecution is a problem transcending national boundaries.



Freedom of conscience, the essence of religious liberty, is a foundation for all other human rights. A national community which refuses to defend those who believe differently is likely to become a source of intolerance, hatred, and violence — which may end up directed beyond its own country’s boundaries.



The ongoing disintegration of Pakistani society was reflected in the assassinations of Punjab Governor Salman Taseer in January and Religious Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti in March. Taseer was a Muslim who opposed the religious parties and denounced Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Bhatti, a Christian, said he was “speaking for the oppressed, marginalized and persecuted Christians and other minorities.”



Although a few brave Pakistanis embraced the two men in death, many more stayed silent while extremists praised the murderers. Taseer’s son was kidnapped in August.



In such an environment, official support for al‐​Qaida and other terrorists should come as no surprise. A poll last year found that some 60 percent of Pakistanis viewed America as an enemy.



Much of America’s unpopularity results from Washington’s policies. The war in Afghanistan and especially drone attacks in Pakistan have created growing popular hostility.



But the spread of Islamic extremism has created an environment in which violence naturally flourishes. Even if those willing to strike remain a minority, they increasingly receive warm support from others.



The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that “Pakistan continues to be responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.” The commission pointed to the blasphemy laws which, along with “other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism.”



The State Department’s assessment of religious liberty is equally blunt. The department noted: “Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuse against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government’s failure or delay in addressing religious hostility by societal actors fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.”



Both the commission and the department emphasize the blasphemy laws as a particular problem. Last year Freedom House concluded: “The situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” The extremist Jamiat Ulema‐​e‐​Islam party proposed banning the Bible as “blasphemous.”



Even before the Taseer and Bhatti murders, the situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. Last November the State Department declared: “The number and severity of reported high‐​profile cases against minorities increased” and “organized violence against minorities increased.”



International Christian Concern, which placed Pakistan in its “Hall of Shame,” noted that Islamabad “absolutely refuses to progress toward a religiously free society.” Or a free society in any other way.



Washington can do little to transform internal Pakistani affairs. But U.S. officials should make the toxic human environment an issue of bilateral discussion.



The best way to do so would be to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern, which is warranted when there are “systematic, ongoing, and egregious” violations of religious liberty “engaged in or tolerated” by the relevant government.



A CPC rating requires the State Department to act, such as imposing sanctions, or granting a waiver. Even in the latter case the designation can spark an ongoing dialogue. Many Americans already wonder why the U.S. continues to provide Pakistan with billions of dollars annually in foreign aid.



Pakistan’s geopolitical importance inevitably inclines the State Department against holding Islamabad accountable for its dangerous religious climate. However, Pakistan’s very centrality to U.S. policy makes the internal situation especially threatening for Americans as well as Pakistanis. The primary issue is a nuclear‐​armed state in the hands of those shaped by a system which celebrates intolerance and murder.



Unless the current government confronts those promoting intolerance, moderate Muslims may vanish along with Christians. Three leading Pakistani Christian leaders issued a statement after Shahbaz Bhatti’s death: “If the country becomes a killing field of the democrat and liberal individuals who exercise their freedom of conscience and expression, it would embolden the criminals trying to take charge of the country.”



If Pakistan is taken over by such “criminals” — or, more specifically, extremists advocating the use of violence — the consequences could be incalculable. Washington should do its utmost to avoid such a threat. Angering Islamabad today by raising the pressure through a CPC designation today might be the best means to prevent a crisis in relations tomorrow.

The “Hurricane Sandy is caused by global warming” Tabloid Climatology™ affliction gets out of control on MSNBC in a Chris Matthews interview with Dr. Michael Oppenheimer:

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well Professor [Michael] Oppenheimer, back in the 60s, we calls such people pigs. Pigs. No, really. They don’t care about the planet, they don’t care about the destruction of war. All they want is what they got, their stuff, and they want more of it. Is that what we’re facing here, just greed? I’m not talking about the guy at the coal mind, that’s hard work. I’m talking about people who won’t listen to you, won’t listen to science because they want more stuff.
OPPENHEIMER: Listen, Chris, I’m not into name calling here. I think —
MATTHEWS: Well I am.
The hate is extraordinary. I wonder if Chris Matthews realizes that he just insulted a good portion of the USA populace that is skeptical about AGW?
And, with a salary of $5 million, I wonder how much “stuff” Chris Matthews has compared to the average viewer he foams to.

OK, so Washington (and a bunch of other East Coast cities) just saw its warmest month in modern history. That would be July 2011, and my greener friends were very happy. “At least now maybe the politicians will listen,” said one of my high‐​placed friends. D.C.‘s weather bloggers insist this is a clear sign of the global warming apocalypse caused by pernicious economic activity.



And so, for the past days, I have been involved in a running discussion with said bloggers. Predictably, I argued that the vast share of Washington’s overheat was caused by our “urban heat island”, and not by dreaded greenhouse gases. I conceded that a small part may have been due to our industrial exhalations.



I was wrong. None of it can be pinned on global warming. Should have tested my hypotheses before opening my yap, something I often accuse my friends of not doing.



A bit on the National Furnace, aka downtown Washington:



Matt Groening should do a comic book about this place, called “Summer in Hell.” Before the invention of air conditioning, anyone who could — including Congress — got out in June and came back in September. Now, thanks to modern technology, we spend the entire summer legislating (or, in the case of this Congress, not legislating) inside air‐​conditioned marble tombs. Trips outside are horrendous, especially on sunny days when moisture wafts off the torpid Potomac.



Along with air conditioning came ever bigger government, more government employees, more industries serving government employees, more black SUV’s panting in conga lines squeezing from the area’s few superhighways onto streets designed for the horse era, more buildings, more black pavement, and, yes more heat.



The urban surface, especially dark pavement and brick, absorbs tremendous amounts of solar energy, and then dissipates less of it away at night as the uneven surface of masonry, buildings and streets impedes the flow of ventilating winds. DC’s heat island is especially vicious because of the waste heat from all the money changing hands and the excessive rutting that tends to accompany such activity.



This is Gomorrah‐​on‐​the‐​Potomac, a city where the welcoming signs should say, “When in Gomorrah, do as the Gomorrons do.” Indeed, many do come here to be participant‐​observers in our peculiar anthropology, driving up the temperature even further.



It’s also a city where the rise in local temperature is directly proportional to the national debt.



So, with regard to the local heat, how does global warming shape up compared to what the Gomorrons cause on their own?



Well, there were two “global warmings” in the 20th century. The first began around 1910 and ended around 1945. Carbon dioxide emissions really took off after the Great War, so the current myth in climate discussions is that this warming had little to do with that and more to do with solar changes and the final rebound from the abnormal cold of previous centuries.



The second warming began in 1976–77 and was initiated by a totally unforeseen event known as the Great Pacific Climate Shift, a sudden change that reverberated from the Pacific to the world. That warming peaked with the great El Niño (another Pacific event) of 1997–98, an anomaly so great that it has yet to be eclipsed. One of the many sideshows in the climate biz is whether or not the lack of net warming since then has any real meaning for the future. It might.



So, if human‐​caused global warming is making Washington even more hellish, there should be some correlation between what happened since 1976 and now. Check it out:





That’s not a pretty picture for those claiming our recent suffering is because of our economic sins.



Just to shoot a few more plump fish in this very small barrel (an activity I too little of a sportsman to tire of), here’s a plot of annual temperature departures from the long term mean at Washington’s Reagan National Airport versus the global departure.





“Explained variance” is the amount of Washington’s interannual temperature variation that is related to global changes. Statistically, 2.6% = _zero_ for this sample of 34 years.



What I don’t get is why apocalypse lovers aren’t overjoyed about this. Presuming that some day D.C.‘s temperatures will get with the global warming program, things will get — using their favorite phrase — _even worse_. Yes, the hell created by the culture of Gomorrah‐​on‐​the‐​Potomac will actually become hotter than hell.

Published in the Financial Post today:
OPEN CLIMATE LETTER TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL: Current scientific knowledge does not substantiate Ban Ki-Moon assertions on weather and climate, say 125 scientists.
Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
H.E. Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General, United Nations
First Avenue and East 44th Street, New York, New York, U.S.A.
November 29, 2012
Mr. Secretary-General:
On November 9 this year you told the General Assembly: “Extreme weather due to climate change is the new normal … Our challenge remains, clear and urgent: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to strengthen adaptation to … even larger climate shocks … and to reach a legally binding climate agreement by 2015 … This should be one of the main lessons of Hurricane Sandy.”
On November 13 you said at Yale: “The science is clear; we should waste no more time on that debate.”  
The following day, in Al Gore’s “Dirty Weather” Webcast, you spoke of “more severe storms, harsher droughts, greater floods”, concluding: “Two weeks ago, Hurricane Sandy struck the eastern seaboard of the United States. A nation saw the reality of climate change. The recovery will cost tens of billions of dollars. The cost of inaction will be even higher. We must reduce our dependence on carbon emissions.”
We the undersigned, qualified in climate-related matters, wish to state that current scientific knowledge does not substantiate your assertions.

"The Covid-19 recession will bring fiscal stimulus on a massive scale. There are high hopes that the recovery will be green but it could be an uphill struggle. A big opportunity for Australia’s governments is to keep the renewable energy revolution going. There will be pressure to invest in anything that quickly brings back jobs and prosperity, never mind long term, social or environmental goals. A return to the world as it was in 2019 will seem a marvellous goal for the many people whose jobs have gone or whose businesses have faltered. In order to improve the economy relative to pre-Covid, to build back better, will need governments to lead.  The forces pushing the other way are strong. Fossil fuel interests see Covid as a chance to push their barrel, all too evident in the push under way in Australia to increase gas production, regardless of the fact that it would raise greenhouse gas emissions for a long time to come. In the United States, longstanding environmental protection rules have been suspended under the cover of Covid, and Brazil’s government plans to change the rules on the Amazon while attention is on the pandemic. In China, the buzzword is “new infrastructure” but early indications are that new government spending on projects such as rail and telecoms is still overshadowed by building of coal power plants. Policy documents released last week suggest that Australia’s meagre patchwork of emissions measures is now to be amended a little, but carbon pricing remains unmentionable. Thankfully renewable energy is now by far the cheapest way to produce electricity from any newly built plants. We’ve seen a huge boom in solar and wind and power. Even the government’s new discussion paper towards its technology roadmap acknowledges that the future is renewables rather than coal, though it also gives a nod to gas. But the recession could thwart investor appetite in new electricity generation plants. In the east coast electricity market, average wholesale prices are now less than half of what they were a year ago – as a result of lower gas prices, more renewables on the grid, and lower electricity demand. While that is great news for consumers including energy-intensive industry, it dampens the case for new renewables investment. It also puts extra pressure on old coal-fired power plants. Regardless of the dynamics in the electricity market, it is a sure bet in Australia to rapidly expand solar and wind power, new transmission lines and energy storage. It is what will replace the coal power fleet, power electric cars, and provide the foundation for the energy-intensive export industries of the future. Governments should now step up and accelerate renewables investment. Large renewable energy zones have been mapped out, and New South Wales already has a plan to deliver three of them. The coming recession is the best possible reason to step up the pace. Renewable energy projects can be built quickly and they can be scaled up over time. Governments can fund and own renewables generators, or provide long-term fixed-price contracts to companies that build and operate them. And we urgently need new power lines. The usual way would be a lengthy process to plan, contract and build transmission lines and for private companies to build wind and solar projects. With the recovery stimulus imperative, governments can and should make it happen more quickly. In parallel, governments need to be ready to support the regions where coal-fired plants will inevitably close down. It will not do to wait until the next power plants in the Hunter and Latrobe valley announce closures on commercial grounds. Building alternative infrastructure and supporting new areas of business should start right now. The fundamental criteria for economic stimulus that stands the test of time are simple: projects need to be able to start soon, use a lot of local inputs, result in something useful for the long run, and be compatible with a net-zero emissions trajectory. Expanding renewable energy and the power grid scores high on those criteria. Many other infrastructure projects are attractive, including public transport, retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency, and land restoration. And we have the chance to lay the foundation for clean export industries of the future, such as renewables-based hydrogen and steel. The obvious way to get started on these is a large public investment program in R&D and pilot plants. The government’s technology roadmap can identify priority investments. This should then quickly be followed by cash. Governments will take out big loans to get the economy out of the Covid recession. We must be sure to spend it in a way that benefits our society in the future. That means creating better social fabric, more education and infrastructure. And it means helping build up industries that have a strong prospect in a world economy that acts on climate change. Today’s younger people will be paying the debt back through higher taxes. They should be able to look back at Covid-19 as a time when useful public investments were made that helped protect their future. • Frank Jotzo is the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University"

"**Pubs and restaurants in some parts of England are being allowed to re-open, but with tougher rules.**
Different restrictions are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
There are also special rules over the Christmas period.
Despite the arrangements for meeting others over the festive period, you will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues.
You can meet other people outside your Christmas bubble, but only in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying.
The rules vary across the three tiers from Wednesday. The tiers are reviewed every 14 days.
In tier two areas - where about 60% of England's population lives - hospitality venues can only serve alcohol alongside a ""substantial meal"".
Venues will only offer table service, and diners could also be asked to leave once they have finished eating, No 10 has confirmed.
Environment Secretary George Eustice told LBC Radio that Scotch eggs would constitute such a meal, while legislation says it should be at least the main course of a breakfast, midday or evening meal, served at a table.
Up to six people from different households can sit together outside in a pub garden.
Businesses in all tiers are legally required to take customers' contact details, so they can be traced if there is an outbreak. Businesses can be fined up to Â£10,000 for failing to do this, for taking reservations of more than six, or not enforcing social distancing.
Staff in hospitality venues must wear masks, as must customers when not seated at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing one, or breaking the ''rule of six'' is Â£200 for a first offence.
Wedding receptions and wakes - where drinks and food are often served - will be permitted in tiers one and two.
People will be able to have 15 guests for weddings, civil partnerships, wedding receptions and wakes, as well as 30 guests for funerals in all tiers. But wedding receptions will not be permitted in tier three.
Northern Ireland is in a two-week circuit-break lockdown, which started on Friday 27 November.
Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops are shut, except for takeaways and deliveries, which must stop by 23:00.
Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes are open, but they will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday.
Under new restrictions, hospitality venues will also have to close their doors to customers by 18:00.
Businesses will, however, still be allowed to provide a takeaway service after 18:00 for food or non-alcoholic drinks.
If they have an off-licence, they can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The rule allowing a maximum of four people from four different households to meet in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. That does not include children under the age of 11.
Entry to premises is controlled and you will probably be required to pre-book with details of all group members.
Customers must wear face coverings, except when seated to eat or drink.
Businesses are legally required to take customers' contact details. They can be fined up to Â£10,000 if they do not do this, or if they take reservations of more than four, or do not enforce social distancing.
Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.
Restaurants, pubs and bars can open in regions that are placed in level zero, level one, level two or level three.
In **level zero** , up to eight people from three households can meet indoors, while in **level one** , a maximum of six people from two households can meet indoors.
In **level two** , pubs, bars and restaurants are permitted to sell alcoholic drinks only if they come with substantial meals.
This is allowed only until 20:00 indoors, and outdoors until 22:30.
In **level three** , alcohol sales are not permitted either indoors or outdoors. Cafes, pubs and restaurants are permitted to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks until 18:00.
And in **level four** , all hospitality venues must close.
Table service and the wearing of face coverings when not seated by all customers is mandatory in all hospitality venues.
UK pub and hospitality bodies have published guidance for bars and restaurants on how to operate contact tracing."

 **Introduction** 1  
Too many U.S. policymakers, from Capitol Hill to the various executive branch agencies in Washington, tend to focus on foreign policies and foreign barriers when considering how best to improve the competitive prospects for U.S. firms. The presumption is that the major impediments to the success of U.S. firms are foreign born. Closed foreign markets, complex laws and regulations, overt flaunting of the trade rules, subtle protectionism, and unfair trade are the primary culprits that subvert the success of U.S. firms, discourage investment and hiring, and encourage offshoring of production. Indeed, that is the premise of today’s hearing, as inferred from its description on the Committee’s website.



But that premise is myopic and, frankly, irresponsible. It reinforces arguments for nonsensical policies, such as preserving our own barriers to trade and investment, which are nothing more than costs to U.S. businesses and families. Policies that raise the cost of doing business in the United States — such as our tariff regime and the trade remedies duties that the U.S. government imposes on broad swaths of industrial inputs — encourage manufacturers to at least consider moving operations abroad, where those materials are available at better prices.



Governments are competing for business investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions. This global competition in policy is a positive development. But we are kidding ourselves if we think that the United States is somehow immune from this dynamic and does not have to compete and earn its share with good policies. The decisions made now with respect to our policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.



 **Policymakers and Media Mislead the Public about Trade and its Benefits**  
We live in a globalized economy where more and more U.S. jobs depend upon transnational collaboration — through integrated supply chains and cross‐​border investment. Most Americans enjoy the fruits of international trade and globalization every day: driving to work in vehicles containing at least some foreign content; communicating, shopping, navigating, and recreating on foreign‐​assembled smart phones; having higher disposable incomes because retailers like Wal‐​Mart, Best Buy, and Home Depot are able to pass on cost savings made possible by their own access to thousands of foreign producers; earning paychecks on account of their companies’ growing sales to customers abroad; and enjoying salaries and benefits provided by employers that happens to be foreign‐​owned companies. Nearly 6 million Americans work for foreign subsidiaries in the United States.



Still, too many Americans are of the view that exports are good, imports are bad, the trade account is the scoreboard, the trade deficit means the United States is losing at trade, and it is losing because our trade partners cheat. Many point to the trade deficit as the obvious explanation for the much exaggerated death of U.S. manufacturing. According to polling data, Americans are generally skeptical about trade and its impact on jobs, manufacturing, and the U.S. economy. And come to think of it: why shouldn’t they be? After all, the public is barraged routinely with misleading or simplistic coverage of trade issues by a media that is too often heavy on cliché, innuendo, and regurgitated conventional wisdom, and lacking in analytical substance or balance. And demagogic politicians only fan the flames of misconception and misgiving.



The Obama administration has not been particularly helpful about correcting these misperceptions. In fact, the president is prone to using these scoreboard metaphors to describe trade, exhorting U.S. exporters to “win the future” or to secure foreign market share before other countries’ firms get there or to beat the Chinese in developing this technology or that. This encouragement, with its incessant emphasis on exports as the benefits of trade and imports as its incidental costs, only reinforces the misconception that trade is a zero‐​sum game with distinct winners and losers. But trade does not lend itself to scoreboard metaphors because both parties to a trade are made better off. There are no losers, else the transaction wouldn’t occur.



 **Policy Myopia**  
The centerpiece of the administration’s almost indiscernible trade policy is the National Export Initiative, with its goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years (to $3.12 trillion by the end of 2014). That would be fine, except that nowhere in the administration’s 68‐​page plan to double exports is the word “import” mentioned, except with respect to the section that speaks about strengthening the trade remedies laws to better discipline “unfair” imports. Some of the components of the NEI — such as streamlining U.S. export control procedures and concluding and signing trade agreements — are laudable ideas. But the plan is simply not good enough.



As currently executed, the NEI systemically neglects a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export‐​oriented activities of exporters. It presumes that U.S. exporters are born as exporters. But they are not. Before those companies are exporters, they are producers. And as producers, they are subject to a host of domestic laws, regulations, taxes, and other policies that handicap them in their competition for sales in the U.S. market and abroad.



According to a World Economic Forum survey of 13,000 business executives worldwide, there are 52 countries with less burdensome government regulations than those of the United States. Those regulations impose additional costs on U.S. businesses that sell domestically and abroad. As put by Andrew Liveris, chairman and CEO of the Dow Chemical Company, “How we operate within our own borders, what we require of business here, often puts us at a competitive disadvantage internationally.” By neglecting these domestic impediments, the administration pretends that the obstacles to U.S. competitiveness and export success are all foreign‐​born.



The policy reform focus must be broadened to include consideration of the full range of home grown policies — such as taxes, regulations, tariff policy, and contingent protectionism — that affect U.S. producers and put them at a disadvantage vis‐​á‐​vis foreign competitors.



As producers first, most U.S. exporters are consumers of capital equipment, raw materials, and other industrial inputs and components. Many of the inputs consumed by U.S. producers in their operations are imported or the costs of the inputs are affected by the availability and prices of imports. Indeed, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for more than 55 percent of the value of all U.S. imports last year — and 57 percent through the first half of 2011. That fact alone indicates that imports are crucial determinants of the profitability of U.S. producers and their capacity to compete at home and abroad. Yet the NEI commits not a single word to the task of eliminating or reducing the burdens of government policies that inflate import prices and production costs.



The president exhorts U.S. exporters to “win” a global race, yet he ignores the fact that the government’s hodgepodge of rules and regulations has tied their shoes together.



If the administration were serious about helping U.S. companies become more competitive and making the NEI a long‐​lasting institution committed to U.S. international competitiveness, it would compile an exhaustive list of laws, regulations, policies, and practices that are undermining the stated objectives of increased competitiveness, economic growth, investment, and job creation through expanded trade opportunities.



Near the top of that list would be America’s self‐​flagellating treatment of imported intermediate goods and other industrial inputs required by U.S. producers to make their final products. Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol collected $32 billion in duties on $2 trillion of imports, over $1 trillion of which were ingredients for U.S. production — such as chemicals, minerals and machine parts. Normal tariffs and special trade remedies duties (i.e., antidumping and countervailing duties) added roughly $15–20 billion to the overall price tag, which would have been even higher had companies not been compelled to shutter domestic operations and, in some cases, relocate abroad on account of the higher input costs.



President Obama understands this dynamic. Last year, when signing into law the Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 (a bill to temporarily reduce or eliminate duties on certain imported raw materials) the president said:



The Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 will create jobs, help American companies compete, and strengthen manufacturing as a key driver of our economic recovery. And here’s how it works. To make their products, manufacturers — some of whom are represented here today — often have to import certain materials from other countries and pay tariffs on those materials. This legislation will reduce or eliminate some of those tariffs, which will significantly lower costs for American companies across the manufacturing landscape — from cars to chemicals; medical devices to sporting goods. And that will boost output, support good jobs here at home, and lower prices for American consumers.



Yet, the president’s National Export Initiative contains provisions to “strengthen” the antidumping law, which will further frustrate domestic producers’ access to imported inputs. 



**Antidumping Reform Would Encourage Domestic Investment and Hiring**  
The U.S. antidumping law still enjoys support in Congress and within pockets of the executive branch. Although some of that support can be chalked up to politicians representing the narrow interests of influential constituencies that have mastered the use of the antidumping and its highly misleading rhetoric, much more support stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose, history, mechanics, and consequences of the law.



Too many policymakers passively accept the anachronistic rationalizations proffered by the steel industry, labor unions, other big antidumping users, and their hired guns in Washington. Too many buy into the idealized imagery of a patriotic, upstanding American producer working tirelessly to ensure the preservation of well‐​paying jobs for hard‐​working Americans, but is suffering the ravages of unscrupulous, predatory foreign traders intent on destroying U.S. firms and monopolizing the U.S. market.



What politician could oppose a law presumed to protect that kind of a company against that kind of a scourge? But that is really a caricature, a myth. When the curtain is peeled back to expose the operation of the antidumping law, one can see a very different reality. Antidumping measures always raise the costs of firms in downstream industries that rely on the affected imports, and always claim domestic firms as victims. The law is often used as a tool by domestic firms waging battle for supremacy over other domestic firms, completely defying the foundational “us vs. them” premise upon which the AD status quo has come to rest. Sometimes foreign‐​owned firms are the petitioners and U.S-owned firms are the respondents. Rarely do antidumping restrictions lead to job creation or job restoration in the domestic industry, which is the most common claim of those seeking protection. And never is the allegation of “unfair trade” substantiated, or even investigated. Myth and misinformation explains the persistence of the U.S. antidumping regime.



In recent years, as U.S. producers of hot‐​rolled steel, saccharin, polyvinyl alcohol, nonmalleable cast iron pipe fittings, and silicon metal were “winning antidumping relief” from import competition and being liberated to raise prices, their U.S. customers — producers of appliances, auto parts, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, buildings, and solar panel components — were bracing for disruptions to their supply chains and inevitable increases in their costs of production.



In the period from January 2000 through December 2009, the U.S. government initiated 304 antidumping cases. Of those 304 initiations, final antidumping measures were imposed in 164 cases. Intermediate goods — inputs consumed by U.S. producers in the process of adding value to make their own downstream products — accounted for 130, or 79.3 percent of the decade’s antidumping orders. Yet, in none of those cases were firms in downstream consuming industries given a seat at the table. Under the statute, the authorities are required to ignore any potential impact of AD measures on downstream industries — and on the economy at large.



The 130 antidumping measures on intermediate goods can be broken out further to distinguish the 99 cases involving inputs used by manufacturers of goods and the 31 cases involving inputs used by non–goods-manufacturing producers, such as construction firms, utilities, and mining and drilling operations. Both sets of import‐​consuming producers suffer the costs and consequences of antidumping restrictions. Both pass some of those costs down the supply chain to the next level of consuming firms or end users in the form of higher energy costs, higher food prices, higher apartment and office lease rates, and higher input prices.



But the industries that rely on the inputs in the 99 manufacturing cases are those that are most likely to export. It is the companies in those industries which the president exhorts to “win the future.” It is those firms who are competitively disadvantaged at home and abroad on account of the wayward U.S. antidumping regime.



What is most striking about these cases is the asymmetry between the size and economic importance of the petitioning industry and the adversely affected downstream industries. For 35 of the 99 AD orders imposed on manufacturing inputs, the entire petitioning industry consisted of just one firm. Yet the ensuing trade restrictions affected dozens or hundreds of downstream firms in numerous industries. For example, in 2005, on behalf of a single producer, the U.S. government imposed antidumping measures on imports of a widely used industrial ingredient called purified carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) from Finland, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Sweden. CMC is an input for production processes in 17 downstream industries (according to USITC descriptions). Those combined industries accounted for $172 billion of exports and 2.6 million employees in 2010. In stark contrast, U.S. exports of CMC in 2010 amounted to only $35 million. Yet the tail wags the dog.



In 2003, on behalf of a sole domestic producer, antidumping duties were imposed on imports of the artificial sweetener saccharin from China. Saccharin has widespread uses in the production of various food and beverage products, pharmaceuticals and medicines, as well as cleaning compounds. U.S. producers in these downstream industries accounted for $249 billion in U.S. exports in 2010 and employed 1.9 million workers. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of saccharin in 2010 came to slightly more than $7 million.



The fact that a single U.S. producer of a crucial manufacturing input can prevail in its efforts to limit its customers’ access to alternative sources of supply should raise some eyebrows among policymakers. The fact that it is routinely the case that the antidumping law affords suppliers the ability to assert market power over their customers without any consideration of the economic consequences should be a wake‐​up call for those who fancy themselves stewards of sensible economic policy.



 **U.S. Foreign Trade Zones Encourage U.S. Production — Stop Undermining Their Appeal**  
Under the U.S. Foreign Trade Zones program, some of the costs inflicted on downstream, import‐​consuming firms can be mitigated. (Of course, the program wouldn’t be necessary if U.S. duties were recognized as just another cost of production and set, optimally, at zero.) Among the aims of the FTZ program is to encourage manufacturing activity in the United States (and to discourage manufacturers from shuttering domestic operations and moving offshore as a result of the burden of paying U.S. customs duties).



FTZs are usually manufacturing plants or facilities physically located within the United States, but considered outside U.S. territory for the purpose of customs duty payment. Goods that enter FTZs are not subject to customs duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties) until they leave the zone and are formally entered into the commerce of the United States. If those goods are used as inputs to a further manufacturing process, the rate of duty applicable to the final product is assessed. If the goods are exported from a FTZ, with or without further processing, no duties are imposed because the product never officially “entered” the United States.



With respect to products made from materials and components subject to AD or CVD duties, the standing regulations require FTZ operators to get advance approval from the Foreign Trade Zones Board if the intention is to sell those final products in the United States. That requirement _does not apply_ when the final product is going to be exported from the FTZ, which provides some incentive to downstream U.S. firms to keep production in the United States by operating as a FTZ.



But now the Obama administration — at the behest of the antidumping petitioners’ bar and organized labor, and despite its own exhortations to U.S. companies to double exports, invest in America, and put Americans back to work — is proposing to seal off that channel of sanity and compromise. New regulations would require advance approval even if the final product was going to be exported.



The requirement of advance approval from the FTZ Board, which is administered within the Import Administration — the same agency at the Commerce Department that simultaneously assists protection‐​seekers in crafting their AD/CVD petitions, while gleefully implementing and administratively adjudicating the antidumping and countervailing duty laws — will tip the balance in favor of outsourcing production for many firms in many industries. Any benefits of continuing to produce in the United States will be diminish next to the rising costs and uncertainty of doing so.



Thus, companies like Dow Corning, which uses silicon metal to produce silicone components for solar panels, will have that much more incentive to shutter operations in Kentucky and set up shop in Canada or elsewhere, where silicon metal is available at lower world market prices, so that it can compete in foreign solar panel markets with Chinese, Japanese, Canadian, and European rivals.



Asking American firms to invest and hire, while simultaneously pushing policies to raise the cost of those activities, reflects either profound cynicism or incompetence.



 **Conclusion**  
At a time of growing concern over the competitiveness of U.S. firms, when even this administration claims to be looking for ways to streamline regulations and reduce other burdens on businesses so that they will invest and hire, it is hard to believe that reform of the U.S. tariff schedule, with its $20 billion burden on U.S. producers has been ignored. It is utterly absurd that antidumping reform has not only been overlooked, but that Commerce has proposed to strengthen the law as part of the NEI. Likewise, it makes no economic sense to subvert the purpose of the U.S. foreign trade zones program, which is intended to encourage domestic economic activity and to dissuade offshoring of production.



The fact is that antidumping measures, as well our normal MFN tariffs, represent a huge drag on the competitiveness of downstream, value‐​added U.S. producers and a subsidy to foreign downstream, valued‐​added producers. None other than U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk made that point in the U.S. WTO case against Chinese raw material export restrictions earlier this year. He said:



China maintains a number of measures that restrain exports of raw material inputs for which it is the top, or near top, world producer. These measures skew the playing field against the United States and other countries by creating substantial competitive benefits for downstream Chinese producers that use the inputs in the production and export of numerous processed steel, aluminum and chemical products and a wide range of further processed products.  
  
These raw material inputs are used to make many processed products in a number of primary manufacturing industries…These products , in turn become essential components in even more numerous downstream products.



How can President Obama be serious about improving U.S. competitiveness when his Commerce Department is seeking to strengthen antidumping rules and the Foreign Trade Zones Board is moving to foreclose, or at least complicate, zone activities that use inputs subject to AD/CVD to make final products that are exported? How can we allow the president to throw nearly $100 billion in subsidies to solar, windmill, and lithium ion battery technology, while his policies make it more difficult to secure the necessary ingredients to produce and compete in those industries?



Let me conclude with an observation from the astute, mid‐​19th century French economics writer Frederic Bastiat. In 1850, he wrote:



Between Paris and Brussels obstacles of many kinds exist. First of all, there is distance, which entails loss of time, and we must either submit to this ourselves, or pay another to submit to it. Then come rivers, marshes, accidents, bad roads, which are so many difficulties to be surmounted. We succeed in building bridges, in forming roads, and making them smoother by pavements, iron rails, etc. But all this is costly, and the commodity must be made to bear the cost. Then there are robbers who infest the roads, and a body of police must be kept up, etc.  
  
Now, among these obstacles there is one which we have ourselves set up, and at no little cost, too, between Brussels and Paris. There are men who lie in ambuscade along the frontier, armed to the teeth, and whose business it is to throw difficulties in the way of transporting merchandise from one country to the other. They are called Customhouse officers, and they act in precisely the same way as ruts and bad roads.



With no intended disrespect to CBP officers or employees — it’s only a personification of bad policy — this is what we have done. We have overcome the physical barriers — the bad roads, the swamps, the oceans, and shallow harbors — only to erect our own barriers. In a perfect world there would be no duties at all. The costs of imports, including duties, are production costs for firms and living expenses for families. Policies that portend to improve prospects for U.S.-based production and U.S. families should aim to reduce those costs, not increase them.

"The dust storms that devastated the US prairie during the Great Depression were the worst ecological disaster in American history. They were also, partly, manmade. Decades of farming in the Great Plains had rid the topsoil of its native grass, leaving nothing to prevent fields crumbling to dust when drought struck in 1931. Across the Dust Bowl in midwest America, millions of acres of farmland were swept away in brown blizzards. Forced off the land, hungry families headed west in search of new jobs and lives. The dust blew so far east that it settled on the White House lawn. Almost 90 years ago the US president’s response was not to lie about the scale of disaster or blame others. Instead, Franklin D Roosevelt launched one of his New Deal’s signature relief programmes: the Civilian Conservation Corps. Its mission was to put unemployed Americans to work. More than 3 million people planted 3bn trees, built shelter belts across the Great Plains to reduce the risk of dust storms, and created 700 state parks. FDR’s legacy survives, but his policy is venerated more in name than in deed.  That needs to change. The world faces mass unemployment caused by the Covid crisis and a climate emergency which could spell the end of humanity. But there is no sign in the UK of the effort required to combine our need for jobs with the pursuit of alternatives to fossil fuels and a concomitant reduction in greenhouse gases. The coronavirus pandemic and the environmental crisis share the same roots: humans’ success as a species in arrogating global resources for themselves and the consequent ecological disturbance. This is increasing viral exchanges – first from animal to human, then from human to human – on a pandemic scale. Our environmental footprint is too large for the planet, leading to accelerated species extinctions and atmospheric chaos. Both the Covid and climate catastrophes are not misfortunes that befell us. They are part of a pattern of decisions that we humans are taking. We need to make different choices. Parts of the Conservative party are keenly attuned to the political salience of greenery. This week the environment minister Zac Goldsmith put his name to a letter calling for a “global shift towards more sustainable forms of agriculture and land use [which] would provide a strong opportunity for job creation”. These are fine words. But we must judge the government on its actions. There’s no sign that cabinet ministers are pushing to transition to a cleaner world with a Green New Deal or seeking to emulate FDR in putting the jobless to work in conservation. We ought to be importing production techniques that emit fewer greenhouse gases and strengthen food security. Instead we are opening up to foreign businesses that may do the opposite. Liz Truss, the trade secretary, appears to want to agree a deal with Washington that could see the UK accepting imports of climate-unfriendly US factory farming that it previously rejected, or letting American-made cars that emit higher levels of CO2 on to Britain’s streets. Trade deals that privilege industrial competitiveness without taking into account the cost of carbon provide a strong incentive for Britain to offshore greenhouse gas emissions to meet its net-zero target. The absence of politically powerful interests outside of business pushing for global cooperation over health or the environment is a concern. The threat of a boycott by British supermarkets helped derail a Brazilian law that could enable the faster destruction of the Amazon rainforest, a planetary rampart against the rise of future zoonotic diseases. But MPs sit powerless to vote on such matters. Under government plans the Commons won’t have oversight of, or votes on, trade deals. Instead, after the Brexit transition ends, ministers gain unchecked powers over trade. The size, speed and scale of action provoked by the Covid-19 outbreak show what is possible if governments can set aside short-term thinking. Ministers must adopt the same approach to the climate emergency. They should drop beggar-thy-neighbour policies and back meaningful ways to enforce rules for global green goods – or else the government will be pushing a form of globalisation that diminishes the chances of human survival."
"Britain’s most powerful business leaders have called on Boris Johnson to set out economic recovery plans that align with the UK’s climate goals to help rebuild a resilient UK economy in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Almost 200 chief executives – from companies including HSBC, National Grid, and Heathrow airport – signed a letter to the prime minister calling on the government to “deliver a clean, just recovery”. The letter calls for a recovery that “creates quality employment” and helps to build “a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient UK economy for the future”. It was also signed by the heads of Aviva, Lloyds Banking Group and BP’s UK business. The letter emerged days after MPs called on the government to deliver £30bn in green aid to help to accelerate “faster, further, fairer” action to help tackle the climate crisis and the economic consequences of the coronavirus lockdown. “The current crisis, in moving us all away from business as usual, has already created shifts in how we operate, and we believe we must use the recovery to accelerate the transition to net zero,” it said. “Efforts to rescue and repair the economy in response to the current crisis can and should be aligned with the UK’s legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.” The letter is the latest in a growing chorus of voices calling for the government to focus on sustainable investments. It set out three key measures. First, the government should include a combination of targeted public investment and clear policy signals to support growing private sector investment in low-carbon technologies. These might include tax incentives or a penalty price on carbon emissions. Second, the government should prioritise sectors within the economy that can stimulate jobs, spur the economy and help lower the UK’s emissions. These include construction, renovation and energy efficiency, and low-carbon electricity and electric vehicle infrastructure. Finally, the letter calls for the government to set out stimulus packages that include measures to ensure that the businesses which receive government support align their business strategies with the government’s own climate goals. The UK became one of the first major economies to set a target to become carbon neutral by 2050 through legislation that demands that emissions fall to net zero within the next 30 years. The latest call comes after the the International Renewable Energy Agency found that accelerating investment in renewable energy could spur global GDP gains of almost $100tn (£80tn) between now and 2050. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that the economic fallout of the coronavirus could pose a threat to climate action unless governments use green investments to help support economic growth through the global slowdown."
"The blackcurrant harvest on my allotment is highly dependent on the weather. In 2018 the UK had a hot, dry summer and the currants were sweet and plentiful. So far 2019 has been cold and wet, and the currants are few and tart. Just like my blackcurrants, the animals and plants of the world respond to their environment – and especially the changing climate. However, what scientists have not really understood to this point is whether the responses that species are showing will help them to survive in a changing world. In a new study, published in Nature Communications, the ecologist Viktoriia Radchuk brought together a large team of collaborators (myself included) to pool what we know about two key areas of biology.  First, we were interested in how animals are responding to climate change, with a focus on changes in shape and size (“morphology”) and changes in the timing of life events (when birds lay their eggs, when dragonflies emerge from ponds and so on – known as “phenology”).  Second, we were interested in how those changes affect their success (or evolutionary “fitness”): does earlier egg laying lead to greater survival of chicks, for example. By linking the two datasets, we could infer whether the responses of species to climate change would help them to keep ahead of the change. While many different groups of animals and plants have been studied in this way, birds are one of the few groups that have been followed in the same locations over multiple years. For example, the University of Oxford has run the Wytham Woods Tit Project since 1947, studying changes in the population of great tits and blue tits using 1,000 nest boxes and a complex array of microchipped birds and feeding stations. That study has been able to track the timing of reproduction, the number of eggs laid, and the weight and size and the birds during the period of recent climate change – all vital to the aims of our project. Radchuk compiled a vast dataset covering 4,835 studies on 1,413 species, of which 71 contained all the information needed: a change in climate, a change in either the size/shape of the animal or the timing of a biological event, and a clear link between the size/shape or timing and the “fitness” of the animal (usually how many offspring they produced). Those 71 studies were almost entirely on birds, and so that became the focus of the work. The data showed that higher temperatures were shifting everything earlier in the year – birds were arriving earlier at breeding sites, beginning to breed earlier, and the young were developing earlier. Importantly, these earlier events tended to help the birds to breed more successfully. However, in a clever piece of mathematical modelling, we also show that the pace at which birds are tracking climate change is not fast enough to keep them safe in the long term. The results suggest that at least some species of bird may be able to adapt to changing climates without having to move for the time being – an important finding given that even if we set aside climate change, humans are already destroying or fragmenting many bird habitats. We also show that there is no increase in the degree of adaptation to changing climates during the studies, so the responses of birds (while helping for now) are limited in what they can achieve.  The key novelty in this work lies in bringing together a vast quantity of data that has been recorded for a large number of species sometimes over several decades. This treasure trove of data reveals just how remarkable the natural world is to be able to track a changing environment. At the same time, the fact that even that amazing flexibility is not sufficient to keep pace with ongoing climate change is yet another important piece of the argument for tackling the human contribution to climate change.

"**Debenhams is set to close all of its 124 stores after last-ditch efforts to rescue the department store chain failed.**
It looks like it is finally the end for the 242-year-old business.
It reached its position as a lynchpin of the UK retail landscape by 1950, when Debenhams became the largest department store group in the UK, with 110 stores.
And in 2006 it joined the stock market - for the third time - with a worth of Â£1.7bn - a price tag it has never topped since.
Over the last decade, it started its descent, as its profits fell and debts became unmanageable.
The chain has been placed in administration twice over the last two years, with the pandemic proving to be the final straw.
So how did things go so wrong for Debenhams?
Experts say Debenhams has fallen behind with fashion trends over the last decade, a problem familiar to other mid-market High Street retailers such as M&S.
Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData says it lacked products that differentiated it, which left it exposed when dynamic new brands, many of them operating purely online, started breaking through.
""Back in the 1990s they had Designers at Debenhams, where designers like Ted Baker or Jasper Conran would do in-house ranges for them. That was a good differentiator but they never moved on,"" she says.
""They also filled their stores with concessions that weren't anything you couldn't buy anywhere else on the High Street.""
It made it very hard to compete against newer fashion retailers such as Primark, Boohoo and Asos, which also branched into other areas that Debenhams did well, such as beauty.
Debenhams also failed to adapt quickly enough as more and more shopping moved online, says veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman.
But he caveats: ""It is no good having a good website if the product isn't right. The bigger problem was the brand became irrelevant.""
Over the years, Debenhams expanded at a rapid rate. In 2006 it announced plans to double its number of stores to 240 and was opening new shops as recently as 2017.
At the same time, shopping habits shifted and consumer spending was squeezed - firstly because of Brexit uncertainty, and then by the pandemic.
Debenhams was left with many underperforming shops which came with high costs, including rising rents, business rates, wages and maintenance.
Those liabilities got harder to cover, as revenue began to fall and the retailer booked a record Â£491.5m loss in 2018.
Sir Ian Cheshire, Debenhams' former chairman, told the BBC that its shops became a ""straitjacket"" and the retailer would have been better off with just 70.
Ms Hinton says this made turning the business around almost impossible when coronavirus hit.
And Mr Hyman says a lack of strong leadership in previous years added to the problem. ""In order to arrest the decline there was an even greater need for top talent. But those people tended to avoid Debenhams.""
As a by-product of its expansion, Debenhams also ended up shouldering unsustainable debts - something some experts blame on poor financial decisions.
Back in 2005, the retailer sold 23 shop freeholds to property investment company British Land for Â£495m and then leased them back.
This locked the chain into costly leases of up to 35 years, with average annual rent rises guaranteed at 2.5%.
The short-term cash benefit was soon outweighed by the costs, says Ms Hinton, and by March this year the business was shouldering Â£720m of debt.
In a desperate bid to restructure its finances, Debenhams was put into administration in 2019, wiping out its shareholders. It then secured a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its landlords, enabling it to cut its rent bill and embark on plans to close 50 of its 166 stores.
But the damage was already done and it was placed back in administration in April 2020.
Mr Hyman says: ""Its fate was sealed by the private equity-style of swapping assets for large amounts of debt, which might just about work in a growing economy and a growing retail market.
""Instead it left Debenhams fighting with one arm behind its back."""

Mariana Mazzucato’s _The Value of Everything_ is premised upon her previous research into debunking myths about lone entrepreneurs and startups and ignoring a key actor of “first resort” — the state. Because of this “glaring omission,” she believes that our economic theory of value creation is flawed, and this conceptual flaw is a major reason for the growing problem of wealth inequality in Western nations. Her question? Are we sure that much of what is passing for “value creation” is not just “value extraction” in disguise? She argues that this blurring of two different economic concepts is precisely what has occurred in post‐​World War II industrial economies.



According to Mazzucato, understanding the history of the “production boundary” — and specifically what lies inside this boundary and outside of it — is critical to understanding how theories of value have evolved over the last 300 years. Inside this boundary has included all productive activities generated by the wealth creators, while outside the boundary lay the rent seekers. Such rent seekers benefit due to their monopolistic behavior or because wealth from the productive side is redistributed to them (“wealth extractors”). As Mazzucato explains in the early part of her book (Chapters 1 and 2), the boundary (“production frontier”) between the “makers” and “takers” has not been fixed but has shifted due to social, political, and economic forces. These forces have influenced the development of government measures of growth of the economy. More important, Mazzucato argues that the production boundary began to blur in the latter half of the 19th century so that almost anything that could attract a price in the marketplace could successfully claim value, including financial services (but, interestingly, not government).



Chapter 3 reviews the arcane world of national income accounts. Today’s national accounts include decisions about what constitutes value by blending any goods and services priced and exchanged legally. Mazzucato’s criticism of this approach is that it now includes “politically pragmatic decisions” such as accommodating technological change in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry or new services and products offered in the overinflated financial sector. This, however, leads to a flexible production boundary that allows former nonmembers of the “wealth creators” to lobby (“rent‐​seek”) to move from the “unproductive” to the “productive” side, and their formerly value‐​extracting activities are then counted in national gross domestic product (GDP) (with few noticing this transition).



In Chapters 4, 5, and 6, Mazzucato evaluates the rapid growth in the financial services sector in the late 20th century. For example, economists viewed this sector as rather “unproductive” — simply transferring existing value — through the 1960s. Yet, by the later part of the century, it had evolved to a “productive” status. Today, in its 21st century reincarnation, the financial services sector is widely recognized as earning profits from a wide variety of services. Mazzucato, however, remains unconvinced that this transformation is inherently productive rather than the result of political expediency and the success of rent‐​seeking activities by this industry. Moreover, she questions how the expansion of financial intermediaries (the asset management industry) and the actual risks they have taken on justify the lucrative financial rewards they accrue. Her analysis finds that fund management and private equity have contributed far less to the productive economy than what the industry asserts.



Mazzucato argues that, until activities in the financial sector are accurately accounted for in national income accounts (are they rents or profits?), no serious debate on financial reform can take place. She believes that, if we can properly address this issue, society can better understand the dynamics of value destruction in the 2008-09 world financial crisis. Mazzucato also evaluates the financialization of the whole economy. She drills down on the concept of maximizing shareholder value (MSV), a short‐​term perspective that arose in the 1970s as a way to revitalize floundering corporate profits. Allegedly, following the Friedman maxim, MSV invoked the main purpose of the firm: creating value for shareholders. Mazzucato argues that MSV has been detrimental to long‐​term economic growth, rewarding shareholders (identified as the biggest risk takers) with short‐​term gains (and increasing the influence of fund managers) at the long‐​term expense of companies (who should be reinvesting in research and development and employee skills development). Alternatively, Mazzucato proposes a stakeholder management approach sharing risks and rewards among multiple company risk takers over the long term.



In Chapter 7, Mazzucato directly addresses risk taking and the process of capturing radical technological innovation. While innovation is one of the riskiest and uncertain activities in capitalism, she acknowledges such efforts often fail. Mazzucato identifies the prevailing biased view of public‐​sector risk taking as generally ignored in the technological innovation narrative, with the state seen as merely facilitating and reducing risk for private‐​sector initiatives. This narrative has resulted in ongoing policy reforms strengthening the existing intellectual property rights (IPR) system, which in turn has strengthened the power of incumbents, thereby limiting innovation and creating what Mazzucato calls “unproductive entrepreneurship.” She further argues against the false presentation of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as the most dynamic actors in modern capitalism and as wealth creators. Offering their platform technologies in the sharing economy, the tech giants claim value in their innovation, but Mazzucato argues that they are less about genuine innovation and much more to do with facilitating value extraction through rent capture.



Chapter 8 focuses on what Mazzucato calls the “underestimated” public sector. She argues that, in the same way and in the same period (the 1980s) that finance emerged as productive, the public sector shifted to an unproductive status. According to modern neoclassical economic theory, government’s role is to fix private‐​sector market failures rather than actively creating and shaping markets. This fundamentally affects how government views itself — that is, inefficient, ineffective, and careful of not being accused of crowding out innovation or of “picking winners.” Mazzucato notes that government remains unaccounted for in GDP accounting, and she suggests a societal debate of a “new and deeper understanding of public value.” Such public value, she argues, should be a product of the whole society and is a goal useful to “shape markets.” Mazzucato wants public institutions to “think big” and play a major role in the transformations to come, including the “issues of climate change, ageing populations, and the need for twenty‐​first century infrastructure and innovation.”



Chapter 9 concludes the book with the “economics of hope.” Triggered by criticisms of the modern, “dysfunctional” capitalist systems — ranging from it is too “speculative,” to it rewards “rent seekers” over “wealth creators,” to encouraging rampant growth of finance over job creation — has led to a series of proposed reforms. These reforms include focusing the financial sector on long‐​run investments, new corporate governance structures less focused on quarterly returns, taxing speculative trades more heavily, and curbing excess executive pay.



Mazzucato, however, offers her own set of policy prescriptions. First, policymakers should be “emboldened” to negotiate symbiotic public‐​private partnerships, such as in the financial services sector, where new mission‐​oriented, state investment banks can provide strategic, long‐​term finance necessary for high‐​risk investments required for the R&D for real value creation. Second, patent law should be encouraged to foster research into needed essential drugs rather than for blocking competition and innovation through the application of strong and wide patents. Mazzucato further suggests granting fewer patents upstream, allowing the tools for biopharmaceutical research to be open access for all competitors. Third, more thinking in the ICT and digital sectors is necessary concerning the appropriate tax system for companies like Uber and Airbnb, which Mazzucato argues would never have existed without publicly funded technologies such as GPS and the Internet. Fourth, public investment cannot be limited to traditional infrastructure projects and should be extended to “green transformation.” Says Mazzucato: “A green revolution will require deliberate and conscious changes in social values; a redirection of the entire economy, transforming production, distribution and consumption in all sectors.”



Crucially, it is imperative that the reader understands that Mazzucato takes issue with the modern neoclassical economics position that price is the determinant of the value of products and services. She believes that the modern price system distorts the historically traditional view of value creation where specifically identified human, physical, and intangible resources produce new goods and services, rather than by individuals who decide what is valuable to them (and signaling such “wealth‐​creating value” by paying the price for such products or services). In other words, socially constructed value results in a price, rather than price designating value. To this end, Mazzucato spends little time emphasizing individual liberty and market freedom. Instead, most of her intellectual efforts are geared to explaining institutional examples of societal collective choice.



She argues that many activities, such as many of those found in the financial services sector, simply move existing resources around without creating any new value, resulting in value extraction. Is there evidence of this in the financial services sector? Certainly, but the financial services market has been adjusting in recent years, specifically with the growth in low‐​cost asset management services (now accelerating with the emergence of fintech) capturing an increasing share of this market. Moreover, Mazzucato’s view of venture capitalists as being far from real risk takers is strangely naïve. The data show that venture capitalists are likely to invest in a successful venture once or twice among every 10 invested projects. On average, a 15 percent success rate still leaves an 85 percent failure rate — a high‐​risk endeavor in most people’s opinion.



The biopharmaceutical industry is also a target for Mazzucato. As an example of value extraction, she points to Gilead’s Harvoni, an effective treatment for hepatitis C first commercially available in 2014. According to Mazzucato, the drug’s $94,500 initial list price for a 12‐​week treatment plan had no basis in the true cost of developing and manufacturing this pharmaceutical (regardless of the astronomical commercial failure rates in this industry). Most important, says Mazzucato, given the high public subsidies in basic research for this industry, “drug prices are not falling.” In fact, competitors of Gilead had driven the drug list price for Mavyret, a comparably effective treatment, down to $26,400 for an eight‐​week treatment plan in 2017, a 72 percent decline in cost to the consumer or health insurance provider. Moreover, annual growth in U.S. retail prescription drug spending did slow in 2016 (to 1.2 percent), following two years of strong growth: 11.1 percent in 2014, and 9.2 percent in 2015. By 2018, U.S. consumers were purchasing 90 percent of their pharmaceuticals as low‐​cost, price competitive generic drugs — a major contributor to holding the line on pharmaceutical price increases.



Mazzucato’s progressive approach to “solving” the maladies of modern capitalism suffers from many of the same weaknesses exhibited in previous attempts at state central planning. For example, the R&D state investment bank concept harkens back to the good old days of industrial policy. This contrasts with presenting a more realistic, market‐​based approach to encouraging development of an industrial strategy — one where basic, nonappropriable R&D funding by government meets the constitutional needs of critical national security and economic competitiveness (including that of protecting domestic IPRs from foreign infringement and widespread industrial espionage). Moreover, her support for a “green revolution” all but dooms fossil fuels (regardless of how “clean”), as this redirection of the economy will employ the coercive power of the state regulatory apparatus imposing its transformative will on all industrial sectors. Likewise, growing national budget deficits are of little long‐​term economic concern to Mazzucato. Such public “investments,” however, need to be effectively spent by government on proper “wealth‐​creating” activities.



Mazzucato does concern herself with a lack of competition among certain industries, but surprisingly does not recognize recent competition policy scrutiny of tech giants’ alleged anti‐​competitive business practices in Europe, as well as recent antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. For example, since 2010, the European Union (EU) has launched three separate antitrust investigations into Google for violating the EU’s competition law. By encouraging greater competition (and investment in technological innovation), such policies will go a long way in creating wealth, rather than diverting company resources into (societally) unproductive rent‐​seeking lobbying activities and legal strategies in the public policy arena.



Yet, while the tech giants are painted by Mazzucato as 21st century rent seekers and wealth extractors, Ama​zon​.com in July 2019 unveiled plans to retrain a third of its U.S. workforce — or 100,000 workers — by 2025 to help its employees move into more advanced jobs or find new careers. The planned program is among the biggest corporate retraining initiatives ever announced, at a cost of roughly $7,000 per worker, or a voluntary $700 million expenditure into human resource training.



Nevertheless, while Mazzucato recognizes the importance of education to society, she spends little time on how effective public education has been in many Western societies. An assessment of this important publicly mandated “wealth‐​creating” activity (especially in the United States, which is perpetually globally ranked in the mediocre middle among Western countries in science, math, and reading comprehension in grades K-12 — and not for a lack of per pupil expenditure) would have provided a more balanced approach to understanding real long‐​term value creation for society. Yet examples of such gaps in the analysis are what ultimately defines this book and leaves the reader intellectually unfulfilled with more questions than answers.



For example, it’s an oversimplification to say that “corporate leaders are not telling the whole truth when they say that shareholders are the only risk takers and hence deserve the lion’s share of the gains from doing business.” Anyone familiar with a basic balance sheet knows that labor expenses make up the largest category of cost to a modern service business. Employee salaries and benefits are paid before shareholders receive dividends. “Investments” made by schools, public agencies, etc. are funded by these same businesses through taxes and fees. Taxes to various levels of government are paid before shareholders are compensated. Corporate investment in capital equipment and new information technology systems are a requisite for long‐​term success of firms. This helps to satisfy market analysts who are interested in the long‐​term viability of firms. Mazzucato’s accusation that companies put “financial markets and shareholders first” and “offer as little as possible to other stakeholders” reveals a lack of true understanding of how important other stakeholders are to the long‐​term success of private firms. Perhaps a better understanding of how firms actually operate in the real world would better inform Mazzucato’s insights and recommendations.

"**No changes have been made to Scotland's Covid-19 alert levels.**
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 11 areas would remain in level four, which has the harshest restrictions, until 11 December.
There had been speculation that Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire could move to level three after a rise in cases.
Ms Sturgeon said they would stay in level two for now, but the government would ""look carefully"" at the data in the next few days.
The first minister said that current measures were having a ""positive impact"" across Scotland and that the average number of daily cases was falling.
The latest figures showed that a further 754 people had tested positive for Covid-19 and 34 more deaths had been registered, taking the total under that measure to 3,759.
Ms Sturgeon said independent estimates suggested that Scotland's R number - the rate of virus reproduction - was slightly below one, and the country was ""in a position where infections are declining"".
However, she added: ""The level of the virus overall is still higher than we need it to be.""
The first minister warned that an increase in cases over winter could ""quickly intensify"" pressure on the NHS.
""Although we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidify that progress means that we need to continue to take care and err on the side of caution,"" she said.
Each council's position in the five-level system is reviewed every Tuesday.
Ms Sturgeon said restrictions would be lifted on areas in level four on 11 December, and that next week's review would be ""more substantial"".
Public health officials had recommended Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire should move up to level three, although council leaders had lobbied for them to remain in level two due to the risk of ""economic harm"" .
Ms Sturgeon said the government would ""continue to look carefully"" at both areas.
She pointed out that cases had ""increased sharply"" in the last week, rising by 68% in Aberdeen and 42% in Aberdeenshire. While they are still below the national average, the figures are higher than some level three areas.
""However, there is a need to understand more deeply the extent to which these increases are driven by specific outbreaks that are being actively managed, within for example food processing and care settings, versus a wider and more general rise in community transmission, which would obviously be a concern - especially as we go further into winter,"" said Ms Sturgeon.
She said the data would be considered in more depth over the coming days before reaching a conclusion.
An investigation has been launched into Covid cases linked to an Aberdeenshire food plant.
Ms Sturgeon had previously said she was ""hopeful"" Dumfries and Galloway could drop to level one.
She said this change could happen ""very soon"" but winter factors and the area's proximity to councils with high infection rates had to be considered.
""That is why the strong public health advice - which the Cabinet has accepted - is for it to remain in level two for now,"" she said.
South Scotland Labour MSP Colin Smyth said the decision was ""completely unacceptable"" and would have ""a devastating impact on local businesses"".
**Level four -** East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian.
**Level three** \- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, Perth & Kinross.
**Level two** \- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Borders, Dumfries & Galloway, East Lothian.
**Level one -** Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles."

It may sound like a very strange paradox, but the best thing about this government sometimes is how inept and incompetent it is. They were labelled as visionary and transformational when they came into power, full of ideas about how they would change the country after ‘nine years of neglect’. Because of their Green arm, they cancelled many of National’s roading projects, wanting instead to focus on rail, cycleways, walkways and public transport in general. It was obvious to everyone except the government that this approach was going to cause massive traffic gridlock, which is indeed what has happened. After all, the ideology does not seem to allow for the fact that, while you are building the rail and cycle systems, people still need to be able to get to work.



NZTA went along with the government’s plans, wanting to develop more rail projects and reduce the number of roading projects. They were all in favour of the government’s plan. Two years later, NZTA find themselves in what would be considered an enviable position, if it were not so common among government departments and agencies; they have money to spend on projects, but no projects to spend money on.



So NZTA, a much-maligned government agency, has decided to spend the money it has been allocated on roads after all. And this does not please Climate Change Minister James Shaw one little bit. 



What is it they say? Oh dear, how sad, never mind.



Climate Change Minister James Shaw says it’s “very annoying” money allocated for Auckland’s light rail project will probably end up being spent on roads.



The Government’s promise of light rail from the [CBD to Mt Roskill](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115885818/nzta-backs-down-from-light-rail-looks-at-spending-millions-elsewhere), expected to cost $463 million, [has been put on hold until at least 2021](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/phil-twyford-defends-rapid-transit-as-nzta-looks-to-pump-millions-into-highways.html) – the original date Labour said it would be completed. 



“It should have moved faster than it was, and I think that the frustrations that our Transport Ministers have had with, you know, agencies and other factors in getting that over the line sooner is pretty evident,” Green Party co-leader Shaw told Newshub Nation on Saturday.



Well James, what can I say? You are part of this government. If the progress of the projects has been too slow, unfortunately, there is no one else to blame. You and your hapless government needed to make sure that all funding, consents, plans and development were fast-tracked (excuse the pun) to get the light rail system up and running as soon as possible. Sadly, much as you would like, you cannot blame National and ‘nine years of neglect’ for this.



NZTA wants nearly three-quarters of the money to now be spent on highways instead. National Party transport spokesperson Chris Bishop said it “can’t happen quickly enough”, saying the decision to allocate money to light rail has seen roading projects around the country stall. 



NZTA can reallocate funding from rapid transit to something else as long as it [doesn’t breach funding limits set out in the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/phil-twyford-defends-rapid-transit-as-nzta-looks-to-pump-millions-into-highways.html).



“Well, it is very annoying, because we think that there is a solution there,” Shaw told Newshub Nation host Simon Shepherd. 



The solution is to spend allocated funds on roading projects that have been delayed because, while everyone is waiting years or decades for the rail projects, people still have to travel to work, school, or wherever. That is what NZTA is doing, and good on them.



He said it shouldn’t dent voters’ confidence in the Government’s ability to deliver better transport solutions for the famously traffic-clogged city.



“We are going to deliver on it. And actually if you look at what we’ve done is we’ve diverted $14.5 billion over the course of the next years into light rail, heavy rail, walking, cycling, public transport and so on.



What an absolute joke. Please tell me what this government has actually done. Yes, it has built just over 200 houses in 2 years, against a promise of 1,000 in the first year and 10,000 every year after that. It has allocated $1.9 billion to mental health, but so far all it has done is to set up an office in Wellington, after 2 years. It has a ‘Cancer Action Plan’, but no drugs. It promised to solve homelessness, but now spends over $3 billion a year on housing assistance, most of which goes on motels. They have proved that they cannot deliver the things they say they will. Everyone knows it.



In the meantime, there is a small glimmer of hope for some of our much-needed roading projects. NZTA is not drinking the government Koolaid. The agency has been criticised for a number of things of late, but kudos to them for this.

"**A man who pulled plastic sheets off clothes in a supermarket during Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown has been told to compensate Tesco over his protest.**
Gwilym Owen was filmed pulling off the sheeting in Bangor on the first day of Wales' 17-day autumn lockdown.
Supermarkets had been told they were not allowed to sell ""non-essential"" items during the firebreak period.
Owen, of Holyhead Road in Gaerwen, Anglesey, pleaded guilty to damaging the sheeting and disorderly behaviour.
He was sentenced at at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court to 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay Â£200 to Tesco in compensation and Â£180 in costs.
Footage of Owen damaging the sheeting went viral after he uploaded it to Facebook.
Gilly Harradence, defending, told the court Owen had not entered the store with the intention of causing trouble.
""He just wanted to highlight the unfairness and illogicality of the regulations,"" she said.
Magistrates' chairman Alastair Langdon said Owen entered the shop to ""maliciously"" disrupt the running of the business and had used ""very nasty and abusive language"".
""You had no regard to the safety and welfare of staff or customers at the store,"" he said.
""Your actions must have been frightening and worrying to a number of people in the immediate vicinity.""
The Welsh Government banned the sale of non-essential items, such as clothes, during Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown which ran between 23 October and 9 November.
More than 60,000 people signed a Senedd/Welsh Parliament petition calling for the ban to be reversed, the largest ever submitted."
"The world may finally be waking to the reality of the climate and ecological crisis, after 30 years of inaction. But while the UK parliament has declared a climate and ecological emergency, ongoing plans for airport expansions suggest we’re flying full-speed towards crisis rather than away from it. Globally, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation are rising rapidly, and set to further escalate. Passenger numbers are rising far too fast for efficiency improvements and alternative technologies, such as electric or biofuel-powered engines, to keep up. What’s worse, the climate impact of flights is two to three times larger than their CO₂ emissions alone, due to the release of nitrogen oxides – powerful greenhouse gases – and the contrails planes leave in their wake which trap even more heat in the atmosphere. The aviation industry has also evaded fuel taxes, emissions regulations, and is often completely omitted in emissions accounting. This is particularly important as cities are setting targets to reduce their carbon emissions. While many of these cities have airports, their climate strategies tend to focus on the emissions released within the city’s boundaries and from their electricity use. They don’t account for emissions from imported goods and services that are consumed in the city but produced elsewhere, nor from flights through their airports. Any emissions from residents travelling outside the city are generally omitted.  One example is Leeds in the UK, where the city council recently declared a climate emergency and committed the city to emitting no more than 42 megatonnes of CO₂ from 2018 until 2050. But the city’s targets sit uncomfortably alongside plans to expand Leeds Bradford Airport. The expansion should more than double the number of passengers using the airport every year from 4m to 7.1m by 2030 and 9m by 2050. By 2030, the climate impact of all those flights would be double the target emissions for Leeds as a whole, and by 2045, the overshoot would escalate to almost a factor of 10. By 2050, the combined climate impact of all flights through Leeds Bradford Airport 2018 would be almost double the carbon budget for Leeds as a whole. Even if only one in five passengers are Leeds residents, their flights alone would use up 35% of the city’s entire carbon budget by 2050. As aviation is governed mostly at a national level, Leeds City Council may argue it has little control over the expansion, but is it even trying to stop it? Their Inclusive Growth Strategy suggests the opposite: endorsing the expansion and promising new transport links to the airport with a new commercial centre nearby. If the number of passengers using Leeds Bradford Airport remained at their current levels, all flights from 2018 to 2050 combined would still produce a climate impact equivalent to the entire carbon budget of Leeds. Only if passenger numbers fell drastically could flying become remotely compatible with climate targets.  If cut in half by 2022 and 75% by 2030, the flights of Leeds residents alone would use up 6% of the city’s carbon budget. This might be just low enough to squeeze all other activities in Leeds into the remaining carbon budget – if these are also radically decarbonised. Such a drastic reduction might seem difficult, but perhaps some flights are more dispensable than others. For UK residents, 70% of all flights in 2014 were claimed by just 15% of the population, and while many business leaders fly every week, more than half of the population didn’t fly at all in 2014. Given how sharply the number of flights has to decrease, the difficult question then is who gets to fly, and for what purpose. Should priority be given to someone taking their fourth flight this year to their second home in the Mediterranean, or to someone visiting their family living abroad? And how is this decided? A first step might be to increase taxes in line with the number of flights a person takes, with what’s called a frequent flyer levy.  But that’s not enough. Price mechanisms can’t make the value judgements at the heart of this – and they could just make flying exclusive to a rich elite who could still afford it. It seems more appropriate to make these decisions through democratic deliberation processes like citizens’ assemblies.

 Reducing flights will need to come with wider changes in transport systems and society. A large share of current air traffic could be made redundant by using video conferences for meetings. Improving rail transport could make for a low-carbon and affordable alternative to flying for medium-distance travel. More overnight trains with sleeping facilities and better cross-border integration of rail operators would help. Carefully developing attractive holiday locations closer to home, made accessible by electrified public transport, and promoting low-carbon activities like bike trips could also reduce demand for flights. Another major issue is car transport which accounts for the lion’s share of transport emissions and causes severe air pollution, with dramatic impacts on public health. Road accidents are a major cause of death worldwide, far exceeding deaths from malaria or war, and road networks and car parks take up lots of public space. Making transport systems sustainable means ending the dependence on car travel. This involves massively expanding reliable and affordable, low-carbon public transport within and between cities. It also means better urban planning, with more bike lanes, bike sharing and car-free zones. Suburbs should be designed so that a car isn’t necessary for getting around. And a drastically reduced car fleet could be bound to fuel efficiency standards before eventually becoming fully electric. Deep and rapid changes to the world’s transport systems are needed to halt climate change, and many of these would also improve human well-being and public life. But to get there involves challenging powerful vested interests in aviation and the car and oil industries. The challenges are vast, but doing nothing means accepting an unacceptable future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJosef Kowatsch of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has issued a press release informing that there’s been no increasing temperature in Germany in 17 years!

Even though CO2 concentrations are increasing, annual mean temperature in Germany is cooling. Originally a warming of 0.4°C per decade was announced. Instead a cooling of more than 0.2°C per decade has actually been observed! Chart by J. Kowatsch, data from the German Weather Service (DWD).
Especially in Germany over the last 20 years people have been told to fear ever more threatening dangers from increasing climate change. Self-proclaimed “climate experts” from reinsurers and high-paid climate scientists have been falling all over each other in delivering bad news year after year. Cities and communities are instructed to fight the already started and supposedly worsening climate warming, otherwise there’s the threat of a climate collapse showing up in the near future. “Fight climate change!“ is the motto that is now being used – as if the entire country were on a war footing. The enemy: man-made CO2.
But the reality is very different. Even though December 2013 has been mild, the annual temperature for 2013 is only 8.7°C , the second coldest in 17 years.  In nature, using temperature, the religiously repeated belief of a strongly warming greenhouse effect as a consequence of man-made CO2 is nowhere in sight.
The fact is: CO2 values are rising, but temperatures in Germany have been falling 16 years and the trend has been down for 17.

At NASA’s Climate 365, there is an interesting story posted with this statement and a graph:
Some say scientists can’t agree on Earth’s temperature changes
Each year, four international science institutions compile temperature data from thousands of stations around the world and make independent judgments about whether the year was warmer or cooler than average. “The official records vary slightly because of subtle differences in the way we analyze the data,” said Reto Ruedy, climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But they also agree extraordinarily well.”
All four records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades. All show the last decade has been the warmest on record.
In sync? Weellll, not quite. Japan apparently hasn’t ‘got their mind right‘ yet as the graph shows:

Here is where it gets interesting. Note the purple line after the year 2000.

The Japanese data line in purple is about .25 degree cooler than the NASA, NOAA, and Met Office data sets after the year 2000. That has partially to do with anomaly baselines chosen by the different agencies, as these two comparison graphs shown below illustrate:

Source: http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/news/press_20120202.pdf

NASA GISS uses a 1951-1980 average for the anomaly baseline, Japan’s Meteorological agency uses a 1981-2010 baseline, and that explains the offset difference between 0.48 and ~ 0.23 C, however, it doesn’t explain the divergence when all of the data is plotted together using the same anomaly 1951-1980 baseline as NASA did, which is explained in more detail at the link provided in the NASA 365 post to NASA’s Earth Observatory study here:
Source: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=80167
In that EO story they explain:
The map at the top depicts temperature anomalies, or changes, by region in 2012; it does not show absolute temperature. Reds and blues show how much warmer or cooler each area was in 2012 compared to an averaged base period from 1951–1980. For more explanation of how the analysis works, read World of Change: Global Temperatures.
The justification for using the outdated 1951-1980 baseline is humorous, bold mine:
The data set begins in 1880 because observations did not have sufficient global coverage prior to that time. The period of 1951-1980 was chosen largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define “normal” or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. It is also a period when many of today’s adults grew up, so it is a common reference that many people can remember.
So, the choice seems to be more about feeling than hard science, kind of like the time when Jim Hansen and his sponsor Senator Tim Wirth turned off the air conditioning in the Senate hearing room in June 1988 (to make it feel hotter) when they first tried to sell the global warming issue:

But, back to the issue at hand. The baseline difference doesn’t explain the divergence.
Perhaps it has to do with all of the adjustments NOAA and GISS make, perhaps it is a difference in methodology in computing the global surface average and then the anomaly post 2000. Perhaps it has to do with sea surface temperature, which Japan’s Met agency is very big on, but does differently. A hint comes in this process explanation seen here:
http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/explanation.html
Global Average Surface Temperature Anomalies
JMA estimates global temperature anomalies using data combined not only over land but also over ocean areas. The land part of the combined data for the period before 2000 consists of GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) information provided by NCDC (the U.S.A.’s National Climatic Data Center), while that for the period after 2001 consists of CLIMAT messages archived at JMA. The oceanic part of the combined data consists of JMA’s own long-term sea surface temperature analysis data, known as COBE-SST (see the articles in TCC News No.1 and this report).
The procedure for estimating the global mean temperature anomaly is outlined below.
1) An average is obtained for monthly-mean temperature anomalies against the 1971-2000 baseline over land in each 5° x 5° grid box worldwide.
2) An average is obtained for monthly mean sea surface temperature anomalies against the 1971-2000 baseline in each 5° x 5° grid box worldwide in which at least one in-situ observation exists.
3) An average is obtained for the values in 1) and 2) according to the land-to-ocean ratio for each grid box.
4) Monthly mean global temperature anomaly is obtained by averaging the anomalies of all the grid boxes weighted with the area of the grid box.
5) Annual and seasonal mean global temperature anomalies are obtained by averaging monthly-mean global temperature anomalies.
6) The baseline period is adjusted to 1981-2010.
Note what I highlighted in red:
…for the period after 2001 consists of CLIMAT messages archived at JMA
That along with:
The oceanic part of the combined data consists of JMA’s own long-term sea surface temperature analysis data, known as COBE-SST
Is very telling, because it suggests that Japan is using an entirely different method for both land and sea data. For the post 2001 land data, it suggests they use the CLIMAT data as is, rather than the “value added” processing that NCDC/NOAA and NASA GISS do. The Met Office gets the NCDC/NOAA data already pre-processed with the GHCN3 algorithms. NASA GISS deconstructs the data then applies their own set of sausage factory adjustments, which is why their anomaly is often the highest of all the data sets.
Prior to 2001, Japans Met Agency uses the GHCN data, which is pre-processed and adjusted through another sausage recipe pioneered by Dr. Thomas Peterson at NCDC.
The land part of the combined data for the period before 2000 consists of GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) information provided by NCDC
A good example of the GHCN sausage is Darwin, Australia, as analysed by Willis Eschenbach:

Above: GHCN homogeneity adjustments to Darwin Airport combined record
So, it appears that Japan’s Meteorological agency is using adjusted GHCN data up to the year 2000, and from 2001 they are using the CLIMAT report data as is, without adjustments. To me, this clearly explains the divergence when you look at the NASA plot magnified and note when the divergence starts. The annotation marks in magenta are mine:

If anyone ever needed the clearest example ever of how NOAA and NASA’s post facto adjustments to the surface temperature record increase the temperature, this is it.
Now, does anyone want to bet that the activist scientists at NOAA/NCDC (Peterson) and NASA (Hansen) start lobbying Japan to change their methodology to be like theirs?
After all, the scientists in Japan “need to get their mind right” if they are going to be able to claim “scientists agree on Earth’s temperature changes”, when right now they clearly don’t.
P.S.
BTW if anyone wants to analyze the Japanese data, here is the source for it:
http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/map/download.html
It is gridded, and I don’t have software handy at the moment to work with gridded data, but some other readers might.
UPDATE: Tim Channon at Tallbloke’s has plotted the gridded data and offers a graph, see here: http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/jmas-global-surface-temperature-gridded-first-look/

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel reports that a recent storm blew the beach sand away at Cardigan Bay in Wales, uncovering something unusual: a prehistoric forest from 4500 years ago. Apparently the forest had become the victim of sea level rise back at the time.
Spiegel writes:
The trees died more than 4500 years ago. Once the forest covered an area of several miles between the Welsh locations of Borth and Ynyslas. With climatic changes the sea level rose and peat, sand, and salt water swallowed the trees. The forest disappeared.”
Imagine that. Flat-temperature-earthers would like to have us believe that climate of the Holocene was more or less constant and that sea levels are higher than ever today. Turns out in Wales sea level is lower.
Obviously things were probably even warmer back then and sea levels were indeed higher. This is confirmed by NASA here, which discusses sea level findings for Northern England and Scotland, and possible implications for the UK:

Since the end of the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago, land and sea-levels around the UK coastline have changed in response to the retreat of the ice sheets. As the ice melted, the release of this enormous weight resulted in the landmass slowly tilting back up in the north or down in the south, a process called isostatic adjustment. […]
The action of the Ice Age on our landmass has been like squeezing a sponge which eventually regains its shape. The earth’s crust has reacted over thousands of years and is continuing to react. […
]The new map shows how the UK and Ireland are responding to the ice sheet compression of the earth’s core and the current rate of land tilt across the UK. In Northumberland, researchers found sediments from 7,000 years ago five metres below, and others from 4,000 years ago at 1 metre above the present sea level. This indicates that the sea level rose above present levels from around 7,500 years ago to 4,500 years ago, and then dropped and is continuing to fall.”
But North Cumberland is much further north than Cardigan, where the ice sheets were likely much thinner, and so isostatic adjustment at Cardigan Bay should be less.
The uncovered forest remnants tell us one thing: Wales is higher today than 4500 years ago and it’s going to take long time, if ever, for Cardigan Bay to return to where it’s been before. Climate change is normal and there is nothing we can do to re-establish and preserve the climate we had 50 years ago. It’s going to change by itself.

"**Why does this feel like a government without a majority?**
It's not even a year since Boris Johnson was carried to a thumping victory on the back of months of agonising parliamentary fiasco over Brexit and up against Jeremy Corbyn.
The majority was never in that much doubt, but the scale of the victory was something the Tories had only really dreamt of.
And it should, theoretically, have given Boris Johnson the kind of comfortable cushion in the Commons that no prime minister had had since the days of Tony Blair.
It seemed in Tory circles, for a while at least, that he was ruler of all that he surveyed.
That has hardly gone according to plan.
Despite the prime minister making appeals in person to MPs tonight, although Downing Street had moved over the last few days to meet some of their unhappy MPs demands by publishing documents, and promising more votes in the near future, 55 Tory MPs banded together to give the Boris Johnson his biggest Parliamentary kicking yet - even though he was said to be glowering at them as they tramped through the 'no' lobby (those who voted in person tonight at least).
With more abstaining, the message from the backbenches to the government's front row was clear - right now, Downing Street should not feel able to rely completely on their support.
Remember, the vote did actually pass.
The most important impact of the vote is, of course, in the real world, where from just after midnight, England will be carved up into three different tiers to try to manage coronavirus.
But this is a notable political moment too.
If the opposition parties had also voted against the government, the prime minister's plan - and his central mission right now in government - would have been sunk.
He'd have been defeated, the proposals kaput.
Why then does this feel like a government that is far less stable than the numbers would imply?
First off, and most straightforwardly, many MPs who didn't back the government tonight were doing what they feel they are sent to Westminster to do - to stand up for their specific areas, rather than just blindly back their tribe.
In particular, this meant MPs from areas where Covid infections are low, but regional restrictions are to be tight, protested by voting no - a practical, rather than a philosophical objection perhaps.
Second, there has been unease for many weeks in Tory circles about the government's overall approach to the restrictions - anxiety that the economic concerns aren't being given enough weight, and that patients who don't have Covid are losing out simply too much.
On both of those fronts, of course, the coronavirus crisis is unprecedented as an administrative nightmare for every government around the world.
It hasn't happened before, so no one can be sure of the right thing to do.
Beyond that duet of reasons, however, there are other political factors at play.
Let's start with - and bear with me - Brexit.
Covid and Brexit are not directly linked. But no issue on the political planet is an island.
The government is in the final throes (honest) of the Brexit negotiation process, just as ministers are moving England to a new set of tiers.
Just as backbench hackles begin to rise about any concessions the prime minster may be prepared to make, along comes a vote where anxiety can be expressed - an opportune moment, perhaps, to remind Downing Street that those MPs who developed rebelling into an art form will not be willing to suck up any old deal.
One cabinet minister suggested there was ""a lot of nervousness around the Brexit messaging about a possible deal [and] Covid is a good outlet"", saying there was a ""remarkable"" similarity between the cast list of Covid sceptics and Eurosceptics.
Another suggested the objectors were the same old ""awkward squad"", who enjoy causing trouble.
There may, or may not, be a deal with the EU that Parliament has to approve in the next couple of weeks (at breakneck speed if things carry on at this rate with the negotiations) and it is likely at least some of those who voted against the government tonight were motivated, in part, to give No 10 a reminder they can't be taken for granted.
The objections went beyond that group, however, including some prominent former Remainers and ministers, and even some of the new 2019 intake, who ought not to carry the Brexit scars.
The second political concern some MPs were trying to express was a frustration at the government's overall competence and direction.
No one in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast could claim that handling coronavirus is easy.
But one of the rebels - even a Boris Johnson fan - told me the vote was a ""strong signal that we cannot carry on like this"", adding: ""The government must stop these lurches and engage MPs more about all aspects.""
Another senior Tory, a former minister, said ""the mood is toxic"", suggesting relations between the backbenches and Downing Street are getting worse, not better - even though this is one of the first big set pieces since the departure of Dominic Cummings that was meant to herald a ""reset"".
They added: ""The tom toms are beating. We said we would take back control, but it feels like the government has lost control.""
There are even questions on the inside about what it's trying to achieve, with one member of the government telling me tonight: ""The basic problem is that there is not a governing philosophy for this government other than Brexit.
""Without that to hold the party together, and coming into its 10th year in office, the parliamentary party is inevitably restless and grumpy.""
Worrying, perhaps, for ministers tonight too, while the PM was involved in significant lobbying of wannabe rebels to try to keep the defeat to a minimum, his Tory opponents were not trying to gather support as aggressively as they might have done.
I'm told by sources involved they did not work as hard as they could have done to ratchet up their numbers.
Rather than inflicting a heavier defeat, they wanted to make it clear that more of their colleagues would rebel next time if the policy doesn't change.
One defeat, of course, does not doom a policy, and it certainly doesn't end the hopes of a party.
One of the easiest things you hear uttered in politics is ""we can't go on like this"", and then somehow, it almost always does.
And a cabinet minister predicted today that after the worst of Covid, with vaccines on the way and the conclusion of the Brexit process (before you scream, of course there will be issues between the UK and the EU for ever, but this bit will soon be done at least), the government would be able to get on with passing laws that Tory MPs and voters wanted.
Their hope then is the 2019 majority will yet lead to a politics that is more stable, perhaps more boring (shock!), and certainly much more comfortable for the prime minister.
Politics has, however, in the last few years developed a reliable habit of surprise."
"Equity markets have generally ignored the increasing number of natural disasters over the past 50 years and tougher rules are needed to make investors aware of the dangers posed by the climate crisis, the International Monetary Fund has said. Companies should be forced to disclose their exposure to climate risk because a voluntary approach does not go far enough, the IMF said in a chapter from its latest global financial stability report (GFSR). The Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, an initiative led by Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, outlines how companies should calculate and disclose their exposure to climate risk to investors. The IMF, however, said in a GFSR published on Friday that climate risk should ultimately be made part of international reporting standards. “An increasing number of firms have begun to voluntarily disclose climate change risk information, in line with the recommendations set out by the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures” it said. “However, going further by developing global mandatory disclosures on material climate change risks would be an important step to sustain financial stability. In the short term, mandatory climate change risk disclosure could be based on globally agreed principles. In the longer term, climate change risk disclosure standards could be incorporated into financial statements compliant with international financial reporting standards.” The IMF functions as the global lender of last resort, bailing out countries in financial difficulty and issuing policy advice alongside its interventions. Its latest statement on the climate crisis expressed concerns that stock markets were ignoring the rise in global temperatures and its consequences. Although stock markets fell sharply in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, this followed their best year since 2009 and the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. A global index of share prices rose by 24%, and the FTSE 100 climbed by 12% despite uncertainty over Brexit. Last year was also marked by a series of severe weather-related events, including flooding in the US and bushfires in Australia, but the IMF said this was part of a trend for the number of disasters to increase “considerably” in the past few decades, from slightly more than 50 in the early 1980s to about 200 since 2000. It noted that Hurricane Kartrin devastated New Orleans in 2005, and Dominica suffered damage amounting to more than twice its GDP when Hurricane Maria struck in 2017. The IMF said global temperatures were currently 1.1C above their pre-industrial level and were on course to rise by a total of 3C unless stronger action was taken. “Climate change induced by this level of warming is, in turn, expected to adversely impact the world’s stock of natural assets, lead to a significant rise in sea level, and increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather event,” the IMF said. “As the frequency and severity of climatic hazards rise, the resultant socioeconomic losses could be significantly higher than in recent history.” Even so, according to the GFSR there had been little indication that investors had become more aware of the potential losses they could face if global temperatures continued to rise, with only a modest impact on stock markets, shares in banks and insurance companies from large disasters. “While projections of climatic variables and their economic impact are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, aggregate equity valuations as of 2019 do not appear to reflect the predicted changes in physical risk under various climate change scenarios”, the IMF said. “This suggests that equity investors may not be paying sufficient attention to climate change risks.” The IMF said that preventing global heating from causing a run on share prices was not the only reason to take action. “Of course, strong policy actions to mitigate climate change would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and future physical risk in the first place, conferring benefits to mankind that extend well beyond the realm of financial stability. Yet, from a financial stability perspective, this transition to a lower-carbon economy needs to be carefully managed to avoid abrupt and unanticipated repricing of portfolios and economic dislocation.”"
"In conservation, charismatic mammals and birds such as the black rhinoceros and the capercaillie get a lot of attention, while others, like invertebrates, are often ignored. One way of addressing this problem is to focus on protecting “umbrella species”. These are species whose conservation can benefit many others, especially those that rely on similar habitats. But does this work in practice? We had a unique opportunity to test the idea with one of the largest field experiments in Europe. In a region called Breckland in the East of England, we used a tractor to churn tall grassland into bare, sandy plots for Eurasian stone-curlew, a rare summer visitor. The disturbed soil provides excellent camouflage for stone-curlew nests and chicks, and Breckland holds the majority of the UK’s breeding population. Rabbits used to graze in large numbers to create this habitat for stone-curlews, but numbers have collapsed over the past 50 years due to disease, culling and predation. Without the rabbits, stone-curlew habitat shrinks – and so do the numbers of rare insect and plant species that also thrive in these bare patches of land. It’s hard getting people to care about beetles and seedlings – especially when there are so many different species. But an assessment of the region’s biodiversity predicted that managing habitats for stone-curlews could benefit many other rare and threatened plants and invertebrates with no additional effort.  That’s because these priority species need the same bare and open habitats as stone-curlews. Predatory beetles like the open territory to spot and hunt prey, whereas many colonising plants like the clear space to set down roots with little competition. A programme led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) over thirty years has endeared the stone-curlew to many local bird watchers, so people usually don’t need convincing about the value of protecting them. Because stone-curlew breeding habitat is so compatible with many other threatened species, we thought that looking after them would take care of nearly everything else. This includes species like the tiny “fingered speedwell” plant (Veronica triphyllos) and the “wormwood moonshiner” beetle (Amara fusca), both of which are endangered in the UK. Each experimental plot was the size of two football pitches and almost entirely devoid of vegetation. We sampled an incredible 30,000 insects – including 402 species of beetles, bugs and ants – by placing 1,000 small containers within the plots and within grassland that wasn’t being managed as a comparison. The habitats we created for stone-curlews had more insects, including rare priority species which were found hardly anywhere else in the country, such as the rove beetle (Philonthus lepidus). After the experiment, a bug showed up that’s never been recorded in Britain before and is only known by its scientific name, Acrocephalus languidus. We knew many rare insects and plants preferred the same kind of habitat as stone-curlews, so we weren’t too surprised with our results. But they do suggest something very useful. Finding and protecting a single umbrella species could achieve the same result as multiple projects targeted at many other species, for a fraction of the cost. This offers a shortcut for conservation. In places with many rare and threatened species – such as the chalk grassland plains of Southern England or the Caledonian pine forests of the Scottish Highlands – a catalogue of proven umbrella species could help conservationists confidently manage habitats in the knowledge that vast numbers of other species would also benefit."

President Obama and his supporters have had a turbulent relationship with Supreme Court. It reached a low point when he said that striking down his massive health care overhaul — which he said “was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress” — would be an act of illicit “judicial activism.” Though the president later backtracked, his allies continue to lament the prospect that the Supreme Court will do its job — most recently in a _Chicago Tribune_ op‐​ed penned by House Minority Nancy Pelosi this week.



The episode harkens back to a nasty chapter in legal history: the clash between the Court and President Franklin Roosevelt during the 1930s. Fortunately, today’s Americans are unlikely to welcome a repeat of that confrontation, and President Obama would be wise not to try impugning the High Court, as Roosevelt did.



FDR’s fight with the Court began after the justices struck down some of the New Deal’s largest components. It is well to remember how absurd these programs were: in _Schechter Poultry v. United States_ , for example, the justices invalidated a law that barred grocery shoppers from choosing which chicken they wanted — buyers were forced to reach into a cage and pick a random chicken, the idea being to protect farmers from having to charge less for scrawnier birds. That law — like other programs forcing farmers to destroy food to raise prices — was meant to boost farmers’ income, but it meant less food for everyone, an awful idea in the depths of a Depression, and one that overstepped constitutional boundaries. The Constitution only allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce — not to control prices at neighborhood farmer’s markets.





Everyone disagrees with Supreme Court decisions from time to time.



The justices unanimously ruled that law invalid. But Roosevelt — who said the Constitution was “superseded entirely by what has happened and been learned” since its ratification — was furious. Accusing the justices of “activism,” he proposed a bill that would “save the Constitution from the Court” by allowing him to appoint six new justices, a new majority.



Republicans and Democrats alike denounced the “Court‐​Packing Plan” as an effort to exempt the president from checks and balances. Journalists called it “revolutionary,” and a “bloodless coup.” Polls showed 60 percent of people opposed the plan, wary that neutering the Court could endanger their rights under future administrations. Congress killed the proposal, but not before it became an albatross for the Administration, and one with lasting consequences. Historian Jeff Shesol argues that Roosevelt’s “hubristic” plan “wrenched” the Democratic party in two and “helped fracture the New Deal coalition.” President Obama has even less to gain by picking a fight with the Court, since polls now show that two‐​thirds of Americans, including most Democrats, hope the Court will strike the down the individual mandate.



But in 1937, in a very different political climate, the justices gave in. They began upholding New Deal laws, expanding Congressional power under the Commerce Clause and erasing long‐​standing constitutional protections. Those precedents later proved powerful obstacles against the next generation’s efforts to secure individual freedoms. Over the following decades, the Court slowly began to protect privacy rights, religious liberty, and racial equality — but only over the objections of Roosevelt appointees who argued that New Deal precedents allowed lawmakers to override those freedoms. For instance, in 1943, when the Court ruled that states could not force Jehovah’s Witnesses to pledge allegiance to the flag, Justice Felix Frankfurter — an FDR favorite — dissented, arguing that since the 1937 cases let government dictate how people use property and what prices businesses can charge, government should also be free to control people’s religious expression. Likewise, Justice Hugo Black refused to join the Court’s 1965 ruling that the Constitution protects personal privacy, because it relied on “cases from which this Court recoiled after the 1930s, and which had been, I thought, totally discredited.” Progressives would do well to remember how hard it was for civil rights activists in the 1960s to overcome the pro‐​government precedents established by the New Deal Court.



Everyone disagrees with Supreme Court decisions from time to time. But Americans understand that majorities are not always right, and that our Court plays a crucial role in the system of checks and balances that protects the rights of minorities and individuals who lack political influence. President Obama should recall how Roosevelt’s war on the Court backfired — not only on him, but on the cause of justice in general.

The North Korean decarbonized zone. NASA photo taken by the International Space Station (ISS), acquired January 30, 2014.
Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) took the above shown night image of the Korean Peninsula.
NASA writes that the light emission from North Korean capital Pyongyang is equivalent to the smaller towns in South Korea and that differences are illustrated in per capita power consumption in the two countries, with South Korea at 10,162 kilowatt hours and North Korea at a resp0nsible 739 kilowatt hours.
It’s time for the global warming alarmists to nominate North Korea for the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, with all the worldwide conferences and jet-setting, the carbon footprint on the planet by 2007 Nobel Peace prize winners Al Gore and the IPCC, and all the delegates globally, probably exceeds that of the entire North Korean country.

"Leading health professionals, including a Nobel laureate and a former Australian of the Year, say the government must put human health “front and centre” in a new generation of environment laws in the aftermath of the Covid-19 and bushfire crises. The Nobel prize-winning immunologist Peter Doherty and the epidemiologist and former Australian of the Year Fiona Stanley are among 180 professionals who have warned the government that Australia’s “failing” environmental laws will fuel further public health crises.  In a letter to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, they’ve called on the government to use the once-in-a-decade review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act to strengthen environmental protections and acknowledge the importance of a healthy environment to human health. “We note that the EPBC Act review is occurring during a period where Australia has experienced back-to-back crises of extraordinary scale in the 2019-2020 ‘Black Summer’ bushfires and now the Covid-19 pandemic,” the letter, organised by Doctors for the Environment Australia and the Climate and Health Alliance, states. “These events highlight the fundamental interdependence between humans and the natural world and the consequences for human health when this is ignored.” The businessman Graeme Samuel is chairing the independent review and is due to hand down a draft report in June. The final report is due in October, however, the government has indicated it is prepared to introduce changes to the act before that deadline. Environmental organisations have long called for an overhaul of the act, highlighting its failure to stem Australia’s high rate of extinction. Businesses and the government have spoken of the need to cut environmental bureaucracy – so-called “green tape” – in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Others, however, have told the Morrison government Australia’s prosperity depends on eradicating greenhouse gas emissions. Stanley said the prospect of weakened environmental protections was “scary” and “the most devastating thing we could do for the health and wellbeing of our people”. “The danger of the pandemic is they’ll slip this relaxing of environmental and other laws in without us noticing. It’s unacceptable,” she said. “The people pushing for that are the people who are going to make the profits.” The letter to Ley instead calls for an “entirely new generation of environmental law” with more robust protections. As part of that, the health professionals state human health must be included in the act and public health professionals should sit on institutions responsible for administering environmental law. The letter says the catastrophic bushfire season had not only caused unprecedented ecological devastation and loss of wildlife, it had also led to loss of human life, physical injuries, respiratory problems, and displacement of people. It says the mental health effects of the disaster will be long-lasting. It says animal welfare and destruction of habitat were at the heart of the Covid-19 crisis and protection of nature was necessary to “prevent further and potentially even more deadly pandemics”. Stanley said Australian environment and climate policy was late in acknowledging the importance of human health. She said healthy ecosystems allowed children to grow up physically and mentally healthier and would reduce costs associated with health care. “Planetary health leads to our health. In the end, it leads to better economies and more cost effective ways of providing energy,” she said. “We should be talking about investment in society, investment in environment and biodiversity. It’s an investment, not a cost. The cost comes from not doing it.” Stanley said environmental and climate policy in Australia had suffered for two decades due to the denigration of science She said the fact Australia was slowly starting to ease its Covid-19 restrictions showed what was possible when scientists were listened to. “At least everybody now knows what epidemiologists are,” Stanley said. “Because they’ve listened to the science all through this pandemic, our hope is they might listen to the science with regards to the letter we’ve just sent.” A spokesman for Ley said the letter had been received and would be considered by Samuel as part of the EPBC Act review."

"Almost all scientists agree that burning fossil fuels is contributing to climate change. But agreement is less clear cut on how exactly it’s influencing rising global temperatures. The world is now 1°C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times. Is this solely down to emissions of greenhouse gasses such as CO₂? Meteorologist Hubert Lamb, regarded as the father of modern climatology, argued that CO₂ levels alone couldn’t account for all of the global warming that’s been observed. His attention turned instead to the role of thermal emissions. Burning fossil fuels doesn’t just produce greenhouse gases, it also generates a lot of heat, which leaks out to the atmosphere. Nuclear tests and volcanic eruptions are some examples of other large heat sources. Back in 2009, two scientists in Sweden argued that thermal emissions were more important than CO₂ for raising global temperatures. A few years later, two Chinese scientists suggested that heat from the earth’s interior could be contributing to rising temperatures. They argued that fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas in layers and crevices beneath the Earth’s surface act as an insulating blanket, trapping heat from the planet’s interior. As these deposits have been emptied by fossil fuel extraction, more of that heat could be reaching the surface. This idea is similar to how fat tissue under the skin prevents body heat from being lost to the surrounding air.
To investigate this theory in the Earth’s crust, we looked at the figures for global fossil fuel production alongside data for temperature changes on the land and sea surface. Our research suggests that it is possible that temperatures may be rising faster in places where fossil fuels are being extracted from the ground.   Between 2007 and 2017, 45.5 billion tonnes of oil and 36.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas were removed from the Earth’s crust. When oil and gas is extracted, the voids fill with water, which is a less effective insulator. This means more heat from the Earth’s interior can be conducted to the surface,  causing the land and the ocean to warm. We looked at warming trends in oil and gas producing regions across the world. These places, which included Saudi Arabia, the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Alaska, reported high rates of warming – between three and six times higher than the average rate worldwide. One of the fastest rates of warming has been observed in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen by 0.6°C every decade since 1978. In Antarctica, however, the increase is just 0.1°C, despite similar levels of atmospheric CO₂ in both polar regions. One reason for the difference may be that fossil fuels are extracted in the Arctic, but not in the Antarctic. From 2007, more than 400 oil and gas fields have been developed north of the Arctic circle, while in Antarctica, fossil fuel extraction is banned.  An earlier study found evidence for a similar pattern in the north east of England, where a long history of coal mining has dramatically changed the land’s subsurface. So much so that in the former coalfields around Gateshead and Newcastle, a “heat island” effect was detected below and beneath the ground. This meant the atmosphere above the conurbation was about 2°C warmer than the surrounding area, while the ground beneath Gateshead was found to be up to 4.5°C warmer.  Groundwater that discharged from a mine water pumping station was also found to be unusually warm, in part due to heating from the Earth’s interior. The researchers concluded that this effect could be expected in former coalfields across Britain.  Could higher rates of warming in these places be caused by the Earth losing its internal “heat shield”? The idea that some regions have a protective layer below the ground, stopping heat from the Earth’s interior rising to the surface, isn’t as strange as it may sound. After all, the ozone layer in Earth’s atmosphere protects against ultraviolet radiation, but it was only discovered in the 19th century. Astounding new findings about the Earth system emerge all the time.  If a similar heat-trapping shield exists in the Earth’s crust, much must be done to reinforce it. Carbon emissions that are captured from industry and energy generation could be stored in the crevices left by extracted fossil fuels, re-insulating the sub-surface and helping to slow the thermal emissions that could be amplifying global warming. Scientists have said for some time that any hope of halting catastrophic climate change rests on leaving fossil fuels in the ground. Our preliminary findings could give that warning new urgency. Underground reserves of oil have existed for far longer than humans have exploited them – we know worryingly little about the consequences of emptying them.

"DJIBOUTI  —   The 10:24 a. m. train out of Djibouti’s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month. Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers, the crush of African leaders, European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine,   carriages making their inaugural run. “It is indeed a historic moment, a pride for our nations and peoples,” said Hailemariam Desalegn, the prime minister of Ethiopia, shortly before the train  —   the first electric transnational railway in Africa  —   headed toward Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. “This line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries. ” But perhaps the biggest star of the day was China, which designed the system, supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the   line. And the $4 billion cost? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing. Having constructed one of the world’s most extensive and modern rail networks at home, China is taking its prodigious resources and expertise global.   subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston, Beijing is building a $5 billion   rail line in Indonesia, and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing. Another ambitious system in the works, the     Railway Network, would link China to Laos, Thailand and Singapore. But few places are being reshaped by China’s overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century. Despite years of steady economic growth,   Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit, according to the Africa Development Bank, with only half of its roads paved and nearly 600 million people lacking access to electricity. Chinese companies, many of them   and grappling with an economic slowdown at home, have stepped unto the breach, earning about $50 billion a year on new ports, highways and airports across the continent, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Many of the projects are part of Beijing’s new Silk Road initiative, a $1 trillion effort intended to deepen ties between China and its trading partners in the developing world. Much of that spending has been directed at rail projects that planners hope will transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another, and the rest of the world.   and   projects include a      system in the Ethiopian capital a $13 billion rail link between the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the port city of Mombasa that will open later this year and an ambitious rail modernization project in Nigeria that includes an urban transit system for Lagos. “For the longest time, railroads across Africa were limping along and in decline, but with the Chinese, that’s definitely changing,” said Andrew Grantham, the news editor at Railway Gazette International, a trade publication. China’s enthusiasm for constructing railroads, schools and stadiums in Africa stands in marked contrast to the role of the United States, which has largely shied away from financing infrastructure on the continent. One of the few exceptions, Power Africa, a $9. 7 billion initiative announced by President Barack Obama in 2013, has fallen far short of its goal of providing electricity to 20 million households within five years. When it comes to trade, China surpassed the United States in 2009 to become Africa’s biggest trading partner. It remains unclear how that calculus might change under the Trump administration. President Trump has questioned the benefits of free trade agreements, and a questionnaire from his transition team that was sent to the State Department last month expressed skepticism for foreign aid and development efforts in Africa. That worries some African officials and longtime experts, who fear the loss of American influence and largess  —   and the good will that is often produced by desperately needed infrastructure projects. Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the United States was also missing opportunities to cultivate loyal customers. “If you’re looking for new markets, Africa is the place to be,” he said. “But right now, the U. S. is not leveraging Africa’s huge potential. By contrast, the Chinese are there, and they are willing to take risks. ” China is placing more than $14 billion worth of bets here in Djibouti, a geopolitically strategic speck of a country beset by soaring poverty and unemployment. The projects include three ports, two airports and a pipeline that will bring water from Ethiopia, its landlocked neighbor and a regional economic power that depends on Djibouti’s ports for 90 percent of its foreign trade. Also on the drawing board are a series of     power plants that would ease summertime electricity failures and help fuel a new   manufacturing zone that officials hope will turn Djibouti into a Hong   entrepôt and international shipping hub. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, said he hoped the new railway linking his country to the Ethiopian capital would be just the first leg of a     route, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. “The train is already a ” he said, noting that it will cut to 12 hours what until now had been a grueling   or   trip by truck. Mr. Hadi praised the Chinese for going all in after Western banks declined to help finance the nation’s glaring infrastructure needs. “We approached the U. S. and they didn’t have the vision,” he said. “They are not thinking ahead 30 years. They only have a vision of Africa from the past, as a continent of war and famine. The Chinese have vision. ” Not everyone is comfortable with China’s vision. Some worry about the leverage China wields and what happens when countries fall behind on loan payments. For Djibouti, the debt is especially daunting, amounting to 60 percent of its gross domestic product. But Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh, the country’s finance minister, dismissed such concerns, saying Djibouti’s heady 6. 7 percent growth rate would allow it to meet its loan payments. “If we don’t take this risk now and develop our infrastructure, we will remain stuck in poverty,” he said. “Come back in a few years, and you will find that Djibouti has become the logistics hub of the continent. ” Others worry about the Djiboutian government’s lack of transparency, its authoritarian impulses and a vexing legacy of official corruption. Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a leader of Djibouti’s embattled opposition and a former presidential candidate, said the lack of information about the terms of China’s loans raised questions about potential malfeasance. “We’re talking about billions of dollars and complete opacity,” he said. “Have there been kickbacks to government officials? There is no way to know. ” Others wonder what will happen to the system after the Chinese leave. European imperialists in Africa built a skein of lines, most of which fell into disrepair in the decades after their colonies achieved independence. Jamie Monson, the author of “Africa’s Freedom Railway,” a book documenting the legacy of the   train linking Tanzania and Zambia, said   maintenance could be more challenging than initial construction. Built during the Cold War and hailed as a symbol of   friendship, the train, the Tazara Railway, has struggled to maintain regular service, prompting talk of a Chinese takeover. “Without proper maintenance comes problems, which can have a huge impact on a regional economy and local people’s livelihoods,” she said. For now, however, much of nation is euphoric over the completion of Djibouti’s first modern railway, which follows the path of a creaky   line, completed in 1917, that met its demise several years ago after generations of neglect. Although workers from China did much of the technical and engineering work, thousands of Djiboutian and Ethiopian laborers were hired to lay tracks and dig tunnels, helping to head off some of the local resentment that has dogged other Chinese projects in Africa. The system will be operated by Chinese conductors for five years and then turned over to local citizens, many of them trained in China. After a boisterous opening day ceremony in the broiling sun, only the   attendees were allowed to board the train, which filled with applause and song as it glided out of the station. Daha Ahmed Osman, 34, a tech specialist who works for the Djiboutian government, displayed a wide grin as he watched the arid, harshly beautiful landscape spill across the train’s picture windows. He predicted that the new train would transform Djibouti and Ethiopia, and eventually all of Africa. “For this, we have the Chinese to thank, because they shared with us their money and their technology,” he said. “More than anything we thank them for showing confidence in us. ”"
"**With the UK granting approval to a Covid-19 vaccine that is currently being reviewed in the US, 330 million Americans are left wondering when they will be able to get the potentially life-saving jab.**
There are two vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer, that are both seeking emergency approval in the US. Pfizer's treatment was approved for the British public on Wednesday.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, which was created through a partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech. They will meet again on 17 December to discuss Moderna's request.
On Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence told US governors in a conference call that rollout of the vaccine could begin ""as soon as the week of December 14"".
It comes as coronavirus cases continue to balloon across the US, with an average of over 150,000 new cases reported per day. The US has recorded a total of 13.6 million cases and some 270,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
On Wednesday, the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine, meaning that mass injections could start next week.
The elderly, as well as medical workers, will be given top priority, following by those with medical issues, then by age.
The UK's approval is expected to place extra pressure on FDA regulators to swiftly approve the vaccine - the CNN's chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, said it was encouraging that there were no red flags in the UK over the vaccine's safety. American regulators will examine the same data.
The CDC's Covid-incident manager, Dr Henry Walke, said on Wednesday that they had seen the news, and ""we are still evaluating that approval in the UK"".
""The US has a process in place for approval and we are continuing that process,"" he added.
The British experience in distribution can also help guide US authorities.
This vaccine must be stored at around -70C (-94 F) and will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agree that the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes.
But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups.
The nation's approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Will postal workers and meat-processing factory workers be included, for example?
Moncef Slaoui,Â who leads the federal government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine distribution programme, said he does not ""expect the states to make uniform decisions"".
""Some may prefer long-term care facilities or the elderly, while others may prioritise their health care workers. It would be wrong to immunise 18-year-olds first. I hope no one does that. But otherwise it's shades of grey.""
Officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021.
There are also ongoing concerns regarding how many Americans are willing to get vaccinated. A recent Gallup poll found that 58% of Americans say they would be willing to get the jab, up from a low of 50% in September.
It also remains to be seen how racial minorities - who are at a higher risk of catching the virus and dying from it - will be prioritised.
Last month, New York's governor decried the federal government's immunisation plan as ""discriminatory,"" saying that distribution infrastructure such as pharmacies and hospitals are less prevalent in black and Latino communities.
None of the vaccines currently under review have been tested on pregnant or nursing women, meaning they will be unlikely to be advised by the government to be vaccinated.
8 Dec - White House summit with vaccine firms
10 Dec - FDA could approve Pfizer
14 Dec - rollout of Pfizer vaccine could begin this week
17 Dec - FDA could approve Moderna
President Trump will host the ""Covid-19 Vaccine Summit"" at the White House on 8 December.
The event is expected to bring together vaccine manufacturers, drug distributors and government officials and is being seen by experts as an opportunity for the White House to apply pressure on all involved to swiftly make vaccines available in the US.
On Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence told US governors in a conference call that rollout of the vaccine could begin ""as soon as the week of December 14"".
Some 40 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be available by the end of December.
On Monday, Kentucky's governor said the state's first vaccine shipment would mostly go to the elderly, with a smaller amount being given to hospital workers.
Colorado has said they would prioritise ski industry workers living in shared housing. Other states may choose to prioritise meat industry workers, who have been hit hard by the virus.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said priority will be given to the state's 2.4 million healthcare workers, who are being divided into smaller sub-groups in case of early shortages.
""Mass vaccination is unlikely to occur anytime soon,"" he said. California has already appointed some 65 different labour and advocacy organisations to help ensure an equitable distribution of the vaccine.
In July, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a $1.95bn (Â£1.45bn) deal to secure 100 million vaccine doses from Pfizer. The agreement also allows the US government to purchase an additional 500 million doses.
Moderna received nearly $1bn from the US government for coronavirus research. They are set to receive an additional $1.5bn for 100 million doses, according to a deal signed in August.
Billions of dollars have also been promised to other drug companies in the event that they are able to bring additional vaccines to market.
The CDC says that vaccines purchased with taxpayer money will free, but providers may still charge for administering the jab. That fee may be reimbursed by health insurance companies or the Medicaid and Medicare programmes - social safety nets for low income and elderly Americans.
States are also racing to acquire ultra-cold refrigerators that are capable of storing the Pfizer vaccine, which much be kept at temperatures of -70C.
Each refrigerator costs tens of thousands of dollars, and have been harder to find in recent days as hospitals race to purchase them."
"**No further changes have been announced to Scotland's five-level Covid alert system after the latest review of the restrictions.**
Eleven local authorities continue to be in the toughest level four restrictions. Rules are similar to the lockdown in March, although this time schools have remained open. All non-essential shops, as well as pubs and restaurants, gyms, libraries and hairdressers, are closed. The restrictions will be in place until 18:00 on 11 December.

Restrictions at this level see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 18:00 to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks to groups of up to six from two households. Alcohol sales are not permitted indoors or outdoors. All leisure and entertainment venues are closed, including cinemas. No non-essential travel is allowed out of a level three area. Indoor exercise, which includes gyms, are restricted to individual and not group exercise.
In this tier there is no in-home socialising allowed and up to six people from two households can meet outdoors and in hospitality settings. Licensed premises can only serve alcohol indoors with a main meal - and then only until 20:00. Outdoors, you can be served until 22:30. Most leisure and entertainment premises are closed except gyms, cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades.
Six people from two households can meet indoors if they are resident in Shetland, the Western Isles and Orkney. This does not apply to the other council areas. Level one sees a ""reasonable"" degree of normality. Hospitality has a 22:30 curfew. Events, like weddings, would be restricted to a maximum of 20 people. Indoor contact sports for adults are not permitted. Only those unable to work from home should go to their place of employment. Up to eight people from three households can meet outdoors.
No local authority has been assigned this level. At level zero, hospitality would operate ""almost normally"" - subject to rules on physical distancing, limits on numbers and other rules, such as table service.

From our WUWT.TV 24 hour broadcast answer to Al Gore’s dirty weather on November 14-15, 2012. Dr. Sebastian Lüning of Dr. Franz Vahrenholt are co-authors of the book “Die Kalt Sonne” which we previously reviewed here and here on WUWT. Here, in this interview and presentation, Lüning, who is a geologist by trade, explains how he was converted to climate skepticism by his own research.
It is a powerful demonstration of how people can come to understand just how flimsy the evidence is for catastrophic global warming, and is well worth your time to watch.

Russell Norman would be so proud. But this time, the Greenpeace Eco-Fascists have gone too far and an innocent member of the public has been injured.



Ahead of Thursday night’s Democratic primary debate in the USA, a group of Greenpeace activists suspended themselves from a Houston bridge to _“resist Trump”_ and protest the oil industry.



HAPPENING NOW: We're in the heart of the fossil fuel industry (the largest oil export channel in the US) to confront Trump & the oil industry.   
  
RT to support the brave activists & take action for [#GreenNewDeal](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreenNewDeal?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)! >> <https://t.co/xGNiM0OlYG> [pic.twitter.com/xkoyvj2nt6](https://t.co/xkoyvj2nt6)



The group of 11 protesters hanging from the Fred Hartman Bridge were aiming to block traffic in the Houston Ship Channel; a key location for the passage of oil-carrying ships.



But, as usual, the fools don’t care about the damage they cause; as long as people are talking about them. 



Local TV station KHOU [reported](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/greenpeace-bridge-protesters-blamed-for-crash-on-fred-hartman-bridge/285-2ea1b500-6399-4b3e-9db3-2952db96e273) that the Greenpeace activists are being blamed for a Thursday morning crash on the bridge. Investigators from the local Constable’s Office said a van carrying the protesters blocked traffic and caused a motorist to swerve at the last second to avoid a collision.



That motorist was rear-ended by a second vehicle. One driver was treated for minor injuries at a local clinic. I hope Greenpeace have good lawyers.



But not only are they now causing actual injuries, they would also like to point out that, if you are giving them abuse for wearing plastic hard hats, glasses and vests and for driving in fossil-fuelled vehicles to the protest, then you are the problem, and they are not being hypocrites.



Ever heard the argument that climate protesters are hypocrites because they drive cars, use petroleum products and otherwise don’t practice what they preach? It’s a PR line designed to shut down criticism without addressing its substance, and, what’s worse, it’s a logical fallacy. 



Or they could just be twats who have no clue that, to normal people, they just look like self-absorbed, deluded nutbars.



Whether you agree with them or not, climate activists are participating in a social debate over how we respond to climate change. They’re advocating for a broad shift away from fossil fuels and a corresponding investment in renewable energy. 



Yeah, whatever, explaining is losing. No one is going to take you seriously when you drive a petrol-fuelled van to protest about oil use.



At least the local police dealt with[ them properly](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/greenpeace-activists-hanging-from-fred-hartman-bridge-to-stop-ship-channel-traffic/285-33d1c828-fd39-4221-8556-f341db2ebbf3). Around a dozen protesters who were stationed on the bridge as ‘spotters’ for the swingers below were taken into custody early in the piece, but it took nearly twelve hours to remove the hanging clowns safely, an operation that involved dozens of SWAT officers, Fire and Ambulance personnel.



All protesters will likely face charges and, this being Texas, I would suggest that they may not wish to show their faces there again any time soon. As one local suggested;



Those [oil] tanks have been there for ever, if they don’t like it, well, maybe they should get out



I bet a few of the locals would have been happy to sort the problem out with a quick flick of a Stanley knife!

"For anyone wondering how former President Barack Obama is adjusting to life under the Trump administration, know this: He seems to be doing just fine. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, took a vacation to the British Virgin Islands, where they have been hosted by Richard Branson, the chief executive of the Virgin Group. On Tuesday, Mr. Branson published a blog post, along with photos and video, showing Mr. Obama learning to kitesurf. Yes, he seems to be doing just fine. Mr. Branson wrote that Mr. Obama spent two days learning how to stay afloat and navigate kitesurfing. “Being the former president of America, there was lots of security around, but Barack was able to really relax and get into it,” Mr. Branson wrote. While Mr. Obama was enjoying the wind and the waves, his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced details of his   work. Mr. Biden will lead the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a new effort “focused principally on diplomacy, foreign policy and national security,” the university  announced on Tuesday. Mr. Biden said in a statement: “The Penn Biden Center and I will be engaging with Penn’s wonderful students while partnering with its eminent faculty and global centers to convene world leaders, develop and advance smart policy, and impact the national debate about how America can continue to lead in the 21st Century. ” The center will be in Washington, but Mr. Biden will also have an office on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, which is a short Amtrak ride away in Philadelphia. The campus is also a fairly short trip from Delaware, where Mr. Biden served as a senator for 36 years and where he maintains deep roots. He will also be working with the University of Delaware, his alma mater. The university announced on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would be the founding chairman of the Biden Institute, which it described as “a new research and policy center focused on developing public policy solutions on issues ranging from economic reform and environmental sustainability to civil rights, criminal justice, women’s rights and more. ” The former vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, intend to split time between a lakeside home in Greenville, Del. a Wilmington suburb, and a home in Washington. Dr. Biden plans to continue teaching English at a community college in Northern Virginia. The couple previously announced the creation of the Biden Foundation as a platform to advance priorities like military families, preventing violence against women and a “moonshot” to cure cancer."
"■ A vote on Jeff Sessions’s nomination as attorney general is expected on Wednesday. ■ A proposed Senate bill would require congressional approval to lift sanctions on Russia. ■ Vice President Mike Pence will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump on Wednesday lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s clothing and accessories line, once again raising questions about the tangled relationship between the president and his family’s business interests. The president has been criticized for singling out other companies for criticism, like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, prompting gyrations in their stock prices, but those controversies had to do with government contracts, not his family’s own fortunes. Nordstrom, the department store chain, said on Friday that it was dropping the Ivanka Trump line, a decision it said was based on sales performance. A campaign, using the hashtag #GrabYourWallet, which has encouraged shoppers to boycott products with ties to Mr. Trump, his family and his donors, called the Nordstrom announcement a victory. It was not clear what prompted the president to criticize the company five days later. As Mr. Trump has noted several times, federal    laws apply to other officials, but not to the president. Nordstrom’s stock dropped briefly after the president’s Twitter post, then rose again. Mr. Trump’s blast at the company came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit describing her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. A day after her narrow confirmation as education secretary, Betsy DeVos toured the department she now leads and delivered a speech to staff members and reporters. She began with a joke: “This confirmation process and the drama it engendered have been a bit of a bear,” she said, a reference to her   comment during her Senate hearing that schools might need guns to protect students from “grizzlies. ” “We’ve just come through one of the most bruising, divisive elections in modern times, and that’s O. K.,” she said. “All of us here can help bring unity by personally committing to being more open to and patient toward views different from our own. ” In her speech, she did not mention some of the issues that had made her such a contentious nominee, like her support of private school vouchers and charter schools. But while she had seemed unfamiliar in her Senate hearing with basic education terms and policies, such as the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, on Wednesday Ms. DeVos went out of her way to promise to serve “  students and families to whom we owe our full support,” as well as “students who may be struggling” and “hardworking teachers who may feel stifled. ” She continued, “I pledge to listen and learn from you, and from stakeholders around our country. ” Capping a strikingly contentious confirmation process, the Senate is expected to vote as soon as Wednesday evening on the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general. Senators usually show a great deal of deference when one of their own is nominated for a cabinet post. But Democrats have sharply criticized over his background on civil rights and his stances on voter access and immigration. After Mr. Sessions’s nomination cleared a procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, Democrats took to the floor to reiterate their opposition to the senator during the final hourslong debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote those Twitter posts after being halted by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as she tried to read on the floor a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King opposing Mr. Sessions’s nomination for a judgeship. Mr. McConnell, in a rare step, said Ms. Warren had breached Senate rules by impugning the character of Mr. Sessions. The Senate then voted, along party lines, to bar Ms. Warren from speaking again during the debate. In the end, though, Democrats can do little more than raise their voices. None of the 52 Republicans have said they would vote against Mr. Sessions, and he needs only a simple majority to win confirmation. In a bit of procedural strategy, Republican leaders held off on Mr. Sessions’s vote until after confirming Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s education secretary. With Mr. Sessions still in the Senate, Republicans had just enough votes to push her to confirmation. A day after a federal appeals court panel voiced skepticism over his targeted travel ban, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge on Wednesday the possibility that he could lose the case. But to lose the normal way, on the merits? The president sees other forces at play. Later in the morning, Mr. Trump resumed that theme at a gathering of sheriffs and police chiefs. “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” he said. “But courts seem to be so political. ” He also called the appeals court hearing “disgraceful. ” With that, Mr. Trump kept up his efforts to call into question the independence of the judiciary  —   a cornerstone of American democracy. A few days ago, he referred to the district court judge in the travel ban case as a “  judge. ” And before that, he doubted that the judge in a Trump University case could be impartial because of his Mexican heritage. The president has been   blaming judges for any terrorist attack that might happen during the travel ban suspension. On Sunday, he attacked the district court judge who blocked his immigration order, James Robart of Seattle. “If something happens,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “blame him and court system. ” On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump was back on Twitter, claiming that foreigners were flowing into the United States from “certain areas. ” A bipartisan group of senators is expected to introduce legislation on Wednesday that would require congressional approval for Mr. Trump to lift sanctions on Russia, according to two Senate aides. The group is expected to include six senators: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida, all Republicans and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, all Democrats. The effort comes amid longstanding worries on Capitol Hill that the Trump administration might be too dovish on Russia, which intelligence officials say intervened in the election in an effort to help Mr. Trump. Last week, the president seemed to defend the reputation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by asking an interviewer, “You think our country’s so innocent?” The vice president will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas at the end of the month, according to a notice from the group sent to prospective attendees. Las Vegas is home to one of the group’s biggest donors, the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson. Mr. Pence’s trip will come a few weeks after the Trump administration issued a muted statement about Israeli settlements, calling for immediate curbs on construction but also signaling a shift away from the Obama administration’s rejection of all settlement activity. It will also come after the president’s promise to immediately move the American Embassy to Jerusalem has been delayed. It seems that no mission is too impossible for Jim Mattis to take on. During a recent trip to Asia, Mr. Mattis, the defense secretary, succeeded in shoring up connections with South Korea and Japan despite Mr. Trump’s campaign talk about pulling back from the United States’ security commitments in the region. On Tuesday, Mr. Mattis made an effort to salvage relations with Mexico, at least in the area of military cooperation. According to a statement issued Tuesday night by the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis spoke by phone with two of his Mexican counterparts: Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, the secretary of national defense, and Adm. Vidal Francisco Soberón Sanz, the secretary of the navy. Mr. Mattis talked about the need to strengthen military connections between the two countries, and “lauded Mexico’s growing leadership in the region,” the Pentagon said. The statement did not say when Mr. Mattis might be visiting the country, but it noted that Mexico was planning to host the Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas in 2018. No word if Mr. Trump’s wall will be built by then."

Joe says, “It’s incredible watching these people making up excuses. […] It’s astounding how I’m hearing these things. […] Just shows you what they don’t know.”
Here are a couple of the highlights. Most of the global land-masses for February are colder than normal (see 1:40 mark). February 2014 global temperature measured by NCEP is 0.10 °C below normal:

At the 3:59 mark, Ryan Maue’s chart from NCEP shows that global temperatures have been dropping over the last 5 years:

Joe Bastardi: “Unmistakable trend, down with the temperatures.”
As far as March goes for the USA, it looks like the deep freeze is set to continue and could be the coldest in over 50 years.
By now we suspect the global warmist alarmists have pretty much written off this winter and surely now have their eyes set on the coming spring…tornado season.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn early April, the 7th Climate Conference, featuring distinguished non-alarmist scientists and organized by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), took place at the Steigenberger Hotel Mannheimer Hof in Mannheim, Germany.
The 2-day conference featured heavyweights like Richard Lindzen, Nir Shaviv and Henrik Svensmark who brought the message that today’s climate science tells us there really isn’t much to be alarmed about. CO2 is nowhere near the big driver the media and government-funded scientists make it out to be.

Prof. Lindzen, NN, Dr. Thüne, Prof. Shaviv, Prof. Svensmark. Photo: EIKE
The conference room was large enough to accommodate an audience of 100 people, yet 130 specialists of various fields jammed inside. Those coming late had to stand. Year by year interest in other views in the climate debate and explanations as to why global temperatures refuse to rise has been growing among the public in Germany and Europe. Little wonder that the place sold out.
But interest in rational climate science ends at the media’s front door. The non-alarmist message put forth by the distinguished scientists obviously was not what the German mainstream media wanted to splash in their newspapers, TV screens or internet pages. EIKE reports that not one of the three invited local newspapers bothered to show up and report on the conference and cover the story.
Instead of delivering vivid pictures of doom and gloom scenarios like the IPCC does, the dissident scientists came to tell the world that there really isn’t a man-made climate problem and that the real problem is the man-made climate science disaster. For years the IPCC has been giving the public a distorted and manipulated picture of our climate.  The non-irrational scientists at the conference showed the data to back it up. But this was not the message the German media wanted to hear or to spread to the public. The willful deception continues.
EIKE asks and comments:
Does the print media see the writing on the wall as to why readers are leaving in droves? It’s little wonder. The readers want to see objective information, and not eco-propaganda. […]
As it stands, one has to consider the often sworn free, objective German media as definitely having reached communist East Germany media levels.”

Avert your eyes, believe me; it’s for your own safety. You may be blinded by the sight of Ms Ardern displaying her ‘international leadership’ credentials, because from what I know of them they won’t cover very much at all. Here’s hoping, fingers crossed, she reveals herself behind a screen rather than in front of one.



In a piffle-esque puff-piece propagandising Ardern’s contribution to humanity and laughably labelled “[Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s UN leadership challenge](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115877600/prime-minister-jacinda-arderns-un-leadership-challenge)” Stuff’s Luke Malpass toffees the big apple with this over-sugary spin:



“The prime minister has secured an important bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump. Tick **.”**



Well; isn’t Luke just the master of important-sounding words – a ‘bilateral meeting’ – gosh, I wonder what a unilateral meeting would look like; just Jacinda standing alone in a room talking to herself? Although the truth is that it would do about as much good. 



Mr Malpass immediately continues:



“But the substantial parts of her agenda – climate change and the Christchurch Call […]”



And that very stupid sentence perfectly encapsulates the far-Left’s agendas and attitudes. A meeting with the leader of the strongest economy in the world, a great opportunity to pitch for increased access to a lucrative market is ‘important’, but not the ‘substantial’ reason for Ardern’s visit to what, she imagines, is her own personal Glee Club at the wretched and rotten forum known as United Nations.



Her condescension towards President Trump was well-framed by Newshub’s Jamie Ensor:



“Jacinda Ardern may have revealed her feelings about US President Donald Trump by burying the announcement she’s meeting him near the bottom of a press release […] Normally, these things would be sung from the rooftops. **Jacinda Ardern buried it at the very, very, very, very, very bottom of a press release**. Fourth paragraph from the bottom after basically everything else she is doing in Tokyo and New York.”



Leadership, that ain’t. Nor wisdom or professionalism, nor common courtesy; in fact it’s stupid, but stupid is as stupid does.



Mr Malpass gets to Ardern’s actual ‘message’ with a positively ghoulish preamble that, although entirely inappropriate, accurately sums up Ardern’s ambition to forge the Christchurch murders into a personal yardstick to measure her ‘leadership’ by:



“In foreign affairs-land the Christchurch Call is a big deal. New Zealand rarely leads on global initiatives of this kind, but the Christchurch massacre threw New Zealand into a position of global leadership which **Ardern intends to exploit**.”



Yes; you read that correctly – the saintly woman fully intends to ‘exploit’ a murderous rampage. I guess you gotta’ do what you gotta’ do; poor thing. I should feel sorry for her, but I don’t. 



I feel only contempt for the person sucked into an evil scheme euphemistically re-branded after the awful event in Christchurch but which was hatched by soul-less Macron of France a long time ago under the sinister but more accurate title “[esprit de vigilance constructive](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/remise-du-rapport-de-la-mission-de-regulation-des-reseaux-sociaux/)” – “the spirit of constructive vigilance”. It seeks to unleash citizen against citizen in a [battle of the snitches](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/snitches-unleashed/). Facebook only signed on to it to avoid the stand-over threats calling for the company’s break-up by the EU, engineered by France’s repugnant socialist bloc. 



Ardern is a simple pawn, just a useful idiot, in pushing these reprehensible proposals, the systematic and quintessentially socialist suppressions of free expression that she hopes to champion and take ‘credit’ for. 



I wish her nothing but complete failure, because, as with stupid, failure is as failure does. Attempting to burnish her moral and ‘leadership credentials’, and personal career options, on the bodies of the buried put down by a maniacal and extremely disturbed monster, a total stranger to the country where his crimes were committed, is the ultimate in failure. That’s neither morality nor leadership; it’s positively macabre.

"The New York Times Magazine won three National Magazine Awards on Tuesday, tying New York Magazine for the most awards for any publication this year. The winning stories showcased a wide range of reporting and storytelling, at home and abroad: • In the Public Interest category, “Worlds Apart,” by our staff writer Nikole   tells the story of  ’s own process of finding a school for her daughter in New York City, among the most segregated public school systems in the country. Expertly weaving together the personal and the historical, supported by a wealth of research and data,   made the case that  —   more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education  —   the majority of poor black and Latino children received a separate and unequal education. • The winning story in the Feature Writing category, “I Have No Choice but to Keep Looking,” by our contributing writer Jennifer Percy, visits the coast of Japan, where more than five years after the tsunami that killed tens of thousands, the families of the dead still search the sea for their loved ones  —   a heartbreaking testament to love and devotion in the face of unimaginable loss. • In the   category, “David’s Ankles,” by our staff writer Sam Anderson, explores Anderson’s obsession with the history of Michelangelo’s David statue and its flaws while unspooling a meditation on the nature of imperfection itself."

For more than a decade, the Heartland Institute has tried to explain to the public, in courteous terms, that the idea of a human-caused global warming catastrophe is a delusion, and that its proponents should not be allowed to waste the world’s economic resources through arrogant efforts to alter the planet’s climate.
Tim Ball, Ph.D., takes up the issue with strong words in his new book, The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science. He argues, with overwhelming evidence, that in fact the global warming debate in the halls of science has been an unmitigated fraud perpetrated by people who no longer have the right to be called scientists.

Senator McCain, Senator Reed, and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning. It is an honor to be here.



This is a vital undertaking. There is an urgent need for the United States to clarify its national security goals, to craft a strategy that prioritizes those goals, and to consider the tools necessary to achieve them. Our military forces of the future should conform to that strategy.



I will focus first on how U.S. foreign policy has shaped the international system. Second, I will explain the flaws of our current grand strategy, and propose an alternative, with a particular focus on the role that U.S allies and partners should play in the future. Lastly, I will briefly touch on some of the capabilities that the U.S. military requires to carry out its vital missions.



 **Understanding U.S. Foreign Policy**  
U.S. foreign policy is crippled today by a dramatic disconnect between what Americans expect of it and what the nation’s leaders are giving them. If U.S. policymakers don’t address this gap, they risk pursuing a policy whose ends don’t match with the means the American people are willing to provide.



What is our foreign policy? To the extent that it can be summarized in a single word, that word is “primacy”: a foreign policy that hinges on a forward‐​deployed military geared to stopping prospective threats before they materialize. Primacy holds that it would be too dangerous to allow other countries to defend themselves and their interests. Some will botch the job, necessitating costly U.S. intervention later. Others will succeed too well, unleashing arms races that would alter the delicate balance of regional or international relations. Thus, primacy reassures; it discourages other countries from defending themselves and their interests.



For much of the past two decades, these underlying premises of U.S. foreign policy have not changed, although the preferred terms or phrases to describe it have. Other popular variations include “deep engagement,” “unipolarity,” “liberal hegemony,” or the particularly grandiose “benevolent global hegemony.”



President Obama favors “leadership.” That word appears 35 times in his latest National Security Strategy.



His predecessors have all had similar aspirations, although most managed to work in a few more synonyms. It all boils down to primacy.



For example, at the dawn of the post‐​Cold War era, officials in the George H.W. Bush administration aspired for the United States to be the sole global power. Now that the nation’s long‐​time rival was gone, the object of U.S. foreign policy, according to an early draft of the Defense Planning Guidance, was to “prevent the re‐​emergence of a new rival” capable of challenging U.S. power in any vital area, including Western Europe, Asia, or the territory of the former Soviet Union. To accomplish this task, the United States would retain preponderant military power, not merely to deter attacks against the United States, but also to deter “potential competitors” — including long‐​time U.S. allies such as Germany and Japan — “from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.“1



Leaving aside, for now, the question of whether the strategy is preventing rivals from challenging U.S. power, the costs have been considerable. Primacy, notes MIT’s Barry Posen, “encourages less‐​friendly states to compete with the United States more intensively, while encouraging friendly states to do less than they should in their own defense, or to be more adventurous than is wise.“2



For the most part, American taxpayers, and especially American troops, have borne the burdens of primacy, while U.S. allies have been content to focus on domestic spending, and allow their underfunded defenses to languish. Because U.S. security guarantees to wealthy allies have caused them to under‐​provide for their own defense, they also have less capacity to deal with common security challenges, from ethnic violence in the Balkans in the late 1990s, to combatting terrorism and piracy in the Middle East, South Asia, or the Horn or Africa in the 2000s, to averting state collapse in North Africa today.



But there is an even more dramatic problem underlying U.S. foreign policy today: it requires U.S. leaders to push, prod, and occasionally even hoodwink Americans into taking on unnecessary tasks. Even strong advocates of primacy concede that it might not be realistic to expect Americans to bear the burdens of global governance indefinitely, and admit to the need for misdirection and subterfuge.



“Americans,” Michael Mandelbaum grudgingly admitted in his book, _The Case for Goliath_ , “approach the world much as other people do….For the American public, foreign policy, like charity, begins at home.” For that reason, above all others, Mandelbaum predicted, “the American role in the world may depend in part on Americans not scrutinizing it too closely.“3



It is no longer appropriate to expect Americans to remain ignorant about our foreign policy. Primacy served us well immediately after the end of World War II, when the nations of Europe and East Asia were physically broken and fiscally broke, and we wanted to prevent the reemergence of Japan and Germany as rivals. Protecting our Asian and European allies continued to make sense during the Cold War, as long as our absence from those continents would have left an imbalance of power that the Red Army or Communist China could exploit.



But we should ask more of our allies and security partners today and in the future. We shouldn’t merely expect them to support us when we act militarily abroad. We shouldn’t merely demand that they allow us to use our facilities in their lands, often on their behalf. Rather, we should expect them to act first, to address urgent threats to their security, before they become threats to their wider region, or the world.



On the subject of threats, I do not believe that we are living in the most dangerous time in human history, or even in my lifetime. There are dangers in the world; there always have been, and there always will be. We are quite good at identifying a dizzying array of possible threats.4 An effective national security strategy will prioritize among them, and identify the best tools to mitigate them.



In that context, the key question is what Americans should be prepared to do to address which threats, and what will be expected of others. Whether you agree with me or not about today’s threats as compared to those a generation ago, or a century ago, the best approach would involve many countries who are willing and able to confront potential local or regional challenges.



Under the current model, the United States is expected to address all threats, in all regions, at all times. We need a new grand strategy, one that expects other countries to take primary responsibility for their protecting their security and preserving their interests. We need a resilient international order, one that is not overly dependent on the military power of a single country. We need capable, self‐​reliant partners. And we must restrain our impulse to use the U.S. military when our vital interests are not directly threatened.



 **A New Profile of Power**  
Such a grand strategy, built around a greater skepticism toward military intervention, leads logically toward a new profile of power: namely, a smaller military oriented around defending U.S. security and U.S. interests.



We should not reduce our military without first rethinking how those forces will be used. If a finite number of assets are stretched to the limit to cover excessive global commitments, there is a serious risk that we will damage morale and readiness, thus contributing to a “hollow force” — a military that appears capable on the surface, but that is, in actuality, crippled by inferior equipment, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate training.



We must work over the next decade to renegotiate or abrogate security relationships. Alliances for mutual defense, and to advance common interests, are acceptable; the current inequitable arrangement, whereby we agree to defend our allies, and they agree to let us, is not. It is unreasonable to expect U.S. taxpayers to foot the bill when U.S. interests are not at stake.



Put another way, the days of the U.S. military serving as the world’s global constabulary, responding to every 911 call, from every corner of the world, should end.



For the balance of my time, I’m going to focus on three aspects of the force structure consistent with a foreign policy of self reliance and restraint: a capable Navy, a credible nuclear deterrent, and a flexible, mobile Army.



 _A Focused Navy_



I’m proud to have served in the United States Navy. I spent about six months at Navy schools in Newport, Rhode Island, and then three years on the guided missile cruiser USS TICONDEROGA, mostly in Norfolk, Virginia, but also two deployments overseas. I have a great naval name. I grew up in Maine, as did about 10 generations of Prebles before me. They build ships at Bath just across the Kennebec River from where some of my ancestors first settled.



I am a Navy partisan. There is no point in trying to conceal that fact. But my support for a strong and capable Navy reflects more than just parochialism and ancestral pride. And my love of the institution, and the men and women who serve in it, informs my attitudes about the missions that our Navy should be expected to perform, and the ships that it will need to perform them.



The number of ships in the U.S. Navy has declined precipitously since the late‐​1980s. In those days, we were confronting a globe‐​straddling Soviet empire with a vast and capable blue‐​water navy. I remember it well. I was a young midshipman in the Navy ROTC program at George Washington University, and the SecNav back then, John Lehman, famously aspired to build a 600‐​ship navy.



But times have changed. The Soviet Union is where it belongs: on the ash heap of history. And the ships that we deploy today are vastly more capable than the Cold War‐​era ships, some of which were considerably older than the sailors who deployed on them. We shouldn’t, therefore, focus on numbers of ships in the fleet today, per se, but rather on the mix of vessels, and especially their costs and capabilities to perform key missions.



Those costs include opportunity costs. Choosing to invest a substantial share of the Navy’s total shipbuilding budget on just a few Ford‐​class aircraft carriers necessarily means that we will buy fewer small surface combatants, especially cruisers and destroyers. I also believe that we need a successor to the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, the last of which was decommissioned earlier this year. The costly and disappointing littoral combat ships may not be the answer. And where do submarines fit into the mix? The shipbuilding budget must also account for them, both ballistic missile submarines and fast attack boats. Understanding these tradeoffs is crucial. Are we prepared to say that a single platform costing $14 billion is worth more than six or seven DDGs? Can the United States build a small surface combatant for less than $500 million? Other countries can, so why can’t we?



We should not build our fleet around the supposition that it will be continuously engaged in offensive operations across the planet. Under a strategy of self‐​reliance and restraint, the U.S. Navy will be a surge force, capable of deploying if local actors prove incapable of addressing threats, not a permanent presence force, committed to preventing bad things from happening, all the time, and everywhere.



Safeguarding the flow of essential commodities and finished goods was a core mission for the U.S. military during the Cold War, when the Soviet Navy aspired to close vital sea lanes of communications (SLOCs), and they appeared to have the ability to do so, at least for a time. Today the situation is far different. Few international actors have an incentive to close major international waterways, and those that are so inclined — e.g pirates, bandits, and various non‐​state actors — lack the capacity to do so. They can disrupt. They can threaten. They cannot deny the use of these waterways to determined shippers backed by capable nation states.



Sea‐​lane control in the modern era aims to ensure the free flow of goods and is therefore primarily defensive in nature. Given that the sea‐​control mission will be shared with other countries, most of whom will be operating in close proximity to their home waters, our force planning can focus on our core obligations, principally in the Western Hemisphere. That mission could be supported by small surface combatants, including destroyers, and possibly a new class of frigates. In the unlikely event that a regional conflict threatened to close a distant strategic choke point, naval and air forces from many different countries would be able to respond, augmented by U.S. forces as necessary.



In this context, we should revisit the decision to build a number of very large and costly aircraft carriers. These vessels are not well suited to the sea control mission, and will become increasingly vulnerable to defensive weapons that force them to operate at greater and greater distances from shore. The investment in such exquisite technology — a single platform that consumes a substantial share of the total shipbuilding budget — raises serious questions about how such platforms will actually be deployed in an era of defensive dominance. Simply put, will any future president of the United States risk losing even a single such vessel? And what interests would justify taking such risks?5



 _A Small but Credible Nuclear Deterrent_



Maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent is a key component of U.S. national security policy, but U.S. security does not require nearly 1,600 nuclear weapons deployed on a triad of delivery vehicles — bombers, land‐​based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine‐​launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). A smaller nuclear deterrent based entirely on submarines would be sufficient to deter attacks against the United States. It might be more politically feasible to reduce to a dyad of delivery vehicles — SLBMs with either bombers or ICBMs — but that would signal the triumph of parochial interests over the needs of U.S. security.



The triad grew up during the 1950s as a result of competition between the military services. The rationales were thin at the time, and quickly were superseded by dramatic technological improvements that the services chose to downplay. As the competition for resources abated in the 1960s, the Navy and the Air Force stopped denigrating each others’ nuclear delivery systems and began arguing on behalf of the triad as an article of faith. It is not clear, in retrospect, that a triad was ever required to deter Soviet attacks against the United States or U.S. allies. Maintaining a guaranteed second‐​strike for deterrence was never the only goal, but today’s submarines are also capable of counterforce (i.e. first‐​strike) missions.



U.S. power today makes the case for the triad even more dubious. Survivability is no longer a feasible justification. No adversary has the capability to destroy all U.S. ballistic submarines, let alone all three types of delivery vehicles, and there would be time to adjust our nuclear force posture if that circumstance changed.



Overinvesting in nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery vehicles, even if such expenditures represent only a small share of the total military budget, nonetheless diverts resources that could be more effectively invested elsewhere. We should build and maintain only what we need.6



 _Flexible Ground Forces Postured for Defense, Not Nation Building_



What about our ground forces? Some argue that the Army and Marine Corps are well‐​suited for counterterrorism missions, because they rely on precision firepower and they are more adept at separating terrorists and terrorist‐​sympathizers from innocent bystanders.



But the belief that a larger military is necessary, or even effective, at reducing the threat of terrorism is mistaken. Counterterrorism is not an especially personnel‐​intensive endeavor, and, to the extent that it is, the people most heavily involved are not, and should not be, members of the military.7



And what of the supposed need for more troops to conduct Iraq and Afghanistan‐​style conflicts — regime‐​change operations followed by years of armed nation building? Some Americans believe that our failings in those countries, especially in Iraq, are a function of having too few “boots on the ground.” From that flows the logical conclusion that we need more people in boots.



The idea that our military is stretched too thin because our commitments exceed our means to achieve them is widespread. The best way to resolve this imbalance, however, is to rethink the ends, as opposed to merely increasing the means.



No one disputes that our troops have been overtaxed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the problem of too few troops chasing too many missions predated 9/11. We have asked the members of our military — and especially those men and women in the Army and Marine Corps — to be the lead instrument of our foreign policies ever since the end of the Cold War. Our troops have responded honorably, but they cannot do everything, and they cannot be everywhere.



More troops are not the answer. A more judicious use of the troops that we already have is. Rather than increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps, we should reduce the number of active‐​duty personnel in both services, and transition to a smaller force augmented by a capable ready reserve.



We should also pause to consider the wisdom of armed nation building, what the military also calls counterinsurgency (COIN). When the United States chooses to shuffle the political deck in a weak or failing state, it needs men and women on the ground to do the work. Bombs can’t build schools or bridges, reform legal codes or root out corruption. They can’t convince the locals that we care about them enough to stick around for the long haul and will be there to protect them if the irreconcilables return to exact vengeance.



And that backlash is nearly inevitable; those driven out of power will fight to regain what they lost. FM 3–24, the military’s COIN manual, explains “Insurgencies are protracted by nature. Thus, COIN operations always demand considerable expenditures of time and resources.”



The United States is ill suited to such missions. This is not the fault of the U.S. military. The American people will support missions to strike our enemies with a vengeance, but solid majorities believe that the nation‐​building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan weren’t worth the effort. The widespread opposition to deeper involvement in the Syrian civil war demonstrates that the public’s skepticism hasn’t abated.



The public’s instincts are correct. If you understand the culture, if you avoid counterproductive violence, if you integrate civilians and make reconstruction operations a reward for cooperation, if you train the local forces well, if you pick your allies wisely, if you protect enough civilians and win their loyalty and more, you might succeed. But even avoiding a few of those ifs is too much competence to expect of any political and military leaders. Many of the crucial factors for success are simply beyond the capacity of outside forces to control. That is why insurgencies in the last century generally lasted for decades and why the track record of democratic powers pacifying uprisings in foreign lands is abysmal.8



Then again, Americans are accustomed to doing the impossible if the impossible is truly necessary. The ultimate reason why Americans will not master counterinsurgency and state‐​building is that it is not necessary. The supposed link between terrorism and state failure is weak to nonexistent. Terrorists operate in many perfectly healthy states (including Spain, the U.K. and, most recently, France), while many weak or failing states don’t serve as launching pads for violent extremism directed at Americans. We should deal with threats from Yemen or Somalia or Afghanistan as they arise and drop the pretense that we can or must construct a modern nation state in any of those places in order to defeat transnational terrorism.



If we are unlikely to embark on protracted nation‐​building missions for decades on end, and if the military, particularly our ground forces, are not the best tool for counterterrorism, we should revisit the other possible rationales for a large standing Army. The principal advantage of having that force, 20 to 30 percent of which is forward deployed in foreign bases, is that it is quite easy for it to become involved in foreign wars, without attracting too much attention by the American people, or their representatives here in Congress. The public is rarely engaged to the point of debating why we might be involved in such wars, let alone how to win them. This hardly seems like an advantage at all. If we reduce our permanent overseas presence and encourage other countries to defend themselves, we could rely more heavily on reservists serving stateside. And when there are calls for deploying U.S. forces abroad, and those reserves are mobilized into the active force, we can be sure that that will trigger a national debate.



Let me be clear: this isn’t just about saving money; it’s about spending money wisely. Ronald Reagan said, “Defense is not a budget issue. You spend what you need.” He was right, which is why it is crucial that we understand what we need. The misallocation of funds — whether for platforms the Pentagon doesn’t need, or bases it doesn’t want or personnel it won’t use — takes away from other priorities. We need a balanced force focused on defending vital U.S. interests, not a top‐​heavy force geared to fight the last decade’s wars or to defend others who can and should defend themselves.



 **Conclusion: Rethinking Ends and Means**  
In the debate over military spending that is now raging, it is generally assumed that our foreign policy, and thus the roles and missions that we assign to our military, will remain unchanged — or at least will not become less onerous. It is unreasonable to expect our military to do the same, or more, with less. It is unfair to the troops and their families. This noble sentiment explains the current push to increase the Pentagon’s budget above the spending caps imposed by the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. Many people believe that the only way to address the means/​end mismatch is to remove the fiscal constraints.



But the military’s roles and missions are not handed down from heaven. They are not carved on stone tablets. They are a function of the nation’s grand strategy and informed by the dominant intellectual paradigms at a given point in time.



That strategy must take account of the resources that can be made available to execute it. Under primacy, in the current domestic political context, increasing the means entails telling the American people to accept cuts in popular domestic programs, higher taxes, or both, so that our allies can maintain their bloated domestic spending and neglect their defenses.



It seems unlikely that Americans will embrace such an approach. “Defending our allies’ security” ranked near the bottom of Americans’ foreign policy priorities — tied with “Limiting Climate Change” — in the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ most recent report on American public opinion and U.S. foreign policy.9 The best recourse, therefore, is to reconsider our global policing role, encourage other countries to defend themselves and their interests, and bring the object of our foreign policy in line with the public’s wishes.

Climate alarmists want to redesign our entire civilization, economic system, lifestyle and energy infrastructure – without any debate. Carl Sagan said “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” In this video I show that Arctic alarmist claims are indeed extraordinary – but only in their deception.

Ugly reality has dashed the high hopes of the “Arab Spring.” Although the dream of democratic reform lives on, only Tunisia appears on course. In Egypt, the fall of Hosni Mubarak has encouraged religious intolerance and persecution, especially against the Coptic Christian community.



Once a great civilization, Egypt long ago turned into an impoverished backwater. Only a large population and strategic location today deliver geopolitical importance. Hosni Mubarak ruled for three decades, but under him the Egyptian people enjoyed neither prosperity nor liberty. In fact, Mubarak was exhibit A for America’s foreign policy conundrum: stability or democracy? He held the Muslim Brotherhood in check, maintained a cold peace with Israel, and kept the Suez Canal open. For that he was richly rewarded with tens of billions in “foreign aid,” which he used to build an authoritarian kleptocracy — one that treated the needs of most Egyptians as an afterthought. Washington occasionally pushed for reform, but never too hard, lest stability be sacrificed.



Mubarak counted among his victims the Coptic Christians, who make up around ten percent of the population. They predate Islam, but today are a disadvantaged and increasingly threatened minority. Rather like Saddam Hussein and the Assad family, Mubarak seemingly cared little for religion. However, he left more room for Islamic extremists to act and compete for political support by victimizing religious minorities.



While the “government does not actively persecute or repress Christians, a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity,” noted Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty in Egypt “poor.” State added that Christians and Baha’is faced “personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship.”



Moreover, the regime “sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed” those “whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.” Government‐​controlled media and government‐​funded mosques encourage violence. The authorities do little to stop the kidnapping of young Coptic girls, who then are forced to marry Muslims.



Converts are at particular risk. Despite some recent progress, the government traditionally refused to provide new identity documents to converts as well as Baha’is. Worse, noted William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law, “Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment — including imprisonment and sadistic torture.”



Equally disturbing, noted the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, “violence targeting Coptic Orthodox Christians remained high.” But the Mubarak government rarely punished the attackers. Indeed, International Christian Concern noted that it was common for the government to arrest “Coptic victims alongside the perpetrators of the violence.”



Even when the Copts did not end up behind bars, they did not receive justice. State explained that the Mubarak government sponsored “informal reconciliation sessions” which “generally prevented the criminal prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against Copts, precluded their recourse to the judicial system for restitution, and contributed to a climate of impunity that encouraged further assaults.”



No surprise, failing to exact a penalty for murder and mayhem has led to more murder and mayhem — or what the Hudson Institute’s Nina Shea called “pogroms and acts of terror.” The failure to punish the perpetrators, complained the Commission, “continued to foster a climate of impunity, making further violence likely.” Even more emphatic was Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who told a recent congressional hearing that “the Egyptian regime is fully responsible for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine.”



Unfortunately, those who hoped the Egyptian revolution would better protect Christians and other religious minorities have been disappointed. To the contrary, violent attacks on Copts have been increasing.



As of last month 24 Christians had been killed, more than 200 had been injured, and three churches had been destroyed. Muslim mobs have beset Coptic churches, businesses, and homes. Well‐​armed thugs also attacked Christians who were protesting against the forgoing attacks.



No surprise, then, that few perpetrators have been arrested, let alone imprisoned. Noted Paul Marshall of the Hudson Institute: “as under Mubarak, the authorities’ refusal to punish attacks on Christians has led to more attacks.” The army even assaulted two Coptic monasteries, supposedly to enforce discriminatory zoning laws (which prohibited walls erected for protection from attacks).



Overall, the transition regime’s record is dismal. Noted the Commission: “Since February 11, military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators. Implementation of previous court rulings — related to granting official identity documents to Baha’is and changing religious affiliation on identity documents for Christian converts — continues to lag. In addition, the government has not responded adequately to combat widespread and virulent anti‐​Semitism in the government‐​controlled media.”



Islamic extremists are responsible for what increasingly looks to be a campaign of intimidation. The World Evangelical Alliance’s Religious Liberty Commission explained that the attacks were “mostly incited by conservative Salafi Muslims,” who are using violence to mobilize Islamist support. Salafis also led opposition to the choice of a Christian to be governor of the Qena Governorate, leading to a suspension of the appointment, even though his predecessor was a Christian. Traditionally, the Salafis had remained aloof from politics, but no longer. Alas, they make the Muslim Brotherhood appear moderate.



Nina Shea fears “what we’re seeing in Egypt today — namely, a reinvigorated effort by some of the country’s more radical Islamists to establish Egypt’s identity as a thoroughly Islamicized and Arabicized state.” The Copts “are the most visible bloc standing in the way of impatient jihadists and violent Salafis,” who therefore are accelerating their attacks.



The future looks increasingly bleak. Although there has been some pushback — Muslims rallied to help rebuild one of the destroyed churches — the vast majority of Egyptians express intolerance towards minority faiths. And Copts, as well as other Christians, are feeling the pressure.



The _Wall Street Journal_ entitled one article: “As Islamists Flex Muscle, Egypt’s Christians Despair.” It quoted Ayman Anwar Mitri, who was attacked by Islamists who cut off an ear and burned his apartment: “they kept saying: ‘We won’t leave any Christians in this country’.” No one was punished for the assault. One Salafi leader warned ominously: “Only those Christians who did something wrong should be fearful.” Mitri said simply: “Here, there is a war against the Copts.”



Shea worries about “a mass exodus” of Copts from Egypt if existing trends continue. In fact, the Egyptian media has reported an upsurge in Copts seeking to emigrate. Coptic human rights lawyer Naguib Gabriel said: “They are insisting on leaving Egypt because the risks of staying here are too great.” Iraq offers an ugly precedent, with the practical destruction of the large historic Christian community, which also precedes Islam. Syria has become the refuge for many Iraqi exiles, who fear that the overthrow of Bashar Assad could unleash similar violence there. The status of Christians and other religious minorities is growing ever more precarious throughout the Arab and broader Islamic world.



For the first time the USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern, which, if adopted by State, could lead to a variety of penalties. Still, Washington’s influence inevitably is limited. The Obama administration had no idea how to respond to Egypt’s upheaval, haphazardly offering support for Mubarak before exhibiting enthusiasm for the revolution — and its ever‐​changing stance had no effect on events on the street in any case.



Nevertheless, religious liberty should be part of the U.S. government’s official dialogue with existing regimes and revolutionary forces alike. Religious freedom is a bedrock form of human rights. This basic freedom of conscience acts as the proverbial canary in the mine. If peoples and governments are not willing to respect religious minorities, they are unlikely to tolerate political opponents. Religious extremism also acts as an efficient incubator for violence, including terrorism, as is increasingly evident in Pakistan. “There is no political vision to deal with these types of sectarian clashes,” admitted Emad Gad of the Cairo‐​based Al‐​Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.



While Washington cannot impose tolerance on the new Egypt, American officials can point to the danger posed by virulent Islamists to that nation’s future. If the radicals grow in influence, they are likely to sweep away more than the vulnerable Coptic population. They might take down the new political system, with dangerous consequences for Egypt and beyond. As Georgetown’s Thomas Farr testified before Congress last month: “There will be no real freedom in Egypt — period — and there will be no real stability in Egypt — period — unless there is full religious freedom in Egypt, not only for its Coptic minority but also for moderate and reformist Muslim voices.”



The Arab Spring risks turning into the Islamist Winter. The willingness to safeguard religious liberty has become a proxy for measuring the impact of the ongoing revolution. As go the Copts may ultimately go the rest of the Middle East.

 **Franklin Local Board (Pukekohe subdivision)**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



In 2016, all four positions on this subdivision were held by Team Franklin.  




[ **Karnail Badhan**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=868e41e3-e09c-42d6-bdd1-217f3bdcd5f8&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Independent **$**



I cannot over-stress the importance of running a grammar check on anything of importance that you write. Karnail didn’t do that with his profile statement. It’s hard to decipher exactly what he hopes to achieve. Were I not writing a voting guide, I’d have moved on long before reaching his swipe at Team Franklin down the bottom.



Badhan received a QSM for services to the Indian community in 2016 and has been the Head of the Ambedkar Sports & Cultural Club for 24 years. This is [Ambedkar](https://youtu.be/fz_0OHs7GjE?t=1021). It makes less sense to me than Aussie Rules but it is literally the first I’ve ever heard of it.



[ **Andy Baker**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=03d1a869-6125-4cbd-95ed-cd0dc289f173&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin **$$$$**



Andy Baker and the Baker family have a long history of involvement in local politics in Franklin, with Andy seeking a fourth term on the Franklin Local Board.



It is clear that significant growth is inevitable in Pukekohe and the Franklin region as a whole. Baker’s optimistic and constructive approach to working with Panuku is refreshing, in stark contrast to many other small-town NIMBY’s on the outer-edge of Auckland.



It means as well as embarking on a massive regeneration project for Pukekohe township, sales of Council land will also be reinvested in the region to ensure infrastructure and amenities can keep up with the coming population explosion.



Aside from some griping over a $15,000 report by AT examining what should be done with a historic train station (with a full removal and refurbishment estimated to cost $2.7 million), Andy has been a key personality driving the open-minded and optimistic response to the opportunities ahead.



[ **Alan Cole**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b7afd6c8-6b14-4e10-b9ae-436688312216&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin **$$$$**



Alan is cut from a different cloth to Baker having farmed in the area for 37 years. As part of the Pukekohe Business Association, the Rural Advisory Panel and President of Auckland Federated Farmers, he knows his industry and community inside out.



Cole has previously also been involved in a 2016 working group looking at appropriate steps to regulate nitrate levels in rivers and creeks that cross the area. An earlier process in Waikato has proven an abysmal failure with a heavily regulated top-down approach resulting in protracted legal action. That situation has been avoided in Franklin due, in part, to the work done by the Franklin Nitrate Reference Group including Cole.



[ **Ian Cummings**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a8bd82cb-d77e-4c88-a1c8-45e7bf3ae782&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Independent **$$$$$**



The more candidates I review in Franklin ward, the clearer it becomes that they’re a different breed in the far south. No “climate emergency glasses” or high school boys channelling Jacinda Ardern around here. Just straight up, practical and genuine people stepping up for their neighbourhood.  
  
Cummings is most definitely one of those people. Having him on Franklin Local Board is the best insurance policy I can think of against colleagues who may be tempted to splash your money out on nonsensical vanity projects.



He will ensure value for every ratepayer dollar the board spends, make sure the Board’s activities are as public and transparent as possible and be the best watchdog against Council incompetence you could elect.



The safest, closest and friendliest neighbourhoods are those built from the bottom up by residents, volunteers and local businesses mucking in to support one another. Ian is one of those residents and absolutely deserves your vote!



[ **Baljit Kaur**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b5a0f84b-13e3-4f30-8684-7dd07e7bc411&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Labour Party 



Baljit is a perennial Labour candidate, having been thumped in the 2017 general election by Andrew Bayly by over 17,000 votes and finished almost last in the Botany subdivision of Howick Local Board in 2016. Not a resident of the Pukekohe subdivision, Kaur looks more like a window shopper than a genuine representative.



If elected to Local Board, she will embark on completely unrelated projects such as advocating for improved health. She doesn’t mince words when expressing her passion for social issues; this is the first candidate I’ve seen in this region pitching diversity as a reason to elect her to the board.



You’re not in Botany now Ms. Kaur.



[ **Amanda Kinzett**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e95a2874-3700-4383-8082-79e449595c6a&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin 



This is an unusual campaign pitch, almost entirely about the 12 years she spent working in Onehunga as the Town Manager. She doesn’t include anything she actually accomplished unless “great wins” counts? She manages to write a full sentence mentioning achievements three times without specifying what any of them are.  
  
The one practical thing she does mention is sitting. She does that most of the day. In traffic. Kinzett is very aware that this is a complete waste of time. She’s frustrated but is yet to find a solution other than standing for election to Franklin local board. 



Considering she also thinks the local community know what is best for them, I can’t see any scenario in which Kinzett adds value by sitting on your board.



[ **Dave Pope**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=846aa134-9f84-44c5-85bd-b24fd06f61cf&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Independent **$**



Pope has a photo news website [www.franklinlifenz.com](http://www.franklinlifenz.com/) I guess he chose photography because he clearly can’t write. Having lived overseas for some time has shown him the future of Pukekohe and it would appear he is pessimistic.



It looks like your local board funds will be channelled into nocturnal security guards driving around the streets, assuming there is any money left over following an inquiry into the linking of Nelson St and Golding Rd for the Bombay traffic bypass.



The two streets are very distant from each other, one is largely in the Waikato region and, despite how confused I am, I think I can work out that it is nothing the Local Board can achieve. AT might consult them. Consult…



I’m not convinced that anyone should conclude their pitch to voters with “A vote for him, is a vote for one of your own kind. (sic)” 



[**Logan Soole**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=c37af353-c3f4-41e6-83bf-eb8f14fd32f0&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin **$$$**



The departure of Niko Kloeten opened up a vacancy for Team Franklin token young person. Former Pukekohe High School Head Boy Logan Soole has filled that place.



His profile is very vague, with several phrases that could come from anywhere on the political spectrum. However, he is a keen community volunteer so as long as he doesn’t discover drugs are more fun than Board meetings, he should do OK.



 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** You may cast up to 4 votes in this FPP contest.

We have looked at [EV batteries](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/troy-runs-the-jag-off-the-road/) and [wind turbine blades](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/disposal-problem-number-two). Today let’s look at solar panels or photovoltaic panels (PV).



In May 2018, Michael Shellenberger, a Time Magazine “Hero of the Environment” and Green Book Award Winner, wrote in Forbes that the problem of solar panel disposal will explode with full force in two or three decades **and wreck the environment** because it is a huge amount of waste which is not easy to recycle.



We have known for years about the production process that results in tonnes of polluted sludge and contaminated water.



Before going bankrupt the US company Solyndra generated, in just four years, some 12.5 million pounds of hazardous waste, much of which was contaminated with carcinogenic cadmium.



Solar energy is clean and green. James said so!



The truth, however, does not care much about ideological blindness. 



The average lifespan of a solar panel is about 20 years, but high temperatures can accelerate the aging process for solar cells, and snow, dust, and other natural events (tornadoes, earthquakes), can cause material fatigue on the surface and in the internal electric circuits – gradually reducing the panel’s power output.



Solar panels generate **300 times more toxic waste per unit of energy than nuclear power plants.** They also contain lead, cadmium, and other toxic (even carcinogenic) chemicals that cannot be removed without breaking apart the entire panel. Worse, rainwater can wash many of these toxics out of the fragments of solar modules over time.



Another real concern is the vast increase in the use of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) in the construction of solar panels – up 1,057 percent over the past 25 years. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deems NF3 to be 17,200 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas – meaning that even relatively minor quantities can have major impacts.



  
Oh dear. For all those who believe the doom and gloom about greenhouse gases going to fry us all, this is a tad inconvenient.



Japan is also facing a growing solar waste problem. In a November 2016 article, Osamu Tomioka stated that Japanese solar panel waste will likely grow from the current 10,000 tons a year to 800,000 tons a year – and that just to recycle all of the waste produced through 2020 will take 19 years. How long will it take, and at what cost, to recycle 80 times that amount?



The simple truth is that it is past time for a real accounting of the overall costs to the public and to the environment of a massive increase in the use of solar panels as compared, for example, of increased reliance on non-intermittent technologies like nuclear energy and natural gas.

"**The number of residents to have died in a Covid outbreak at a south of Scotland care home has risen to eight.**
Dumfries and Galloway Health and Social Care Partnership reported the first cases at the Alma McFadyen Care Centre in Dalbeattie in early November.
A statement said there had now been a total of 42 positive cases associated with the outbreak.
The partnership said thoughts were with the families involved at this ""difficult time"".
It said the situation at the centre was now ""much improved"" but that did not mitigate the impact on residents and their relatives.
The partnership added that containing the spread of Covid was ""not at all easy - even when all the correct protocols are in place to address the virus""."
"A tragedy continues to unfold across the Amazon. Tens of thousands of fires are raging across the region, destroying large swathes of forest in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru. Unlike boreal forests, the Amazon is not adapted to fire, which means that burnt forests may take centuries to recoup the lost indigenous trees, wildlife and carbon-storing capacity. These fires are no accident. They are a result of the policies of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who since coming to power in January has weakened environmental protections in the region, slashed the budget of Brazil’s environmental protection agency by 95%, encouraged the clearing of land for agribusiness, failed to stem the illegal logging trade, and has called for the eradication of the near 1m indigenous people living within the forests.

      Amazon fires explained: what are they, why are they so damaging, and how can we stop them?


 So if politicians normally entrusted to rectify situations like these are instead making them worse, what can be done to stop the Amazon burning? The fires in South America are not your fault, but it is now time for all of us to apply pressure to change the way we look after our planet, and the future of life on Earth. Here are eight things you can do to combat the fires. The Rainforest Action Network has been working since 1993 to protect the Amazon one acre at a time. Its Protect An Acre grants have helped to support more than 200 front-line communities and indigenous-led organisations as they work to protect millions of acres of forest around the world. Protect An Acre helps local activists regain control of sustainably managed traditional territories, and fight against human rights abuses frequently associated with logging, pulp and paper mills, mining and other extractive industries. Similarly, the Rainforest Trust works with communities to buy land to protect it from logging, mining, and slash and burn agribusiness. You can support its work by buying some land and helping it to support local communities in preserving the Amazon for future generations.  Bolsonaro’s racist policies and anti-indigenous rhetoric have emboldened those who seek profit at the cost of indigenous rights and livelihoods. Amazon Watch works on behalf of and with indigenous allies, providing direct funding and support to help them defend their territories and their rights, for example by lobbying governments, exposing destructive corporations, and training indigenous communities. This work will continue to be important long after the fires are out – Bolsonaro is on record as saying the 900,000 indigenous inhabitants of Brazil should not have even a millimetre of space. While many of the fires have been set to clear land for agribusiness, setting fires is also part of the process of extracting timber. Large areas are often burned to access trees for felling or to create access to other areas of the forest. Reducing the amount of paper and wood we use is a good way to help reduce commercial pressures on the Amazon, as well as other forests. Where it’s harder to reduce consumption, look for rainforest safe products with the help of the Rainforest Alliance. Consider more carefully what you eat. Beef is especially destructive, as it requires huge amounts of land for grazing – space often created through the burning of forests. Cattle ranching accounts for about 80% of the forest cleared in the Amazon. An area the size of Ireland has also been cleared for growing soybean, which is then exported as cattle feed to support the beef industry around the world. Many of us find it hard to go fully vegan, but even reducing cheese, beef and pork consumption, and throwing away less can all help to reduce the intense pressures food habits place on forests and other ecosystems. Think about how you vote. Strongman nationalism and right wing politics are usually bad for the planet and the environment, and the fires are no exception. Avoid politicians who support deregulation, extraction and subsidy of fossil fuel resources, and who are more accountable to corporations than to those who have elected them.

      Amazon fires: Jair Bolsonaro faces mounting political backlash in Brazil – even from his allies


 Most of us can’t vote in Brazil, but our own politicians have shown that they are complicit in their lack of action. The US$22m in aid offered by the EU (and intially rejected by Bolsonaro) to fight the fires pales in comparison to the UK’s US$50 billion defence budget, for example. Wherever you are, vote for someone with enough ambition to stand up for protecting the planet rather than their job, or corporate interests. Voting doesn’t happen too often, so we need to get political between votes. Write to or call your representative. Tell them that they must use their position to put pressure on your own and other governments to take action. The EU’s recently signed trade deal with Mercosur, an economic bloc including Brazil, has yet to be ratified, and Ireland and France are already using this to leverage action on deforestation. More could do the same. You could also put your name to collective actions, like this petition from Greenpeace. And if you can, join a protest to show those in power that we want to safeguard the planet. Perhaps the most important way we can really leverage our weight is by challenging corporations. Companies, not individuals, are the most destructive force on the planet. We can hit those who contribute to the Amazon’s downfall in the pockets by not buying their products – organisations like Ethical Consumer can help you make informed decisions about what to buy, and who to avoid. We can call them out on social media. We can tell our representatives that we want them properly regulated, and punished when they don’t comply.

Our energy and environment deserve better – in South Africa and Qatar
Guest post by Dr. Kelvin Kemm
A few weeks ago, perhaps as a prologue to the “global warming disaster” convention in Doha, Qatar, South Africa’s Department of Environment Affairs took out a full-page advertisement in our country’s newspapers, promoting National Marine Week.

The ad showed a map of the Antarctic continent, from above the pole, surrounded by the vast blue Southern Ocean. It also promoted South Africa’s new Antarctic research vessel, SA Agulhas II.
The advertisement’s text mentioned the massive Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which is responsible for distributing vital nutrients to the world’s oceans. It noted that the truly massive quantities of phytoplankton found in the ocean are vital marine building blocks in ocean processes. All that is true, and I certainly applaud efforts to protect the environment and promote National Marine Week and our country’s research efforts.
But then, sadly, the ad’s discussion of physics content went off the rails. Referring to phytoplankton, it said “these microscopic creatures also use carbon to create energy.” Wrong!  
The most basic law of thermodynamics says energy is neither created nor destroyed, but merely converted from one form to another. The only way to “create” energy is via a nuclear process, whereby matter is converted to energy in a nuclear reaction, as Einstein famously postulated over a century ago. Nuclear processes operate outside the laws of thermodynamics, but there is certainly no nuclear process going on in phytoplankton.
I could have lived with that slip up in the physics. But it got worse – much worse. The ad went on to blame global warming for upsetting the phytoplankton. In a declaration straight out of Alice in Wonderland, it asserted: “The increase in surface temperature over Antarctica from climate change is having a catastrophic knock-on effect, depleting phytoplankton stocks, melting the Antarctic ice sheet and causing an alarming reduction in all marine life.”
First, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no “alarming reduction in all marine life.” None of my colleagues are aware of it. Second, the surface temperature over Antarctica is not increasing.
In fact, a new record has just been attained. Antarctic sea ice has just reached an all-time record for total acreage. Day 265 of the year 2012 set an all time record, and then on day 266 that record was broken. The days 265 to 270 were the six highest Antarctic sea ice extent days of all time.
The environment department then compounded these errors by committing the unforgivable scientific sin of claiming a supposed increase in surface air temperature over Antarctica “is having a catastrophic knock-on effect” – then providing no evidence to back up its assertion and not telling readers what the alleged knock-on effect is.
I cannot even begin to imagine how this knock-on is supposed to alter the Circumpolar Current, which in turn is somehow supposed to affect the “energy creation” capabilities of phytoplankton. Come off it, folks.
There is so much good Antarctic science to be proud of – and, for that matter, really fine South African scientific achievements in the Antarctic to brag about. That the DEA would feel compelled to celebrate National Maritime Week by resorting to phytoplankton scares supposedly related to nonexistent Antarctic heating is beyond mystifying.
Meanwhile, over the last few months, newspaper stories have told of reduced sea ice extent at our planet’s other pole, the Arctic. Terms like “alarming rate” of ice depletion were bandied about casually. Yes, there were reductions in Arctic sea ice cover.
However, on September 18, a video posted by NASA on its website showed that a large and long lasting Arctic cyclone “wreaked havoc on the Arctic sea ice cover,” by “breaking up sea ice.” The unusual reduction in Arctic sea ice cover was due to high winds – not to any warming of the Arctic or global warming in general. NASA’s belated analysis demonstrated that a large section of ice north of the Chukchi Sea was cut off by the churning storm, broken up and pushed south into warmer waters, where it melted.
The storm also broke up other ice, accelerating drifting and melting elsewhere. Reuters finally reported that “NASA says a powerful cyclone formed off the coast of Alaska in early August and moved toward the centre of the Arctic Ocean, weakening the already thin sea ice as it went.”
NASA noted that this was an “uncommon event” and that there have been only about eight storms of similar strength during August in 34 yearsof satellite records. However, a major storm every four years is not all that “uncommon.” Paul A. Newman, Chief Scientist for Atmospheric Sciences at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, added that such wind disturbances produce many effects and can also lift warmer water from the depths of the Arctic Ocean up to the surface to accelerate melting.
For some reason – probably having to do with its regular promotion of “dangerous manmade global warming” claims – the storm story was barely mentioned in the mainstream popular media. By contrast, the “alarming ice cover reduction” narrative was covered extensively.
Now jump back in time five years, to December 12, 2007. On that date Associated Press writer Seth Borenstein distributed an article that stated: “An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly accelerated this summer – a sign that some scientists worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping point. One scientist even speculated that summer sea ice could be gone in five years.”
Well, five years have come and gone. Borenstein was dead wrong. Does anyone suppose the AP will now publish an apology, admitting that its “science writer” was on thin ice when he made this outlandish statement, and saying he should not have tried to scare thepublic like that?
Perhaps the answer can be found in Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.
“There’s no use trying,” Alice said. “One can’t believe impossible things.” “I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”
Especially with the Doha climate change confab in full swing, taxpayers, newspaper readers – and anyone dreaming of a better life through reliable, affordable energy – deserves more honest reporting and more science-based energy and environmental policies than they have been getting.

Despite pledges to cut spending by the new Republican House majority, it appears spending during the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, will actually be greater than in fiscal 2011. The House Republicans were filled with good intentions, but they got snookered by President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Foolmeonce, shameonyou. Foolmetwice, shameonme.



The Tea Party crowd and other Americans who believe in fiscal responsibility are unlikely to be tolerant of and re—elect Republicans who are so incompetent that they cannot reduce federal spending and continue to fund programs that most of their voters oppose. The Constitution is clear. Article I, Section 9 states, “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” That is, only Congress can authorize the spending of money.



It is true that the Republicans only control one half of Congress, the House, and that many of the Senate Democrats want higher spending, so the House Republicans are not going to be able to get all of the spending reductions they wish. But it also is true that the House Republicans can insist on reductions in overall spending and, particularly, get rid of unpopular and nonessential programs as a price for passing any of the necessary appropriations bills.



The Republicans allowed themselves to get snookered last year by not insisting on the “regular order,” whereby both the House and Senate are required to pass a budget resolution that sets the framework for overall spending. The various appropriations committees then are supposed to make their spending decisions within the limits set by the budget resolution. The House dutifully complied with the Budget Act and passed a budget resolution. The Senate did not — in fact, it has been three years since the Democrat—controlled Senate passed a budget resolution. Without a binding budget resolution signed onto by both houses of Congress, the appropriators basically had free rein, which is exactly what the majority of Democrats wanted.



The president and many of the Democrats demonstrate time and time again that they care little about the rules or the Constitution. Just last week, Mr. Obama made clearly unconstitutional “recess” appointments even though the Senate was not in recess. As former Attorney General Ed Meese and Todd Gaziano of the Heritage Foundation wrote: “If Congress does not resist, the injury is not just to its branch but ultimately to the people. James Madison made clear that the separation of powers was not to protect government officials’ power for their sake, but as a vital check on behalf of individual liberty. To prevent future tyrannical usurpations of power, Congress must act to redress this serious threat to our liberty.”



Again, Congress still has control of the purse, and even the big—spending senators cannot force an appropriation if the House majority does not approve it. Therefore, the Republican leaders must make it clear to the president, Democrats in the Senate and the American people that they will not approve any spending for programs or people that operate against the best interest of America or operate outside what is constitutionally permissible.



Republicans should prepare a specific list of spending non—starters and make it known to all. They need to be clear that if any of the items are contained in a future appropriations bill or continuing resolution, they will make sure it is defeated. The list should contain only those items that would cause the president to have a politically impossible public—relations problem if he threatened to veto the specific appropriation bill or continuing resolution and thereby shut down the government if the items were not included.



Republicans could start by insisting that no expenditure for salaries could be made for people not properly appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate as called for in the Constitution — that is, phony, non—recess appointments would not be funded.



A number of the international organizations for which the United States provides major support have gone rogue and spent monies on programs of which most fiscally responsible Americans disapprove (or would disapprove it they knew about them). These programs should be cut. Examples are the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (which ignores much sound science), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Fiscal Affairs Committee (which is attempting to create a high tax cartel) and possibly the International Monetary Fund, which keeps flirting with bailing out European economic mismanagement.



The GOP and others have rightly complained about regulatory excess, but they need to put some teeth in these complaints by refusing to allow funding for regulations that have not been justified by a truly independent cost—benefit analysis, so the Environmental Protection Agency could not get away with unnecessarily attempting to shut down many needed power plants. The cost—benefit requirement also should be applied to the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury so they could not continue such outrages as making it almost impossible for Americans living abroad to get bank accounts and driving hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign capital out of the United States.



Republicans may not be able to reduce spending greatly until they have control of both houses of Congress, but they can stop specific spending programs that have little or no popular support and do great damage. They need to insist on the regular order and provide their list of non—starters now and not wait until the next budget crisis when, once again, they are likely to get snookered.

"**A village in Stirling was left without internet access for several days after a lorry crashed into a telegraph pole.**
The vehicle - owned by a contractor for Stirling Council - left ""significant damage"" following the incident on Thursday.
Broadband was affected for the majority of residents in Brig o' Turk and some properties in Invertrossachs.
Openreach carried out a temporary fix but a small number of households are still disconnected.
One local resident told BBC Scotland the Ripple Retreat - a respite centre for families affected by cancer - had also been impacted by the damage.
In an email to Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon, the woman described the significant impact on the community as poor mobile reception left many households ""without an alternative"".
She said: ""As a result, local children are unable to effectively revise for their preliminary exams, with most revision resources being online.
""Elderly people and other people vulnerable to Covid-19 are unable to shop for groceries online, leaving them with no safe means of accessing essential items.
""Rural businesses already struggling with the impact of the virus and its mitigation measures are unable to connect with customers or conduct necessary work online.
""People working from home during this crisis have unable to complete any online work.""
The Scottish government said it was investigating the issue ""as a matter of urgency"" given the impact on the community.
A spokeswoman said: ""Digital connectivity has proven to be vital during the last few months, whether supporting our health and emergency services or in enabling people to work or study from home and stay connected to friends and family.""
Openreach said the crash damaged overhead wiring and ripped up copper and fibre cables from the ground - the fibre cable supplies broadband to the majority of residents in the area.
Several days later engineers installed temporary fibre cables to restore service to the majority of households.
A spokeswoman for the firm said the pole and new aerial cables would be installed on Wednesday.
She said: ""We're really sorry for the disruption to broadband, which was beyond our control on this occasion.
""Anyone experiencing loss of service should report it to their service provider, who will arrange for Openreach to investigate further.""
Stirling Council said it was aware of the incident and the matter was under investigation."

Advice



Probably satirical.



It has long been claimed that increasing CO2 is warming the planet. But what causes this increasing CO2? We have been told that it is the evil ‘fossil’ fuels that are at fault.



However, new research has come to light that shows that there is a much stronger correlation with the CO2 growth: Population growth.



In light of this startling new evidence, the Irritating Persons Claiming Crisis (IPCC) are recommending that populations immediately be reduced to 1.5% above pre-industrial levels. At 2% above pre-industrial levels, humanity is doomed, they claim.



Taking all this very seriously, our local Green Party has proposed the Zero Population Bill, which seeks to make the NZ population neutral by 2050. When ‘population’ is referred to in the Bill, it is not only the human population that the Greens are concerned about: The population of animals on our farms will also come under these new regulations.



The net-zero population proposals have a number of benefits, fewer cars on the roads, fewer people travelling to work so less need for expensive and inefficient public transport. No need for trams down Dominion Road; no need for a bullet train service from Hamilton to Auckland (or somewhere near Auckland, anyway).



Clearly, with the Zero Population Act in force, the Emissions Trading Scheme will no longer be required as surrogate births will be illegal.



The Zero Population Act will set separate targets and pathways for long-lived populations (mainly geriatrics) and short-lived populations (mainly idiot drivers). Long-lived populations must go to net-zero by 2050 or sooner (accounting for natural attrition). Short-lived populations must be significantly reduced to sustainable levels, but not zero. This is usually achieved by Darwin Award winners and the like. 



The Zero Population Act will establish an independent Population Commission, consisting of 6 – 10 experts appointed by Parliament. The Commission has two main functions:



The Act will ensure New Zealand’s zero population transition is fair and cost-effective. The Act will honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Government must take into account a range of factors when setting population budgets, including environmental and social impacts, business competitiveness and inter-generational equity. 



The Zero Population Act framework is uniquely suited to cross-party agreement. It sets out legally mandated outcomes and process, without prescribing specific policies. It combines long-term clarity on policy direction with flexibility in its delivery.



The Zero Population Act will commit New Zealand to net zero population by 2050 or sooner. Getting to zero population in this timeframe will require broad political commitment, immediate action, and coherent long-term planning.



Getting to zero population by 2050 is possible, necessary, and will be beneficial for New Zealand.



Two recent reports have shown feasible options and pathways for New Zealand to transition away from population-intensive living. These reports are available somewhere on the internet. Read the benefits of transitioning to zero population.



The transition to zero population is inevitable, and already underway in many countries. Under the Paris Agreement, the world has agreed to a net-zero emissions future. Net-zero emissions is a prerequisite for net-zero population.



Starting our transition without delay will minimise costs and create benefits for New Zealand. 



_Note: Much of this was lifted from official sites by simply replacing the word ‘carbon’ with ‘population’. Both scenarios are equally stupid._

"A Florida man who admitted that he had  burned a mosque attended by Omar Mateen, the gunman behind the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla.  last year, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison. The man, Joseph Schreiber, 32, pleaded no contest  —   effectively a guilty plea  —   during a hearing on Monday in St. Lucie County. Mr. Schreiber, who had a previous criminal record and who had posted   views on social media, told detectives he set fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, which in 2016 also fell on Eid   an important Muslim holiday, Assistant State Attorney Steve Gosnell said. The mosque was so badly damaged  —   photos published online show a gaping hole in the roof and an interior burned to a crisp  —   that it is expected to be relocated. The mosque, about an hour’s drive north of Palm Beach, was occasionally attended by Mr.  Mateen, the Islamic State supporter who shot and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Mr. Mateen was killed by police officers responding to the mass shooting. Before Mr. Schreiber was sentenced, he read aloud a lengthy statement in which he said the arson had been driven by anxiety, not hate. Florida, he said, could be targeted in another terrorist attack. “My message is this to all the Muslim communities on the face of the Earth: Make peace with America and make peace with Israel and stop the killings, stop the attacks,” he said. Mr. Gosnell, the prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Schreiber had told detectives that he believed Muslims were “trying to infiltrate our government” and that “the teaching of Islam should be completely illegal. ” Mr. Schreiber’s sentence was based on his previous criminal record and on arson evidencing prejudice, essentially a hate crime in Florida, the prosecutor said. The Sunni mosque is central to Islamic life in Fort Pierce, but it has drawn scrutiny in recent years as a place of worship for young men who staged terror attacks. In addition to the connection with Mr. Mateen, the Islamic Center had been a frequent stop for Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who carried out a suicide bombing in 2014 in Syria. The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said the men had known each other casually."

I get an encouraging volume of feedback publishing these reviews. Some people disagree at times and give me their own angle on the candidates. Occasionally a candidate will express displeasure about their own rating but even then, the feedback is communicated politely which I really appreciate and don’t always deserve.   




Near the beginning of this project, I rated the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board (East Coast Bays subdivision) and missed someone from the list: Independent candidate **Victoria Short.** Several people pointed this out rather quickly. I resolved to be more careful from now on. Weeks later, supporters of Victoria are still politely asking me to look at this again, suggesting that she would actually be a far better candidate than others I had recommended.  
  
Given the support Victoria Short has from a wide selection of residents in East Coast Bays, I decided to swallow my embarrassment and have another look before voting papers start going out to letter boxes. Victoria Short has worked as an electorate agent for 6 years for a local MP, while Alexis Poppelbaum, listed above Short in voting guides, has also mentioned working in Murray McCully’s electorate office.   




I can see how I’ve made this mistake and, based on what I know now, think it would be an injustice to do nothing.  




 **Hibiscus and Bays Local Board (East Coast Bays subdivision): TAKE 2!**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



There are 11 candidates standing for four positions. You may cast up to four votes in this FPP election.  




 **Edward Benson-Cooper** – Independent **$**  




A chiropractor currently serving on the Waitemata District Health Board. It ran a deficit of nearly $15 million in 2018. 



Moving along…



 **Christina Bettany** – Backing the Bays **$$**



Has served one term. From her profile:



“I am passionate about our environment so have taken a special interest in sedimentation, recycling and waste management. I have been an active supporter of our local environmental groups in their planting and pest-free programmes as well as stream restoration initiatives.”



Sounds fine.



“I take climate change issues seriously.”



You bloody had to add that, didn’t you.



Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a climate change denier. I’m a climate change is a role for Auckland Council denier.



 **James (Jim) Brown** – Independent **$$$$$**



Doesn’t look like he shortened his name out of frustration at people [asking if he was related to the singer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI1NfFExOSo)



“His concerns for the area include Transport and deterioration of Infrastructure. ‘Our community has outgrown its facilities and we’ve overreached our support network’. He can’t promise to fix these problems, but what he can offer is a focus on practical solutions using logic, a common-sense attitude, a willing ear and an open mind.”



That sounds just sensible enough for me to pretend I didn’t see common-sense mentioned.



 **David Cooper** – Independent **$$**



A current local board member. I’m curious as to why the 2016 People over Politics ticket is no more. Maybe it is the hollow ring of ‘People Before Profit’ which always results in no profit for the people.



He has a background in infrastructure engineering and strongly supports openness and transparency, having voted for the unsuccessful motion to open up local board workshops to public view.



I’m told Cooper is a keen golfer. A very keen golfer. Judging by the way he allegedly organises his diary, golf is a higher priority than local board meetings. But I couldn’t possibly speculate…



 **Elizabeth Hall**



Hall is concerned that every day items are not always available locally and believes that with new apartment buildings and rest homes, the town centres need diverse well stocked shops.  
  
Doesn’t go on to advocate Hibiscus Coast and Bays Local Board run supermarkets but she doesn’t really need to.



 **Gary Holmes** – Backing the Bays **$$**



Currently serving on the local board, Holmes has been accused of a conflict of interest for managing four Business Improvement Districts; the Glen Innes, Uptown, Dominion Road and North West business associations – through his company Campaigns Ltd.



In 2013, when six storey apartments were proposed for Browns Bay, [Gary Holmes accused planners and councillors of using Browns Bay](http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/8362530/High-rise-plans-are-flawed-says-councillor) “like a token in their game of Monopoly where they are trying to see how many people they can squeeze into the small seaside suburb”.



However Holmes has been only too happy to advocate for high-rises in the [BIDS that his company manages.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106665885/auckland-council-agencys-posh-apartment-plan-knocked-back)



 **Julia Parfitt** – Backing the Bays **$$$$**



Should Julia be unsuccessful in her candidacy for Albany ward, she will romp home for the local board.



 **Susana Perez** – Independent **$$$**



Perez moved to New Zealand in 1996 and has been involved in multiple charity groups including the East Coast Bays Lions. She is interested in improving road safety and the provision of adequate lighting on roads. Her interest in improving recycling is outside the proviso of local board but appears to be standing for the first time, so I think that can be overlooked.



 **Alexis Poppelbaum** – Backing the Bays **$$$$$**



Having worked as a senior staffer to Murray McCully, Poppelbaum may well be very effective if current East Coast Bays MP Erica Stanford is a measure of the talent McCully’s former office contains. A policy Analyst at PHARMAC and Communications Manager at the Brain Health Research Centre and experience in planning and preparing multi-million dollar budgets.  
  
Take my vote!



 **Victoria Short** – Independent **$$$$$**



Victoria is a life-long East Coast Bays resident and with six years experience liaising with Council and central government supporting an electorate MP, she will know the system inside out. If elected for her first term, Short will hit the ground running with the knowledge and abilities to match many incumbents. Victoria is familiar with the speed at which the area is growing and recognises the urgent need for East Coast Bays to invest in additional infrastructure to cope as well as upgrading existing facilities.



She also wants to improve engagement between residents and the local board so that those who want to be involved in decision making have the opportunity to be heard.



Based on the feedback I’ve had from residents and elected representatives of East Coast Bays and beyond, Short is hard-working and very knowledgeable. Her excellent engagement with parliamentary constituents really speaks for itself, when so many locals have spoken on her behalf to fix her omission from the original article.



 **Glen Stanton** – Independent **$**



Glen is also standing for the Upper Harbour Local Board. He wants the beaches cleaned up and coastal walkways upgraded. His dream project is a World Class walkway from Browns Bay to Takapuna.  
  
Could that be a legacy project with a third-world class price tag?



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You get four votes

"Tree planting has been widely promoted as a solution to climate change, because plants absorb the climate-warming gases from Earth’s atmosphere as they grow. World leaders have already committed to restoring 350m hectares of forest by 2030 and a recent report suggested that reforesting a billion hectares of land could store a massive 205 gigatonnes of carbon – two thirds of all the carbon released into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.  Many of those trees could be planted in tropical grassy biomes according to the report. These are the savannas and grasslands that cover large swathes of the globe and have a grassy ground layer and variable tree cover. Like forests, these ecosystems play a major role in the global carbon balance. Studies have estimated that grasslands store up to 30% of the world’s carbon that’s tied up in soil. Covering 20% of Earth’s land surface, they contain huge reserves of biodiversity, comparable in areas to tropical forest. These are the landscapes with lions, elephants and vast herds of wildebeest. Savannas and grasslands are home to nearly one billion people, many of whom raise livestock and grow crops. Tropical grassy biomes were the cradle of humankind – where modern humans first evolved – and they are where important food crops such as millet and sorghum originated, which millions eat today. And, yet among the usual threats of climate change and wildlife habitat loss, these ecosystems face a new threat – tree planting. It might sound like a good idea, but planting trees here would be damaging. Unlike forests, ecosystems in the tropics that are dominated by grass can be degraded not only by losing trees, but by gaining them too.

      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Increasing the tree cover in savanna and grassland can mean plant and animal species which prefer open, well-lit environments are pushed out. Studies from South Africa, Australia and Brazil indicate that unique biodiversity is lost as tree cover increases. This is because adding trees can alter how these grassy ecosystems function. More trees means fires are less likely, but regular fire removes vegetation that shades ground layer plants. Not only do herbivores like zebra and antelope that feed on grass have less to eat, but more trees may also increase their risk of being eaten as predators have more cover. More trees can also reduce the amount of water in streams and rivers. As a result of humans suppressing wildfires in the Brazilian savannas, tree cover increased and the amount of rain reaching the ground shrank. One study found that in grasslands, shrublands and cropland worldwide where forests were created, streams shrank by 52% and 13% of all streams dried up completely for at least a year. Grassy ecosystems in the tropics provide surface water for people to drink and grazing land for their livestock, not to mention fuel, food, building materials and medicinal plants. Tree planting here could harm the livelihoods of millions.  Losing ancient grassy ecosystems to forests won’t necessarily be a net benefit to the climate either. Landscapes covered by forest tend to be darker in colour than savanna and grassland, which might mean they also absorb more heat. As drought and wildfires become more frequent, grasslands may be a more reliable carbon sink than forests.

      Exaggerating how much CO₂ can be absorbed by tree planting risks deterring crucial climate action


 How have we reached the point where the unique tropical savannas and grasslands of the world are viewed as suitable for wholesale “restoration” as forests? At the root of the problem is that these grassy ecosystems are fundamentally misunderstood. The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN defines any area that’s half a hectare in size with more than 10% tree cover as forest. This assumes that landscapes like an African savanna are degraded because they have fewer trees and so need to be reforested. The grassy ground layer houses a unique range of species, but the assumption that forests are more important threatens grassy ecosystems across the tropics and beyond, including in Madagascar, India and Brazil. “Forest” should be redefined to ensure savannas and grasslands are recognised as important systems in their own right, with their own irreplaceable benefits to people and other species. It’s essential people know what degradation looks like in open, sunlit ecosystems with fewer trees, so as to restore ecosystems that are actually degraded with more sensitivity.  Calls for global tree planting programmes to cool the climate need to think carefully about the real implications for all of Earth’s ecosystems. The right trees need to be planted in the right places. Otherwise, we risk a situation where we miss the savanna for the trees, and these ancient grassy ecosystems are lost forever."

NASA Discovers Unprecedented Blooms of Ocean Plant Life…
“Part of NASA’s mission is pioneering scientific discovery, and this is like finding the Amazon rainforest in the middle of the Mojave Desert,” said Paula Bontempi, NASA’s ocean biology and biogeochemistry program manager in Washington.
Or maybe it’s more like finding a lot of trees in a part of the Amazon rainforest where you never bothered to look for trees before. Sub-ice phytoplankton blooms are not exactly “unprecedented.”

Dense sub-ice bloom of dinoflagellates in the Baltic Sea, potentially limited by high pH

Abstract
The phytoplankton community, carbon assimilation, chlorophyll a (Chl a), pH, light and attenuation and inorganic nutrients were monitored under the ice in the coastal Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Maximum ice and snow thickness was 40 and 15 cm, respectively. Freshwater influence had created a halocline 1–2 m below the ice–water interface, and above this halocline, a dense bloom of dinoflagellates developed (max: >300 μg Chl a L−1). The photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide by this “red tide” increased the pH to a maximum of 9.0. The sub-ice phytoplankton community was dominated by the dinoflagellate Woloszynskia halophila (max: 3.6 × 107 cells L−1). The pH tolerance of this species was studied in a monoculture and the results indicate that pH >8.5 limits growth of this species at ambient irradiance. This study shows that primary productivity may raise the pH to growth limiting levels, even in marine, low-light environments where pH normally is not considered important.

INTRODUCTION
The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed, brackish ocean where ice is an important element of the ecosystem during winter. In the northern part of Baltic Sea and western part of Gulf of Finland, the probability of freezing is >90% and ice coverage normally lasts for 2–6 months (Mälkki and Tamsalu, 1985). There have been observations of dense, dinoflagellate dominated blooms under the ice in the Baltic Sea, but there is relatively little information about this phenomenon (Larsen et al., 1995; Haecky et al., 1998; Kremp and Heiskanen, 1999). These types of blooms are often called red tides because of the obvious discoloration of the water, but a cold-water red tide is very much in contrast to the main distribution and bloom patterns of dinoflagellates, which typically avoid winter and spring in temperate areas (Smayda and Reynolds, 2001).

Like a zombie rising from the grave to stalk the living, the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST) has haunted Washington for the last 30 years. President Ronald Reagan refused to sign and seemingly killed the omnibus agreement. But his successors revived the misnamed “constitution of the oceans.” There is talk of a renewed push for ratification by the Obama administration and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry.



LOST is one of the more obscure panaceas sold in Washington. If the issue is Chinese maritime assertiveness, Arctic oil exploration, or other maritime disputes, the answer is supposed to be LOST. Ratify the convention and international controversies will be magically resolved.



The convention is a complex, unwieldy document joining diverse ocean‐​related measures. LOST was fashioned when communism claimed to be gaining on capitalism, dictators of newly independent states asserted the international moral high ground, and income redistribution characterized Washington’s domestic policies.



Indeed, the convention was but one element of the “New International Economic Order” designed to promote global income redistribution, taking money from productive First World democracies and giving it to collectivist Third World autocracies. To this end, LOST established the International Seabed Authority (ISA), currently located in the hardship post of Jamaica, to regulate private ocean development, mine the seabed through an entity called “the Enterprise,” and subsidize favored nations and groups.



The ISA is a Rube Goldberg creation, with Assembly, Council, Tribunal, and assorted committees, commissions, and chambers. Most important are the rules. Complicated and seemingly endless, they were drafted to limit access to international resources and force the West to give money and technology to members of the so‐​called G-77, the once influential international lobby for Third World dictators (a few democracies lurked among the developing nations at the time, but not many).



Negotiations proceeded under Richard Nixon, who cared little about economics, and Jimmy Carter, who cared little about redistribution. But Ronald Reagan worried about both and refused to sacrifice U.S. sovereignty for the privilege of creating a mini‐​UN to mulct the American people. To the horror of international diplomats, bureaucrats, and activists, President Reagan refused to sign the final agreement in 1982.



Filled with moral indignation about capitalist outrages, the Soviet Union denounced the U.S., but also refused to sign. The Europeans emphasized their enduring love for their former colonies, which then dominated the G-77, and signed LOST—but refused to ratify the convention. Then, as collectivism collapsed throughout the communist and developing worlds, even Third World states increasingly admitted that President Reagan had been right. Private markets, not government diktats, were the key to prosperity.



Unfortunately, treaties attract U.S. diplomats like flames attract moths. It’s hard for the State Department to imagine an international agreement to which America is not part. So the Bush and Clinton administrations renegotiated the convention. The result was a set of amendments approved in 1994, which led most nations to accept the treaty.



Advocates spoke of having “fixed” the treaty. But they had not.



The document isn’t as terrible as before. However, only in Washington does “less bad” count as “good.”



Even the State Department acknowledged that the amended “Agreement retains the institutional outlines of” the original draft. That is, the convention’s principles and basic structure remained the same. Only some details changed.



Every regulatory body survived. The so‐​called “parallel system,” whereby Western miners subsidized the ISA’s Enterprise, persists. Private companies still must survey and provide free mining sites for the Enterprise. Financial redistribution to the Third World continues. The revised treaty, like the original, encourages public cartels while discriminating against American mining firms.



Taxpayers from wealthy states still pay for the privilege of being regulated by a Third World‐​dominated entity. If the U.S. joins it would become the deepest pocket to be picked. The ISA would even be entitled to revenue from oil development on America’s extended continental shelf.



Alas, the institutional safeguards against over‐​spending are limited and temporary. The Clinton administration put great store in exhortation. The 1994 amendments included Section 1, paragraph 3, pledging that “all organs and subsidiary bodies to be established under the Convention and this Agreement shall be cost‐​effective” and Section 5, paragraph 1(c), stating that the royalty “system should not be complicated and should not impose major administrative costs on the Authority or on a contractor.” No doubt, no one would ever violate such precepts.



One of the most important criticisms of the treaty was the mandatory transfer of proprietary mining technology. The revised LOST deleted one provision, but left another unchanged.



The ISA is directed to “promote and encourage the transfer to developing States of such technology and scientific knowledge.” Additionally, the Authority and member nations “shall initiate and promote” programs “for the transfer of technology to the Enterprise and to developing states,” including “facilitating the access of the Enterprise and of developing States to the relevant technology.”



Moreover, the amended text adds new language: “If the Enterprise or developing States are unable to obtain deep seabed mining technology, the Authority may request all or any of the contractors and their respective sponsoring State or States to cooperate with it in facilitating the acquisition of deep seabed mining technology.” What is to stop the ISA from interpreting the revised text to require technology transfers as LOST originally intended?



The potential for dubious “interpretation” is one of the convention’s greatest threats. The U.N. proclaimed that LOST is not “a static instrument, but rather a dynamic and evolving body of law that must be vigorously safeguarded and its implementation aggressively advanced.” Some treaty proponents forthrightly celebrate expansive litigation possibilities.



William C.G. Burns of the Monterey Institute of International Studies argued that LOST “may prove to be one of the primary battlegrounds for climate change issues in the future,” even though no one drafting the convention thought about temperature controls. Burns noted the Treaty’s expansive definition of marine pollution, writing that “the potential impacts of rising sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels, and changes in ocean pH as a consequence of rising levels of carbon dioxide in sea water” could “give rise to actions under the Convention’s marine pollution provisions.” If nothing else, he suggested, “the specter of litigation may help to deepen the commitment of States” to legislate on the issue.



U.S. courts might be obligated to enforce decisions under LOST. Annex III, Article 21(2) states that LOST tribunal decisions “shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.” In _Medillin v. Texas_ Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens contrasted the Vienna Convention—which the Court determined was not self-enforcing—with LOST, which he argued did “incorporate international judgments into international law.”



LOST supporters warn against discussing such possibilities. Bernard Oxman of the University of Miami acknowledged that the convention “is amply endowed with indeterminate principles, mind‐​numbing cross‐​references, institutional redundancies, exasperating opacity and inelegant drafting.” Thus, after release of the revised agreement he advocated “restraint in speculating on the meaning of the convention or on possible differences between the Convention and customary law” lest critics gain additional ammunition against ratification.



Other LOST supporters simply tell everyone what they think will sell. For instance, groups like World Wildlife Federation and Citizens for Global Solutions contend that LOST could stop Russia from polluting the Arctic. However, treaty proponents simultaneously insist that the agreement would not affect domestic American law. One treaty advocate admitted the contradiction in an email which inadvertently ended up in my hands, noting the consequent difficulty in allaying “conservative fears” of LOST being “some kind of green Trojan Horse.”



When treaty critics point to the continuing economic threat posed by LOST, its advocates try to repackage it as guarantor of America’s navigational freedom. In fact, on this narrow basis the U.S. Navy long has backed the treaty, which expanded territorial seas, created a large exclusive economic zone, and largely codified customary maritime freedoms.



An additional paper guarantee might be nice to have, but as Steven Groves of the Heritage Foundation noted in a recent study, “The navigational rights and freedoms enjoyed by the United States and the Navy are guaranteed not by membership in a treaty, but rather through a combination of long‐​standing legal principles and persistent naval operations.” In any case that really affected U.S. security—think naval transit during a period of crisis or in a war—LOST would not matter.



A country contemplating halting U.S. vessels would weigh its interest and capability, not the treaty’s provisions. Washington responding to foreign interference with navigation would do the same. Over the last couple centuries powerful naval powers, particularly Great Britain (Napoleonic Wars, War of 1812, World War I), Germany (World War I), and the U.S. (Civil War), routinely ignored the protests of neutrals and tramped underfoot customary international law and treaty obligations which restricted maritime operations during war.



Some LOST advocates nevertheless contend that only adherence to the convention will afford America the opportunity to prevent new restrictions on navigational freedom. However, noted Groves: “the evidence indicates that the navigational provisions … are already locked in to the extent that any aspect of international law can be. Indeed, the passage of time has demonstrated that nations—[LOST] members and nonmembers alike—have generally adhered to the convention’s navigational provisions in good faith and that those provisions have endured, not eroded.”



Of course, this doesn’t mean nations don’t sometimes make excessive territorial claims. They do, _even after ratifying the convention_.



Perhaps the area of greatest controversy is the South China Sea. China vehemently denounced U.S. intelligence activities 75 miles off of China’s Hainan Island and harassed the naval vessel concerned. Washington had the better legal argument, but Beijing’s LOST interpretation was not implausible. In this case only U.S. naval power offered certain, unambiguous protection of navigational freedom.



Beijing has been similarly asserting ownership of islands and control of waters against its neighbors, treaty members all. Nor have the Chinese worried about consistency, sending their survey ships into waters claimed by Japan. Two years ago Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee: “In the past several years, they have become more aggressive in asserting claims for the [EEZ] which are excessive under almost any international code.”



For years America has preserved its maritime freedoms through reliance on customary international law, negotiation with straits and archipelagic nations, and a strong navy. Concluded Groves: “By forgoing [LOST] membership, the United States is in no way hindering its ability to secure, preserve, or otherwise protect its navigational rights and freedoms.” While the convention’s navigation provisions are useful, they cannot justify accepting the rest of the text, most particularly the seabed mining regime.



LOST refuses to die, but it remains a bad deal for America. Despite the 1994 amendments, the convention’s redistributionist economic provisions remain flawed and Byzantine bureaucracy remains counterproductive. The treaty’s navigational guarantees, though much better in substance, are not essential. The U.S. Senate should vote against ratifying LOST and put the treaty out of its misery.

"If the Amazon keeps burning, what will happen? – Ibrahim, aged 12, Maryland, US. There have been a lot of fires in Brazil this year – about 76% more than there were during the same period last year. And just 48 hours after Brazil’s government put a ban on burning and land clearing, to help stop the fires spreading, satellite data found that 2,000 more fires started in the Amazon alone. The 2019 fires will have a big and long-lasting impact on the forest itself, and the wider world.  The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, and may be home to a quarter of the Earth’s land-bound species. If it keeps burning, it’s likely to turn into a completely different ecosystem, with fewer trees and different species of plants and animals. Many trees will die, and animals will lose their habitat – some species might disappear from the area entirely.

      Amazon fires explained: what are they, why are they so damaging, and how can we stop them?


 While the Amazon fires aren’t going to deplete the Earth’s supply of oxygen, they will release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) into the atmosphere. For example, when just 0.2% of the Amazon burned in 2016, it released 30m tons of CO₂ – that’s almost as much as Denmark emitted in 2018.  This is bad news, because as you probably know, CO₂ is a “greenhouse gas” that contributes to global warming and climate change – and humans are already creating dangerous amounts of it through energy use, transport and industry.  Even tropical, humid forests like the Amazon can catch fire easily during the dry season. Dry dead wood, branches and leaf litter build up on the forest floor, and after many days without rain, any spark is enough to start a wildfire. But that doesn’t mean the fires we’re seeing now are normal or natural.  I Need To Know is a series by The Conversation, which gives teenagers the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. Send your questions – along with your first name, age and the area where you live – to ineedtoknow@theconversation.com, or find out more ways to get in touch at the end of this article. Unlike other ecosystems – such as the African savannah, the Australian bush or the US conifer forests – which have evolved with fires over many thousands of years, the plants and animals living in the Amazon don’t have the traits needed to survive a big fire and regenerate after the blaze. This is because fires were not very common before humans settled in the area.  The trees in the Amazon have relatively thin bark, so during a fire, the heat can seriously damage the cells inside the tree, which eventually kills it. Previous research in the Amazon has found that more than 40% of trees die up to three years after a fire. This means that the carbon stored in their trunks, branches and leaves is released into the atmosphere, either while the fire is burning, or later as the dead trees decompose.  When large trees die due to fire, more sun and wind is let into the understorey (the sheltered layer below the canopy). And some plant species can regrow and sprout in the new, less shady conditions better than others. This in turn can attract more herbivores, such as leaf-cutting ants, agoutis and brocket deer. At the same time, the loss of plant species that produce fruit causes a decline in the populations of species that rely on them for food, including parrots and monkeys.  When humid forests like the Amazon burn for the first time, they can partially recover – but it’s not clear how long it would take them to recover fully, or if that’s even possible. For example, when I conducted research in an area of the Amazon 30 years after it was burned by wildfire, I found that even after all that time, the forest stocked about one quarter less carbon than it did before the fires.  This is mainly because most of the large, hardwood trees – which hold the greatest amount of carbon – died after the fire. And as the forest grows back, they are replaced by smaller trees, which are mainly softwood species. These smaller trees grow fast, but have a shorter lifespan (between five and 30 years) and don’t amass much carbon in their trunks.  It may take hundreds of years for the larger hardwood species to grow back and reach the forest canopy. Without any further disturbances, there’s a chance that the Amazon might return to its previous state – but not in our life time. And the world’s changing climate and ongoing deforestation mean that further fires are all too likely.  As fires become more frequent and intense, the chances of the rainforest recovering decline. Two or three fires can destroy the trees’ stock of seeds,  arresting the ecosystem into a non-forest state.  It’s likely that the fires across Brazil this year have been caused by deforestation to make way for cattle ranching and soy crops. The “slash-and-burn” approach – where people chop down trees, leave them to dry out, then burn them – is the cheapest tool for clearing forest in the Amazon. At the peak of the dry season, when rain is scarce, flames can escape into the forest. If left unchecked, wildfires can burn until they run out of fuel or are put out by the wet season rains. To protect the Amazon forest from new fires, the governments responsible for protecting it must clamp down on deforestation. But countries around the world that buy beef, leather and products from crops should demand that they are produced in an environmentally friendly way. And of course, global action on climate change is needed, to prevent droughts from getting worse and increasing the risk of more fires."
"WASHINGTON  —   Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration, don’t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president  —   a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans  —   might not really be one of them. “The country doesn’t need saving,” Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a   congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. “I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,” he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. “Our members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results. ” He added: “No matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid  —   from our perspective  —      things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done. ” Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president’s “drain the swamp” initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment  —   inside and outside Congress  —   have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. “Back during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,” Mr. McConnell recalled. “But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. “It is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell’s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and   as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. “We have had very good unity on our side,” Mr. McConnell said. “People are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don’t find any decision that he has made surprising. ” He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. “A lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?” Mr. McConnell said. “He used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center. ” It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president’s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell’s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. “It is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,” Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party’s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. “Sooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,” Mr. McConnell said. “Hopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then. ” His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the   congressional Republicans?"

A major new government campaign to convince companies to cut down on their carbon emissions has splashed the cash in a big-budget **one million dollar** production. 



The 90-second long ad opens with Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘I have a dream’ speech (which has NOTHING to do with carbon) and then shows more famous leaders like Dame Whina Cooper and Winston Churchill who also have NOTHING to do with carbon emissions. The cost of showing the ad just once during the lead-up to the All Blacks’ Rugby World Cup opener against the Springboks on Saturday night was **$19,000.**



“They all had their defining moment. Climate change is ours,” the ad concludes. 



Using iconic leaders like these to push the Labour-led coalition government’s carbon emission agenda is like using Jesus in an ad to promote halal products. 



The campaign’s logo is an adapted version of the ‘less than’ mathematical symbol. Clemenger BBDO hope it will be a rallying cry for people and businesses to make a commitment to lower their emissions.



Several major New Zealand businesses and organisations have bought into the virtue signalling hype: Westpac, Countdown, Lewis Road Creamery, NZ Post, and Stuff Ltd, which owns stuff.co.nz. are just some of them.



This is a massive waste of taxpayer money for virtue signalling companies. _Stuff_ has embraced it, so I hope _Stuff_ is going to turn off their massive neon signs on their building since they are telling us all to use less energy.



They may also want to stop printing their papers as well since making newsprint is a massively wasteful use of energy and creates pollutants too.



Since Countdown is also sticking up their hands to virtue signal, I hope we will see them reducing their energy use since they have all those Countdown trucks and big stores with massive electricity footprints.

"**An MP has called for the Home Office to urgently review conditions at an accommodation centre for asylum seekers which was hit by a Covid-19 outbreak.**
Urban House in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was forced to close in July after dozens of residents tested positive for the virus.
Sheffield Hallam MP Olivia Blake said not enough food or PPE equipment were being provided for residents.
The Home Office ""rejected these claims entirely"", a spokesperson said.
Ms Blake has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel urging her to review conditions at the centre, which is run by the Mears Group.
More stories from around Yorkshire
The Labour MP said: ""Despite Mears having a Â£1.15bn contract with the Home Office, volunteer groups including Yorkshire Refugee Foodbank are having to provide food, PPE, clothing and toys to Urban House residents due to Mears' failure to support them.
""Residents are being forced to share toilets and bathrooms, going long periods without access to soap, and struggling to access healthcare.
She added: ""I asked Home Secretary Priti Patel why Urban House was permitted to reopen when the conditions that led to a Covid-19 outbreak in July still remain, and called on her to urgently review Mears' operations during the pandemic, and the conditions residents have been subjected to.""
A Mears Group spokesman said: ""Mears have followed public health advice on the running of the facility throughout the pandemic.
""Urban House is operating with arrangements agreed with Wakefield Council's Public Health Department and PHE as well as in consultation with the Home Office.
""Arrangements include reduced capacity to support social distancing, no unrelated individuals sharing a room and health checks on site for new arrivals.""
He added three nutritionally-balanced meals a day were provided, and food ""is of good quality"".
A Home Office spokesperson said they ""entirely"" rejected the points raised by Ms Blake.
They added: ""The wellbeing of all those in the asylum system is taken extremely seriously, and we have taken many measures to reduce the risk of transmission in these unprecedented times, working closely with health partners in Wakefield throughout lockdown to ensure guidance is followed and will continue to do so.
""Asylum seekers have access to legal and medical support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year through the Migrant Help helpline, for support and advice.""
Following the Covid-19 outbreak, a report by the Commons Home Affairs Committee said the continued use of shared rooms in asylum accommodation made it ""extremely difficult"" for people to follow social distancing advice.
Campaigners South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) also said it had raised concerns of poor hygiene standards and the welfare of residents at Urban House.
Ms Blake is acting in her role as a member of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects.

Guest post by David M. Hoffer
In my first two articles on the leaked AR5 Chapter 11 (near-term projections) I looked at the caveats with which the IPCC is now surrounding their projections, and the lengths to which they are going to preserve the alarmist narrative. The caveats go to such ridiculous lengths that there is actually a quote suggesting that reality may well be within, above, or below the range projected by the models. Falsify that! To maintain the alarmist narrative , they characterize record ice extent in the Antarctic as a “slight increase” and make no mention in the executive summary of the projection buried deep in the report that tropical cyclones may decrease in frequency by as much as one third by 2100.
But what of their temperature projections? Do they say how much they expect it to warm up in the next few decades? They do. But these are the high stakes projections for the IPCC because, unlike most of their projections, these ones will be falsified (or not) within the life times of most of this readership. True to form, they’ve surrounded their temperature projections with caveats while taking an interesting approach to maintaining the alarmist narrative.
The projection is for between 0.4 and 1.0 degrees of warming for the period 2016-2035 compared to the period 1986-2005. Now normally when the IPCC gives a range, we expect that their “best guess” is in the centre of the range. But oddly we find this phrase in Chapter 11: 
[…] it is more likely than not that actual warming will be closer to the lower bound of 0.4°C than the upper bound of 1.0°C
In fact, they go out of their way elsewhere to suggest that the most likely outcome will be about 0.2 degrees per decade. With 2035 only a smidge over two decades away, how do they justify an upper bound 2.5 times their most likely scenario? While delving into this, I came across some rather interesting information. Here’s the graphs they provide with their projections for the beginning of the reference period (1986-2005) through to the year 2050:

Figure 11.33: Synthesis of near-term projections of global mean surface air temperature. a) 4 Projections of global mean, annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) 1986–2050 (anomalies relative to 1986–2005) under all RCPs from CMIP5 models (grey and coloured lines, one ensemble member per model), with four observational estimates (HadCRUT3: Brohan et al., 2006; ERA-Interim: Simmons et al., 2010; GISTEMP: Hansen et al., 2010; NOAA: Smith et al., 2008) for the period 1986–2011 (black lines); b) as a) but showing the 5–95% range for RCP4.5 (light grey shades, with the multi-model median in white) and all RCPs (dark grey shades) of decadal mean CMIP5 projections using one ensemble member per model, and decadal mean observational estimates (black lines). The maximum and minimum values from CMIP5 are shown by the grey lines. An assessed likely range for the mean of the period 2016–2035 is indicated by the black solid bar. The ‘2°C above pre-industrial’ level is indicated with a thin black line, assuming a warming of global mean SAT prior to 1986–2005 of 0.6°C. c) A synthesis of ranges for the mean SAT for 2016–2035 using SRES CMIP3, RCPs CMIP5, observationally constrained projections (Stott et al., 2012; Rowlands et al., 2012; updated to remove simulations with large future volcanic eruptions), and an overall assessment. The box 1 and whiskers represent the likely (66%) and very likely (90%) ranges. The dots for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 estimates show the maximum and minimum values in the ensemble. The median (or maximum likelihood estimate for Rowlands et al., 2012) are indicated by a greyband.
Is the first graph serious? 154 data plots all scrambled together are supposed to have some meaning? So I started to focus on the second graph which is presented in a fashion that makes it useful. But in examining it, I noticed that something is missing. I’ll give everyone 5 minutes to go back and see if they can spot it for themselves.
Tick
Tick
Tick
Did you spot it?
They hid the decline! In the first graph, observational data ends about 2011 or 12. In the second graph though, it ends about 2007 or 8. There are four or five years of observational data missing from the second graph. Fortunately the two graphs are scaled identically which makes it very easy to use a highly sophisticated tool called “cut and paste” to move the observational data from the first graph to the second graph and see what it should have looked like:

Well oops. Once on brings the observational data up to date, it turns out that we are currently below the entire range of models in the 5% to 95% confidence range across all emission scenarios. The light gray shading is for RCP 4.5, the most likely emission scenario. But we’re also below the dark gray which is all emission scenarios for all models, including the ones where we strangle the global economy.
It gets worse.
I did a little back of the envelope math (OK, OK, a spreadsheet, who has envelopes anymore these days?) and calculated that, assuming a linear warming starting today, we’d need to get to 1.58 degrees above the reference period to get an average of +1.0 over the course of the reference period itself. If my calcs are correct, extrapolating a straight line from end of current observations through 1.6 degrees in 2035 ought to just catch the top of that black bar showing the “Likely Range” in the centre of the graph:

Hah! Nailed it!
But now it is even worse for the IPCC. To meet the upper bound of their estimated range, the IPCC would need warming that (according to their own data) is below projections for all their models in all emission scenarios to suddenly increase to a rate higher than all their projections from all their models across all emission scenarios. In brief, the upper range of their estimate cannot be supported by their own data from their own models.
In fact, just based on their own graph, we’ve seen less than 0.4 degrees over the last 26 years or so, less than 2 degrees per century. That brown line I’ve drawn in represents a warming trend beginning right now and continuing through 2035 of 6 degrees per century, triple recent rates. Since the range in their own graph already includes scenarios such as drastic reductions in aerosols as well as major increases in CO2, there simply is no justification in their own data and their own models to justify an upper bound of 1.0 degrees.
That’s not to say it is impossible, I suppose it is possible. It is also possible that I will be struck by lightning twice tomorrow and survive, only to die in airplane crash made all the more unlikely by the fact that I’m not flying anywhere tomorrow, so that plane will have to come and find me. Of course with my luck, the winning Powerball ticket will be found in my wallet just to cap things off.
Is it possible? Sure. Is it likely?
Not according to their own data and their own models. The current version of IPCC AR5 Chapter 11 takes deception (intended or otherwise) to new heights. First, by hiding the fact that observational data lies outside the 95% confidence range of their own models, and second by estimating an upper range of warming that their own models say is next to impossible.

For this nation to survive as a self‐​governing republic, we need to motivate our public‐​school students to become active, knowledgeable, critical‐​thinking citizens.



Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York (a renowned education foundation), frames the challenge: “Today’s students must experience, debate, understand and argue about what it means to be a citizen. There is no better place to transmit the ideas — and the challenges — inherent in our democracy.



Showing what it takes for this to happen in schools is Diana Hess, a professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Wisconsin‐​Madison.



In “Discussions That Drive Democracy,” she insists: “Discussing controversies about the nature of the public good and how to achieve it is essential if we are to educate for democracy.”



Among the examples she gives: “Should the federal government grant amnesty to people living in the country without legal documents? Should my state guarantee health care to all its residents?”



These kinds of interactive discussions cannot come into being by teaching only for standardized tests. These are town meetings, of which there ought to be many more for adults, as well. In the classroom, Hess continues:



“Often, highly debatable issues are directly linked to the lives of students in our classrooms. Students need to recognize that their views matter — not because there is something special about young people, but precisely because there is not. Their views matter because all views matter in a democracy.”



She then emphasizes why now in America there is a special need for students to think about and express their views and become aware of other students’ questions and convictions.



American adults, she writes, “increasingly interact and socialize in ideologically homogeneous communities. … People increasingly talk primarily with people who already share their views, access media that reinforce what they already believe, and ruminate on what they hear within an echo chamber of like‐​mindedness.”



When I was teaching graduate‐​level journalism at New York University, I would begin by telling the students: “If you are a reader of _The Nation_ or _The New Republic_ or similar liberal publications, you must also become familiar with the views and news analyses in _The National Review_ and _The Weekly Standard_.”



I also gave each student pocket‐​size editions of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence because both of those founding documents should often be in the rhythm section of the symphonies that are our classroom discussions and debates.



Were I still teaching, the required‐​reading list would begin with the book _Controversy in the Classroom_ (Routledge, 2009) by Diana Hess. In her introduction, she tells of visiting a U.S. history class “at a public charter school in a large Midwestern city.” Involved in a debate on whether abortion should be legal or illegal in the United States were 19 juniors: “Half were African‐​American, the other half Latino — a composition that mirrored almost exactly the student population of the school. Almost all of the students were from poor families with only one parent or guardian at home.



“The students were not engaging in the class discussions to win over or beat up on their peers.” Speaking of their teacher, one student told her: “Mr. Dunn really gives us a chance to say what we beleive and he gives us space to voice our opinions. His classroom gives us space so our opinions aren’t shut out … (and) where we can all work together and figure out a problem. … I enjoy it a lot.”



As rocky as our economy is and will continue to be for some time, there is no financial cost in bringing active democracy into public‐ and private‐​school classrooms.



In “Discussions That Drive Democracy,” Hess shows the way for teachers and school systems — through their students — to nourish the self‐​identity of this self‐​governing republic:



“I encourage teachers to take up the challenge of teaching students how to deliberate controversies by creating a climate of respect, holding students accountable for norms of civil discourse, and teaching the skills at the root of civil exchanges. Each teacher will find his or her own best way to accept this challenge, depending on the unique community and — possibly — local obstacles.



“But each must start by showing respect for students and for the intrinsic relationship between controversy and democracy.”



Abraham Lincoln, not yet president, described in 1858 the root of “our own liberty and independence. It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, the guns of our war steamers, or the strength of our gallant and disciplined army. These are not our reliance against a resumption of tyranny in our fair land. … Our reliance is the love of liberty. … Destroy this spirit, and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors.” (my book, _Living the Bill of Rights_ , University of California Press, 1999).



Students experience the love of liberty by learning to be actively engaged citizens in their classrooms. And as they come to vote in our elections, they will invigorate our democracy through their knowledgeable independence.

The gaga greenies of Europe are about to charge you for flying here in America. 



In a stunning slap at the sovereignty of everyone on the other six continents, the European Court of Justice last week said it was just fine and dandy for the European Union to levy fees on planes flying elsewhere. 



As the Europeans see it, global warming is so bad that they have to tax … us. 



Here’s how it works: You take off from London for Los Angeles; your flight route runs north‐​northwest over Scotland and out of European air space pronto. You pay a tax for this, which, while annoying, isn’t much different than a highway toll. 



But as your flight continues on — clipping south of the North Pole, then swooping over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Alberta and into the United States and LAX — the EU will tax you for each one of _those_ miles, too.



Starting next year, the EU will tote up all the miles a plane flies to or from any European city, factor in the fuel usage and charge a “carbon levy” for all emissions that are more than 85 percent of 2002 levels. No airline is going to eat that cost, so you’ll get the bill, perhaps listed as an “environmental surcharge.” 



Like most taxes, it starts out small, maybe $20 or so (no one really knows yet) — and then the fine folks in Brussels will start jacking up the price. By 2020, it could be $60 — the sky’s the limit.



And the EU’s not just _planning_ to hike the tax — it’s already mandated it. By 2020, it will tax planes for using more than half their 2002 fuel, and while newer planes are more fuel efficient, they’re not making gains close to that level. 



According to Fitch, United, Continental, Delta and American are likely to get hit the most, because about 20 percent of their revenue comes from European travel.



Things could get pretty ugly. China is already making noise about pulling its order for 10 double‐​decker A‐​380s from Europe’s Airbus (probably pretty good news for Boeing). Other countries may jack up landing fees or inflict similar taxes on foreign carriers. 



Until now, Europe and the United Kingdom have been content to go it alone with their silly climate taxes, smugly thinking (along with Chevrolet Volt drivers) that they are somehow saving the world. No more.



All of this seems downright silly. Here in America, the last (overwhelmingly Democratic) Congress refused to pass an anti‐​warming bill that would’ve ordered the country to cut carbon‐​dioxide emissions an impossible 83 percent by 2050. 



The bill actually passed the House, with President Obama’s support. But Obama’s public approval plummeted, while Republican poll ratings jumped, so the Senate punted the business of impoverishing us over to the president and his Environmental Protection Agency.



One reason that the bill was so unpopular was that it demonstrably did nothing about climate change — even if Europe, Australia, Canada and other industrialized nations adopted the same policy. That’s because the massive emissions from China, India and other developing nations will dwarf ours. 



In 2009, the last year for which we have good data, China emitted 142 percent of the US total of “greenhouse gases” — up from just 51 percent 10 years earlier.



But the Europeans aren’t willing to let futility stop them from launching a perfectly disastrous crusade — or even from exporting it to America.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading financial daily Handelsblatt here writes that the Spanish Andasol 3 parabolic solar power generation plant in Spain “is producing foremost one thing: losses“.
The Andasol 3 solar power station is owned by a consortium of German power companies RWE, Rheinenergie and Stadtwerke Munich and is located in the Spanish province of Granada. When the first of its kind (Andasol 1) was built in 2009, the technology was hailed as a model to the world on how solar energy could successfully replace fossil fuels. US president Barack Obama said Spain was the way to go in terms of energy policy.
And when Andasol 3 went online in 2011, Stadtwerke München director Kurt Mühlhäuser boasted:
Andasol 3 is the the best example that we have to achieve the transition to renewable energies at the European level.”
According to Wikipedia, Andasol 3 was completed at a cost of 315 million euros and generates approximately 165 GW-hr each per year. The plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can generate electricity even when the sun isn’t shining. The site has an annual direct insolation of 2200 kWh/m² per year.
But today the Handelsblatt writes the plant is losing money and cannot operate profitably. Stadtwerke München has had to write off 64 million euros, Rheinenergie 17 million, and RWE has admitted that the write-offs will be “considerable”.
Corporate lawyers to the rescue
The losses stem from the Spanish goverment rolling back subsidies to green energies as the country reels from its debt crisis. The Handelsblatt writes that the three German companies have sent over their lawyers “who are suing against the changed subsidy rules in Spain“. Now that the guaranteed feed-in tariffs are no longer guaranteed and in fact will no longer be paid, green energies are no longer able to operate profitably.
Solar energy was always only possible with generous subsidies from the state. During the boom years more than 13 billion euros flowed into renewable energies in Spain thanks to generous subsisidies by the state, the Handelsblatt writes. But now the solar gold rush days are over. The collapse is unstoppable.
All three German investor companies involved in Andasol 3 blame the scale back in Spanish subsidies for the losses. The Handelsblatt writes that the legal wrangling will persist for years as green energy investors sue the Spanish government.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBerlin’s leftist, climate-cultie TAZ here reports on how indoor pot growers are switching over to LED lighting to grow their clandestine cannabis. Like, we’re saving the planet too, dude!

Image cropped from Cheech and Chong film: Up in Smoke, Paramount Pictures.
The TAZ article features a photo of a US grower with the caption:
Indoor growing in Denver: Works better with LED lamps and supposedly more environmentally friendly.”

The problem with regular lamps is that they consume up to 600 watts per square meter and lead to really high (no pun intended) electric bills. Not only does this cut into growers’ profits, but excessive power consumption also raises suspicions at the power companies. The energy saving LED lights now do a better job at hiding suspicious electricity consumption and at the same time solve the problems of keeping the growing basement or garage cool, the TAZ writes.
There’s another security advantage: high electric bills are not the only way of detecting illegal indoor growing activity, the TAZ writes that the German government, for example, uses helicopters equipped with infrared cameras to sense the heat generated by indoor growers. The TAZ writes that this method of detection will have a much more difficult time now that growers are switching to the low-energy LED lighting.
Another savings, the TAZ writes, is that LED lighting with a rating of 50,000 hours have a far longer lifetime before they burn out.
Now comes the really good news for cannabis connoisseurs: LED light frequency can be precisely adjusted and thus help to yield crops that have premium quality, i.e. more high for the light.
Wow, now growers can feel good about growing climate-friendly pot. And potheads will soon be able to smoke weed without leaving a much of a carbon footprint. Smoke a joint – save the planet!

"The last time we saw John Oliver on “Last Week Tonight,” the weekly comedy series he hosts for HBO, he was blowing up a giant 2016 sign in a soccer stadium, bidding farewell to a year that seemed unmatchable in its capacity for tumult and   news events. Then 2017 came along. As Mr. Oliver prepares for the   premiere of “Last Week Tonight” on Sunday, he returns to an arena where President Trump, the bête noire of the   shows, has been in charge of the country for nearly a month. During that time, the Trump administration has already made the picture more complicated for many issues that Mr. Oliver has addressed in his   segments, like net neutrality, voter fraud, torture and nuclear weapons. Now, who wants to hear some jokes? In an interview on Monday at HBO’s New York offices, Mr. Oliver, 39, said that despite some clear challenges to his way of looking at the world, he did not believe his past work had been in vain. “I’m not a complete nihilist,” he said with a laugh. “I haven’t quite got to the point where I’m going, ‘What’s the point in anything? Burn it down. ’” Though he was mum on the subject of Sunday’s episode, Mr. Oliver said “Last Week Tonight” would continue to resist the impulse to go “all Trump, all the time,” and instead try to focus on subjects not addressed by his   peers. “It’s a lot of people feeding on the same carcass,” he said. “We try to pick a different carcass because of how many different beaks have already gotten to it. ” The   Mr. Oliver did talk about how his   perspective and   experiences have informed his takes on the presidential election, the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s travel ban why you’d have to be a “sociopath” to think   comedy programs helped Mr. Trump win and the relationship between his show and what he considers real journalism. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How did you spend your election night? I just watched it at home, but it was the same muscle memory as the Brexit vote, as those early returns came in  —   I think I know what’s going to happen here. You’ve been living in the United States for about a decade. Do news events in Britain still have a visceral impact on you? I hadn’t left much of a career behind in England  —   I pretty quickly had flipped the switch in my head. This is my home. But Brexit was awful because it reminded me of a certain blatant ugliness in the country that I was raised in. I’d just had a baby, so I liked the idea that he’d have a British passport as well  —   which is a European passport, meaning he can live and work anywhere in Europe. From that vote, you realize his horizons have been contracted dramatically, and that becomes a physical manifestation of what is true for a lot of people. I’m very happy that he doesn’t understand anything that’s happened in the last year. You’re a   holder and the husband of a former United States Army medic. Do you fear any personal ramifications from the travel ban, which created widespread complications for immigrants and residents? Practically speaking, I should be O. K. but it’s kind of scary in a way. That pales into insignificance next to the   trauma of other people. My wife’s been in Iraq. She had a translator. So I know IRAP [the International Refugee Assistance Project] very well. They were there the whole time at J. F. K. I know some of the people who have bled for this country and are now not being let in. When I was still on a visa, I remember the third or fourth time I landed back in J. F. K. from England, catching myself thinking, Oh, great to be home. And then realizing, that is a dangerous thought when there is someone behind a glass panel deciding whether this is your home or not. I still have the basic immigrant’s crush on this country. I like the point of America, that it is diverse  —   not a reactionary idea of an America that happened after the fact. When, say, you do a long segment on “Last Week Tonight” about the importance of the   fiduciary rule, and then Trump signs an executive order that could put a halt to it, does that frustrate you?  No, but it hurts more. We’ve spent so long looking at those stories, we know how important it is. Even something like the fiduciary rule, which can seem like a luxury issue  —   that, in very meaningful ways, affects people’s lives down the line. Our researchers have been looking at the [hiring freeze on federal workers]  —   there’s a lot of veterans who are going to be adversely affected and they don’t even realize it yet. With some of these E. O. s [executive orders] it’s like a tsunami warning. You’re in real trouble and you don’t yet know because the sea looks calm. Do you accept the argument that   comedians helped Trump win, either by insulating Clinton voters from the possibility she could lose or egging on his supporters to vote for him? That is just a stick to hit someone with, knowing that it’s something that could hurt someone. What’s a thing that you like? I’ll attach something you don’t like to it. “Pancakes  —   this is why Trump won. ” But I like pancakes! I’m not saying that comedians are not, by their nature,  . But if you, as a comedian, think you got Donald Trump elected, you’re a sociopath. The election and its aftermath have brought attention to the problem of fake news. Do you think shows like “Last Week Tonight” contribute to this problem?  The phrase “fake news” has now been used so liberally, it’s meaningless. The problem with aggregation is that the very act of aggregating a piece of information assumes that somewhere along the line, there was a level of  . We are very, very strict about making sure that every piece of information that we pass along, we   independently. I do not, for a second, say that our sourcing is transferable across other political comedy shows. Mr. Trump has vociferously criticized the media  —   news outlets as well as comedy shows like “Saturday Night Live. ” Do you fear he might actually try to retaliate against his critics? What he says about journalists is a serious, lasting concern. He has proven these threats are not entirely empty. They’re sometimes promises. But “S. N. L. ” is a comedy show. What would he do, get “S. N. L. ” taken off the air? “S. N. L. ” is something he cares about. We are a meaningless mosquito that he barely hears buzzing by his ear. There is a nonzero chance that he’ll do anything. There’s a nonzero chance you and I are taken to the border this evening and deported as Mexicans. That’s probably not going to happen, but it’s not zero. [laughs] Do you feel as if you were seeing more TV journalists use some of the basic techniques “The Daily Show” developed, like juxtaposing video clips of an administration official contradicting himself?  What you’re describing just seems like basic   to expose hypocrisy. I always find it pretty dispiriting if ever I see journalists trying to tell a joke. This is not your concern. Pick a lane. You don’t need to do this. Also, almost 100 percent of the time, you’re less funny than you think you are. Although, you could absolutely apply that to most comedians. [Laughs.] In all my working years at “The Daily Show,” whenever [a TV journalist] said, “I wish we could do what you guys do”  —   you can. Just don’t tell jokes at the end. Because you can’t, and you shouldn’t. Have you been approached about hosting the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner? Oh, no. God, no. That is just such a noxious concept. I have such contempt for that, as an evening. It would seem really [awful] to go and say, “This whole thing is a horrendous farce. ” I don’t need to go and ruin their unearned evening of celebration. Any of that commentary, I can do on my own show."

I am also author of _Transactions and Strategies: Economics for Management_ (Cengage Learning, 2010), an applied text for MBA students and advanced undergraduates. My consulting clients have included state utility regulators, electric utilities, independent power producers and marketers, natural gas producers, large energy consumers, environmental organizations, public interest groups and governments. My services have at times entailed expert testimony, which I have presented at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, public utility commissions in California, Illinois, Mississippi and Vermont, the California Energy Commission, and in three previous appearances before other House committees.



 **II. Background and Purpose**



The Committee today is exploring the economics that underlies H.R. 2915, and in particular the consequences of repealing the Western Area Power Administration’s (WAPA) $3.25 billion borrowing authority under The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. That Act authorizes borrowing to construct new or upgraded transmission lines interconnected with WAPA, and specifically mentions lines “delivering or facilitating the delivery of power generated by renewable energy resources.“1 Numerous individuals and agencies have alleged that the increased investment in “renewable” sources of power is a worthwhile national objective on two grounds:2 [1] it will provide environmental and climate benefits that outweigh their higher costs, and [2] these investments will favorably impact employment, particularly in a time of recession. If these statements were even approximately true, they could justify support and subsidization of renewable power. Unfortunately, they are not.



My testimony addresses the realities of renewable electricity. It first addresses the very minor contribution of renewables to the nation’s power supply, and how that contribution reflects subsidies and regulations rather than market factors. It continues with a summary of the actual subsidies to various power sources, showing that some renewables receive highly disproportionate treatment that is unjustifiable on economic grounds. The third part questions the logic behind any policy that purports to “create jobs.” Even if government can create them, energy policy is one of the poorest possible vehicles with which to do so. Renewables are seldom sources of durable jobs, and their actual importance for the nation’s employment is negligible. On closer examination, most of the millions of frequently touted “green” and “clean” jobs have little to do with either existing or proposed energy policies. I conclude that federal policies toward renewables are due for a complete rethinking, and that the WAPA authorization may be a useful starting point for that process.



 **III. Renewables and reality**



 **A. Renewables in the U.S. power supply**  
Exhibit 1 shows the amounts of the nation’s power coming from various sources. In 2010, 44.9 percent came from coal, 23.8 percent from natural gas, 19.6 percent from nuclear, and 4.1 percent from renewables (excluding hydropower).3 Note the recent drop in production from coal, the longer‐​term increase in production from gas and the remarkable constancy of nuclear generation. Renewable power is a small fraction of today’s total, but its contribution was even smaller in the past — 2.1 percent in 1990 and 2.2 percent in 2005, when its current growth began. Exhibits 2 and 3 show that the mix of renewable sources has changed substantially over the past 20 years. In 1991, over 95 percent of renewable electricity was from geothermal sources, biomass and waste burning. These technologies were viable because their unsubsidized power was (and still is) competitive with fossil‐​fuel generation in a few areas. They were also dispatchable, operable when their power was valuable and left idle when it was not. All three of them have since stagnated. In 1992 they produced 70.5 million kilowatt‐​hours (gigawatt hours or gwh) and in 2009 slightly more, 72.2 gwh. Solar power remains a minor presence despite its substantial subsidies. Its 1993 output of 0.45 gwh grew to only 1.29 gwh in 2010, under 1 percent of renewable power and 0.03 percentof all U.S. power. Exhibit 4 shows that the growth of renewable electricity since 2000 has been almost entirely in wind power, which by 2010 accounted for over half of all renewable generation capacity. Explaining that growth is our next task.



 **B. Costs of power and costs of reliability**  
Wind power is both intermittent and expensive, and official expectations are that it will remain so. Exhibit 5 shows the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) projections of the levelized cost per megawatt‐​hour (mwh) of various technologies (including fuel where applicable) for plants expected on‐​line in 2016 (in 2009 dollars). The three most costly sources are solar thermal ($312/​mwh), offshore wind ($243) and solar photovoltaic ($211). The cost of onshore wind is $97/​mwh. Compared with a conventional (not an advanced) combined cycle gas‐​fired generator ($66/​mwh) the cheapest intermittent source is almost 50 percent more expensive. Intermittent renewables are even likely to be poor investments under a carbon tax or cap‐​and‐​trade system. The costs of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology are still highly uncertain, but EIA estimates that adding it to a combined cycle gas unit still leaves it 8 percent less expensive per mwh than the cheapest wind turbine. At carbon prices typically projected for cap‐​and‐​trade regimes the wind plant still loses.



Technology and economics both tell us that intermittent wind capacity carries costs that will likely exceed those the same dispatchable fossil‐​fueled capacity. Small amounts of wind can easily be integrated into a regional grid because a sudden calm is operationally indistinguishable from a minor outage. Larger amounts of wind capacity, however, require costlier backup arrangements, including operating reserve generators. In most regions wind blows most strongly when its power production is least valuable. In 2006, California had 2,323 MW of wind capacity and was operating under record loads in early summer. Wind’s average on‐​peak contribution (over the diverse northern and southern climates) was 256 MW.4 For system planning purposes, ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, currently sets a wind turbine’s “effective capacity” at 8.7 percent of its nominal amount for planning purposes.5



Because wind requires fossil‐​fuel generation as backup we cannot simply conclude that a mwh of wind power eliminates the pollutants in a mwh of conventional power. Research by gas marketer Bentek Energy found that in some areas additional wind power has strikingly perverse consequences. Bentek found that large increases in Texas and Colorado wind capacity indeed led to less coal‐​fired generation. Emissions of EPA “criteria pollutants” from these plants, however, actually increased, and CO2 emissions were unchanged.6 Operating data showed that wind’s variability required numerous quick adjustments by coal‐​fired units, which were responsible for the added pollution. Bentek’s controversial conclusion was that the total load in the area could have been served with lower total emissions had the wind units never existed.



 **C. Who gets what subsidies?**  
Subsidies and regulations can explain wind power’s rise quite graphically. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) extended wind’s sporadic production tax credit (PTC, now also applicable to some other renewables) through the end of 2012. Before the PTC’s first enactment in 2000, only 67 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity were built. That figure grew to 1,697 MW during its initial year of 2001. For 2002 (credit not in effect) and 2003 (in effect) the figures are 446 and 1,687 MW; and for 2004 (off) and 2005 (on) they are 389 and 2,431 MW.7 Many other factors influence investment, but total investment in years with the tax credit was 544 percent greater than in years without it. (We cannot go beyond these years because subsequent extensions have included retroactivity provisions that investors may have come to expect. ) There is, however, no evidence of changes in market conditions that would diminish the importance of subsidies, as was recently noted by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). In mid‐​2010 it claimed that ARRA’s subsidy provisions (which included an investment tax credit option) had been responsible for an increase in small turbine installations:



“The ITC was perhaps the most important factor in last year’s growth … [it] helpedconsumers purchase small wind systems during a recession when other financingmechanisms were hardest to obtain. The enactment of the ITC [was] the industry’s toppriority…“8



Alongside such subsidies, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and related regulations in approximately half of the states require utilities to obtain certain quantities of power from renewable sources. Although quantification is difficult it is likely that some wind investments have been made solely for RPS compliance, rather than because they were cost‐​effective choices.



Energy subsidies are a sensitive issue in part because they have no generally agreed‐​upon definition. For fiscal 2010 the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) produced what are the currently authoritative estimates. Its authors took particular care in calculating the effects of subsidies to various fuels on the actual amounts of power they produced. Thus a subsidy to the oil industry will only be relevant to the extent that it affects the (negligible) amount of oil used to generate power. Exhibit 6 presents the basics. Per mwh of power that it actually produced, wind received a subsidy of $56.29 and solar received $775.64. Wind gets 88 times more funds per mwh than coal, and the same multiple more than gas and oil.9



Taken by themselves, these figures alone cannot determine the desirability of subsidies. For example, the newness of renewable technologies might provide an economic rationale for subsidies to fund basic research that if successful could render them truly competitive. (Justifying the subsidy, however, also requires a demonstration that renewables somehow differ from other leading‐​edge industries in their unique needs for support.) Even if so, the current form of the subsidy is inappropriate. A targeted research subsidy might make sense, but one that simply lowers prices paid by purchasers of renewables or reduces the taxes of investors is harder to rationalize. EIA’s report states that “tax expenditures” (i.e. reductions) to the coal industry (including those for coal not used to produce power) were $561 million in fiscal 2010, while R&D subsidies (possibly necessary if we are to have “clean coal”) were $663 million. Tax expenditures for renewables were $8,168 billion, primarily the production tax credit for wind, while the R&D that might make them competitive was only $1,409 million for renewables as a group with $166 of that going to wind.10



 **IV. Renewables and employment**



 **A. “Green jobs“**  
It is rapidly becoming apparent that renewable energy is failing to produce the promise of painless prosperity embodied in “green jobs” that will simultaneously decrease unemployment rates and reduce pollution. Begin with some principles:11



1\. The proper goal of energy policy is to support the efficient provision of energy. The lower the cost of energy to the economy, all else equal, the higher will be job creation and economic growth outside of the energy sector. Raising energy costs by forcing the use of uneconomic technologies that create more job slots will have exactly the opposite effect. Put simply, more workers in energy reduce the production of non‐​energy goods and services.



2\. Any analysis of job creation by green energy must consider the simultaneous effect of job destruction. Policies that raise the cost of energy to households and businesses must leave them with fewer funds to spend elsewhere. Such policies include the spending of tax revenues to support green activities instead of other government purchases or returning the funds to taxpayers. To a first approximation the net effect of such programs on employment will be zero. This is particularly important here because the new job slots are often visible, while the losses are dispersed among the thousands of goods and services that households and businesses will spend less on. Jobs that cost more to create will generally have higher costs in terms of lost jobs elsewhere.



3\. Double counting of jobs and unrealistic assumptions about labor markets.Although they seldom say so explicitly, the models that underlie most studies of green energy and job creation assume that there is a limitless pool of idle laborers with just the right skills to fill the job slots created by the spending. As always happens in labor markets, many such jobs will in fact be filled by already‐​employed workers, whether the nation is in prosperity or recession. Even if green policies moved massive amounts of labor between jobs they would have little impact on the national unemployment rate.



 **B. How Government Models Job Creation**  
Much federal research on both the technology and economics of renewables is in the hands of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), where a now‐​standard computer model of the economic impact of renewable projects originated and continues to be maintained. During my appearance at a 2010 hearing before the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee the discussion turned to what was known about the effects of renewables on unemployment. After a representative of NREL testified about the optimistic findings of that standard model, known as JEDI (Job and Economic Development Impact), I commented that its use was entirely inappropriate. I noted that JEDI is structured, by NREL’s own admission, in a way that makes any outcome other than job creation mathematically impossible.12 It is thus a worthless tool for analyzing the actual employment effects of renewables, because it can only produce favorable ones. NREL’s representative disputed my statement, and that person and I agreed to submit supplemental testimony on the matter.13



As I detail in that testimony, JEDI is one of a large class of “input‐​output” models that analyze the effects of a project by examining the payments its owners make to workers and suppliers of materials. The monies they receive will in part be respent on other goods, and a “multiplier” effect brings further increases in incomes, outputs and employment across potentially many industries. I noted that



“[t]here is nothing in the model that could conceivably decrease employment or output in other sectors of the economy. Any project consider by JEDI, no matter how efficient or inefficient as a source of electricity, will show a positive effect on employment. That increase may be large or small, but we can be certain that it will not be negative.“14



I further noted that most of the effects will be transitory, since most of the positions created will be in construction rather than operation.



JEDI’s creators appear to have consciously chosen to avoid discussing the sources of the workers or the funds for projects under study. Even if there is a vast pool of unemployed workers in the project area who just happen to have the right skills, we can say nothing about its effect on overall employment. JEDI does not net out jobs lost due to taxes paid by consumers and businesses elsewhere that they cannot spend as they wished to. Even if the project is funded by private or public bond issue, alternative projects with their own employment consequences could have been undertaken. It is not even enough to have workers in the project area with the right skills, because net increases in employment usually happen only if those persons have also been suffering long‐​term unemployment.



NREL’s disregard of elementary economics and continued reliance on this model is remarkable, particularly in light of its’ creators’ acknowledgments of its inadequacies:



On occasion [the creators] have cited the works of others who use more complex models capable of forecasting both job creation and job destruction. Such models can incorporate factors that include responsiveness to higher power prices, reductions in employment in conventional power, and the‚ ‘crowding out’ of other capital spending by increased investment in renewables. Sometimes such models produce negative effects on employment in the long run. NREL’s researchers are thus aware that other models that capture important complexities are available (or they could surely create their own). For unknown reasons, they instead persist in using a model that can produce only the single result of job creation from renewables.15



The “green jobs” claim is logically insecure at best, and models like JEDI mask that insecurity by invariably finding that the jobs are created. Interestingly, however, I am aware of no published research in which the predictions of JEDI or a similar model for some project have been compared with the actual results. Apparently the model’s own creators also take its claims on faith, and that faith appears to be without foundation.



 **C. Which jobs are green?**  
Even if there were a usable model to analyze job creation, we are left with the problem of identifying which jobs are actually “green.” A renewable project can result in the employment of technical personnel trained to specialize in operating or maintaining its technology (whom we presume are green), as well as additional bartenders who will help the workers to enjoy their evenings (harder to classify as green). The matter is important because any type of governmental or private spending might open up slots for bartenders. Renewable technologies, however, have been viewed as the foundation for a massive increase in skilled workers whose human capital will provide them with higher lifelong earnings.



Two recent studies point up that the choice of definitions can affect estimates of the green workforce, and show that an extremely small fraction of jobs defined as green are in renewables. The Brookings Institution recently estimated 2.7 million jobs associated with the “clean economy.” The categories include “Agricultural and Natural Resources Conservation” (18.9 %), “Regulation and Compliance” (5.3%), “Energy and Resource Efficiency” (31.0%), and “Greenhouse Gas Reduction, Environmental Management, and Recycling” (39.6%).16 The clean economy expands its bounds by creative classification. Thus we find that energy efficiency includes 350,000 people in public mass transit, mostly bus drivers, and environmental management includes 386,000 people in waste management, formerly known as trash disposal. The researchers chose not to use an alternative definition that would have been far more helpful to most readers: how many clean jobs have (or will) come into being as a result of recent and proposed energy, environmental and climate regulations? (And, of course, how many others will vanish.)



Some additional insight is possible when we consider the Brookings’ final category. “Renewable Energy” contains 138,000 clean jobs, only 5.1 percent of the total. If we subtract the 55,000 of them in hydropower, which most data sources class as nonrenewable, the figure is down to 84,000, or 3.1 percent of all clean jobs. 29,000 of this remainder are in solar (thermal and photovoltaic), which accounts for under 1 percent of actual renewable power production. 24,000 more are in wind (17.4 percent of renewable power workers and under 1 percent of total clean workers).17 Even if we are willing to assume very large “multipliers” from renewable power, its impact on employment will be trivial, whether taken as a fraction of all energy, clean economy jobs, or the entire labor force.



As a check on those figures we examine Washington State, where environmental awareness is high and renewable energy (non‐​hydro) is a significant presence. Its four base categories are [1] Increasing energy efficiency, [2] Producing renewable energy, [3] Preventing and reducing environmental pollution, and [4] Providing mitigation or cleanup of pollution.18 Again, a significant fraction of its green workers are bus drivers, trash handlers and the like. The Washington data show that renewable energy occupies 3,464 workers, 3.5 percent of the state’s 99,979 green jobs.19 Its current wind capacity is 2,357 MW, ranking it sixth among the states.20 Washington is one of the most active states in wind investment and production, but still only a small percentage of its green workforce works with renewables, including wind. The Washington study’s authors further note that “construction-relat¬≠ed industries and occupations, as well as professional and techni¬≠cal services occupations, accounted for the majority of all [renewable] positions.21 The majority of these jobs are in manufacturing and construction. Per project, both are short‐​lived, and once in operation “most renewable energy facilities operate with a relatively small number of operations and maintenance employees… The proportion of part‐​time positions is higher for renewable energy than for any other private‐​sector core area (35 percent).“22



Both the Brookings and the Washington data tell similar stories. Green or clean jobs are not objectively definable, and cases like the bus drivers tell us that they are easy to inflate. Under both studies’ definitions, renewable power jobs are small fractions of the total, and most will be short‐​lived construction work performed in the main by people with skills that are usable in almost any type of project. Washington’s wind units produce a higher fraction of the state’s power than those of most other states, but their existence has not created any discernible difference in Washington’s labor market performance. Similarly, it appears that most of the solar work force is in construction, where opportunities will diminish with the growth of installations. The past three years have led many to question the federal government’s ability to create new employment and the odd logic that lies behind that hope. The data, however, should make it clear to both believers and nonbelievers that renewable power is a singularly inappropriate and ineffective way to increase employment.



 **V. Summary and Conclusions**



The reality of most renewable electricity, particularly from intermittent sources, is easy to summarize. It is expensive, undependable and environmentally problematic. Some renewables such as biomass and geothermal are exceptions, often capable of passing market tests that wind and solar cannot. Unchallenged data from the Energy Information Administration show that the subsidies per kwh actually generated by wind and solar power are over 80 times those received by non‐​nuclear conventional sources, and over 15 times those for nuclear power. Most subsidies to wind and solar are politically‐​inspired wealth transfers, rather than tools to incentivize improvements in their competitiveness. In all but the most extreme scenarios, the Department of Energy projects that they will be uncompetitive with conventional resources, even if carbon policies come into being.



The economic theory behind claims that renewables will increase employment applies (if at all) to an economy that hardly resembles today’s. Advocates of job creation almost invariably fail to note the concomitant destruction of jobs in industries whose products are no longer bought because consumers must pay taxes or higher prices for the renewable power. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s models of job creation are curiosities devoid of policy relevance, mathematically structured to render any possible job destruction an impossibility. Even if we only look at jobs in renewables, their impacts on employment are minimal. The Brookings Institution estimates slightly over 80,000 renewable energy jobs, many of which are short‐​term construction work. The millions of “clean” or “green” jobs mentioned in the media are overwhelmingly positions that would be filled even if all renewable electricity vanished — bus drivers, refuse workers, and some building trades, to name a few. Calling these workers part of the “clean” economy can only mislead the public about the likely effects of energy and climate policy.



Any choice by government to financially support one energy source over another is by definition an exercise in picking winners. All too often such spending generates forces that make it very difficult to abandon the non‐​winners. The stories of synfuels and ethanol are back today in wind and solar power, which have many friends in Washington. Whatever happens there, the real future of energy has already arrived, and the winner was picked by the market, with virtually no help from the District of Columbia. Independent risk‐​takers devised ways to access shale gas for the simplest of reasons — there was profit to be made by alleviating a scarcity of conventional gas. Shale is competitive on costs, compliant with environmental rules and in the main within state jurisdiction, under which it is producing prosperity. The jobs shale creates are the kind that have always powered the country, and their finance comes from the voluntary savings of households and businesses. The nation is looking at centuries of low‐​cost, clean, secure fuel that creates the kind of jobs that are really worth creating — in the making of goods and services that people voluntarily trade because doing so makes both sides better off. Wind and solar largely exist because government can coerce payments for them.



The subject matter of this hearing is a seemingly minor provision in a far larger and more pervasive law. ARRA and many other recent laws contain language that prioritizes facilities associated with renewable power in ways that I believe are unwarranted. This testimony has summarized some facts about renewable energy in order to shed light on its true costs, benefits, and labor market effects. These facts clearly show that this committee must rethink ARRA’s statement that WAPA pay particular attention to renewable energy. I am not testifying about the organization or performance of WAPA, or about the costs and benefits of any specific transmission project. Rather, I am stating that power from renewable sources should compete for transmission resources on the same terms as power from conventional ones.

I honestly cannot see the point of the Zero Carbon Bill. For a country that produces 0.17% of global emissions, and whose farmers are the most efficient and productive in the world, it just makes no sense. Why hamstring our economy for a rate of emissions that would make no difference even if they were eradicated altogether?



Unfortunately, the eco-warriors in the Green party do not see things that way, as you might expect. But thankfully, they may find themselves alone this time. 



The Government’s plan to [make farmers pay for their emissions](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/114267785/farmers-exempt-from-95-percent-of-emissions-charges-under-new-proposed-rules) **is on shaky ground** after Labour, the Greens, and NZ First have failed to agree on proposals.   
A draft scheme went to the environment, energy and climate cabinet committee, but failed to make it through after **ministers could not agree on it.**  
It has now stalled at the cabinet committee stage, while ministers work to agree on a plan. 



Well, how about that? I cannot deny feeling relieved, but what I hate about this inept government is the time and money that is wasted putting draft bills together, only to have their coalition partners throw a spanner in the works. They behave as if money grows on trees when, actually, it grows on taxpayers.



The news comes after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gave the keynote address to a [climate change action summit at the United Nations in New York.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/116033750/pm-jacinda-ardern-calls-climate-change-perfect-trade-opportunity-in-optimistic-un-speech)



Well, it was only a 3-minute speech, and she can always claim she knew nothing – she is good at that.



Agriculture has been exempt from the emissions trading scheme (ETS) since it was created in 2008. The exemption is controversial as agriculture is New Zealand’s largest emitter, responsible for nearly half of total emissions. 



It does not seem right, however, to make life more expensive for food producers, especially as our economy is so dependent on them. Most other countries, such as the EU, have significant subsidies for their farmers, but we don’t. Ours stand on their own in every way. 



Senior ministers are concerned that the Government is **facing an agricultural revolt** as farmers grapple with a raft of stringent new regulations on water quality and environmental degradation announced by [Environment Minister David Parker](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115571186/environment-minister-david-parker-promises-to-clean-up-new-zealands-summer-swimming-spots).   
There is concern within the Government that **it may have burnt through its**[ **political capital with farmers**](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/96665676/federated-farmers-say-the-ets-will-cost-the-primary-industry-83-million), leaving it limited scope to pursue other measures that would add cost to agriculture.   
**There is no suggestion at this stage that scheme is dead in the water.** Back tracking on introducing agriculture to the ETS would be a significant backdown for the Government, which had promised it would finally bring an end to the exemption. 



It might be dead in the water or watered down so much that it will be both unrecognisable and unpalatable to Green supporters. Time will tell, but let us just say that it is not exactly plain sailing at the moment… for the Greens, that is.



The deal that was eventually struck between the Greens, Labour and NZ First was that agriculture would be brought into the scheme if the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC) recommended it.  
But **NZ First managed to negotiate a sweetheart deal for the sector,** meaning that whatever recommendation was made, agriculture would only pay for 5 per cent of the total cost of emissions.  
Advice drawn up by the Government found this would add a charge of $0.01c per kg of milk solid, 0.01c per kg of beef, $0.03c per kg of sheep meat, and $0.04c per kg of venison at the current ETS prices.   
[The ICCC finally reported back in July](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/114267785/farmers-exempt-from-95-percent-of-emissions-charges-under-new-proposed-rules), recommending that farmers should enter the scheme under a special “levy and rebate” scheme.   
The recommendations were shopped around farmers at a series of roadshows which ended on August 13. After that the policy was refined and sent to cabinet committee.   
Some details of the scheme were agreed to last week, but there are still enough outstanding problems for the scheme not to progress beyond committee stage. 



This all sounds okay, but don’t forget David Parker’s water schemes and also the debacle that is Fonterra at the moment. The government cannot be blamed for Fonterra, but the last thing they want to do is to anger farmers even further. Most New Zealanders support the agricultural sector. We know we would be considerably poorer as a country without it.



Climate Change Minister **James Shaw hopes the bill will pass with the support of the National Party,** who supported it at first reading. 



  
Not on your life. James Shaw demonstrates both political naivety and climate stupidity if he thinks National will support this bill when his own coalition partners will not. He really does live in a parallel universe, doesn’t he?



What a slap in the face for the Greens. But, to quote the late Windsor Davies…



Oh dear. How sad. Never mind.

BBC: Richard Black’s Farewell
Let’s hope the reporter who replaces him is more balanced.

For those who do not know, Richard Black is / was the environmental and global warming reporter for the BBC .
I’m sorry for the short post; I’m sending it from my phone from a fast food restaurant along Interstate 5.

We haven’t heard politicians complain much lately about “tax breaks for U.S. companies that ship jobs overseas,” perhaps because the next federal election is still more than a year away.   
  
  
An article in the _Financial Times_ today shows why that charge rings pretty hollow anytime in the election cycle. In an interview with CEO Doug Oberhelman of Caterpillar Inc., the FT notes that the Peoria, Ill.-based maker of earth‐​moving equipment has been thriving even though the domestic U.S. economy has been stuck in low gear.   
  
  
Like many U.S. multinational companies, Caterpillar has been expanding its sales and profits by selling its products in rapidly growing emerging markets while spreading its production facilities around the world. Here’s the key passage for those politicians who complain about U.S. companies investing and hiring abroad: 



In recent months, [Caterpillar] has announced plans for new factories in Singapore, Thailand, China and Brazil.   
  
  
In the US, it is building a new distribution centre in Washington state while expanding its factories in North Dakota and Kansas.   
  
  
Caterpillar has hired about 29,000 people worldwide in the past 20 months, some 13,000 of them in the US, with most of the rest in China, Brazil, Mexico and the UK.



The Caterpillar experience shows that job creation is not a zero‐​sum game, where jobs created abroad by U.S. companies must come at the expense of production and employment in the United States. In fact, as I show in my 2009 book _Mad about Trade_ (pp. 100–104), the Caterpillar experience is not unusual. U.S. employment by parent companies will typically rise and fall in synch with employment at their affiliates abroad. For U.S. multinationals: 



Foreign and domestic operations tend to complement each other and expand together. A successful company operating in a favorable business climate will tend to expand employment at both its domestic and overseas operations. More activity and sales abroad usually require more managers, accountants, lawyers, engineers, and production workers at the parent company.



As for those “tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas,” I explained why they are not a problem in an op‐​ed in the _New York Post_ during the last election cycle. Keep it handy for when the demagoguery starts flying again next fall.

Dr. Michael Asten writes to alert me of this article in the Australian, with this advice:
Geologic time scale Climate Change (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
The overwhelming conclusion ought to be that cycles should be built into at least some of the climate models in order to explore scenarios.  But I fear we might still be another decade away from seeing that happen.
I suspect he is right, as I do Stephan Rahmstorf who says:
“if the system (is cyclic), we’d expect the opposite. In 30 years’ time we will know for sure.”
From:  The Australian 
Today’s global warming is well within historic range
by:  Michael Asten January 28, 2013 12:00AM


 US President Barak Obama vows action on climate change with the declaration “none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms”. 

It was an appeal using rhetoric and not science because the most severe impacts of these natural disasters come from the challenge of managing increased population or changed population demands, not changes in the events per se.

Great fires are a regular feature of North American and Australian landscapes, and their human impact is worst when they reach housing or infrastructure built among trees, on the edge of bushland that has not been cleared by “cool” burn-offs.
Civilisations have been hit by droughts since the Nile delta drought of 4200 years ago destroyed Egypt’s old kingdom, leaving the pyramids as witness.
As global citizens, we still have much to learn about the management of water, it seems, whether in our Murray-Darling backyard or in the Sahel of Africa.
The term “powerful storms” summons up graphic images of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated New York – except it was no longer hurricane-strength when it, like a dozen others in written history, struck.
But the Manhattan area it flooded contained huge areas of high-density development on reclaimed swamps, ponds and what was riverbed before civilisation drained, dozed and filled to provide for the population of one of the world’s greatest cities. When New York has absorbed the lessons from this, it will be able to pass on advice and technology to places such as Bangladesh.
…
A growing number of mainstream scientists agrees there is evidence for such cycles as drivers of climate change, although debate on causes and mechanisms is strong. By way of example, I note three recent papers that find evidence for long-term cycles influencing the Earth’s climate.
Weichao Wu of the Peking University and colleagues studied sea-surface temperature records preserved in deep-sea sediments near Okinawa in the Pacific Ocean, and found evidence for multiple cyclic temperature variations over the past 2700 years.
The most interesting temperature peaks correspond to medieval, Roman and possibly Minoan warming periods of about 900, 1800 and 2500 years ago.
The paper is significant in that it concludes that the current rate of global temperature change lies in the same range as that of those historical warming periods.
This suggests we have evidence that challenges current climate orthodoxy on two grounds, first by suggesting that such warming events were global not local European phenomena, and second that current warming is not unprecedented in the historical record.
While we read many claims by oceanographers of an increasing rate of rise in sea-levels associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, an alternative interpretation of observed data is made in a recent analysis by Don Chambers of the University of South Florida and colleagues.
Chambers poses the question: “Is there a 60-year oscillation in sea-level?” and shows evidence that the answer is probably yes.
I read his data and find it is arguable that the upswing of that oscillation is responsible for about half of the current 3mm/year rate of rise, leaving the background rate of rise at about 1.7mm, where it has been for 110 years.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author Stefan Rahmstorf, writing in the climate scientists’ blogsite Real Climate this month, commented on whether the data supports an interpretation of cycles, or non-cyclic shifts associated with changes in aerosols and current increases in greenhouse gases.
Rahmstorf concludes in favour of the latter but ends with the objective and open-minded comment “if the system (is cyclic), we’d expect the opposite. In 30 years’ time we will know for sure.”
…
A third work that may eventually prove immensely important in understanding cycles in climate change is a study by JA Abreu of the prestigious Swiss university ETH, with co-authors including Australia’s 1995 Australia Science Prize winner Ken McCracken.
Abreu reconstructs a history of solar sunspot cycles over the past 10,000 years from elemental isotopes created by cosmic rays impinging on the atmosphere, subsequently preserved in Greenland ice-core records.
…
The mechanisms of sun-spot, solar magnetic field and cosmic ray interactions are complex and will be intensely studied, but the associations illustrated here demand consideration when we seek to model our future climate.
The devastating impacts of extreme climate events of which Obama speaks have always been with us, and we have to expect that the human tragedies they bring will be exacerbated by growth in global population.

 _The BFD_ has canvased the EV battery disposal problem here:



Dr Woods wants us to build 4.5 windfarms per year. Very fortunately, this is another CoL target that is being comprehensively missed as no one wants to see New Zealand end up looking like France does at the moment. Ugly turbines everywhere, with a maximum of about one in three actually rotating when we visited France last month.



Turbines do not last forever, the life cycle of a modern wind turbine is around 20 to 25 years, so what happens at the end of that lifespan?



You can’t burn the blades, and currently they are not recyclable, so the only option is landfill, something the Greens hate with a passion. But these blades are massive: 50 – 80m long, so not every landfill can handle them. Then there is the tower and the massive concrete foundations to dispose of eventually.



According to Pu Liu and Claire Barlow ( _Waste Management,_ April 2017), there will be 43 million metric tons of blade waste worldwide by 2050, with China possessing 40% of the waste, Europe 25%, the United States 16%, and the rest of the world 19%. The problem of blade disposal, they conclude, is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future.



A 2017 report from researchers Katerin Ramirez-Tejeda, David A. Turcotte, and Sarah Pike ( _New Solutions)_ asserts that “the environmental consequences and health risks are so adverse that the authors warn that if the public learns of this rapidly burgeoning problem, they may be less inclined to favor wind power expansion.”



Ramirez-Tejeda, _et al.,_ added that landfilling turbine waste is especially problematic “because its high resistance to heat, sunlight, and moisture means that it will take hundreds of years to degrade in a landfill environment. The wood and other organic material present in the blades would also end up in landfills, potentially releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other volatile organic compounds to the environment.”



  
Clearly any process to break down the blades, so that they take up less valuable landfill space, will require a significant energy input, further reducing the climate-saving ability of the turbines. Chain-gangs and sledgehammers seem to have fallen out of favour.



Are the costs and hassle (and waste of limited landfill space) of disposing of millions of tons of turbine blades factored into the cost-benefit for any wind project? Will this cost be added to your monthly power bill? 



Ultimately, according to Sarah Lozanova ( _Earth911,_ August 2017), decommissioning wind farms might be [more costly than the construction phase](http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/102458629/DTU_INTL_ENERGY_REP_2014_WIND_91_97.pdf). Indeed, she added, [decommissioning and recycling wind turbines](http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/102458629/DTU_INTL_ENERGY_REP_2014_WIND_91_97.pdf) is a blind spot when considering the total environmental impact of wind energy.

"Reindeer are incredibly hardy creatures – they survived the last Ice Age and today live in some of the world’s most inhospitable landscapes. Despite their fine-tuned adaptations to life in the Arctic and after over 600,000 years of living there, reindeer are struggling to survive the rapid changes happening all around them. In the winter of 2013-14, 61,000 reindeer starved to death in the Yamal peninsula of Russia. The population crashed, devastating the Yamal Nenets – an indigenous people who herd the reindeer for food. A more recent census found that 200 reindeer in Svalbard, Norway didn’t survive the winter of 2018-19.  These mass starvations were largely due to climate change, which is causing unusual spikes of warm winter weather in the Arctic. The higher winter temperatures cause snow to melt and refreeze, or to fall as rain which also refreezes. The icy sheet encases lichen on the ground – the reindeers’ main winter food supply. The reindeer can’t dig through it and often the ice freezes over such a large area that they starve while wandering, trying to reach the plants they can smell beneath them.  


      Read more:
      The Arctic is turning brown because of weird weather – and it could accelerate climate change


 These “freeze-thaw” and rain-on-snow events do happen naturally each year in the Arctic, and have done for a long time. But they’re happening more often now and on a larger scale. The recent struggles of reindeer aren’t all down to climate change though, especially in northern Europe. Sapmi – a region spanning northern Sweden, Norway, Finland and west Russia – is home to the indigenous Saami, who are also reindeer herders. For many years they’ve tried to maintain the tradition which provides them with food and warm clothing, while locked in conflict with industries and governments over land. Sweden provides 90% of the EU’s iron ore and the mines built to extract this, as well as the areas flooded to store mining waste, reduce the pasture land that’s available for reindeer. One dam holding mining waste in Kiruna, Sweden is 4km long. The region’s timber industry is also disrupting the ancient forests reindeer have evolved alongside. These are populated by a variety of tree species of various different ages and heights. This creates a canopy that’s uneven, allowing snow to accumulate in deeper and shallower patches below – so some areas will remain grazeable when others are too deeply covered. Plantations created and used by commercial foresters are monocultures – the trees are all roughly the same age and size. This creates a uniform canopy which allows snow to pool at roughly the same depth everywhere, leaving fewer alternative places to graze when food becomes inaccessible. Even if there is food and a variety of pastures, the reindeer can be scared away by noisy machinery and roads to the mining and logging sites. One study in Norway found that in the last century, undisturbed reindeer habitat has shrank by 70%, including grazing lands that have been flooded for hydroelectric dams.  Reindeer have less and less to eat and their migration routes are being broken apart by roads, fences and railway lines. The effects of climate change on top of all this make an already difficult situation worse. Many reindeer herders now need to purchase feed for their reindeer during winter – an extra cost that may be difficult for owners of smaller herds to afford. Losing reindeer isn’t just a worry for herders. These animals play an important role within Arctic ecosystems and can even affect the regulation of the planet’s temperature. Though the effects of reindeer grazing vary from place to place, experiments have shown what can happen when they’re removed from an area. Without reindeer, the diversity of plant species dropped in one study as fast growing grasses that reindeer had previously kept in check were allowed to proliferate and push out other species, like mosses and liverworts.  In some areas, lowland shrubs and flowering plants which were previously eaten by reindeer as seedlings were able to expand into the tundra. An open tundra with few large plants allows more snow to accumulate on the ground. This vast, white landscape reflects more of the sun’s rays back into space and reduces how much the world warms, a phenomenon known as the albedo effect. Shrubby heathlands don’t allow such an even blanket of snow to form and so reflect less solar energy, amplifying the warming of the atmosphere. Luckily, all may not be lost for the reindeer. In recent years there has been growing recognition of the indigenous land rights of the Saami. They won a court case against the Swedish state which gave them stronger rights in determining who could hunt and fish on their lands. It’s hoped that this could set a precedent for them having more say in how industries use their lands in future.  An official report recently advised against building a train line in Finland, as it would cut through six different reindeer herding areas, and the project has been put on hold. This is a positive step which could open more opportunities for constructive dialogue between these groups in future. Perhaps with growing awareness, more support can be given to protecting reindeer and the wild, diverse landscapes they not only rely on to survive, but also help to create and thrive.

A climate science bombshell: New proposal from NASA JPL admits to “spurious” errors in current satellite based sea level and ice altimetry, calls for new space platform to fix the problem.
People send me stuff. Today it is a PowerPoint presentation from NASA JPL that touts the new GRASP (Geodetic Reference Antenna in Space) satellite project. I’d say it is more than a bit of a bombshell because the whole purpose of this new mission is to “fix” other mission data that apparently never had a stable enough reference for the measurements being made. This promises to rewrite what we know about sea level rise and acceleration, ice extent and ice volume loss measured from space.

What is most interesting, is the admissions of the current state of space based sea level altimetry in the science goals page of the presentation:


The difference between tide gauge data and space based data is over 100% in the left graph, 1.5 mm/yr versus 3.2mm/yr. Of course those who claim that sea level rise is accelerating accept this data without question, but obviously one of the two data sets (or possibly both) is not representative of reality, and JPL’s GRASP team aims to fix this problem they have identified:
TRF errors readily manifest as spurious sea level rise accelerations
That’s a bucket of cold water reality into the face of the current view of sea level rise. It puts this well-known and often cited graph on Sea Level Rise from the University of Colorado (and the rate of 3.1 mm/yr) into question:

What’s  a TRF error? That stands for Terrestrial Reference Frame, which is basically saying that errors in determining the benchmark are messing up the survey. In land based geodesy terms, say if somebody messed with the USGS benchmark elevation data from Mt. Diablo California on a regular basis, and the elevation of that benchmark kept changing in the data set, then all measurements referencing that benchmark would be off as well.
USGS Benchmark on Mt. Diablo – Image from geocaching.com
In the case of radio altimetry from space, such measurements are extremely dependent on errors related to how radio signals are propagated through the ionosphere. Things like Faraday rotation, refraction, and other propagation issues can skew the signal during transit, and if not properly corrected for, especially over the long-term, it can introduce a spurious signal in all sorts of data derived from it. In fact, the mission summary shows that it will affect satellite derived data for sea level, ice loss, and ice volume in GRACE gravity measurements:

In a nutshell, JPL is saying we don’t have an accurate reference point, and therefore the data from these previous missions likely has TRF uncertainties embedded:
The TRF underlies all Measurement of the Earth
Without that stable Terrestrial Reference Frame that puts the precision of the baseline measurements well below the noise in the data, all we have are broader uncertain measurements. That’s why the plan is to provide ground based points of reference, something our current satellite systems don’t have:

To help understand the items in the side panels:
GNSS = Global Navigation Satellite System – more here
SLR = Satellite Laser Ranging  – more here
DORIS = Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite – more here
VLBI = Very Long Baseline Interferometry – more here
Taken together, these systems will improve the accuracy of the TRF, and thus the data. It’s rather amazing that the baseline accuracy didn’t come first, because this now puts all these other space based measurement systems into uncertainty until their TRF issues are resolved, and that’s an inconvenient truth. We’ll never look at satellite based sea level data or GRACE ice volume data in quite the same way again until this is resolved.

Climategate was the term quickly applied in 2009 to the mysterious appearance on the internet of large numbers of emails and documents belonging to some of the world’s leading climate scientists.
This happened just a month before the Copenhagen climate change conference, which failed to meet the expectations of many for agreement on international action. The timing may not be coincidental.
For some climate change sceptics, the emails were a disturbing revelation of the real thoughts and manoeuvrings of scientists at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Centre and their international colleagues. The scientists argue that while some of the phrasing may have been unfortunate, there is nothing in the documents to undermine the validity of mainstream climate science.
Climategate certainly inflamed the debate over climate change, in the UK, the US and elsewhere.
In 2012 the Norfolk Police announced they were abandoning their investigation into who hacked into the university’s computer and then distributed what they found.
But what have been the longer-term consequences of this incident, for public opinion, media reporting and international policy-making on climate change? Chris Vallance investigates, asking if this was it a political crime, and, if so, how effective has it been?

"**A former magistrates' court is to reopen in a bid to deal with a ""record high"" backlog of 1,000 legal cases.**
Cirencester Court will be used for magistrates and crown court hearings, Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) has said.
Martin Surl said: ""Waiting lists are already higher than they've ever been and according to worst-case scenarios, it could be at least 2022 before they catch up.""
Hearings will begin from January.
""Behind those 1,000 cases there are more than 1,000 victims, witnesses and defendants with a court appearance hanging over their heads,"" Mr Surl added.
The PCC, who is independent, offered to loan the building seven months ago.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Justice announced it would adopt the building as a so-called Nightingale court.
Mr Surl said: ""Be in no doubt, coronavirus has brought our only remaining courts to their knees.
""The magistrates' court in Cheltenham has been unable to function fully and without the first rung in the justice ladder, little can go to the crown court.""
Maintenance work is under way to bring the building back into use.
Cirencester Court adjoins the town's police station and used to operate as a magistrates' court and reserve crown court.
It closed in 2012 as part of national spending cuts and was acquired by the PCC to ""protect the integrity of the police estate"".

If nothing else gives away the truth about climate alarmism, the propensity of its adherents to resort to denunciation, witch-hunting and lawfare in order to silence sceptics should remove all doubt.



Michael “Hockey Stick” Mann has launched (and lost) a series of vexatious court actions against his critics. Climate alarmists in the US argued for using anti-organised crime laws to prosecute doubters. Sceptics are vilified, smeared and sued.



These are not the actions of scientists. These are the actions of apparatchiks and despots.



One of their biggest victims in Australia has been Professor Peter Ridd. As [already covered in the BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/they-thought-it-was-good-ridd-ance/), for daring to point out that claims about the threat of climate change to the Great Barrier Reef are alarmist nonsense with little basis in fact, Ridd was sacked from his position at Australia’s James Cook University. Ridd took his former employer to court and won.



But the university is determined to waste no end of taxpayers’ money in order to burn down the heretic.



Back in April, Judge Salvatore Vasta delivered a withering judgment against James Cook University, which he concluded had abused Peter Ridd from pillar to post. Before reading on, it is worth reviewing his criticisms of JCU, especially this one:



 **The manner in which JCU trawled through his emails, to try and find some more evidence of breaches of the Code of Conduct, was reprehensibly unfair to Professor Ridd, especially since he was entitled to write everything that he wrote.**



And this:



 **It would seem that the only way in which Professor Ridd could potentially mitigate his loss is if there were a changing of the guard at the University and [Vice-Chancellor Sandra] Harding and [Provost Chris] Cocklin were no longer in their positions. There is no evidence this will happen any time soon.**



This a shocking verdict on JCU. The judge is openly stating that its most senior management deserve to be sacked.



One might think the judgment’s 34-page flogging would be enough to see JCU lick its wounds, write some cheques and hope that the education minister, formerly Simon Birmingham and currently Dan Tehan, had not been paying too much attention to the disgraceful state of academic freedom on the North Queensland campus.



Which is not much different to most of the other campuses in Australia. The campuses where, for instance, anti-Semitic movements are not just allowed, but openly encouraged; or staff pursue spurious vendettas against students for years in the laughably-named “Human Rights Commission”. As is typical, JCU is pillaging the public purse to keep up its anti-science witch-hunt.



JCU […] is tapping what amounts to a bottomless pit of public money to mount an appeal. Professor Ridd isn’t so well-heeled, so must once again rattle the cup. At his fund-raising site he writes:



‘On hearing that JCU was appealing, Cheryl and I seriously considered just walking away. After all, why should I ask donors for $1.5M to fight a pointless battle that the State or Federal education ministers could settle with a phone call to JCU. $1.5M is a crazy amount that could be used for much better things.’



‘JCU will use its infinite financial resources – effectively government money – to appeal. They have hired three or four senior barristers, one of which we are told charges over $20K per day and between them must be over $40K per day.’



‘Last week JCU also stayed the judgement and capped my access to the compensation for legal fees.’



‘So I must very regretfully ask again for help. We need the best legal assistance to ensure a win. My fabulous legal team led by Stuart Wood AM QC has greatly discounted their costs so far. But appeals are horribly expensive and we need to be prepared to ultimately go to the High Court.’



  
This is the absolute state of modern academia: vindictive apparatchiks wield state power and money in order to hunt down dissenters.



Trofim Lysenko must be laughing in Hell.

"**All retail outlets, hairdressers, museums and libraries have reopened in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday in an easing of Covid-19 restrictions.**
Ireland had been in lockdown for nearly six weeks, with rules similar to those in spring, except schools stayed open and construction continued.
It is now moving from the most severe level five restrictions to level three.
People will now also be able to attend religious services and play golf and tennis again.
Gatherings of 15 people can take place outdoors and gyms and swimming pools can reopen, as can hotels and guesthouses, with services limited to residents only.
However, people will not be allowed to leave their county except for essential reasons such as work, education or a medical appointment.
Households have been told not to mix with other households outside their bubble until Christmas week.
People are still advised to work from home where possible, and a face covering should be worn outdoors on busy streets, inside crowded workplaces and in places of worship.
From Friday, restaurants and pubs that have a kitchen and serve food will reopen.
However, pubs that do not serve food will remain closed except for delivery or take-away services.
From 18 December until 6 January, people will be allowed to travel outside of their county and up to three households will be allowed to meet indoors.
Non-essential shops in Northern Ireland are currently closed until 11 December.
Some shoppers queued outside Penney's in Dublin from 04:30 local time on Tuesday ahead of it reopening.
Leonard Watson, who is the owner of a menswear clothing business in Letterkenny, County Donegal, has said it has been a long six weeks but he is delighted to be reopening again.
""It is great to get the doors open again in the run up to Christmas,"" Mr Watson said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the business owner said, if given the option, he would much rather have been closed for the past five weeks if it meant he could be open for the next two weeks in December.
""It is the golden quarter, December is the month for us as independent retailers to make most of our money that covers us through the quiet months of January and February.
""We are still here, people need the high streets and we just hope people will continue to shop local.""
Mr Watson said he accepted that shops being open was conditional on coronavirus case numbers remaining low, but said he was hopeful local retailers would be able to get at least some Christmas trade.
Paddy Malone, from Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, said more than 300 shops in the Dundalk area had availed of financial assistance from the Irish government to help them go online during the lockdown.
""The local office did more in the past four months than they did over the past five years of getting businesses to switch online,"" he said.
Last month, it was reported that TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar had advised against cross-border travel to Northern Ireland at Christmas, but he later said that was not the case.
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Monday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said no-one in the Irish government was suggesting that people could not cross the border.
""What needs to happen north and south is for people to respect the restrictions that are in place,"" Mr Coveney said.
""We are seeing strong advice coming from the executive in the north and the government in the south that there should be no non-essential travel.
""So in other words if people need to see a relative, if people need to travel for work or for study or medical reasons or other essential reasons, of course they are allowed to travel.
""But we're trying to contain a killer disease here and so people need to be responsible in how they travel, how they move around so we can limit the spread of this disease."""
"HAMBURG, Germany  —   Workplaces often display a particular type of signage: “This Department Has Worked __ Days Without An Accident. ” These notices, with their hopefully ascending numbers, are meant to remind employees of institutional standards, of individual responsibilities, of the importance of mindfulness and consistency. The Hamburger S. V. clock is sort of like that. Displayed prominently in the northwest corner of Hamburg’s cavernous home, the Volksparkstadion, the clock marks the total time, down to the second, that the team has spent in the Bundesliga, the top tier of German soccer. Last Friday, the digital numbers, glowing in white, ticked relentlessly upward when the club hosted Bayer Leverkusen: 53 years, 163 days, 3 hours, 31 minutes, 28 seconds at kickoff, all without an accident. As you read this sentence, they continue to mark the days, the hours, the seconds. In Hamburg, the simple act of keeping time commemorates an essential fact of the club’s identity. A founding member, it has played continuously in the Bundesliga since the league’s first competitive moments, on Aug. 24, 1963, at 5 p. m. It is a distinction no other German club can boast. Not the former European champion Borussia Dortmund. Not Hamburg’s Nordderby rival, and fellow founding member, Werder Bremen. Not even mighty Bayern Munich. All this helps explain the complicated angst once again shadowing this city’s biggest team. Pride outstripped performance here long ago. After decades of producing quality soccer  —   Hamburg has three Bundesliga titles on its résumé, and it reigned as the champion of Europe at the end of the   season  —   the club is currently mired in a yearslong rut. Hamburg narrowly avoided its first relegation in 2012, and has survived two even closer calls since then. Now, a stream of losses this season has once again plunged the club toward the bottom of the standings. And the clock, a    reminder of the club’s venerated past, has in effect become a scale measuring in real time the incessantly mounting weight of history. “I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse right now,” said Toben Baumgarten, 24, a fan of the team since childhood. “This can be a point of pressure on the team. They have to keep the clock running. ” Hamburg moved up one place last weekend to 16th in the   league, with 15 games remaining. In the Bundesliga, the bottom two teams at the end of the season are automatically relegated. The    team must play a   playoff series against the   team from the second division, with the winner awarded the final spot in the upper tier. Hamburg grabbed that lifeline in 2014 and 2015, pulling itself to safety and keeping its clock ticking. The club’s poor play, for now, has not much dampened its support. There were 45, 653 fans at the game on Friday, many of them eager to diagnose the team’s ills, to offer variations on similar themes: The players are afraid to lose history has handcuffed the club moves geared toward     have suppressed big, fresh ideas. According to Bobby Wood, an American striker who joined the club last May on a   contract, it does not take long for new players to grasp the depth of the club’s history, to absorb its pride  —   or to inherit its emotional baggage. It’s hard to avoid: In 2014, a small, digital version of the clock was mounted in the front window of the team bus. “You don’t want to be a guy on the team that gets relegated after all these years,” Wood said. “Just because we never got relegated doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen, so you can’t think it’s not going to happen. If we continue this way, we will get relegated. We have to get out of that mentality, start realizing we’re in a bad situation, and do something different to get out of it. ” Things have not always been this dire. Hamburg, which has played in Germany’s top tier since the modern incarnation of the club was formed in 1919, has captured six domestic league titles over all, and three German Cups. It won the European Cup in 1983, in the midst of a golden era that ran from the   to the  . When the first clock was installed in 2001, the team was mired in a spell of mediocrity that has extended to the present day. Back then it was a marker of pride as well as time. “We weren’t winning trophies at that point, so you look for the one thing everyone was proud about,” said Alexander Iwan, who was 7 years old when he watched Hamburg win the 1987 German Cup, the club’s last significant trophy. He still stands on the terraces every weekend, just below the clock, to sing alongside the team’s other   fans. Twelve years ago, his university studies and sports loyalties fortuitously merged when he began working as a historian for the team. Sometimes, while giving tours of the stadium, Iwan will direct his guests’ attention to the clock and mention Bayern Munich, the biggest club in Germany. Bayern has never been relegated either, but, crucially, it was not a founding member of the Bundesliga, and only played its way in in 1965. “They win two trophies a year,” Iwan tells them about Munich. “But we have this. ” Iwan said the clock serves as a reminder of the club’s pedigree, regardless of its current state. No matter what, he added, it is loaded with meaning. “It shows everything  —   all the history, all the problems  —   at once,” he said. Hamburg won its game on Friday at the Volksparkstadion,   with a workmanlike performance against visiting Leverkusen. The players launched themselves into tackles, skidding around the damp field, earning appreciative applause from the crowd. Around the 28th minute, and for the next several minutes, fans belted out a popular club song, which borrows the melody of “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister: Sechs mal Deutscher meister,   German champion, Drei mal pokalsieger,   cup winner, Immer erste liga, H. S. V.! Always first division, H. S. V.! What would happen if the team got sent down? The song, for one thing, would disappear with the last tick of the clock. Patrik Voss, 31, predicted frustrations would boil over in vivid ways. “I think many people would be aggressive, angry,” he said. “Some riots, protests, might go on. ” The clock, Voss presumed, would be removed, never to be seen again. But others on Friday suggested it should be saved, perhaps used to count down to some predetermined deadline for promotion. And some said relegation might even serve as an overdue notice for the organization. Such thought exercises have been more common over the last five years, mental gymnastics amid the   and the relegation playoff escapes. The clock, in the process, has sometimes become an object of jokes and scorn. Iwan said local newspapers often use headline puns playing on timepiece imagery. Sometimes, they have replaced text headlines altogether with images of the clock. Many fans have grown more cynical. “I think if we were not successful right now, we wouldn’t be so proud about always being in the league,” said Baumgarten, the young fan. “It’s more like there’s nothing else to be proud about, so you talk about the history a lot. ” Sipping a beer before Friday’s game, Baumgarten recalled going to a Hamburg game as a child and listening to his father explain the clock’s meaning. He was impressed, and the feeling stuck with him through the years as his devotion to the club grew. “I hope if I come here with my own son one day, I can show him the clock,” he said, smiling at his sudden sentimentality. “We’ll see. ”"

"**A council is challenging the government's decision to put it into tier three after the current lockdown restrictions end.**
Stratford-on-Avon District Council said it had sent a judicial review pre-action letter to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock.
Tony Jefferson, leader of the Conservative-run council, said it was not ""an action we take lightly"".
He said the data did not ""warrant"" the area being place in tier three.
According to official figures, in the week to 27 November the rate of infection for Stratford-upon-Avon was 74.6.
The area was in tier one before before England's second lockdown was introduced.
Mr Jefferson said the decision to put the Stratford district in tier three ""therefore appears arbitrary and irrational"".
""It is very disappointing that the government did not use much greater granularity in deciding on tiers,"" he said.
""I know that they have looked at a number of factors including the rates in all age groups, particularly older people who are more vulnerable to the virus; and we have to take into consideration the pressure on our local hospitals and NHS services.
""However, none of the metrics for our district warrant it being placed in tier three.""
Mr Jefferson said hospitality businesses were ""devastated"" at being placed into the highest tier and the prospect of a review by 16 December was ""no consolation"".
The district forms part of a sub-regional group for the purposes of being placed into tier three, which includes the rest of the county, together with Coventry and Solihull.
Infection rates for Nuneaton and Bedworth, in the county's north, was 207, the North Warwickshire district was 205.3, Solihull 159, Coventry 177.9, Rugby 152.4 and Warwick 105.
It has previously been reported Stratford had the lowest average case rate of any area in the country being placed into tier three.
The Department of Health and Social Care has been asked to comment.

Next week’s climate beano at the UN is shaping up to be a bit of a fizzer. Rare as it is for the hangers-on and blood-suckers of Big Climate to turn down some free wine and cheese and business class flights, as we’ve already reported on _The BFD_ , “Few world leaders are lining up…the New York agenda looks deflated”.



You’d think, then, that beggars wouldn’t be choosers. But no, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres seems not to be bothering even hiding any more that climate change is a massive wealth-redistribution scam.



Australia has been barred from speaking at a UN climate summit in New York next week, where China and India will call for ­trillions of dollars more in climate funding from the developed world.



Other big economies, including the US and Japan, have also been silenced because they have not agreed to increase their am­bitions to tackle climate change.



Despite being one of the world’s top investors in ­renew­able energy last year, ­Australia is criticised for relying heavily on coal and refusing to contribute fur­ther money to a green climate fund […] China and India, which are still investing in coal-fired power at home and around the world, are treated differently under the UN rules as developing nations.



Both will address the UN conference to argue that the different treatment of developed and developing nations should continue and that more money is needed.



In other words, despite having the third and fifth largest economies in the world, these shiftless grifters are still going to ram it up the West’s tailpipe for as much money as they can scam.



A statement issued by China on Wednesday said […]“China urges the developed countries to honour the commitment of $US100bn allocation each year from 2020 […]”



India said […]“The recent estimates for taking climate actions are laying out a case for trillions of dollars, and not billions, in new and additional financing.”



 **They’re not even bothering to pretend, any more.**



Joseph Conrad wrote of the 19th century “Scramble for Africa”, that “They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got”. Even Conrad would be astonished by the rapacity of the Scramble for the West.



But the mega-wealthy Chinese and Indian mendicants are not content to merely rob the West blind: they’re determined to rub our noses in it at the same time.



Fewer than one-third of the 197 parties to the Paris Agreement will be allowed to address the New York conference.



Australia’s leadership are at least treating this globalist smash-and-grab with the indifference it deserves.



Scott Morrison will not be attendin­g the New York conference. Australia will be represented by Foreign Minister Marise Payne.
