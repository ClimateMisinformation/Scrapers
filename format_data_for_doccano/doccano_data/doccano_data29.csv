This source of energy is not only affordable for consumers, but it is relatively environmentally friendly as well. But exploiting the gas would require governments and believers to abandon a big part of the green religion, i.e. renewables.
What do people do when they get so deep into an investment, and have worked so hard to convince everyone it is the right and moral thing to do, and then find out that there’s suddenly a much better and cheaper way? Do they simply abandon the entire endeavour? If the endeavour has become a religion and the meaning of life for them, the answer is no. They continue on a path to self-destruction.
That may indeed be the case for Europe and the Green Movement, who are now so deep into renewable energy that they may have gone beyond a psychological and emotional point of no return, a tipping point, and so they will refuse to abandon it no matter the cost. That could mean that the cheap and plentiful gas beneath our feet will simply be kept there, and we will be forced to continue paying exorbitant prices for an unreliable energy source and endure lots of pain.
Technically and economically, the recent discoveries of these huge deposits of natural shale gas in Europe make all the renewable energy pain completely unnecessary in the future. That ought to be good news, and governments ought to be breathing sighs of relief. But it isn’t so. Many European governments are not about to let anything disrupt their romantic visions of a future of renewables and the Truth.
Remember they are enlightened and infallible. So forget the drilling permits.

Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxiener at the online DIE WELT explain how the discoveries of shale natural gas have rendered renewable energies a complete flop. In a piece called Our Energy Dreamers Are Burning Money Instead Of Gas, they write:
Everywhere globally, huge reserves of natural gas have been discovered, from Israel to Qatar, from South Africa to Ukraine or Poland. The discoveries exceeded all expectations. The USA has found so much gas that it can become completely independent of imports. At current levels of consumption, there are enough for 100 years. And also Europe has gas for at least another 50 years – whereby the second biggest reserve is in North Rhine Westphalia.
Anyone in good psychological health would welcome such a blessing. But it seems we are living in times of increasing power madness. For example Maxiener and Miersch comment on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA), reaction:
But instead of expressing delight over the gas reserves, many of the archictects of our energy future are in a state of shock.
Equally shocked are the German energy dreamers with their solar cells because natural gas is relatively environmentally friendly and far more affordable than the option of Green-romantic alternatives.
So instead of burning the gas, the government will ask its citizens to burn their money to stay warm.

The warmists are all confused – most definitely. They want to eat their cake, and have it too. In doing so, they are really looking like real jackasses.
Today they are telling us: warm periods are unstable (and cold is stable). Yet, history shows just the opposite.
Lately we’ve been hearing lots of reports about the floods in Australia and mudslides and rains in Brazil – instability due to global warming, they’re telling us.
And last month they told us that all the cold in Europe and snow in North America were sure signs of instability in the climate system – brought on by all the man-made warming.
And be prepared for more and even worse extremes in the future as human activity pushes global temps higher, they warn. After all, warm is bad (and cold is good).
History shows that warm times are good, cold times are bad
Unfortunately for the media, yesterday Der Spiegel online reported on a new study appearing in Science, which I wrote about here. Der Spiegel writes comprehensively how the cold times in Europe lead to crop failures, starvation, disease, war and death – lots of death. At times large parts of the population were wiped out.
But as Der Spiegel writes: societies prospered during the warm times.
This is not what the warmists want you to hear. It’s the complete opposite of what they believe, or want you to believe. So this new Science report puts the warmist in a bit of a jam. After all, we’re supposed to believe that warm is bad, cold is good.
In covering the new Science report, warmist media outlets are falling all over themselves to avoid connecting the miserable times of history with the cold periods. Instead they are calling these cold times “dry times” or “periods of climate instability”.
For example Reuters, the Wapo and BBC are all reporting on this Science paper – but in unusually acrobatic ways to cover up the fact that cold is bad – and end up falling flat on their faces.

Here’s how Reuters puts it (emphasis added):
Good growth by oak and pine trees in central Europe in the past 2,500 years signalled warm and wet summers and coincided with periods of wealth among farming societies, for instance around the height of the Roman empire or in medieval times.
Periods of climate instability overlapped with political turmoil, such as during the decline of the Roman empire, and might even have made Europeans vulnerable to the Black Death or help explain migration to America during the chill 17th century.
The good times were the warm times, and here Reuters calls the bad times “periods of climate instability” and not cold periods. These  journalists are just making idiots of themselves. They know they’ve screwed up big time by hitching their wagon to the global warming hysteria. History has contradicted everything they’ve been claiming for the last 20 years.
Here’s how Stephen Stromberg of the WaPo puts it.
Writing in the journal Science, the experts claim that Rome’s Third Century Crisis — a period of political and economic unrest that inaugurated the empire’s slow decline — coincided with “distinct drying” recorded in tree rings, which may have rendered European agriculture less productive. Not just that — the appearance of the Plague in Western Europe correlates with a wet period, which may have provided conditions favorable for spreading the Plague.
Stromberg calls the cold time during the decline of the Roman empire “distinct drying”. The time of the Plague he refers to happens to be cooling time, which he dubs a “wet period” – but he just can’t bring himself to say “cold period”. In both cases sneaky little Stromberg tries to hide the fact that these nasty events events occurred in COLD TIMES.

Now here’s how the BBC put it (emphasis added):
A team of researchers based their findings on data from 9,000 wooden artifacts from the past 2,500 years. They found that periods of warm, wet summers coincided with prosperity, while political turmoil occurred during times of climate instability.
Very similar to Reuters. Here the Beeb also cannot bring itself to call the periods “cold”, and so dubs them “times of instability”. None of them mention that these changes were all natural.
Yet today, ignoring and even hiding history, they insist the opposite: claiming that warm is unstable and that cool would mean more stability.
They’ve painted themselves into a corner. Real jack-asses to say the least.

"For the first time in my life, climate breakdown is high up on the UK’s political agenda. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the Amazon fires and the hottest day on record in the UK have meant we can no longer ignore the fate of the planet we live on. But there’s another reason we’re talking about the climate crisis. For the past six months, young people like myself have taken to the streets month after month, calling for urgent climate action and demanding an internationalist Green New Deal – an immediate change to the cataclysmic system that created, enabled and perpetuates the climate crisis.  The energy we bring to the climate movement as young organisers leaves a mark on those who hear about us. The impact is clear – millions will be taking part in the global climate strike today, with the Trades Union Congress backing our call for stoppages here in the UK. But this alone is not enough. We can’t limit ourselves to one day, or even one week, of action. We need visions, plans and manifestos filled with radical policies for climate justice. So it is fitting that the climate strike will take place a day before the annual conference of a party built on the self-organisation of the working class for a free and equal socialist society. To save our dying planet from a devastating humanitarian crisis, Labour must go to war with the corporate tyranny responsible for the ecological emergency. After all, it’s not a coincidence that the climate crisis has grown at the same time as inequality balloons to grotesque levels. The fight against ecological collapse, then, is a fight for human rights, for safety and security, and for the right of every young person to a liveable future. It is a fight for socialism, against capitalist barbarism. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party recognises this. But to fulfil this vision, and to end the profit-driven system driving us over the climate cliff edge, it must commit to a radical and transformational Green New Deal, including a just transition, the creation of millions of green jobs and decarbonisation by 2030. To tackle the havoc wreaked by Conservative governments, and to establish itself as a voice for a new generation of young activists, Labour must rise to the moment, offering a new system premised on democratic ownership. In this demand, youth strikers and Labour’s grassroots have been united. More than 100 constituencies have put forward motions to party conference calling for a Green New Deal. This is the clearest signal we have seen in a major political party, and an opportunity for Labour to take the lead in preventing the worst impacts of climate breakdown. Last autumn’s IPCC report revealed the devastating impacts of global temperatures hitting above 1.5C. We only have to look at those in the global south, who have been fighting these terrifying disasters for years, to see nature’s brutal retaliation to rising temperatures. Meanwhile, studies show that our carbon budget for even these levels of global warming will be exhausted all too soon. Aiming for zero carbon by 2030 is an essential act of solidarity with the global working class, recognising the structures of imperialism and colonialism that have played a key hand in the crisis. And it’s a first step to the UK addressing its historic responsibility for much of the ecological breakdown. The economy that a Labour Green New Deal seeks to build will work as much for people at home as for those abroad (and the planet), with millions of good, green jobs; universal basic services, including free or cheap public transport to link up the whole country; a four-day working week to both reduce emissions and improve public wellbeing; and clean cities, fresh air and green spaces. Climate can’t just be on the agenda; it is the agenda. The radical programme that Labour’s Green New Deal would offer would be one of hope and genuine systemic change that prioritises justice, equality and freedom over profits for the few. Labour must seize the mantle. • Noga Levy-Rapoport is a UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone reading last Friday’s piece here on the autobahn pile-up that killed 8 people (thankfully revised down from 10) because high-speed autobahn drivers were suddenly caught by a dust storm surely thought: “Hmmm, I wonder if warmists are going to blame this on climate change too?”
Yes we can!
Here it is at the online Bild in a headline story called: Dangerous Sandstorms Will Become More Frequent! Meteorologist Blames Climate Change. Bild writes:
A sudden sandstorm Friday led to aMass Car Crash near Rostock. Now a meteorologist warns: Such dangerous storms could be more frequent in the future! The fault is climate change.”
Of course driving too fast had nothing to do with it.
In last Friday’s piece, I did everything to avoid the temptation of writing “how long will it be before some opportunist steps up and blames climate change?” Not very long. That opportunist is publicity-seeker meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net, who also happens to be the official meteorologist of the Bild tabloid.
Northern Germany has received little rain over the last weeks and conditions were ripe for dust storms as farmers’ fields are exposed just as the planting season is getting ready to begin. Jung, who is a 33-year old whippersnapper, claims:
Climate change produces extreme weather conditions. Record heat waves, cold waves and extraordinary droughts, like the one that led to the sandstorm, are becoming more frequent.”
It’s the science that just cannot be falsified.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver at Sweden’s sceptic The Climate Scam, Jonny Fagerström writes how pro-wind-park organisation Swedish Wind Energy is lobbying to abolish the municipal veto in order to bypass public refusal of windparks. The public, whose landscape would be ruined, should not be allowed to have a say on whether or not a wind-park is to be installed in their area, read here: Wind Power Industry Threatens Democracy
Wind-park builders and operators find it a nuisance that pesky, stubborn residents refuse to have their local landscape industrialised and property values ruined. For the wind industry, permitting is proceeding much too slowly, and populations should just accept having the windmills forced down their throats, without any further ado.
Jonny writes the threat to strip citizens of their last democratic chance to have a say on their surroundings and life in general will seriously aggravate people, and thinks that politicians simply will not take this proposed abolishment of municipal democracy seriously, but adds:
You never know.
The wind industry has deep poskets, and politicians can be bought easily enough.
In Germany, according to the online Lübecker Nachricten, Citizens near the German port city of Lübeck are protesting a proposed wind-pack on an area of 750 acres that would be home to 14 turbines, each 170 meters tall. Read and see photo here.
Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, people’s rights are also being trampled on as well (h/t IceCap):

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Welt here reports that the EU plans to force consumers to save energy – 1.5% every year.According to plans by EU Commissar Günther Oettinger of Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party, energy suppliers in the future have to assure that their customers use less power and gas. Every year suppliers will have to reduce its market share by 1.5%
If that sounds economically retarded to you, you’re not alone.
I guess that means consumers must forget about expanding the family, or getting a bigger and more comfortable house, or buying an air conditioner. No – in Europe it’s downscale your lives – until you’re living in a cardboard box under a bridge. Die Welt writes:
Oettinger also expects public offices and buildings to join in. The draft law stipulates that beginning in January 2014, 3% of all buildings in all 27 member countries shall be made energy-efficient by renovation according to EU requirements.”
I wonder who is going to pay for all that. This sounds like one of the shovel-ready-jobs programs that worked so well under Obama. The proposed law will be introduced to the Parliament next month.
Of course, all the energy saving will be “voluntary” at first – at least during the years 2012 and 2013. But if the targets are not met, then in 2014 “the second bomb will be lit” and the Commission will enact “binding requirements”, Die Welt writes.
Not everybody is pleased about this state-controlled economy. For example, Herbert Reul, Chairman of the Industrial Committee in the EU-Parliament, says all this will lead to an “over-bureaucratization” and that the State “might as well just take over the entire energy sector and that what the EU proposes no longer has any semblance of a free market”.
For readers outside Germany, now you know how crazy on green Angela Merkel’s government truly is in pushing all this. The German CDU as it is today is a party that needs to go politically extinct – the sooner, the better. I can hardly differentiate it from the East German SED  in some areas.

"Ed Miliband has said Labour needs a “wartime” mobilisation on the climate emergency in the next decade as he warned the party not to splinter over fixed decarbonisation targets. The former secretary of state for energy and climate change praised Labour activists for their Green New Deal campaign which demands Labour commit to a net zero carbon date of 2030. The Tories have pledged to do so by 2050, and Liberal Democrats by 2045.  However divisions emerged at the party’s autumn conference in Brighton this weekend over whether Labour should be committed to a date or not. The GMB union hit back at the Labour for a Green New Deal motion committing the party to a 2030 target, and instead brought forward their own motion without an end date, a move due to concerns about energy sector jobs. Both motions will be voted on by delegates on Tuesday after a record 10-hour compositing meeting held on Sunday decided it was not possible to reach a compromise. “[The year] 2050 isn’t the radical position and now it’s seen as a conservative ‘small c’ position. Look, in the end whether it’s 2040, 30 or 50 we’ve got to have the next 10 years, and in the first five years of a Labour government an absolute wartime mobilisation. Now everybody agrees about that,” Miliband said during an event held by alternative festival The World Transformed, run by Momentum. “One of Labour’s best kept secrets is that on domestic policy we are incredibly united. There is a desire for radicalism across the Labour party. Across people who would be considered on the so called right of the party. So let’s not pick fights. “It’s good to have the compositing and all that and push as hard as you can but we’re the only party that can deliver on this and we want to deliver in the next 10 years, whatever it says on the conference resolution.” The Labour for a Green New Deal is a movement to transform industry in the future to ensure it tackles climate change, while creating investment and new green jobs. The decarbonisation of the economy through legislation has been pushed hard in the US by Democrats, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Labour has backed a green industrial revolution programme, led by shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy, Rebecca Long-Bailey, with billion pound investment commitments, including a major shift to electric cars. However, the motion presented by the Green New Deal campaign, and which had the support of up to 100 CLPs and Momentum, goes further, by adding a fixed target date. Miliband said Labour should have a radical green agenda, and push further than the Green party. He said: “There’s two ways this can go...it can either become an election issue or I’m afraid it will be like guns in the US, which is you have a good movement that is doing stuff on it but it never feels like it breaks through into being an election issue. That’s why Labour for a Green New Deal have done such an amazing job. “John McDonnell I think will be the first green chancellor we’ve ever had. Trust me on this we’ve got to make it an economic and social justice issue.” Miliband lambasted education secretary Gavin Williamson for criticising school pupils who missed out on school on Friday to take part in global climate change strikes. To cheers of activists in Brighton, he said: “By the way, that absolute moron, Gavin Williamson, said kids were bunking off, but this is a government that is bunking off for five weeks by closing down parliament.” The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  Ahead of Tuesday’s key vote on climate change motions, he warned again for the party to work with the unions, adding:“Firstly, keep protesting, keep striking, keep marching, keep the pressure on. Secondly this has got to be a working-class issue, not just a middle-class issue. “And our allies in the trade unions are incredibly important on this. I spoke to Paul Nowak [deputy general of the TUC]. He wants us to move forward as fast as we can but he’s worried about his workers in the oil and gas industry ... that’s what the just transition is all about.” Alex Mcintyre, spokesperson for Labour for a Green New Deal, said: “A Green New Deal needs an ambitious target for decarbonisation, or it is meaningless. “We understand and respect GMB’s concerns around the livelihoods of energy workers, which is why our motion calls for a 2030 target only if it assures a just transition for workers. “Our Green New Deal will be worker-led, creating millions of good, green jobs, building new green industries and empowering trade unions to fight for their rights. It’s the wealthiest that will pay for our Green New Deal, not workers and not ordinary people.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd I’m glad Dr. Spencer is coming out and calling it like it is.
It’s not often you hear a distinguished scientist rip into his colleagues as Roy Spencer does at his blog here yesterday. His essay is a reaction to the House vote to suspend the funding the corrupt IPCC. Here are some excerpts:
On the IPCC:
Politicians formed the IPCC over 20 years ago with an endgame in mind: to regulate CO2 emissions.”
and
Science progresses by investigating alternative explanations for things. Long ago, the IPCC all but abandoned that search.”
On the most vocal AGW scientists (natural climate change deniers):
They apparently do not realize that ‘settled science’ is an oxymoron. The most vocal climate scientists defending the IPCC have lost their objectivity.”

and
They have a theory — more CO2 is to blame — and they religiously stick to it.”
and
I am ashamed for our scientific discipline and embarrassed by their behavior. Is it any wonder that scientists have such a bad reputation among the taxpayers who pay them to play in their ivory tower sandboxes? They can make gloom and doom predictions all day long of events far in the future without ever having to suffer any consequences of being wrong.”
and
They have gotten away with too much, for too long.”
On energy policy:
Making our most abundant and affordable sources of energy artificially more expensive with laws and regulations will end up killing millions of people.”
You really need to read his entire post to appreciate it. And I certainly would love to see Dr Spencer get “the opportunity to cross examine these (natural) climate change deniers in a court of law”. These cowards have ducked debate long eneough.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple a days ago I reported on how the German media has hardly been reporting on global warming. Read here.
That should be no surprise because it’s been cold in Germany over the last 3 months, and so reporting on warming planet would only draw chuckles from the public. After all, August was cool and September in Germany was a 0.9″ C colder than normal – the 26th coldest September since 1900, according to the German Weather Service. Many have been heating their homes for 2 months already.
October is looking even worse. Already we’ve had widespread light frost and many places have already gotten snow, You hear nothing about this in the German lamestream media, though. Winter is weeks early.
At the online German Auto Reporter Net, Wolfram Riedel pokes fun at the climate panic purveyors and their deafensing silence.
Silence is everywhere in the media, not a warmist is stirring. All the excitement caused by the climate madness has taken a break. And why? Because the real-life weather which we’ve been experiencing over the last several weeks simply isn’t suitable for spreading global warming panic through the population.  September and October have been colder than normal, and even the first snow has already arrived.
There were some hot days last summer, and so the climate panic purveyors had an easier time painting the devil on the wall, who happens to be surrounded in a cloud of evil CO2.
And how do the coming months look? Also very cold.
The German media reported yesterday that towns and cities are stockpiling road salt because, says the media, “meteorologists are forecasting a harsh winter”.
Last year, having relied on the “rare and exciting winters” forecasts of  made by climatologists, towns ran out of salt already in early January. This year they’re listening to real forecasters – meteorologists.

"Greta Thunberg’s address to the UN’s Climate Action Summit on Monday may well prove to be the climate change movement’s Gettysburg Address. Like Abraham Lincoln’s revered speech, which ran to 273 words, Thunberg’s was also very short, only 495 words long. Lincoln famously spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery, following the leading orator of the day, Edward Everett, who took two hours to deliver the official address, a 13,000 word oration. Lincoln’s speech, simply described in the day’s official program as Dedicatory Remarks, lasted less than three minutes. Thunberg would similarly have had some good acts to follow at a UN talk-fest, but her presence would not, at first glance, seem to be of the same significance as those of the various world leaders who had gathered for the event. And yet it is Thunberg’s speech, which took just four-and-a-half minutes to deliver, which, one suspects, will resonate long into the future. In the manner that was then traditional, Everett’s marathon speech, deemed very good by the standards of the day, was rich with classical allusion. But Lincoln used no classical reference. Instead, in a way that it is hard to appreciate from this distance of time, he was profoundly modern, using Biblical phrasing and rhythms that appealed to a population for whom the Book was the word, not Sophocles. Thunberg’s speech was similarly phrased in the contemporary argot pitched to the polarising force of social media’s algorithms, suffused with a contained rage. For she came not with a dream, but a nightmare, the scientific truth of climate change succinctly put in five paragraphs. Her dreams, she said, had been stolen from her along with her childhood. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing? Thunberg’s speech was damned by many, a Fox News commentator responding to the speech by calling Thunberg “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. So too Lincoln, the London Times in 1863 not so very distant from Fox News in 2019, when, echoing some US newspapers, opined : “The ceremony [at Gettysburg] was rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.” Thunberg’s speech used phrases and ideas she has deployed before and to better effect. So too Lincoln. But what gives both speeches their enormous power is timing, each coming after historic events the significance of which had not yet been fully understood and was still in the process of creation. In Lincoln’s case it was the Battle of Gettysburg that had taken place a few months earlier, now regarded as a turning point in the civil war. In Thunberg’s case it was the massive global strike of schoolchildren a few days earlier inspired by her original, solitary strike on the steps of the Swedish parliament. Lincoln’s speech sought to give meaning to the enormous blood sacrifice of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the war more generally; in doing so he was shaping the future of the war and his nation. Thunberg’s singular achievement was to present the climate change issue as a battle for power. In doing so she spoke with the authority of the millions who marched only a few days before. For this Donald Trump trolled her. He intuited her power and tried to destroy it through mockery. In her speech Thunberg sets up an opposition between the plural we – those who want action on climate change – and a strangely singular use of the word you – those who don’t. And though she was speaking to an audience largely composed of those with power, her you was not only the assembled global leaders but everyone, and her we, while directly referring to the young and Friday’s three million marchers, was a we open to all, infinitely expandable. For the you is not just Trump or Scott Morrison or a fossil fuel company executive. Her you is personal. It is each of us who hears but as if in a nightmare cannot act. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing, condemning yourself to the ranks of those who the future “will never forgive”? On Wednesday the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the nation’s creepy gaslighter-in-chief, criticised Thunberg for similar reasons to Trump, saying, “I think we’ve got to caution against raising the anxieties of children in our country.” Since 1996 – seven years before Greta Thunberg was born – the Liberal party has been working assiduously to advance the cause of fossil fuel companies at the expense of our future. Morrison’s paternalistic piffle is just one more piece of grotesque bad faith on an issue about which the Liberal record is one of lying, scheming and wrecking at every step for over two decades. With his bluster of quiet Australians, Morrison is trying to pull a spit hood over the nation to silence us all. Recently released Australian cabinet papers reveal the Howard Liberal government was conspicuously campaigning in 1996 against legally binding, uniform emission reduction targets in the Kyoto protocol, with the prime minister’s advocacy to key world leaders proving “influential”. When uniform targets were eventually dropped, the Liberal cabinet praised John Howard’s negotiating strategy. If the world continues on its trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years “Australia is in a special position,” the cabinet papers record Howard saying. “We are a developed country that is a major exporter of energy.” And so it went for the next two decades. With the Liberals and the Murdoch press running political cover, the fossil fuel industries ramped up and up. By 2019 the Liberal party had defined itself as the party of coal, and a craven Labor party, after its defeat in the most recent election, is now following its lead. Today Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and LNG, and over the next decade Australia hopes to double its coal production. In consequence Australia is well on the way to becoming a pariah state along with the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia, its people hostage to the profits of its fossil fuel industry. The gross corruption of Australian public life so recently on display with examples of large sums of money from the Chinese Communist party seeming to flow into both Liberal and Labor coffers show exactly how easily purchased an enfeebled and unresponsive Australian democracy has become. And the corollary, the shameful, shared refusal of both Labor and Liberal parties to back a much-needed national corruption commission suggests only the obvious: the depth and breadth of corruption of our national polity. And yet while avoiding the criminality among their own, our leaders have been keen to criminalise those who actively campaign for our future. Queensland – the epicentre for major new coalmines – has significantly strengthened its laws against environmental protesters while lawyers for the Adani mine have publicly stated that they will seek to bankrupt any opponents of their new coalmine, the most controversial in the world, commercially viable only with the subsidies and tax breaks given for its consumption by the Indian government and for its production by Australian governments. When Morrison infamously brandished a lump of coal in parliament he told Australians not to be scared. But we should be. Australia is already living the grim consequences of climate change. If the world continues on its present trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years. The climate collapse is here. For over 30 years those who wished for action on climate change have believed that reason and truth would persuade those with power to act. But it is not so, and it did not prove to be so, and therein lies much of the reason carbon levels continue to rise and the planet’s very future is today hanging by the thinnest of threads. For power never gives to reason. Power bends only to power. And on Monday a schoolgirl raised the spectre of an opposing power that is now rising around the world and which will not be satisfied by those “who can only talk about money and fairytales of eternal economic growth”. “The young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you … We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.” Watching Greta Thunberg’s speech I understood what last Friday was about: a historic turning point where for the first time the power of we met the power of you without artifice, without compromise and with a ferocious courage. Millions marched last Friday. The next march will be bigger. The battle lines are finally clear. And each of us must now decide: am I you or am I we?

"A global campaign backed by 450 activist groups and celebrities, including actors Emma Thompson and Mark Ruffalo, is calling on the UN to endorse a global end to fracking before the industry torpedoes efforts to tackle the climate crisis. The open letter to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, includes signatures from individuals representing global environmental movements, universities and faith groups. The campaign also has backing from writer and activist Naomi Klein and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface. The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled. In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests, legal challenges and planning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government's fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking. The open letter said fracking for fossil fuels “torpedoes our global efforts to tackle climate change and violates basic human rights”. Hydraulic fracturing is more commonly known as fracking and involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The open letter to the UN comes seven years after the UN Environment Programme issued a global alert on fracking, which concluded it may have adverse environmental impacts even if done properly. The letter also points to the “overwhelming scientific documenting” of the fracking industry’s negative impact on the environment, public health and the climate crisis. The activist signatories include members of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Robert Howarth, a professor at Cornell University in the US and one of the letter’s signatories, said fracking for shale gas was a climate disaster because the process releases huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. He said: “Over the past decade, methane levels have been rising rapidly in the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the unprecedented global climate disruption seen in recent years.” Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and threatens to accelerate the pace of global heating. Howarth added: “Over 60% of the increased global methane emissions are from the oil and gas industry, and shale gas development in North America is responsible for one-third of the increased emissions from all sources.” Emma Thompson, who also supported the climate protests led by Extinction Rebellion in central London earlier this year, said: “Fracking is the fossil fuel world’s worst idea to date” and called it “an affront to common sense, common health and the safety of the planet”. She added: “It’s pointless, expensive, doesn’t create jobs that will serve a community, but it does pollute, damage and contribute to wrecking the climate. Its poisonous presence in our green and pleasant land is an as a whole.”"

The prices that is. The UK Daily Mail reports today that inflation has reached the highest level in 20 years. Price increases have been fuelled primarily by an increase in VAT from 17.5% to 20%, and spiralling energy prices. The Mail writes:
For millions, the biggest battle is finding the money to fill up their car. The average price of petrol and diesel has never been higher. For example, a 50-litre diesel car now costs £70 to fill, compared with £59 last year. Unions said the inflation figures from the Office for National Statistics show ‘how tough it is for working families struggling to afford the most basic necessities, like food and fuel’.
Dr Ros Altmann, the director general of Saga, described the inflation figures as ‘truly dreadful’.”
Indeed a litre of petrol is up 14.7% in February over a year earlier, a litre of diesel is up 19.7%. And a litre of pure vegetable oil is up a whopping 42% and electricity up 6.5% . For petrol and diesel that all translates into something like $8 or$9 a gallon. This is the near future in America if you let the envirokooks get their way.
Risk of blackouts in Germany
Meanwhile in Germany electricity prices are also jumping. And as the country shuts down 7 of its nuclear power plants in a panic reaction to Fukushima, pressure for even higher prices will certainly mount. FOCUS magazine reports here that:

Many consumers are now threatened with a bad surprise when they get their next electric bills. According to an energy portal, prices will increase at 43 utilities. Also gas consumers are hit.
The announced price increases of the 43 utilities are at an average of 6.5%, according to the consumer portal.”
 
Natural gas prices are also rising. FOCUS reports that 37 utilities will jack up the prices.
High energy costs are not the only factor causing woes for German consumers. Soon they may no longer be able to rely on a steady supply. Yet another FOCUS report warns of possible blackouts, writing:
The German Energy Agency cautions on an overly hasty shutdown of nuclear energy. Switching off seven reactors power outages. The power grid needs to be massively expanded.”
The expansion of the power grid of course is to accommodate offshore windfarms and solar panels. The 7 nuclear power plants are scheduled to be shut down in May.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the climate conference now taking place in Bonn with the aim of coming up with a successor to the 2012-expiring Kyoto Protocol for Durban later this year, signs of success are non-existent.
Obituaries are now being written everywhere in the German press, also see here and here.
For that we can all breathe a big sigh of relief – saved again from another huge Soviet-scale bureaucratic folly run by enviro-zealots.
The latest obit appears today in the leftist online Frankfurter Rundschau titled Kyoto Dies, which frames the current conference as follows:
If the EU fails to give a signal of a breakthrough, then the conference in Durban in December threatens to be a flop. That would make the Kyoto process practically dead -– almost 20 years after it started at the UN Earth Conference in Rio de Janeiro.”
With the USA, Russia, Canada and Japan out, and only countries that represent 20% of the global emissions still in it, the death of Kyoto is assured.

Not everyone has given up hope. For example “climate expert” Christoph Bals of tree-mater (we’re talking about real enviro-perverts here) group Germanwatch hope that Europe will summon the courage to take the lead and be the first to leap into the abyss of economic suicide. The Frankfurter Rundschau writes:
He demands the EU increase its reduction targets for the year 2020 from 20% to 30%. In fact the EU has already reached 17%.”
Most of that 17% reduction came in the early 1990s from shutting down inefficient industries centrally-run by the Eastern European communists, whom the tree-maters admire so much.
Meanwhile here’s how Der Spiegel starts off:
Already at the start of the climate conference in Bonn hopes were next to zero. No one gave a successor protocol  for the 2012-expiring Kyoto Climate protocol a chance of being passed on time, said UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres. Now, 11 days later, the renewed failure is perfect: there is hardly any tangible progress.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlorida State University scientist Dr Ryan Maue has an update on global tropical storm activity.
Now if global warming causes more, and more intense storms, then there must be some serious cooling going on right about now. Storms are practically off the radar! Here’s the chart for the last 40 years.

Dr Maue writes, adding his own emphasis:

Global Tropical Cyclone ACE does not show an upward trend in communion with global temperatures.”

Where’s the media? He also writes (emphasis added):
The March 21, 2011 00Z ECMWF deterministic 10-day forecast does not indicate another TC developing during the month. This will bring the previous 12-month total of global TCs down to 63 — by far the lowest in the last 40-years or more.”
Dr, Maue also says that this level is possibly “unprecedented”. 
So what should we start expecting from the “climate scientists? First they said global warming would lead to warmer temperatures. But then they changed their minds and said that it leads to colder winters. That means we can expect them to reverse on tropical storms and claim that warming will cause tropical storm inactivity.
But don’t count on it. For that to happen, the global warming “scientists” would first have to jump out of the pockets of reinsurers and into the pockets of those with interest in no storms, whoever that could be.

"Italian authorities have closed off roads and evacuated homes after experts warned that a portion of a Mont Blanc glacier is at risk of collapse. Stefano Miserocchi, the mayor of the town of Courmayeur, said “public safety is a priority” after experts from the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountains Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice was in danger of sliding off the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak. “This phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” Miserocchi said in a statement. Experts have been monitoring the glacier closely since 2013 to detect the speed at which the ice is melting, and Miserocchi said the rate had “significantly increased” recently. But they are unable to predict when the ice would break away. “There are currently no empirical models or methods that can enable quantitative predictions in the case of glaciers with sliding dynamics such as Planpincieux,” Miserocchi added. The warning comes as world leaders meet in New York for the UN climate action summit. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “The news that part of Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that should not leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and force us to mobilise.” In 2017, about 50 cubic metres of ice fell from Planpincieux, while in September last year a mass of ice broke away from the Glacier de la Charpoua, on the south-east side of the Aiguille Verte, on the French side of Mont Blanc. Miserocchi’s order came into force on Tuesday and includes the evacuation of homes and mountain refuges in the area. He said it was a precautionary measure and there was no threat to residential areas or tourist establishments. The zones affected are in the area of Val Ferret. Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, with environmental activists in Switzerland holding their second “mourning ceremony” on the evaporating Pizol glacier in the country’s Glarus Alps on Monday. The glacier has lost up to 90% of its volume since 2006. In August, a similar event was held at a glacier in Iceland. A heatwave across Europe this summer is also said to have accelerated the melt speed."
"School climate protesters who took to the streets in huge numbers across the UK last week are threatening to boycott the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship deal with BP. In a letter being sent to the RSC on Thursday, a group representing young people in towns and cities across the UK, says it will launch a boycott campaign unless the theatre company severs its ties with big oil. The move comes amid growing concern among young people over the escalating climate crisis. Last week, millions of children took part in the global climate strike and this week the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN headquarters in New York for their “betrayal” of young people. BP sponsors the RSC’s £5 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, but the school strikers say the theatre company’s tie-up puts young people in an impossible position. “If we, as young people, wish to see an affordable play at your theatre we have to help to promote a company that is actively destroying our futures by wrecking the climate,” the letter says.  “As an organisation that appears to care about climate breakdown, it simply makes no sense for you at the Royal Shakespeare Company to be accepting sponsorship from a company that is the third biggest corporate source of greenhouse gases in history.” The pressure is growing on arts institutions to sever their ties with fossil fuel firms, and this year there have been a series of protests by artists and campaigners at UK cultural institutions such as the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Natural History Museum. In June Mark Rylance, who had been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, resigned from his position saying BP’s sponsorship deal allowed the company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities”, which he said threatened the future of the planet. School strike organisers say the RSC “needs young people far more than it needs BP, with children and young people making up the bulk of the audiences of its hit show Matilda the Musical”. Eden, a 19-year-old student at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, is one of the organisers who has signed the letter. “Shakespeare said ‘the great globe itself shall dissolve’. By endorsing BP, the RSC is allowing his words of the past to become a horrifying reality. Continued support of the oil industry will not only destroy my future, but is already causing terrible suffering to people on the frontline of the climate crisis right now,” Eden said. “How can you sleep at night knowing that you’ve tied the purity and hope of the arts to BP’s dirty, colonial extractive practices?” Catherine Mallyon, the RSC executive director, and Gregory Doran, the artistic director, said: “We welcome the conversation around this issue and will respond once we receive the letter. We recognise the importance for a continuing, robust and engaged debate, we acknowledge the climate emergency and recognise the strength of feeling especially amongst our young people.  “Our work with over 500,000 students annually means their feedback and opinions are very important to us. This subject is very much live at the RSC with our artists, staff, board and our audiences and we look forward to reviewing the contents of the letter.”  A BP spokesman said: “BP has been supporting the arts in the UK for over 50 years and our support allows the institutions we partner to widen access and extend the reach of their productions and exhibitions. “Our position on climate is clear – the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to move to net-zero carbon emissions in the decades to come. Everyone will have to play their part in addressing this challenge: individuals, governments and companies such as BP.  “We are investing to grow low carbon businesses and activities and working and investing in our other businesses to reduce emissions from our operations.” Jess Worth, co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, which has been spearheading the campaign against fossil fuel involvement in the arts, said the move by young activists was a significant blow to the theatre company. “This is another example of young people finding their power and using it to create change in institutions that, until now, have taken their concerns for granted,” she said. “Education and schools work is one of the RSC’s priorities, and an important source of income. This is a chance for the RSC to demonstrate how much it values young people, by not just listening but acting on their passionately held concerns.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch offers more interesting insights on skeptics, alarmists, the role of the media, politics, scientists etc. at his Klimazwiebel site, read here and here (in German).He answered quite a number questions as part of an “Expert Interview – Climate Change and Media”.  I picked out only some of the questions and his answers. There is quite a bit there.
Indeed Prof von Storch has plenty of criticisim for both sides (not surprisingly). In summary, Prof. von Storch advises the media, politics and scientists to stick more to their roles, and to stay away from one extreme or the other.
Q: How do you perceive public communication on anthropogenic climate change in Germany?
HvS:  The communication has improved considerably over the last year since ClimateGate, the IPCC blunders and the failure of COP-15.  The talk has become less dramatic, as well-known alarmists can longer be so sure with the attention of the public.
Q: In your view how should successful public communication of anthropogenic climate change be set-up?
HsV: Less positive is the tendency to moralise and to propagandise, like Germany should be a model for the rest of the world while countries like China and USA are to be demonized. The communication on one side should present the scientifically supported perspectives as factual supplementary conditions for decision-making, while on the other hand highlighting as political options the possibilities for making decisions by politics and society (i.e. decided by values).
Q: What has to improve with the public communication of anthropogenic climate change and what has to happen so that it gets better?
HvS: More openness to questions and skepticism; more skepticism with respect to the alarmists (i.e. the ones who have the more interesting “stories” for the media and politics); more resistance to attempts at using single events as proof that supports far-reaching statements (like on the irrelevance of the man-made greenhouse effect) on climate dynamics; caution in the argumentative use of the latest scientific findings (much in Nature and Science later turns out to be in need of revision); evaluating scientific results from the methodical points of view, and less from the point of view of political application.
Q: How do you assess the current situation in climate research?
HsV: The situation in climate research as much improved over the last year– to the extent that the discussion is more open. The influence of political circles and cartels has decreased some.

Q: What’s going well, and where are there problems?
HsV: Climate science finds itself in a post-normal phase where the mixture of politics and science is mutually beneficial to both. That doesn’t mean that the scientific process itself is damaged, but there is a need for a discussion in public on what role science should play.
Q: What must be improved and what must happen in order for things to get better?
HsV: The practice observed up to now of  “stealth advocate scientists“, i.e. of scientists who, without saying it, put their science in service of a certain political matter, needs to be stopped.
Q: What trends in the media in Germany with respect to communication on global climate change do you see?
HvS: Since about one year, the reporting has gotten more critical and open.
Q: What’s the deal with the interest of the media? Could you give us a current example?
HsV: The interest by the media was very considerable for a period of about 2 months after the events surrounding COP-15, ClimateGate and the IPCC revelations, but then faded. Alarmist reports have become somewhat less lately, also during COP-16 in Cancun. Obviously there seems to be an interest in better researched background reports.
Q: Over the last years, what impact have the increased number of skeptics had on the public communication of anthropogenic climate change?
I don’t believe the number of skeptics has gone up; more are just admitting it. I think there have always been latent reservations also among other professors from physics, geology and other areas. These reservations are now being more explicitly expressed. Many of these people are so-called “skeptics“. They are not oil-industry seduced hacks.
Q: In your opinion how does the future constellation between, climate science, climate politics and the media appear?
HsV: Hopefully in such a way that all three of these players start accepting more and more their own roles and functions, particularly I hope the media find their way back to accompanying science and politics more critically also in the climate field.

"As a report claims that airlines are struggling to control their contribution to the climate crisis, the question grows more urgent for aviation: does it have a greener future, and will a zero-emission plane ever fly? Executives hope a combination of sustainable fuels, offsetting and improving flight paths can play a part in reducing aviation’s footprint until, if ever, carbon-free flying becomes a viable technological and commercial reality. For now, the best long-term hope for the airline industry appears to be electric planes.  At Cranfield University, the laboratory for much of British aviation research, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, on Thursday urged the industry “to create an electric revolution in our skies”; for the climate and, incidentally, “to seize a share of a market that could be worth £4tn globally by 2050”. Manufacturers are pursuing electric dreams: not just companies like Boeing and Airbus, but a host of tech firms, particularly for urban air mobility – aircraft that could be clean and silent enough to make shorter air hops possible without large airports. How much that can be scaled up remains a question. For now, the development of batteries with better power-to-weight ratio means shorter trips on small planes may not be far away. At this year’s Paris air show, electric planes on display included a nine-seater plane named Alice, being developed just outside Tel Aviv by Eviation. The Israeli startup is aiming to have commercial deliveries of its plane as early as 2022. A bigger version, a partly British-built hybrid electric plane, is aiming for test flights in 2021. The e-Fan X, a collaboration between Cranfield with Airbus, Siemens and Rolls-Royce, will convert a small passenger jet to demonstrate the potential for wider commercial use. That kind of project has excited analysts: the move towards hybrid and electric engines for short-haul flights could come in the next two decades, according to an analyst report by UBS. Another zero-emission alternative could be hydrogen, the fuel behind a plane soon to be tested on flights from the Orkney islands. Trials backed by £5.3m in government funding were announced this week – underlining the potential of hydrogen for commercial aviation, according to Val Miftakhov, the founder and chief executive of ZeroAvia, which is providing the plane’s propulsion technology. He said: “Our project goal of 300 nautical miles is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies - enabling net-zero targets to be met.” The cost of producing and storing hydrogen is one major barrier. But Dr Bobby Sethi, a senior researcher at Cranfield, believes the current cost of liquid hydrogen – five to six times that of jet fuel by weight – will come down. Sethi said: “As large scale hydrogen production and liquefaction infrastructures become more established, and that of jet fuel and taxation of CO2 emissions goes up, particularly with heightened environmental awareness, we believe LH2 (liquid hydrogen) will be very competitive on cost in the medium to long term.” Manufacturers like Airbus predict new forms of plane will come – but not for 15 years. Bob Lange, a senior vice-president, says hybrid-electric propulsion could be feasible by the mid 2030s. The newest planes unveiled in recent years, such as Airbus’s A350 and Boeing’s 787, have brought a step-change in fuel efficiency, but Lange says the next major product launches will be on hold. “We need to do our research and development now for the next fuel technology.” Before those planes appear, the industry – and the planet – needs other ways to curb aviation emissions. Sustainable fuels were a major hope for aviation; and with concerns over biofuels, the focus has shifted to the potential of domestic and industrial waste. A Virgin service claiming to be the first to be partly powered by recycled waste crossed the Atlantic last October. According to its US fuel supply firm, LanzaTech, if that single flight could be scaled up – and more importantly, function with a fuel blend of 50% recycled waste rather than just 5% – it could curb greenhouse gas emissions by 65% compared with conventional jet fuel. British Airways has eyed similar technology and – after several false starts – has submitted plans to develop, with Shell, a new plant in Immingham, Humberside, which could divert half a million tonnes per year of waste – from packaging to nappies – into more sustainable jet fuel. Other measures have been stalled in planning: a single European sky and better air traffic management could cut CO2 emissions by 10%, the industry says. Airlines are meanwhile fighting to avoid more punitive taxation, with Germany poised to announce additional levies on flying. A4E, a trade body representing Lufthansa, BA and others says: “Instead of taxes, the German government should support measures such as reforming EU airspace.” But as aviation finally gets moving on emissions, the pace of change may prove too slow to avoid a clampdown."
"During the carnage of the first world war, the poet Wilfred Owen revisited the biblical story in which God tests Abraham by commanding the sacrifice of Isaac, his son. In Genesis, Abraham dutifully prepares the lad for slaughter before God relents and tells him to offer a ram instead. Owen’s bitter poem rewrites the ending:  But the old man would not so, but slew his son, And half the seed of Europe, one by one. The parable illustrates global warming just as well as war – except, with CO2 levels higher than at any other time in human history, it’s a planet rather than a continent now under the knife. That’s what makes the climate strike so fitting: an international rebellion led by the young against generations of betrayal. We know that, as far back as the late 50s, researchers for the oil industry understood the effects of carbon on the atmosphere but did nothing about it. In 1988 George HW Bush promised on the campaign trail to fight climate change. “I am an environmentalist,” he declared. “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect.” There was, of course, no White House effect. In 1997 the world’s leaders signed the Kyoto protocol, with Bill Clinton declaring “a commitment from our generation to act in the interests of future generations”. More emissions have been released since that agreement than in all of previous history. How petty, how small, how childish do those politicians with the temerity to attack Greta Thunberg look! She speaks for science, idealism and hope; they embody an ignorance or cynicism so deep as to constitute depravity. The ecological disaster that confronts us today extends way beyond climate. Some scientists speak of the “sixth extinction event” – but, as Justin McBrien argued, that phrase isn’t accurate. We might less euphemistically discuss a “first extermination event”. Nature is not dying so much as being killed, by people who know perfectly well what they’re doing. The need for protests could not be more urgent – and, at last, they’re happening. The global strike provides a perfect antidote to the despair so many of us have felt for so long. There’s a nightmarishness to the isolated experience of climate change: a sense of paralysis and horror at a world sleepwalking into disaster. By coming together on the streets, we shake that off, and we grasp something of our collective strength. In day-to-day life, there are few sections of society more powerless than schoolchildren. And yet, despite teachers and parents and politicians, they’ve spurred a movement that’s growing in almost every nation. If they can do that, what else could be possible? What might the rest of us do, if we all act together? Fairly obviously, the strike must be a beginning and not an end. This is not an issue where you can express your disapproval in a single rally and then go back to your daily life. Atmospheric physics doesn’t care if we’re tired of marching or we feel that “done our bit”. Warming won’t be stopped by symbolism or fervent hopes: we need, as, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change argues, “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. That’s no small task, especially given the vested interests in the status quo. It would be foolish not to expect difficult times ahead. In 1848 Marx described the February insurgency in France as “the beautiful revolution” – and then contrasted it with the “ugly revolution” that followed. He meant that the initial uprising (a “revolution of universal sympathy”) united everyone other than utter reactionaries. It was only later that the divergent interests among the rebels became clear. The same might be said today. Will those businesses who encouraged their workers to strike support further stoppages? What about progressive politicians – will they back ongoing actions? How can we prevent protests falling back into tokenism? What kind of alliances might take the movement forward and what kind of deals will set it back? How does civil disobedience relate to the push for a Green New Deal? All of these and other questions must be debated – and the necessary debates will be polarising, fractious and, yes, ugly. Again, though, the climate strike shows the basis for the struggle we need. All over the globe, people have rejected the sacrifice of nature on the altar of greed. That should inspire us all to redouble our efforts. We need a new movement, akin to those that shook the world in the 60s and the 70s, and we have very little time to build one.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOf course the situation is very serious, but very likely nothing like what the chronic habitual alarmists portray it be. Look – it’s a messy job cleaning this up and things will neither go smoothly nor happen right away when you want them to.Right now you’ve got hundreds of thousands of poor earthquake victims outside freezing in the bitter elements and it would be nice if the media focused on them and did something to lift their spirits for once.
That said, here are some good links from calmer heads:
– Firsthand account from someone in Tokyo: chipango blog (hat-tip: oekowatch.org):
And while a momentary increase in radiation has been observed on Monday (which was still an absolutely harmless figure and mostly proves the sensitivity of our measurement processes), the figures have been falling ever since. Since yesterday morning, we’re essentially measuring only the natural background here in Tokyo.”
– More information here at the iaea.org/news:
Japanese authorities have informed the IAEA that engineers were able to lay an external grid power line cable to unit 2. The operation was completed at 08:30 UTC.  They plan to reconnect power to unit 2 once the spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building is completed.
The spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building was temporarily stopped at 11:09 UTC (20:09 local time) of 17 March. The IAEA continues to liaise with the Japanese authorities and is monitoring the situation as it evolves.”

– More detailed report here at World Nuclear News:
There have been about 50 staff engaged in pumping seawater into the reactor cores and primary containment vessels of units 1, 2 and 3. From time to time these need to vent steam, which causes radiation to rise across the site and required the workers to move to a safer location.
Another 130 were also on site, according to reports, including soldiers from the Japan Self Defence Force.”
and
The Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said at 8.38pm that a cable was being laid to bring external power from transmission lines owned by Tohoku Electric Power Company. This was to be connected when radiation levels had died down after a planned venting operation at unit 2.
In addition, one of the emergency diesel units can now be operated and will be used to supply unit 5 and 6 alternately to inject water to their used fuel pools. Later, the power will be used to top up water in the reactor vessels.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore evidence of the obvious now revealed in a recent Nature article from research conducted by the IFM GEOMAR and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Believe it or not, they are slowly finding out that the oceans play a role in climate.
Once again climate scientists, who often claim the science is settled, are running into “surprises” and finding out that there is so much they don’t know. Here’s the press release from the IFM GEOMAR (emphasis added):
====================================================
Oceanographers from Kiel document the effect of equatorial deep currents on West African rainfall
May 18, 2011/Kiel. Our climate is affected by the ocean in many ways.
The most prominent example is the El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific, a well-documented interannual climate signal. Oceanographers from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI, USA) have recently documented the effect of deep equatorial currents in the Atlantic on rainfall and climate over West Africa.
Precipitation associated with the West African Monsoon is of major significance to agriculture, water resources and health concerns in one of the more densely populated regions in Africa. The timing and amount of rainfall each year in the countries along the northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea are determined in part by the sea surface temperature of the tropical Atlantic. The details of this interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere are not fully understood at this time. Previously it was thought that effects from the Pacific and North Atlantic were the main source for climate fluctuations in the equatorial Atlantic. Oceanographers from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR), in collaboration with their colleagues from the USA, were now able to demonstrate the existence of regular interannual temperature fluctuations which have an effect on the rainfall of the region but cannot be traced back to the previously known sources.  Even more astonishing for the scientists is the fact that all measurements indicate that these fluctuations are caused by deep currents of the equatorial Atlantic itself. “To date, when trying to explain tropical climate variations, we have always looked upwards, specifically to the atmosphere. Our new data, for the first time, direct our attention towards the depths of the ocean, thereby opening new perspectives for our scientific approach,” explained Dr Peter Brandt, professor at IFM-GEOMAR.
In a large-scale, international research programme, the Tropical Atlantic Climate Experiment (TACE), experts have attempted for years to track the causes, effects and potential periodicities of climate fluctuations in the tropical Atlantic. The German contribution to this programme also includes deep-sea moorings along the equator. These moorings consist of several km of mooring wire held upright in the water column by flotation and buoys. Instruments are mounted along the wire to continuously record current speed and direction, salinity and temperature, thereby allowing the observation of long-term changes of parameters in the deep ocean. Furthermore, the scientists obtain current data from freely drifting deep-sea buoys, so-called Argo floats, and also information on the sea surface itself and the atmosphere from various satellite-based sensors. “The time series obtained over the past ten to twenty years have revealed previously unknown fluctuations of currents and temperatures at the surface of the tropical Atlantic which have a regular cycle of 54 months, or 4 ½ years,” explained Peter Brandt. The scientists were able to document similar fluctuations of the “Deep Jets”, deep currents down to 3000 m with speeds of 10-20 cm/sec. They flow along the equator, crossing the entire Atlantic, with flow reversals every few hundred meters. “These jets are generated in the deep ocean, and their energy apparently propagates upwards through the water column. Once near the surface, this energy affects currents and temperatures,” stated Dr Brandt.
On the other hand, sea surface temperatures are among the deciding factors for rainfall fluctuations over West Africa. “How large the effect of these deep jets is, and how they are generated is still somewhat of a mystery,” said Dr Brandt, “we still have a lot of work ahead of us.”

We keep hearing that CO2 is the main climate driver, yet so much research has come out showing that it’s the sun and oceans.

"Musa Okwonga makes no reference to the economic inequality that the existence of Eton and similar private schools has created and continues to create in this country (There’s a side to Eton you won’t read about in David Cameron’s memoirs, 21 September). Suggesting that Eton should inculcate compassion is downright patronising to the growing numbers of poor whose lives are destroyed and ambitions stifled by the privately educated. Wealthy families send their children to Eton to ensure they keep and increase their astonishing wealth by holding on to the levers of power in society. Government by former school chums ensures no one can know how wealthy they are, where that wealth came from, where it is stashed, and that fiscal policy is more than favourable. Britain did not become one of the most economically unequal societies in Europe by accident. A privileged group of people want it that way, and it is no accident that they are involved in leaving the EU, because it is a direct threat to their wealth.Dr Robin C RichmondBromyard, Herefordshire  • Leaving aside the issue of whether any “charity” boss should earn £270,000, the speech by Cheryl Giovannoni illustrates just why the Labour party should strip independent schools of their charitable status (Teach girls how to ask for a pay rise, says charity boss, 20 September). As you state, the Girls’ Day School Trust administers 23 private schools. Even its most ardent defender could not argue that this organisation does anything to encourage social mobility, never mind social justice. Of course women should “accept nothing less than salary equality”, but achieving this involves a lot more than teaching girls how to ask for a rise. Ending the gig economy and ensuring all workers have collectively negotiated contracts would be a better start.Declan O’NeillOldham • Once again, George Monbiot was essential reading (For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth, 19 September). However, I feel a caveat needs to be made on one point: “The assumption on which governments and economists operate is that everyone strives to maximise their wealth.” No, the assumption for economists is that everyone strives to maximise their utility, ie their overall satisfaction. The problem comes from too many people forgetting or ignoring this fundamental principle of the subject, and giving wealth too much weight in the utility function. While it is probably true to say that some economists are guilty of this mistake, it is made by far more non-economists – and, regrettably, by far too many policymakers.Dominic RiceSheffield • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Anthony Albanese has delivered his strongest criticism of the prime minister yet, declaring Scott Morrison has a habit of being “loose with the truth” and blaming the media for reporting facts when he was uncomfortable with legitimate criticisms and questions. Albanese, who has banned his caucus from using the word “liar” when referring to Morrison or government MPs, said Morrison’s latest deflection of Australia’s climate record was part of a “pattern” he had developed when asked uncomfortable questions.  Morrison used his time on the world stage at the United Nations general assembly to declare Australia was being unfairly maligned for its climate record, blaming the media for “misrepresenting” his government’s actions. Emissions in Australia have continued to rise since the Coalition took power in 2014 and abolished the carbon price installed by the Gillard government. In one of his first signals since becoming opposition leader that he was prepared to muscle up against Morrison, Albanese said the prime minister’s rhetoric did not match the facts. “What we’ve seen from the prime minister is downplaying the seriousness of climate change,” he said. “What we’ve also seen is him dismissing the concerns which young people have about climate change. “What we’ve also seen is him blaming the media for reporting the facts. And there’s a pattern developing here, whereby Scott Morrison is loose with the truth. “We saw that when he dismissed the fact that he has said at least 17 times about Sam Dastyari – characterised him as Shanghai Sam – and he said that that never happened. “We’ve seen that with regard to his dismissal of legitimate questions about whether he tried to organise for Mr [Brian] Houston to get an invite to the state dinner which was rejected by the United States administration, due to concerns that arose from the inquiry into child abuse that occurred here in Australia. “He can’t just dismiss questions from the media. “We have a prime minister who is … now trying to say that any questioning of the government’s record on climate change and the need to reduce emissions is a product of the media, rather than accepting responsibility as the prime minister of Australia.” Albanese’s stronger stance comes amid frustrations from within his caucus that Labor is not doing enough to “take the fight” up to Morrison, as the party finds its groove under a new leader after the federal election loss. A review of Labor’s policy platform is under way as part of a review into the party’s performance during the May poll, which includes Labor’s much mooted 45% emissions reduction target by 2030. While opposition MPs remain skittish about committing to any continuation of the policy platform Labor took to the last election, fierce debate has raged within the party about remaining focused on climate change. Albanese upped the attack on the Morrison government record on Thursday, but did not expand on Labor’s plans. “The government is not doing enough to tackle climate change,” he said. “They dismiss people who are concerned about climate change, including young people. They dismiss the facts on what is happening with regard to our renewables. “They dismiss the concerns that the business community have, when they say they’re crying out for a framework which would give them the certainty to invest into the future.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a look into a climate science debate conference between skeptics and warmists that took place last month in Potsdam, Germany. The skeptics are scientists from the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and the warmists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
In October 2010 PIK Director Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber invited (reluctantly after some controversy) the skeptic EIKE scientists for a scientific colloquium on the subject of climate change with the aim of clearing up misundertandings that had flared up earlier. For years skeptic scientists had been denied the opportunity to debate the issue, and so thus advance science.
EIKE requested that I translate their conference report.
While PIK, which is massively funded by the state, is convinced of an approaching climate catastrophe, EIKE, on the other hand, views the science behind man-made catastrophic climate change with deep skepticism, and has acted as Germany’s spokesman for skeptic or non-alarmist scientists. EIKE has been the targeted and often denied a voice by the media and warmist scientists. It is run on a shoestring through private funding.
The following is a translation of EIKE’s protocol, see here for the original German (Note: some parts were condensed to remove clutter).
Translation:
———————————————————————————– 
Participants:
PIK: Dr. Georg Feulner, Eva Gaigg, Prof. Dr. Friedrich Gerstengarbe, Dr. Veronika Huber, Dr. Brigitte Knopf, Claudia Köhler, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kropp, Prof. Dr. Anders Levermann, Dr. Jörg Pietsch, Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Prof. Dr. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Dr. Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Mareike Schodder, Jonas Viering. External participants for PIK: Tanja Fröhlich, Prof. Dr. Uwe Ulbrich
 
EIKE: Dr. Siegfried Dittrich Prof. Dr. Karl-­‐Friedrich Ewert, Michael Limburg, Prof. Dr. Horst-­‐Joachim Lüdecke, Klaus-­‐Eckart Puls; EIKE guests Dr. Alexander Hempelmann, Dr.Rainer Link, Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, Prof. Dr. Werner Weber
Date: April 2011
Location: Potsdam Telegrafenberg
The conference began with a presentation by Dr Feulner of the PIK, and then was followed by four presentations by EIKE scientists. All participants were aware that great differences existed beforehand between PIK and EIKE on the development of the global climate, reliability of models, interpretation of datasets, greenhouse effect, extreme weather frequency, sea level rise etc.
Before the conference, information exchanges mainly took place indirectly via media publications, the Internet and events like conferences and symposiums.  These discussions were often extremely heated, and so this face-to-face meeting was to serve as a professional way of exchanging information to avoid misunderstandings and to discuss controversial topics directly.
Opening
Prof. Schellnhuber opened the conference with a short statement at 1:40 pm and spoke about the circumstances that leading up to the invitstion [1]. He then explained why PIK, acting as the host of the event, wished no media attention although this had been suggested by EIKE, and expressed astonishment that EIKE planned to hold a press conference after the conclusion of the conference. He then opened the conference.
Michael Limburg (EIKE Vice President) expressed his thanks for the invitation and the opportunity to discuss scientific knowledge among each other.
“State Of Climate Science“
Dr Feulner then started his presentation: “State of Climate Science“ (see  Feulner). He presented the development of trends, as to PIK. The discussion after the presentation was lively. Dr Vahrenholt doubted the presented influence of solar activity (Feulner pegged at 0.1°K and so called it slight) referring to the newest findings from (Shapiro et al 2011) where the TSI-increase from the Little Ice Age until today was possibly 6 times higher than assumed in AR4. Also a paper from January 2010 from Solomon was referred to, where the cooling over the last 10 years has something to do with the 10% reduction in water vapour in the stratosphere.
It was also pointed out that GISS, in generating a “global temperature”, showed Arctic temperatures even though there exist nowhere near enough measurement stations there, as is also the case in Antarctica.
Dr Rainer Link also pointed out that the temperature oscillations of the oceans like the AMO, PDO, El Nino etc. are not accounted for in the models, and that the models cannot predicts them. But Dr Rahmstorf objected. Dr Feulner explained his claim that no decreasing trend in the recent global mean temperature can be discerned because a short-term look of less than 30 years doesn’t allow it. The climate models would not have a fine enough resolution to allow it. EIKE disagreed with this view by pointing out public data like from Hadley Center and UEA, which show no temperature increase since 1998.  Although it is correct, said EIKE, that a climate reference value of at least 30 years should be used, one has to recognise that the models used so far cannot appropriately show the last 10 – 15 years.
“Sun and Climate“ 
Dr Weber then started his presentation “Sun and Climate” at 2:20 pm “ (see short version here). In the brief first part, he showed the expected saturation of CO2 by the atmosphere. Today about 50% of anthropogenically emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere, while at the start of the industrial times all CO2 emitted by man remained in the atmosphere because of the equilibrium that existed between ocean and atmosphere. Then Dr Weber introduced the resulting differential equation that leads to an exponential saturation of atmospheric CO2 absorption in the most simple model with constant CO2 emission. At approx ca. 4 ppm annual CO2 emission, which is what we have today, saturation is at about 500 ppm CO2. Weber also pointed out that it is scientific practice to use the simplest models for public showing and then discuss subsequent tweaking and corrections. The necessary corrections and model limits would then be added.

In the main part of the presentation, Dr Weber looked at the indirect influence by the active sun on climate, caused by an up to 20% reduction in cosmic radiation by the solar magnetic field, which in turn eventually leads to an increase in solar radiation reaching the earth. These trends, which Weber had found in earlier solar data, had been doubted by Dr Feulner (PIK) in a paper. Then the presentation went on mainly about the quality of analyses on both sides. Unfortunately Dr Weber only had a preliminary and unclearly formulated version of Feulner’s paper at his disposal, and as a result Mr Weber assumed a technical error by Mr Feulner. Misunderstanding resulted and eventually the accusation of a technical error was cleared up. It was agreed that the final version of Feulner paper would be discussed in detail by Dr. A. Hempelmann, who had started a cooperation in this field with Weber.
“Climate Sensitivity of CO2 “
Next Dr Rainer Link made his presentation on “Climate Sensitivity of CO2“, (see short version), beginning with the well-known saying about science: “Every theory in science is accepted only when it is confirmed by observation. A single observation that contradicts the theory is sufficient to refute it. The postulated water vapour positive feedback in the models is the essential part of the alarmist forecast for temperature increase by the climate model cannot be confirmed by a single observation. To the contrary, it has been refuted on multiple times.“A Hot Spot in the middle to upper troposphere in the tropical regions could not be found by hundreds of balloon measurements. That therefore eliminates the possibility that the climate system would go out of control because of CO2 and the subsequent water vapour positive feedback. That also impacted the so-called 2°C target. Link calculated the temperature increase from a doubling of CO2 at a max. of 1.6°K ; however, it is probably significantly less (quoted Lindzen, Paltridge, Harde and others). Thus there is no reason for climate alarmism. Taking part in the controversial discussion in addition to Dr Link, were Dr Schellnhuber, Dr Rahmstorf, Mr Puls, Dittrich and Dr Huber. Dr Rahmstorf pointed out that the ice ages could not be explained by Milankowitch cycles alone and had to have been caused by the CO2 induced water vapour feedbacks, but could not deliver the evidence. The rise in temperature after each ice age is not the consequence of higher CO2 concentrations, but rather the higher CO2 concentrations result from the warming oceans. The arguments presented by Dr Link could not be convincingly refuted by the PIK participants.
 “Extreme weather and sea level“
After the coffee break, meteorologist Klaus-Eckert Puls made his presentation: “Extreme Weather and Sea Levels“ (see Presentation – long version). Mr Puls talked about how the public had been bombarded by countless, and at times absurd, warnings on weather and climate over the last 10 years. These warnings were aimed at producing the impression of an already started climate catastrophe. Moreover: In the public (media and politicians!) results from climate models from climate institutes are often presented as prognoses without the advisory that they are in fact only scenarios that entail large uncertainty. Puls suggested –  analogous to the Hamburg Declaration on long-term weather prognoses made by meteorologists – that PIK and EIKE draw up and agree on a so-called “Potsdam Declaration” with the objective of mutually setting the record straight concerning false or exaggerated statements in the media. No reply from the PIK with respect to this suggestion, and no mention of it in the conclusion (Schellnhuber).
Using charts, graphics, statistics and quotes from a variety of institutes, Mr Puls showed that after 150 years of global warming, weather agencies worldwide have found no 100-year trends in middle latitude cyclones, tropical storms, tornadoes, flooding and other weather events. Moreover, using a series of sea level measurements and satellite data from their own institutes and from the IPCC, the expected acceleration in sea level rise is nowhere to be found. Dr Rahmstorf noted that there are other datasets out there. Puls and Rahmstorf agreed to exchange their data. Concerning the 100-year trends documented at the German North Sea coast by K.-E. Behre (B., NIHK Wilhelmshaven), Puls in a debate with Dr Kropp pointed out that Behre did not take temperature into account and that Behre detected a deceleration in sea level rise over the last 400 years, particularly during the 20th century.
Global long-term temperature series
Dr Horst-­‐Joachim Lüdecke began his presentation “Global Longterm Temperature Series“ (see short version here). At the start, the various versions of the Mannian temperature reconstructions over the last 1000 years were clear. Dr Lüdecke and others termed them as clear falsification, whereby Dr Rahmstorf demanded proof of that claim. He was then refered to the comprehensive works of McIntyre and McKitrick. And it is very well summarised in Andrew Montford’s book: The Hockeystick Illusion“.
The core conclusion of the studies by Lüdecke and Ewert – backed by comprehensive statistical analysis intensive of auto correlation (persistence) on thousands of temperature series is: “There is nothing unusual about the warming of the 20th century.“ After a drop in temperature in the years before, there was a mostly naturally caused warming once the man-made influences of the UHI are removed. It is easily recognizable. Similar and often times even more pronounced fluctuations can be observed in the past over the last 2000 years. They were all caused naturally. Dr Schellnhuber and Dr Kropp both engaged in the lively discussion that followed. Dr Schellnhuber noted that the paper quoted by Dr Lüdecke (which Schellnhuber himself co-authored and confirmed missing warming) was a paper where Dr Kropp was the project leader with the University of Giessen. Dr Schellnhuber remarked that the result was in any case no smoking gun (against CO2-induced warming?). Dr Rahmstorf added that the statistic was “blind“ to the physics. This was rejected by Dr Lüdecke and Dr Link. Dr Kropp then pointed out that the methods that were used are still in development.
Summary
It is obvious that the participants were for the most part in agreement with the perception of the facts – the absence of increased weather extremes being unchallenged by PIK speaks volumes. The methods for assessing these facts however appear to differ. While the participants from EIKE put unconditional priority on physical measurements, climate impact research has to rely on models calculations for future orientation. It would be desirable if this difference were better known among the generally uninformed public. For the truthful informing of laymen, it is not helpful when popular presentations are made by scientists in which catastrophic weather extreme increases are reported as being attributed to anthropogenic climate change, in contradiction to measured facts.
Conclusion: Thanks and return invitation:
On behalf of the guests Mr Limburg expressed thanks for the open discussion and that they would gladly like to continue as the debate, as in EIKE’s view they were especially fruitful. Mr Limburg invited the PIK colleagues for an orderly meeting for late summer of this year – to which there was no objection.
The conference was ended with a short speech by Dr Schellnhuber somewhat behind schedule at 5:50 pm. He thanked the participants for their work and for the almost always factual discussion. He also remarked that he assumed there would be a fair treatment of PIK at the ensuing press conference. In response Mr Limburg invited him to join it. Mr Schellnhuber declined as he had another private matter to attend to, but named some of his colleagues to attend.

———————————————————————–
Some additional notes: Michael Limburg has informed me that PIK scientists have turned down EIKE’s invitation to continue the exchanges. And it is rather peculiar that the PIK objected and refused the presence of the media, and expressed reservations that EIKE held a press conference afterwards.
From the report one gets the impression that PIK puts a lot faith in climate models and is suspicious observations that do not conform to their models. In real science one ought to be suspicious of models that do not conform to real-life observations. Michael Limburg also added in his e-mail:
The scientific position and ability of PIK scientists during that meeting was rather weak. Whenever they had to agree that observation do not show any special increase neither in extreme weather, temperature nor sea level and so on, they mentioned: ‘But our models show…’ “
That their science is weak ought not be a surprise. What else could one possibly expect from a science that ignores observations and relies on models?

This is no joke. Warming now leads to cooling! That’s the latest scientific news that our tax money has bought from Potsdam – from the house of Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf.This is what happens when you take activist physicists off the street, give them super-computers and a license to forecast. Here’s their press release: =========================================
Global warming could cool down temperatures in winter
11/16/2010 – The overall warming of the earth’s northern half could result in cold winters. The shrinking of sea-ice in the eastern Arctic causes some regional heating of the lower levels of air – which may lead to strong anomalies in atmospheric airstreams, triggering an overall cooling of the northern continents, a study recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research shows. “These anomalies could triple the probability of cold winter extremes in Europe and northern Asia,” says Vladimir Petoukhov, lead author of the study and climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Recent severe winters like last year’s or the one of 2005-06 do not conflict with the global warming picture, but rather supplement it.”
The researchers base their assumptions on simulations with an elaborate computer model of general circulation, ECHAM5, focusing on the Barents-Kara Sea north of Norway and Russia where a drastic reduction of ice was observed in the cold European winter of 2005-06. Those surfaces of the sea lacking the ice cover lose a lot of warmth to the normally cold and windy arctic atmosphere. What the researchers did was to feed the computer with data, gradually reducing the sea ice cover in the eastern Arctic from 100 percent to 1 percent in order to analyse the relative sensitivity of wintertime atmospheric circulation.
“Our simulations reveal a rather pronounced nonlinear response of air temperatures and winds to the changes of sea-ice cover,” Petoukhov, a physicist, says. “It ranges from warming to cooling to warming again, as sea ice decreases.” An abrupt transition between different regimes of the atmospheric circulation in the sub-polar and polar regions may be very likely. Warming of the air over the Barents-Kara Sea seems to bring cold winter winds to Europe. “This is not what one would expect,” Petoukhov says. “Whoever thinks that the shrinking of some far away sea-ice won’t bother him could be wrong. There are complex teleconnections in the climate system, and in the Barents-Kara Sea we might have discovered a powerful feedback mechanism.”
Other approaches to the issue of cold winters and global warming referring to reduced sun activity or most recently the gulf stream “tend to exaggerate the effects,” Petoukhov says. The correlation between these phenomena and cold winters is relatively weak, compared to the new findings referring to the processes in the Barents-Kara Sea. Petoukhov also points out that during the cold winter of 2005-06 with temperatures of ten degrees below the normal level in Siberia, no anomalies in the north Atlantic oscillation have been observed. These are fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure between the Icelandic low and the Azores high which are commonly associated with temperature anomalies over Europe. But temperatures in the eastern arctic were up to 14 degrees above normal level. However, distinct anomalies in the north Atlantic oscillation could interact with sea-ice decrease, the study concludes. One could amplify the other and more anomalies would be the result.
Petoukhov’s study is not about tomorrow’s weather forecast but about longtime probabilities of climate change. “I suppose nobody knows,” he says, “how harsh this year’s winter will be.”
==================================================================
It would be nice if these guys got their stories straight. First we were told for years that winters in Europe would be a thing of the past – rare and exciting. Snow in the Alps would disappear and devastate the ski industry, palm trees would grow in Scandinavia, Greenland ice would melt and on and on went the heat-stories. Now they tell us it’s going to get bitter cold.

Many of us have been watching the sunspots every day and wondering if the sun was entering into some kind of Dalton minimum.
Solar Cycle 24 was about three years overdue.
Well, it’s still not sure if a Dalton-sort of minimum will or will not occur, but the latest event suggests that the sun has woken from its long slumber for good. Solar Cycle 24 is alive! This is the latest news from NASA.
====================================================
April 14, 2011:
If you’ve ever stood in front of a hot stove, watching a pot of water and waiting impatiently for it to boil, you know what it feels like to be a solar physicist.

Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet.

NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory recorded this X1.5-class solar flare on March 9, 2011. [movie]

“Ever since, we’ve been waiting for solar activity to pick up,” says Richard Fisher, head of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC. “It’s been three long years.”
Quiet spells on the sun are nothing new. They come along every 11 years or so—it’s a natural part of the solar cycle. This particular solar minimum, however, was lasting longer than usual, prompting some researchers to wonder if it would ever end.
News flash: The pot is starting to boil. “Finally,” says Fisher, “we are beginning to see some action.”
As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of “X-class” solar flares–the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006.

The Aquarius satellite will measure ocean surface salinity every seven days with a precision down to a pinch of salt (1/8 of a teaspoon) in a gallon of water – from 408 miles above the earth.
Source: http://aquarius.nasa.gov/science-discovery.html
Why is this important? This VIDEO CLICK HERE (2 min) explains why. 
When I watched this video, I thought: “Wait a minute – I thought the science was settled, and that the models were pretty much fine-tuned and all.” But as you see in the video, three scientists are telling us there are still lots of data gaps that need to be filled in, and that this will take years to do.
The clip starts with NASA scientists Gary Lagerloef, Amit Sen and Yi Chao explaining why salinity is so important. Amit Sen says (emphasis added):
But yet we do not know one of the fundamental properties that effect climate, which is the density, the concentration of salt of the ocean.”
Yi Chao then says:
Salinity is one of the missing parameters we have never measured from space before.”

Gary Lagerloef:
We have no salinity samples at all from parts of the world, particularly in the southern hemisphere, the South Pacific, South Atlantic and southeren Indian Oceans. So there is a big data gap.”
and later:
Salinity is one of the measurements we need to fill in an important gap to do that very thing.”
Fine. But why not first fill in these “big data gaps” first before drawing final conclusions and settling on predetermined outcomes? Has no one ever told any of you how the scientific process works? And please don’t be so arrogant to think that you know the answer beforehand. Everyone knows that nobody is that clever.
One option I suppose would be to just extrapolate salinity concentrations at locations up to 1200 miles away from measured high salinity points, like your boss Hansen does with surface temperatures. The advantage is that it allows you to get the answer you want. I mean, after all, people in your field do this routinely.
Obviously the status of the science depends on who the scientists are speaking to. When they’re talking to policymakers, then they have have plenty of data to predict the future – even 100 or 200 years ahead! But when they are talking to people who decide the funding, then suddenly there are big data gaps – and everywhere!
Of course, we all know that the latter is true, and lots of data is still needed before one can even start to understand the complex system that is climate. And forget models that can predict 100 years down the road. It’ll be decades, if ever, before we reach that level of performance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt amazes me how the media take a non-story and inflate it into a “climate time-bomb”.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung has an interview today with Dr. Hans-Wolfgang Hubberten, a director at the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), who has been studying the permafrost in Siberia for 20 years now. Not surprisingly he sees signs of some permafrost melt – and why not? After all the globe has warmed about 0.6°C over the last 100 years.
In the interview Hubberten speaks about the scenario of massive permafrost melt and the implications such a scenario would have, but then reminds us that in reality the permafrost is thawing only very slowly, and so it’s no big deal. So what does the media focus on? On the horror scenarios of course, and not the reality.
One of the favorite horror scenarios floated out by AGW alarmists is sub-marine permafrost melt and the associated release of huge quantities of potent greenhouse gas methane, which then could lead to the much dreaded, yet elusive, tipping point.
Hubberten points out that there are 36 million square km of permafrost, which is equal to 25% the size of the earth’s land surface. Much of it lies below the Arctic ocean. The thickness ranges from a couple of meters to 1600 meters in some spots in Siberia. Of course warming and cooling of the climate leads to corresponding changes in the permafrost over time.
Here are some of Hubberten comments on melting permafrost:
1. Impact on sea levels:
It could by the end of the century lead to an additional global sea level rise of a few centimeters. Therefore the permafrost must be studied with the same seriousness as melting glaciers and sea ice.

This is a not so subtle call for lots more funding.
2. Is the permafrost thawing? According to Hubberten (paraphrasing):
In some areas in Russia within 50 years it has gotten about 20 cm thicker. Right now in treeless regions the upper 50 or 60 cm layer  is thawing. In the forested southern permafrost region up to 5 to 6 meters. The permafrost is warming also at greater depths where temperatures over the entire year range from -5°C to -20°C. We have exact measurements in Alaska for example. At a depth of 20 meters it has warmed 1.5″C over the last 35 years.”
Some places it’s thicker, some places thinner, and some places it is less cold. That shouldn’t be a surprise though because the planet has warmed a bit over the last century. So not really that much has happened.
3. What does Hubberten think about the possibility of a massive methane gas eruption from rapidly thawing permafrost (paraphrasing – emphasis added)?
Much is speculated on this ‘methane climate time-bomb’. In a sceanrio where there is a rapid and complete disintegration of the sub-marine permafrost, there could indeed be a huge methane release into the atmosphere, and from that a considerable global temperature increase from a greenhouse effect. In reality we assume, however, that there is a relatively slow reduction of the submarine permafrost – with a possible slight addition of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.”
Hubberten then throws his pitch for more funding, again, adding:
But, the sub-marine permafrost and the methane  gas hydrates are still mostly not researched and with today’s level of knowledge it is a big factor of uncertainty in the climate system.”
In the end we can safely say that all the permafrost warnings will likely turn out to be like the UN 50-million-refugee-predictions we have all been hearing about the last few days.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has a ""Master Plan"" for society. (Photo credit: http://nachhaltigkeit2009.commerzbank.de)
Hans Schellnhuber’s Social Contract For Sustainability‘s real economic and social impacts would be incalculable. This has never been attempted before, and its approach completely contradicts all fundamental economic and scientific principles. Moreover, it is to be implemented without first having a public debate, and to be done so at warp speed. This in itself makes the plan reckless, callous and extremely dangerous. It especially puts the poorest among us at risk. And with its authors having castigated our modern society time and again, it is de facto a Declaration of War on our current system.
That’s the conclusion I have reached having read in more detail Hans Schellhuber’s Social Contract For Sustainability, which he himself dubbed “a masterplan” for radically transforming society. It is truly baffling that this scheme could get so far.
“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”.
And when one considers the arrogance and the scientific dogma that propels Schellhuber’s Social Contract for Sustainability, even the notion of good intentions disappears. From Schellnhuber’s and his peers’ expressed views, one senses the genuine spite they must harbour for today’s modern democratic society and our system of prosperity and freedom. Anyone else would certainly use a different approach to bring about change.
Their manifesto not only calls for a radical overhaul of society, and especially the energy systems that support human life on the planet, but also of our politics and even the way we think. On page 1:
…the requisite transformation encompasses profound changes to infrastructures, production processes, regulation systems and lifestyles, and extends to a new kind of interaction between politics, society, science and the economy.”
Especially disturbing is Schellnhuber’s use of fabricated, junk-science-based horror scenarios for justifying a takeover of today’s democratic and free market system. Although there is a huge body of science showing that CO2 has only a minor, easily manageable impact on climate, Schellnhuber writes on page 1:
This drastic change in direction must be accomplished before the end of the current decade in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum by 2050, and thereby to maintain the possibility of avoiding dangerous climate change. Hence, time is of the essence here.”
Like the Pope Declaring The Islamic World Is To Convert To Christianity By 2020
Worse, the plan callously disregards all the obvious huge risks involved in this great social engineering experiment. The plan ignores science and violates every fundamental economic principle, and so poses a threat of an unimaginable scale to the humankind, society and the environment.  The Social Contract to Sustainability is equivalent to a Chilton’s How To Replace Jet Engines On An Airbus 380 Over To Propellers While In Flight And In Just 10 Minutes. Or, a plan from the Vatican to convert the Islamic World to Christianity by 2020.
More worrisome is that this Green Masterplan is now in the hands of every European Environment Minister, who are drooling over all the power it promises to bring them. It won’t work without something going horrifically wrong. We saw similar results with the Soviet Union.

Not only do the masterplan’s authors want to skip debate and necessary public discussion, which normally precede proposed public endeavours in democratic and open societies, they also  insist that it all has to be done ultra-rapidly, “before the end of the decade”, without debate and always with the fictitious gun barrel of imminent climate catastrophe at our heads. This is a sort of psycho-terror.
Except for their dubious computer models, there is no scientific data to suggest any sort of urgency. It is pure Malthusian paranoia. Don’t let the fuzzy warm platitudes about democracy and human rights in the text at the beginning of the Contract fool you – that’s sheep’s wool over the wolf. In fact the poor will get slammed the hardest.
Denying the poor cheap energy
This is probably the worst part of it all – the plan’s schemes to deny the poor cheap and plentiful energies that would lift them out of their abject poverty. Many poorer countries are planning to use nuclear energies to power their futures, but the masterminds oppose this. Page 3:
Several countries are currently planning to increase their use of nuclear energy. The WBGU urgently advises against this, above all because of the not negligible risks accompanying cases of serious damage, the still unresolved issues concerning final storage, and the danger of uncontrolled proliferation. Existing plants should be replaced by sustainable energy technologies as soon as possible, and, in the case of evident safety deficiencies, be closed down immediately. However, the phase-out of nuclear energy must not be compensated by renewed or intensified brown or black coal based energy generation.
Because it’ll be brutal enough for the richer countries to bear the high costs of renewable energy, you’d think the poor would get a pass be allowed to burn the cheap available energy beneath their feet. Nein! – says Schellnhuber. The council denies them fossil fuels as well, adding later on page 3:
The requisite decarbonisation of energy systems means that the pressure is on to act, not just in the industrialised countries, but also in the dynamically growing industrialising and developing countries. Even the poorer developing countries must veer towards a low-emission development path in the medium-term. The era of fossil energy carrier reliant economic growth must be brought to an end.”
Schellnhuber’s eerie attempts to bring an end to the carbonised society would in fact likely bring about the premature end to millions of lives.
Cost: $1 trillion PER YEAR, and significantly higher after 2030:
Even though many western governments are hopelessly caught in the unsustainable trap of massive debt, printing presses will likely be fired up to print money to pay for it all. The costs even by the masterplan’s admission are staggering. Page 4 states:
Globally, the additional investment required for transformation into a low-carbon society, compared with the cost of ‘just carrying on as we are’, probably lies somewhere in the region of at least 200 to up to 1,000 billion US dollars per year by 2030, and would significantly exceed this amount between 2030 and 2050. These investments will be offset by later savings of a similar size, and the avoidance of the immense costs of dangerous climate change.
This is all to avoid fictitious future “immense costs”. Now one gets a sense as to why this would border on a social and humanitarian folly of unprecedented dimensions.

"Google’s chief executive has revealed plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. Sundar Pichai said the clean energy deal will include 18 separate agreements to supply Google with electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. The search engine’s green energy portfolio will grow by 40%, giving the company access to an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean electricity – the equivalent capacity of a million solar rooftops, the company said. Google has become the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity by matching the huge energy demand of its global operations and data centres with the electricity generated by renewable energy projects. Google said it became the first company of its size to match 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy sources in 2017 after buying more than 7bn kilowatt-hours of electricity. It matched the feat again last year, and expects to meet the target in 2019 too. Once the most recent deals have been signed, Google’s supply agreements with renewable energy developers will total 5.5GW. Pichai said the latest package of deals will “spur the construction of more than $2bn in new energy infrastructure”, including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across three continents. “We’re not buying power from existing wind and solar farms, but instead are making long-term purchase commitments that result in the development of new projects,” he said. “Bringing incremental renewable energy to the grids where we consume energy is a critical component of pursuing 24x7 carbon-free energy for all of our operations,” Pichai added. Almost half of Google’s new renewable energy investments will be made in Europe, including projects in Finland, Sweden, Belgium and Denmark. The deal includes investment in the US states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, as well as a smaller contract in South America to power a Google data centre in Chile."
"A meeting with US president Donald Trump was always a fraught proposition for New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern. It was never going to deliver any clear wins, and was unlikely to do her progressive reputation any favours. And that’s the outcome – Ardern’s reputation has probably taken a hit, at least among her own progressive constituency. Ardern’s liberal supporters see her as the polar opposite of the US president, and she has even been labelled the “anti-Trump”. They expected her in some way to speak truth to power when meeting the man who has become synonymous with the most reactionary problems in politics today. More than anything, Ardern might have been expected to use the opportunity to push Trump hard on the issue of climate change.  Instead, Ardern came out of the meeting typically upbeat, exuding her trademark diplomacy. She described the meeting as a “perfectly productive, warm, solid bilateral”, trotting out the usual platitudes about US-NZ relations, and highlighting Trump’s purported interest in New Zealand. There were some tidbits: we were informed of Trump’s somewhat incongruous interest in the gun buyback scheme established by Ardern’s government immediately following the Christchurch mosque terror attacks. But, as signalled prior to her departure for the US, trade was top of Ardern’s agenda, with climate change seemingly barely touched upon. Unfortunately for Ardern, the New Zealand media is now giving plenty of coverage of her positivity towards Trump, mixed with reports of dissatisfaction over her failure to push climate change action at the meeting. And to make matters worse for her, Trump has now tweeted that the good news stories about their conversation are “true” and that it was “A wonderful meeting!” In one sense the meeting was a success. Many conservatives will be very happy with a positive diplomatic outcome and Ardern’s focus on trade. Prior to the meeting conservative pundits congratulated Ardern for even securing the meeting with Trump and lobbied for her to use it to push a free-trade agenda, which has long been New Zealand’s diplomatic focus with the US. Ardern’s meeting ticked the usual objectives for a New Zealand prime minister meeting the US president. Business as usual has been achieved. Therein lies the problem for Ardern. Ardern isn’t supposed to be a traditional PM. She came to power riding a wave of enthusiasm for being different. Jacindamania was based on the expectation that she would do politics differently and would reject business as usual. She promised “transformational change”. Now this anti-Trump politician has had her first formal meeting with the real Trump, and nothing much has changed. While no one can have reasonably expected that her meeting with Trump would produce immediate results, there was certainly an expectation that she would at least emphasise the need for action on climate change. Ardern has previously campaigned on making climate change her “generation’s nuclear-free moment”. In inviting this comparison, she was consciously evoking a time when New Zealand stood up to the US government, banning American nuclear ships from visiting our ports in the face of enormous diplomatic and trade pressure. While contentious at the time, this defiant stance is now a source of immense national pride for New Zealanders. Climate change is also why Ardern travelled to New York this week. And her meeting with Trump was preceded by her speech at the UN in which she determinedly remained on message and suggested trade was an answer to climate change. To her misfortune, Ardern had to follow Greta Thunberg, who excoriated world leaders for their failure to act on climate change, describing this as a betrayal. Thunberg’s address made it clear there is now a new anti-Trump on the world stage – one who it is impossible to imagine meeting with Trump and letting him get away with business as usual, or proposing trade deals as a solution for climate change. Ardern is also fighting a rising tide of cynicism at home over whether her actions match her rhetoric. The New Zealand Labour party and, crucially, Ardern’s own office, is currently embroiled in a major sexual assault scandal. This is on the heels of failures to deliver promised changes – most notably the flagship housing policy has turned into a train wreck that her government is trying to salvage, without much success. Ardern’s performance in New York is not going to be enough to assuage the uneasy feeling that for all Ardern’s claims to be different, it’s very much business as usual. She described climate change in her speech at the UN as an “extraordinary threat” but, right now, her response to that threat is looking – as we say – “pretty ordinary”.

"Thousands of Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists are planning to shut down parts of central London for at least two weeks in October to demand governments take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. Organisers say the next round of protests, centred around parliament and surrounding government departments, will be bigger than those in April, when Extinction Rebellion activists brought key sites across the capital to a standstill for two weeks and more than 1,000 people were arrested. The October Rebellion in London, which will begin on Monday 7 October, is part of a planned series of XR actions taking place in more than 60 cities around the world, including Paris, New York, Buenos Aires and Delhi. It follows a rise in concern about the escalating ecological emergency, which last week resulted in millions of people taking part in a global climate strike. Sarah Lunnon, from Extinction Rebellion UK, said: “We hope that world leaders understand that the climate and ecological emergency means that the rules must change … business as usual is destroying our planet’s capacity to sustain life; humanity faces a growing risk of societal collapse in 10-20 years due to mass starvation, migration and war.” She said “more rhetoric” from politicians and world leaders would not help. “That is why we have been left with no other choice but to shut down capital cities to raise the alarm. The collapse of our climate and ecosystems has already begun, and is in fact accelerating beyond predictions.” In April thousands of peaceful protesters held key sites across London for two weeks, pushing the environmental crisis to the top of the political agenda and contributing to parliament declaring a climate emergency. Extinction Rebellion says its three demands of government: to tell the truth about the ecological emergency; halt biodiversity loss and reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and set up a citizens assembly on climate and ecological justice, have not been met. For October’s action, organisers say XR has built “a movement of movements”, with animal rights activists, faith groups, medics and peace and anti-war groups joining the protests. In a statement, XR said: “It is expected that thousands more ordinary citizens – with parents, builders, footballers, doctors, teachers, musicians, scientists, CEOs, farmers, with other movements aligned to the cause – will join and peacefully block more than 11 key areas until Extinction Rebellion’s demands, for truth, action and a democracy fit for purpose, are met.” A Metropolitan police spokesperson said on Monday the force was aware of the planned protests and policing would be “appropriate and proportionate”. Under XR’s plans, released on Monday, activists said they planned to block two bridges, Westminster and Lambeth, as well as several roads in and around Westminster. Animal rights activists announced last month they planned to block Smithfield Market, the biggest meat market in the UK, as part of the October protests."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI call this video here the latest attempt by warmists to assert science by public opinion (h/t  Climate Depot). Kind of like: “If we get more young people to believe it and sway public opinion in our favor, then the science will be settled. Let’s start a campaign against the skeptics, get right in their face, and call them names. Let’s be rap stars!”
What a brilliant strategy.
Unfortunately, this is how juvenile and removed from reality “climate science” has gotten. Just take a look at these idiots, thinking they’re cool:

What’s coming next? Mike Tyson climate science communication? Biting deniers’ ears off?
Got to be their latest 10:10 type-idea of “communicating the message better” to the public. These quack scientists are really in trouble. The only ones left they have a chance of convincing are kids.
We’ll gladly take this “own goal”, thank you. Are these quacks really so naive they think science gets settled by public opinion? Again Einstein, Planck, and a host of other science giants are certainly rolling in their graves.
In that video I was looking for Georg Hoffmann, the “climate scientist” who often behaves like a 6-year old, but didn’t see him. I suppose the video was even too juvenile for him.

"From the small sun-drenched Inner Hebridean island of Iona to the packed streets of central London, parents and grandparents, children and trade unionists have stepped out of their Friday routines to tell their political leaders time is running out to tackle the climate crisis. Organisers said it was the biggest-ever environmental protest the UK had seen, with 300,000-350,000 taking part, including more than 100,000 people in London and tens of thousands more in towns and cities from Edinburgh to Bristol, Leeds to Brighton, Bedford to Cambridge. There were more than 200 demonstrations across the UK. Jake Woodier, who campaigns for the Student Climate Network, which co-organised the event, said it marked a turning point in the fight to tackle the climate crisis. “Millions of people across the globe, and hundreds of thousands across the UK, have sent a clear message about the need for urgent climate action,” he said from the protest in central London. “The people have spoken and said enough is enough ... We need an ambitious Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis head on and deliver a world that works for everyone.” In London, young people – who have been protesting in growing numbers on Fridays this year – were joined by trade unionists, politicians, and two generations of antecedents. Mariana Clayton, 41, was with her two-year-old daughter, Albe, in Parliament Square. She said: “I am so fearful for the future. I feel totally powerless – but here, together we have a chance to get our voice heard and force action.” Emma Beresford, 14, was with her younger brother, Archie, and their mother, Anna. She said: “I went on the march for a people’s vote for Brexit but climate change is an even more urgent and pressing issue than anything else.” Jeremy Corbyn and Green MP Caroline Lucas addressed the crowd in London, with the Labour leader promising a “green industrial revolution” – a version of the Green New Deal – to tackle the climate crisis and create hundreds of thousands of well paid unionised jobs. However, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, struck a different note earlier in the day when he said the cause – which he said he supported – did not warrant missing school. That advice was ignored by hundreds of thousands of people across the UK. In Edinburgh, a huge crowd marched from the Meadows, down the Royal Mile to the Scottish parliament. They were clapped and cheered by onlookers, saluted by a bagpiper and entertained by a percussion drummer and jazz bands. Chants of “Hey hey, ho ho, climate change has got to go!” filled the streets of the Scottish capital along with tens of thousands of people, bearing banners that were both funny and dark: “33.2C in Scotland. Time to panic!”, “Sea levels are rising. So are we!”, “You’ll die of old age. I’ll die of climate change.”Ruby, 10, and Dougie, seven, have been ahead of the shift in public opinion. They were inspired by Greta Thunberg to start striking outside the Scottish parliament on a cold day in January. “There was only me and my brother there and the police. The next week there was one more, and eventually loads of people, and now there is this,” Ruby said, gesturing to the vast procession that stretched back as far as the eye could see. “I’m happy and proud.” Her younger brother said the demonstration was “absolutely amazing”. The seven-year-old was among those due to give a speech outside the Scottish legislature. His message to politicians was straightforward: “They are trying their hardest but they need to try lots harder.”In Manchester the square outside the city’s grand central library was taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and demanding change. The city’s mayor, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the protest when he gave a speech pledging that “fracking is the past, it is not the future” – but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl gave a rousing speech that took aim at politicians for their “lies”, before turning directly to Burnham. She said: “Lies, when you don’t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution-related deaths in Manchester just last year – but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats.” Elsewhere, in Birmingham demonstrators staged a die-in outside the BBC offices in the city to protest at what they said was inadequate coverage of the climate crisis. Similar actions were staged at an Oxford University open day for prospective students and by 3,000 Cambridge residents in King’s Parade in the city. One of those taking part in the Oxford protest, Ell Ludlow, said: “We are doing this because we feel like a world leading university should lead on climate. Oxford is not doing that at the moment and so we want them to act now.” In Iona, a few dozen members of the island community supported local children from the primary school in a climate strike “in the centre of the island, near the jetty”. Sarah Macdonald, an island resident and member of the Oran Creative Crafts cooperative, said: “In our small island community, we see shorelines eroding and changing; the gales that hit our exposed wee island are growing more frequent. “Most importantly, we see that the island’s children care deeply about this issue. We have to support them, speak out with them for their future. And we have to do it now.”"

A reader has pointed out that Rob Honeycutt and NoTricksZone appear to have started a trend: Climate Bets For Charity. Here at NTZ, the warmists have entered in a bet (for charity) with the coolists on whether the 2011-2020 decade will be warmer or cooler.
Climate Bet Of The Decade For Charity
Now other blogs are following. It’s the new motto now spreading in climate science:
Either put up, or shut up!”
The latest bet out there is from the outspoken Joe Romm of Climate Progress, who offers to bet Joe Bastardi on temperature and Arctic ice melt. Glad to see he wants to settle it that way, and not through a wrestling match (though the result may very well end up being the same).
Romm’s proposal is very similar to our bet here at NTZ.

In the temperature bet, Romm wants to use the 2000-2009 period instead of the 2001-2010, thus moving the high temperature year of 2010 into his column. His bet is also for charity and insists using the average of RSS and UAH – as we are doing.
But Joe Romm is adding an escape clause: If 2 Pinatubo-size volcanoes erupt, then the bet is off. Such confidence!
I haven’t checked to see what Joe Bastardi’s reaction is. I think he’ll accept both bets. Go for it Bastardi! Unfortunately it’s going to take 10 years to shut this Romm loudmouth up.
Joe Romm seems awfully cocky. I wonder if he has the guts to make a sea level bet. That’s the issue where warmist blow the most hot air, yet are most afraid of touching. What do you say Romm? 5 mm/year over the next decade? That’s way below what Gore and the PIK in Germany are forcasting.
Don’t hold your breath.
Another blog has also got into the climate betting for charity action, but on a more modest scale. Georg Hoffmann here is betting 100 € that 2011 Arctic sea ice extent will reach a record low (NSIDC). Also an attractive bet for coolists.
If all this keeps up, then it won’t be necessary to make up a global warming scare for redistributing global wealth. Looks like the betting is going to care of that itself.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst off, don’t take what this buffoon of a scientist Hoffmann says too seriously. He just serves as an example to illustrate what these self-anointed “elite climate scientists” think of people who don’t believe their junk science and believe in democracy. Some background:
Georg Hoffmann is a German nuclear physicist and worked on climate models at the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg. He then worked in Paris at the LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement) on various aspects of paleo-climatology, specialising in climate reconstructions over the last 1000 years. And last I’ve heard, he then got shipped out to some position out in the desert. Except for his rants at Scienceblog, a Google search turns up very little about any real accomplishments.
At the German Scienceblogs blogsite, Hoffmann, in his typical disdainful haughtiness, once again goes after the climate skeptics, this time using the nutty Glenn Beck in an attempt to put all skeptics in Beck’s boat. This is not the first time Hoffmann indulges in juvenile behaviour, see here. In his latest post he labels Beck as “crazy” – like Hannibal Lechter-crazy.
But first, Hoffmann tells us that skepticism “is a dangerous thing”, starting off his post with:
The so commendable ‘I don’t believe that offhand scepticism is a very dangerous thing. Skeptics of this or that easily become conspiracy theorists who are known to be only a step away from psychopathology. Being a climate skeptic is in no way a condition to put someone on this precarious level of increasing confusion, but let us say: It helps.”
In Hoffmann’s view, skeptics have the potential to become crazy, like Hannibal Lector, or Jack Nicholson in the Shining. Yes, we are probably a greater threat to society than nuclear power plants, and so Angela Merkel should shut us down too because of the unacceptable risk we pose.

Remember, Hoffmann is just one of the many Malthusian charlatans in Europe preaching a gospel produced by crystal balls and flakey climate models, who even claim they can mystically foresee the coming climate Armageddon – even 200 years into the future. (This Armageddon is of course unavoidable, unless of course we submit ourselves to their “masterplans”). These religious climate prophesiers tell us Biblical-proportion rubbish like:
– sea levels will rise meters and meters!
– species will die off like flies!
– ocean acidification will kill marine life!
– Himalayan glaciers are going to disappear by 2030!
– the Medieval Warm Period didn’t really exist!
– global temperatures likely will rise 8°C by year 2200, or more!
– coal plants are global warming death trains!
– global warming causes cooling! And so on.
Indeed it makes us wonder who really is just a step away from “psychopathology”.
Thinking he’s really clever and witty, Hoffmann rants on about Beck’s kooky antics, reminding us that the nutty Beck is a skeptic (and so skeptics are like Beck). Finally Hoffmann, who like Schellnhuber, just cannot conceal his disdain democracy, finishes with:
And everyone, everyone is allowed to vote, Beck is allowed to vote, and those who listen to him and think his analysis is interesting, they too are allowed to vote. So humanity, here is the question I ask you: Are we ready for the 21st century?”
That’s right you arrogant, intolerant agitator – WE CAN ALL VOTE.  The world is only in trouble if people listen and believe the crap you and your ilk put out. We saw what happens when a few elite masterminds with the same calibre of arrogance you display think they know what is best for everybody else.
My advice is that you start behaving like a scientist and get back to your work and do something for a change. Authoring childish provocations as you do is a disgrace to your profession. Skeptics have the democratic right to speak out and to do so without your bullying tactics.

"It is the final night of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu and the Fijian prime minister is explaining how to drink kava. “You clap first,” says Frank Bainimarama, as the smooth wooden bowl is passed around the circle. “Then you have to gulp in one go; then you clap again – one, two, three.” As with so many things in the region, there is a metaphor involving the sea. “Tsunami is the full bowl,” he says, explaining the different levels to which the small bowl is filled from the large tanoa, or kava bowl, in the middle of the circle. “Then full tide, low tide.” “It’s a social drink,” he says. “You can sit for hours and drink this stuff and tell stories about nothing.” Among the stories the prime minister tells over the next three hours as each person gulps down a dozen bowls of kava – about his fear of flying, his views on Trump, why he seized power in the infamous coup that saw him become Fiji’s leader – there is one theme he returns to over and over: the climate crisis. Though the Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world’s population, the climate crisis is already having a devastating impact on the region. The ocean, which has been the source of much of the region’s food and resources, is now the site of impending catastrophe. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs and warming that leads to more frequent and more severe cyclones all threaten the region. As the crisis has hit the Pacific, leaders have emerged. Despite the tiny populations of their countries, they have had an outsized influence on the global climate fight. As the world’s leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly and climate summit, we speak to three Pacific leaders who have been on the frontline of the climate crisis and are taking the fight to New York. The fight against the climate crisis has been the great second act of Frank Bainimarama’s prime ministership. After his role in the 2006 coup, which saw the Fijian commodore seize power and then refuse to call elections for eight years (Fiji has since held two, both of which Bainimarama has won), Bainimarama was ostracised by the international community. But in recent years, he has emerged as a leader in the global climate fight, becoming the president of COP23 in 2017, the UN’s leading climate change body, and the only Pacific leader to have held the title. “I and my officials come from a little tiny island and we had to go onstage and fight these big emitters,” he says. “It’s not easy to be standing up on stage telling the big emitters: ‘Come down off your high horse and do what needs to be done to fight this’.” But Bainimarama says it was important to have a Pacific leader in the role. “By then we knew what climate change was doing, especially to Pacific Island nations,” says Bainimarama. “When we took up the presidency, our fight was really the fight of the Pacific and the vulnerable islands, low-lying islands.” While Fiji, which is one of the most populous and more economically-developed countries in the Pacific, is not considered among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis – that dubious honour goes to Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands – it is still feeling the effects. “Everywhere I go in Fiji there are only two things people want, especially on the coastline. One is a seawall, the other is a hurricane shelter,” says Bainimarama. In 2016, Fiji was devastated by Cyclone Winston which killed 44 people and inflicted damage equal to one third of the country’s GDP. Under Bainimarama’s leadership, Fiji has offered refuge to the entire populations of Tuvalu and Kiribati in the event that the countries become uninhabitable due to the climate crisis. He is also willing to take the fight to much bigger powers, frequently making headlines and causing diplomatic tensions for his blunt assessments of the behaviour of wealthy countries unwilling to curb emissions (including neighbouring Australia). At this year’s climate summit and General Assembly in New York he will be demanding countries take immediate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures and calling upon developed countries to mobilise at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. “Our fight will never stop,” he says. Enele Sopoaga hails from the fourth-smallest country in the world by area and the second-smallest by population. But he wants the world to know its name and to see in its fate, the fate of the planet. Until this week, Sopoaga was prime minister of Tuvalu, which scientists predict could become uninhabitable in the next 50 to 100 years due to the climate crisis. An election in early September saw him retain his seat in parliament, but lose the leadership of the country, so he will not be attending the climate summit and UN General Assembly in New York, though he has spoken at many of them, as well as COP summits, since becoming prime minister in 2013. “As soon as I took on the leadership of my country I went to the first conference of parties in 2014 … I said, ‘Unless we save Tuvalu, we cannot save the world. Save Tuvalu to save the world’.” Sopoaga has been outspoken on behalf of his country. As the main spokesman for the Pacific Small Island Developing States at the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen he proposed amending the draft climate treaty to require countries to limit warming to 1.5C, a proposal that was rejected. At the recent Pacific Islands Forum, hosted by Tuvalu, he was one of the main leaders urging Australia to stop opening new coal mines, saying he told prime minister Scott Morrison: “You are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.” Tuvalu is home to just 11,000 people. Its total land area accounts for less than 26 sq km and according to its government, two of Tuvalu’s nine islands are on the verge of going under due to sea-rise and coastal erosion. When UN secretary general Antonio Guterres visited the country in May, he said Tuvalu was “on the extreme frontlines of the global climate emergency” and that climate change was “striking in Tuvalu is a more dramatic way than anywhere else in the world.” “We are predicted by IPCC scientists to be the first victims of submersion into the sea,” says Sopoaga. “Now, if that happens it doesn’t mean climate change is going to stop, it is going to continue ... We may be the first one, but others will follow. So my call to save Tuvalu, save the world, is not irrational, it is very pragmatic.” Sopoaga says that anyone who doubts the effects of climate change should visit Tuvalu – partly to see the impacts of the crisis on his tiny nation and partly to experience the nation’s rich culture, which would be lost if the country is lost to the waves. “Come to Tuvalu, I will show you how these islands have been badly affected and eaten by erosion, but also come so I can show you how the salinity has eaten into the freshwater table, how it has eaten into the basis of the food supply here. “You come here I’ll show you how the beautiful coral reefs … are now white-ish because they are attacked by acidification and plastic and carbon,” he says. “But the thing is, do you need to see this in order to be convinced that climate change is happening? I don’t think so.” Hilda Heine is a leader of firsts: when she was elected president in 2016 she became the first female leader of her country (she is currently the only female Pacific leader except for Jacinda Ardern in a region with the lowest rate of female political representation in the world). She is the first person in the Marshall Islands to ever get a doctorate, her country was first to submit its targets to meet the Paris agreement and it could be one of the first to see large-scale migration as a result of rising sea levels. In April, one of the local governments in Marshall Islands, purchased 283 acres of land in Hawaii as a climate change bolthole for citizens, if dire predictions for the country’s future come to pass. “I think all of us as leaders realise that we’re coming to the end of this,” she tells the Guardian. “If we don’t take action now, when are we going to take action? There is no time left for us to be indecisive … otherwise the future of our Pacific Island countries will be lost.” But Heine is not ready to accept that outcome yet. She, like many leaders of the Pacific, will be speaking at the climate summit in New York on Monday, where she will demand countries provide “commitments to enhance ambition in line with the IPCC special report on 1.5C”. “We’ve made the conscious choice to lead from the front, because otherwise, who would take the moral responsibility and the leadership on this? Even though we don’t cause this, it impacts our livelihoods more than it impacts others, so for us to just wait to take action would not make sense to our people,” she says. Heine is adamant that the most vulnerable members of society should be prominent in discussions around the climate emergency. She is the chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of around 50 countries that have contributed negligible amounts of greenhouse gases but are particularly endangered by climate change, and a key advocate for more women being brought into the climate debate. “Like any other vulnerable members of our society, [women] are more impacted by climate change,” she says. “That’s why I think it’s important for women to understand the issues and also to be brought to the table too, to help make policies that are relevant to them as a marginalised group.”"

That’s quoting Zettels Raum blog description of the deescalating situation at the Fukushima Diichi facility. Zettels Raum blog has been monitoring the Fukushima incident since the start, and reports on the latest.
Water is being pumped into the reactors with high-capacity airport fire fighting vehicles used by the military. A special piece of equipment has been flown in from the USA as well. Zettels raum writes:
Yesterday 44 fire fighting vehicles with 141 firemen arrived from Tokyo. According to the NHK , these are ‘elite units’. One of the vehicles is equipped with an unmanned extinguishing tower that is 22 meters tall and is designed to fight fires that are difficult to reach. In addition the military is using 5 extinguishing vehicles. So far today, 60,000 litres of water have been sprayed onto Block 3. The operation today will last a total of 7 hours.”
Things are getting under control there. But if you listen to the mainstream media to get the news about what is going on, you’ll quickly find yourself buying a Geiger counter, getting iodine tablets and digging a bomb shelter in your back yard. Again, it’s messy work and things don’t happen right away. On the power situation:
NISA has informed that power connections to Blocks 1, 2 , 3 and 4 will be completed on Saturday. In Blocks 5 and 6 the cooling systems have been put into operation.”
Zettels Raum also reports on radiation:
Radiation on the premises is decreasing, but is fluctuating.”
Around the atomic power plant there is a 20-km evacuation zone , and a 30-km zone in which people have been requested to stay indoors. Most measurements taken beyond these zones show higher, but not dangerous, radiation levels (between 0.0005 mSv/hr and 0.052 mSv/hr).”

"Visiting the United States, Australia’s prime minister demanded of China “participation in addressing important global environmental challenges” in light of its “new status and responsibilities”. As part of a broad call to expect more of China, the comments on environment caught attention as they were made at the time of the UN climate summit. Pointing to China’s emissions growth as an excuse for lack of climate action in Australia was in vogue a decade and longer ago. Then, China’s energy use and carbon emissions rose sharply with its investments in factories, infrastructure and housing. But things have changed in China, and there no longer is a formal distinction between climate pledges from developed and developing countries. In many regards, China’s climate action is stronger than that of Australia or America, at much lower levels of development.  Do the PM’s advisers know? An up-to-date cheat sheet would read like this. 1. China’s CO2 emissions from fossil fuels use rose by just 2% over the last five years (2013-18), with all of that growth in 2018 after a four-year hiatus. That is a stark difference to earlier: China’s CO2 output rose 25% over the five years before that, and 62% the five years before that, according to data compiled by BP. In the US, these emissions fell by 2.5% over the last five years. In Australia, emissions from fossil fuel use rose by 3.6% from 2013-18, faster than the world average of 3.2%; Australia’s overall national emissions rose by 3.9% over the five years. Australia has nothing to brag about in terms of recent emissions growth. 2. The emissions pledges under the Paris agreement do not distinguish between developed and developing countries, in contrast to the Kyoto protocol. All countries are called on to act, and the vast majority of countries have pledged to cut or limit their emissions. China has quantitative targets. The principle of “common but differentiated commitments” applies, with higher expectations placed on more developed countries, but there is no formal distinction. 3. China’s main Paris target is to reduce the ratio of energy CO2 emissions to GDP (the “emissions intensity”) by between 60-65% over the period 2005 to 2030. China’s high GDP growth rates mean that absolute emissions are nevertheless allowed to rise, as they did until 2013. But the highly intensive growth spurt has finished, and emissions are likely to start falling before 2030, China’s target year for CO2 peaking. The reduction in emissions intensity of the economy from 2005 to 2018 was 47% in China, 23% in Australia, and 25% in the United States. We are taking the carbon dioxide out of economic growth, but not nearly as quickly as China. 4. We are far richer, and have much higher emissions per person. Emissions from fossil fuel use in 2018 were 6.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita in China, 17 tonnes in Australia, 15 tonnes in the United States and 4.5 tonnes globally. With all greenhouse gas emissions included, the number for Australia is 22 tonnes per person. GDP per person per year was about US$10,000 in 2018 in China and $55,000 in Australia ($18,000 and $52,000 adjusted for purchasing power). 5. China’s government intervenes to shift to a cleaner energy, industrial and transport system. Fighting air pollution is a top priority, and that also means lower CO2 reductions. Old power stations are replaced with more efficient ones and with wind, solar and nuclear plants; the fleet-wide efficiency of coal power plants in China is now far better than that in Australia. Inefficient industrial plants are replaced with higher value-adding activities, and the share of electric vehicles is rising sharply. Investment in greener kit is massive. A national emissions trading scheme is in preparation, though direct regulation has remained the mainstay of China’s policy approach. 6. All that said, China could do much more and move more quickly towards a lower-carbon economy. Heavy industries remain the backbone of the economy in many provinces, and building new coal-fired power plants means long-term carbon liabilities. And China continues to build coal power plants in other countries under its belt-and-road program. There is massive room for improvement. China could and should strengthen its 2030 emissions target, as just about all nations should. This could well happen next year. If so, then surely Beijing will ask Canberra about their plan for stronger commitments. Lambasting China goes down well in the US. But it could be costly. Australia is on track to be seen as being in lockstep with the US not only on security and other issues but on climate change, and that could come to haunt us. It must seem like we are asking to be left behind. And if the trade wars get worse, then carbon tariffs on climate policy laggards may be on the cards too. For China, a low-carbon future is desirable not only because it limits climate change, but because it creates new high value-added industries. China is positioning to become a dominant supplier of clean technologies. It is already the largest producer of solar panels, and it sees huge opportunities in markets for advanced electricity grid equipment, batteries, electric cars and much more. Decarbonisation of energy and industrial systems has started in most countries. It is happening in Australia and in the US, though driven more by technology than by policy. The governments of China and many other countries are actively going after the opportunities. Australia should seek a big role in a global low-carbon economy. We could become an exporter of renewable energy and of energy-intensive products made from renewable power, and secure our role as an energy exporter in a world that will increasingly shun fossil fuels. To get to that position we’ll need to be seen as partners, pulling in the same direction. Throwing barbs from the sidelines won’t get us there. • Frank Jotzo is the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University"

My wife and I are spending a few days at the Baltic Sea near Kiel, and so blogging will be a little on the light side.
I wanted to do some deepsea fishing yesterday, but the boats didn’t go out – not enough customers. They plan to go out tomorrow. Hopefully I can land that big one. It’s a bit disappointing as I wanted to be out on the sea for days, and not just one.
I’m having some technical difficulties picking up my e-mails (some of you have sent ). My son is going to reroute them over to me and so I’ll answer them as soon as I can. Sorry for the delay.
Hope to post something this evening!

The latest press release from the Helmholtz Institute, in Geestacht, Germany features Professor Hans von Storch and reports that he has been placed on the List Of The Top 100 Influential Germans by FOCUS magazine, who have dubbed him “The Climate Realist”.
Again, for the 2nd time this week, kudos to FOCUS.
Hans von Storch is a warmist (in name only?), and says man is having an impact on the climate. But unlike his paranoid colleagues at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research, whose neurotic science foresees only doom, gloom and catastrophe unless global society immediately suspends democracy and implements a radical and massive wealth redistribution scheme, von Storch prefers to stay within the realms of science and reason – both in practice and in function. Here’s what the Helmholtz press release says (excerpt, translated in English):
Hans von Storch, 61, The Climate Realist — apocalyptic bluster is foreign to him. Smart adaptation to change is Hans von Storch’s credo. The climate scientist from the University of Hamburg is not one of the skeptics, but is convinced like the majority of  his expert colleagues, that global warming is taking place. And because over the last years many exaggerations in climate scenarios have become known, his solid scientific argumentation is gaining more attention.”
‘Climate research is always a project involving many colleagues whose mutual findings can yield a certain amount of influence. Still, I’m pleased to be named because it demonstrates that a realistic approach with climate knowledge is gaining acceptance in the media,’ says Hans von Storch, Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht and Professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg.

The bit above about “not being one of the skeptics” is just standard CYA stuff. Who hasn’t been convinced that the earth has warmed? The question is: “Over which timescale?”
Personally, I’m been both pleased, and annoyed by von Storch. On one hand he is not an alarmist, and you can be sure he bases that on scientific data. Although I haven’t done a thorough review of his writings, he tends to produce results that fall into the sceptics column (he was one of the first to confirm McIntyre’s demolition of Mann’s hockey stick – which he called Quatsch – which means “nonsense” in English. He’s a skeptic of catastrophic scenarios – that’s pretty clear. He’s been attacked by a hot-headed Rahmstorf a number of times.
Yet, on the other hand, I find him making enough warmist comments without presenting data. It’s not for nothing he calls himself  “the honest broker” at his Klimazwiebel blog,…i.e. someone who takes a position in the middle, on the fence, and often acts to try to resolve opposing differences. One has to remember that in Germany being a skeptic is the same as committing career suicide. The only alternative is to move to the middle.
Give FOCUS credit for putting him on the list. I don’t know if any of the dark knights of climate science horrors from PIK , i.e. Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf or Edenhofer are on the list. I guess we’ll find out Monday when the new issue of FOCUS is available at news stands.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPro-Clim, a forum of the Swiss Academy of Sciences, has recently put out a news release titled: The Arguments of the Climate Skeptics. Below you’ll find the news release translated in English by yours truly. Hat tip to NoTricksZone reader John Patagon.
The Swiss Academy is apparently unswayed by the change in direction recently adopted by the Royal Society in Britain. Pro-Clim is sticking to activism and dogma, at least until further notice. Comically it claims that skepticism is scientific, but only if it does not come from climate skeptics. More on this below.
The news release that follows serves to remind warministas that the science is settled and that arguments against “climate change” are to be dismissed. So keep the faith! The release also links to a pdf file, which provides frustrated warministas with arguments they can use against skeptics in public debate. Here is the release in English:
===================================================================
The Arguments of the Climate Skeptics
Climate Press No. 29
Skepticism is the basis for scientific work, as scientific findings must be reproducible and stand up to rigorous examination. On the other hand, the skepticism coming from climate skeptics is problematic because they accept scientific proof only selectively.
The arguments from climate skeptics are numerous, but often contradictory. The facts behind climate change are challenged in more or less complex ways.  These are arguments that have been either refuted already, or simply are not scientifically plausible when examined more closely – but are always put forth anyway. In the meantime answers and detailed explanations for each point can be called up from websites at any time. A look at the collection of arguments allows them to be categorized into groups. Arguments made by climate skeptics almost always fall under one of the categories. The described categories will help you orgnanize the hundreds of arguments.
===================================================================
To me it seems strange that a scientific society would take sides instead of remaining neutral. I especially like their claim “the skepticism of climate skeptics is problematic because they accept the scientific proof only selectively“. What they are saying here is that skepticism becomes unwelcome and dismissible if it threatens their dogma.
When this belief becomes a guiding principle of a scientific society, then it has truly succeeded in reducing itself to a joke.
Sorry, but you don’t get to accept or dismiss skepticism based on whether you like it or not. If you don’t like skepticism because it’s “selective”, or “problematic”, then science is not your field.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNTZ reader and contributor Ed Caryl brings us his newest essay. This one is about the climate’s (low) sensitivity to CO2.
==================================================================
On CO2, Did You Know That… ?
By Ed Caryl
Nearly all the papers on CO2 and high global warming are based on climate models, not actual data.

Did you know that there is one paper that uses satellite data to actually measure CO2’s affect on climate?
Did you know that the temperature figure for CO2 doubling (climate sensitivity) found in that paper is 0.6°C?

Dr. Roy W. Spencer and Dr. John Christy are the “fathers” of satellite based global temperature measurements. Dr. Spencer is also the author of the book, The Great Global Warming Blunder. Dr. Spencer and Dr. William D. Braswell co-authored the above paper.
First, to prepare you, some mathematics:
The formula for the amount of warming due to a doubling of CO2 is:
X = ∆T * (3.7 W/m2)/∆F
Where X is the warming in °C,
∆T is the equilibrium temperature change measured in °C,

//-->




∆F is the sustained forcing in W/m2, that produced that change,
The 3.7 W/m2 figure is the radiative forcing due to doubled CO2 as measured at the top of the atmosphere. This figure is from the IPCC 2001 report, and is agreed on by most researchers, including Spencer in The Great Global Warming Blunder (page 48).
Any sustained forcing of less than 3.7 W/m2 is positive feedback, resulting in an X of 1°C or more. Any sustained forcing more than that figure is negative feedback, resulting in an X of less than 1°C. If there is no feedback, positive or negative, the figure for CO2 doubling is 1°C. The IPCC figures, 1.5 to 4.5°C, assume positive feedback, mostly from water vapor.
Most of the climate sensitivity calculations use climate models, rather than real-world data. All produce climate sensitivity numbers of more than 1°C, most centered around 3°C. Roy Spencer used actual satellite temperature measurement data to find the real-world climate sensitivity. In another paper, found here, he describes evidence that the forcing is between 6 and 8 W/m2, thus climate sensitivities for CO2 doubling of from 0.46 to 0.6°C, or 0.8 to 1°F. This low number is attributed to negative feedback from clouds. This is an inconsequential amount of warming, and even that may not be reached if CO2 does not double.
This low climate sensitivity along with ocean cycles like the AMO, ENSO, and PDO may be the reason for no warming since 1998. See Bob Tisdale’s post in WUWT here for reinforcement of that idea.
Have those figures been published in a peer-reviewed journal? Yes, in the Journal of Geophysical Research. See: Spencer-Braswell-JGR-2010.pdf
Is there any independent confirmation of such low climate sensitivity? Stephen E. Schwartz (2007) (also peer reviewed in the JGR) has studied the ocean heat capacity, and has produced two significant numbers: 1) the time constant for temperature changes is 5 ± 1 year, not the much longer periods touted by others. And 2) the climate sensitivity measured this way is 1.1 ±0.5°C, very close to the no feedback case, but not excluding Spencer and Braswell’s numbers. Schwartz uses GISS temperature data, not the somewhat lower satellite data, so his climate sensitivity number may be high.
Albert Einstein:
No amount of expeimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.
Well, here are two. (Three, if you count Bob Tisdale’s post.) These are “experiments” that use actual real-world data, not models. The science is settled? You be the judge.

"The forests still burn, but the world now looks away. In both the Amazon basin and the rainforests of Indonesia, the world-scorching inferno rages on, already forgotten by most of the media. Intricate living systems, species that took millions of years to evolve, are being incinerated in moments, then replaced with monocultures. Giant plumes of carbon tip us further into climate breakdown. And we’re not even talking about it.  But underneath the grief and frustration, I also feel disquiet. We rightly call on other nations to protect their stunning places. But where are our rainforests? I mean this both metaphorically and literally. Out of 218 nations, the UK ranks 189th for the intactness of its living systems. Having trashed our own wildlife, our excessive demand for meat, animal feed, timber, minerals and fossil fuels helps lay waste the rest of the world. Among our missing ecosystems are rainforests. Rainforests are not confined to the tropics: a good definition is forest wet enough to support epiphytes – plants that grow on other plants. Particularly in the west of Britain, where tiny fragments persist, you can find trees covered in rich growths of a fern called polypody, mosses and lichens, and flowering plants climbing the lower trunks. Learning that Britain is a rainforest nation astounds us only because we have so little left. We now know that, alongside keeping fossil fuels in the ground, natural climate solutions – using the mass restoration of nature to draw down carbon from the air – offer perhaps the last remaining chance to prevent more than 1.5C, or even 2C, of global heating. Saving the remaining rainforests and other rich ecosystems, while restoring those we have lost, is not just a nice idea: our lives may depend on it. But in countries like the UK, we urge others to act while overlooking our own disasters. Foreigners I meet are often flabbergasted by the state of our national parks. They see the sheepwrecked deserts and grousetrashed moors and ask: “What are you protecting here?” In the name of “cultural heritage” we allow harsh commercial interests, embedded in the modern economy but dependent on public money, to complete the kind of ecological cleansing we lament in the Amazon. Sheep farming has done for our rainforests what cattle ranching is doing to Brazil’s. Then we glorify these monocultures – the scoured, treeless hills – as “wild” and “unspoilt”. When the International Union for Conservation of Nature sought to classify our national parks, it had to invent a new category. Most of the world’s national parks are category I or II: set aside principally for nature. But all of ours are category V: places where, in practice, business comes first and nature last. Much of the land in our national parks is systematically burned. In the northern parks, this destruction is wreaked by grouse estates, and in Snowdonia by farmers. But on Dartmoor and Exmoor, the park authorities do it themselves, torching wildlife, roasting the soil, pouring carbon into the skies: everything we condemn elsewhere. The government’s new Landscapes Review is better than I expected, but its positive proposals are in no way commensurate with our ecological and climate crises. It suggests that England’s national parks and other protected landscapes should “have a renewed mission to recover and enhance nature … simply sustaining what we have is not nearly good enough”. But it does not argue that any of our parks should aim for something better than category V. Nor does it recommend that burning should cease, or that farming should withdraw from some places to allow rainforests and other rich habitats to recover. Where is the ambition our emergencies demand? We urgently need more trees, but we appear to believe that the only means of restoring them is planting. We have a national obsession with tree planting, which is in danger of becoming as tokenistic as bamboo toothbrushes and cotton tote bags. In many places rewilding, or natural regeneration – allowing trees to seed and spread themselves – is much faster and more effective, and tends to produce far richer habitats. All over the country, I see “conservation woodlands” that look nothing like ecological restoration and everything like commercial forestry: the ground blasted with glyphosate (a herbicide that kills everything), trees planted in straight rows, in plastic tree guards attached with cable ties to treated posts. It looks hideous, it takes decades to begin to resemble a natural forest and, in remote parts of the nation, it is often the primary cause of plastic litter, much of which is never recovered. There are no woodland creation grants in this country supporting natural regeneration: public money is pegged exclusively to the number of trees planted. This is one of the reasons for the shocking failure to meet the UK’s targets for new woodlands. The government should follow the hierarchical approach suggested by the conservationist Steve Jones. It should fund natural regeneration wherever possible. Where trees struggle to establish themselves, it should finance assisted regeneration (clearing competing vegetation). Only where those options won’t work should it offer grants for tree planting. But while nature loves a mess, officialdom abhors one: instead of natural exuberance it seeks neat industrial rows. Don’t expect much help from politicians. Michael Gove’s successor as environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, seems tongue-tied, apparently terrified of offending vested interests. Labour’s vote for a Green New Deal, with a 2030 deadline for decarbonisation (20 years before the government’s) is exciting. But we now need to see its commitments on industrial emissions matched by ambitious proposals for ecological restoration. Nor are the big conservation groups filling the void. Ours is an extraordinary situation: a nation of nature lovers, obsessed by wildlife programmes, represented by gigantic NGOs, but apparently incapable of preventing the precipitous decline of wildlife and habitats. The conservation groups have manifestly failed to translate our love of nature into action. They betray their radical roots. The National Trust arose from the Commons Preservation Society, that tore down fences to return land to the people. Now it allows the forces it once contested to ride roughshod over its land, allowing trail hunts and exclusive grouse shoots to erode the sense of national ownership. On its Exmoor estate, in the resource book it publishes for school teachers, it celebrates burning the land. The RSPB was founded by women seeking to ban the import of birds’ plumage for hats – they eventually succeeded. Now, as independent ecologists raise massive petitions to ban driven grouse shooting, the RSPB undermines their campaigns by calling for this devastating practice to be, er, licensed. Hesitation and appeasement reign. We should continue to mobilise against the destruction of the world’s great habitats, and its terrifying implications. But the most persuasive argument we can make is to show we mean it, by restoring our own lost wonders. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Merkel suddenly decided that coal power plants emitting 4% more CO2 is no longer a problem.
Not long ago, Chancellor Merkel called climate change due to greenhouse gases emitted by man the greatest crisis facing humanity and said no efforts can be spared in drastically reducing CO2 emissions. So grave was the CO2-climate problem that a massive, society-altering $15 trillion plan was recently unveiled by Brussels, all with the target of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% over the next 40 years.
Suddenly all the imperative and urgency oc climate change gets waved aside.
Veteran author Hartmut Bachmann at Die Freie Welt has written an essay on Angela Merkel’s knee-jerk reaction in ordering the closure of 7 of Germany’s 17 reactors, in a political knee-jerk response to Fukushima. Bachmann writes:
The only energy that can really be delivered free of CO2 on a large scale was and is from nuclear power plants. But these have been ordered shut down without a single mention of  the word – the term – CO2, neither from the government nor – as is expected– from the media. And this was done without any discussion whatsoever on the consequences this would have on the government’s fight for our purported survivial against CO2. This exposes the fight against CO2 as a hoax, as a fiction, that only serves to bilk the citizens rather than serve them.”

The reactors were certified as safe just months ago
The shutdown of the seven reactors, which were deemed completely safe just a few months earlier, and so were granted extended operating times, will now result in much more coal-burning, which of course will increase Germany’s CO2 emissions by a staggering 4%.
Years of painful investment to reduce CO2 are thus being wiped out, all with the snap of a finger, by the once CO2-fearful Merkel.
One has to ask just how threatened is the human race from Co2 after all. Not very much if coal plants spewing millions of tonnes more of CO2 are even safer than allowing technically approved nuclear reactors to run – in an area that is free of tsunamis and earthquakes.

"Scott Morrison signalled that Australia is unlikely to update its emissions reduction commitments under the Paris agreement before a speech to the UN in which he declared that the media was misrepresenting the country’s climate change record. During a press conference before his UN speech at a recycling facility in Brooklyn, the prime minister said he wouldn’t characterise “misrepresentations” about Australia’s climate stance as fake news. But he suggested that negative media coverage fuelled criticism that was “completely false and completely misleading”. People expressed “prejudiced” views about Australia’s climate policy, he said – “Now where do they get their information from? Who knows, maybe they read it.” Asked whether Australia intended to update its emissions reduction commitments as required by the Paris agreement’s five-yearly review process, Morrison suggested that Australia’s 2030 target was fixed: “We are keeping to the commitments we have set and do you know why? That’s what I put to the Australian people.” The Paris global climate accord includes a five-yearly global stocktake to assess collective progress, and Morrison’s signal in the US appears at odds with advice this year from Australian officials who restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic commitments when the EU and China questioned Australia’s policies. Asked whether he would keep a commitment Australia made at the Pacific Islands Forum to develop a 2050 climate policy by next year, Morrison said: “We will assess that as we said we would do, but my priority is meeting 2020 and 2030. We will look at the broader context but, honestly, our focus is on meeting those commitments.” The forum’s communique says all parties to the Paris agreement will “formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020”. With Morrison facing criticism for failing to attend Monday’s climate action summit at the UN, and with attendees at the UN general assembly reporting that Australia is getting some negative blowback because of climate change – the prime minister sought to use his first address to the UN as leader to project a more positive message about his country’s stance. “Australia is taking real action on climate change and getting results,” he told world leaders. “We are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and economic future. “Australia’s internal and global critics on climate change willingly overlook or ignore our achievements, as the facts simply don’t fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution. Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions. Australia is doing our bit on climate change and we reject any suggestion to the contrary.” Morrison said few countries in the OECD could report to the general assembly that they had overachieved on their Kyoto commitments. He didn’t mention Australia was given special treatment in the Kyoto process – it was permitted to include carbon emissions from land clearing. He said emissions per person and the economy’s emissions intensity were at their lowest levels in 29 years. He did not tell the general assembly that emissions across the economy are rising in Australia, and have risen every year since the Coalition abolished the carbon price. Emissions in the electricity sector had fallen, he said: “In the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia’s electricity sector were 15.7% lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009.” But he did not mention that emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising, driven predominantly by an increase in liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia, and transport. Morrison also noted that while Australia was a “resource-rich country, it is important to note that Australia only accounts for around 5.5% of the world’s coal production”. After the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg used an appearance at the UN this week to excoriate the lack of action by world leaders, Morrison returned serve in the same venue. Australia’s prime minister said his view was that children had “a right not just to their future but to their optimism”. He told the general assembly he received “many letters from children in Australia concerned about their future”. “We should let our kids be kids – teenagers be teenagers – while we work positively together to deliver practical solutions for them and their future,” he said. Morrison said Australia was committed “to leading urgent action to combat plastic pollution choking our oceans; tackle overexploitation of our fisheries, prevent ocean habitat destruction and take action on climate change”. He said Australia was determined to create a “circular plastics economy”. “Recently, I announced that Australia will ban exports of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres, starting in 2020. That’s about 1.4m tonnes of potent recyclable material. “Australia is also leading on practical research and development into recycling – turning recycled plastic and glass waste into roads, manufacturing 100% recycled PET bottles and capturing methane and waste to create energy. “New technologies are coming on line with the potential to recycle used plastics into valuable new plastics – creating a circular plastics economy.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said Australia would invest $167m in a domestic recycling plan and create the right investment environment so that new technologies were commercialised, “preventing pollution entering our oceans, and creating valuable new products”. The prime minister also restated that Australia would be investing in climate actions through the aid budget in its region rather than through the UN climate fund. He rejected a view expressed this week by the UN’s chief, António Guterres, who warned the 74th general assembly that the world faced a “great fracture”, with the countries at risk of cleaving between the US and China. Australia would resist the path of “binary choices”, Morrison said. “Approaching its 75th anniversary next year, the UN must reform and evolve to respond effectively to the challenges of the 21st century, and to fulfil its core mandate, the UN must be ever mindful of the principles and values that have always been foundational to the UN’s efforts.” He said the UN was founded on liberal democratic principles: “We believe they should remain the guiding principles for the UN into the future.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite all the media über-hype about this year’s “weather extremes”, which are normal to begin with, and the upcoming Cancun Conference, the German index of public interest on climate protection fell yet again during the 3rd quarter of 2010, from 56 to 55, according to the co2online GmbH, a program set up by the German Ministry for the Environment.
Public interest in climate protection continues to wane in Germany.
The reason for the drop was due to the lack of interest by the media in reporting on climate change. The public is bored by the topic.
The Climate Barometer is published every quarter and is based on the evaluation of 4 indicators, which are converted to form the Climate Barometer index.
Experts complained about the continued wane in public interest. Thomas Hirsch of the organisation: Bread for the World:

In the energy debate, climate protection is an issue that was very much overshadowed by the recent issue of nuclear power in Germany.

Prof Dr Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research:

Flooding in Pakistan and heatwave in Russia brought the topic in the media, but incredibly little. There is hardly any discussion on the causes of such extreme events.

I can’t help Mr Hirsch, but perhaps I can give Dr Rahmstorf, Prince of Panic, some background on extreme weather events and their causes.
Source: http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~maue/tropical/global_running_ace.jpg
Cyclones globally are near record lows and have been falling 20 years. Thus it can’t be because of global warming. So get a life Dr Rahmstorf. You’re fooling no one.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the bitter cold and snowfall forecast for the days ahead in northern and central Europe, this winter is truly shaping up to be the 3rd consecutive hard winter to batter Europe with snow and cold. This of course all flies in the face of projections made 10 years ago and even less. I thought now is a good time to bring up what the consensus and settled science told us 10 years ago.
The Independent brought us an infamous story that has become a favorite of the climate realists, click here, titled:

Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past
Britain’s winter ends tomorrow with further indications of a striking environmental change: snow is starting to disappear from our lives.
According to Dr David Viner, a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia,within a few years winter snowfall will become ‘a very rare and exciting event’.
‘Children just aren’t going to know what snow is,’ he said.”

And what gets printed by The Independent in March gets used for April Fools Day by Der Spiegel, read here, article dated 1 April 2000:

Snow never again?
Influenced by man, temperatures will continue to rise here with a certainty of 95%. In Germany the bitter cold winters belong to the past: ‘Winter with deep frosts and a lot of snow like 20 years ago will no longer occur at our latitudes”, says scientist Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg”
Damn that 5%! To be honest, it seems like Der Spiegel has April Fools climate stories every day.
Finally, WDR German public television talk show “Hart aber fair” (Hard but fair) featured the following topic on January 17, 2007, i.e. less than three years ago!

Warmer winters, broken climate – welcome to the hot future?

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to locate the video clip of that show. But it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to imagine what that discussion was like.
Today things are indeed very different. Suddenly all the talk of warm winters in central Europe has disappeared from the media radar. Instead all the talk is now about hard winters coming to Europe – due to global warming, of course.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have been told that trace gas CO2 dictates the world’s climate, overpowering the oceans and solar factors. So now we should not be surprised when someone tells us that the atmosphere dominates the behavior of the oceans, which are far more massive.
The stream of  junk environmental science doesn’t stop flowing. Again a small group is trying to convince us that the tail wags the dog. Actually in this case, the flea at the end of the tail is wagging the dog (CO2 causes climate change, which in turn causes “ocean change”).
The German warmist website klimaretter (in English that means “climate rescuer”) has become a leading provider of kook warmist stories lately. Their latest is here: Researchers Warning Of Ocean Change, which cites a report officially released today by World Ocean Review in Hamburg.

Climate change does not only lead to rising temperatures and rising sea levels, but it also leads to increased oceanic acidification.
According to today’s online Stern magazine, in its article The world’s oceans – exploited and trashed:
‘The world’s oceans are now a high risk patient that has a chance – if given the right therapy,’ says Martin Visbeck, spokesman for the Cluster Of Excellence”
The recent report is the result of two years of work done by 40 researchers.
The Ocean Science and Research Foundation, a foundation set up by Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a fighter for ocean protection, financed the oceans’ status report. Also involved was the International Ocean Institute, which she also created.
There you have it – activist-sponsored science, which means it has nothing to do with objectivity. In the future a World Ocean Review will be released every 2 years. The latest report not only focuses on CO2-caused acidification, but on over-fishing and trash in the oceans.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProgress is not achieved by abandoning development
Imagine if the Wright Brothers had abandoned flight after the first mishap, only listening to the voices of fear that heavy objects have no place in the air and that it isn’t possible to eliminate accidents? Imagine if society had abandoned the automobile after the first deadly accident? Imagine if early doctors had been prevented from attempting surgery on a seriously ill person. Of course, if humans had given up after every failure, we’d still be in the Stone Ages – if not extinct.
Japan’s disaster will provide valuable lessons learned
I believe the disaster in Japan will act as a blessing is disguise. I say this because many lessons will be learned from this incident. This is not to say we are pleased about any injury or death resulting there – that’s tragic. I’m saying we have the chance to learn from it. It’s already quite impressive that the Fukushima facility survived the 9.0 mega-earthquake and was done in only by the ensuing mega-tsunami. Fukushima was subjected to an extreme natural event and the results will lead to many valuable findings. It’s up to us if they will be applied to future power plants. It’s a chance to improve our lives.
China and applying lessons learned
China has announced it will put its plans to build new nuclear facilities on hold for now. This in no way means China is abandoning its ambitious plan to build nuclear power plants. Indeed it is going to pause and take a look at what went wrong at Fukushima, and then apply the lessons learned to its own plants, making them more sound, and equipped with better and even more reliable redundant safety systems. The result: China’s nuclear power plants of the future will be even safer, more modern and thus will end up saving many lives with the reliable supply of electricity they will provide.
China’s bold electrical energy plan: 200 reactors
Along with 2000 coal-fired power plants, with each one getting more modern, China will also add a huge number of nuclear reactors to its energy supply infrastructure over the next 2 decades. Already China is currently constructing 27 reactors, another 50 have been approved and funded, and a whopping 110 additional reactors are proposed. China today is already the number 2 economy globally. With addition of hundreds of power plants, China will surely be the powerhouse of the future. That does not come from being chicken with small risks, but from boldness and belief in huge technological progress.
Some western countries are abandoning development
Many western countries, on the other hand are taking the opposite approach. Instead applying lessons learned, they are moving back to the Dark Ages, when energy was harnessed from the wind or direct sunlight, where the energy yield per square meter is in the range of watts, and not kilowatts or megawatts. Oil is being abandoned, so is coal – and now nuclear.
The west reacts with fear and hysteria

The accident in Japan did not lead Germany to examine what went wrong and to attempt applying lessons learned to improve safety and reliability at its own reactors, rather it has decided, in a fit panic and hysteria, to abandon the technology altogether and relinquish it to other competing countries. No othe rcountry has reacted so rashly. Physicist Dr. Peter Heller at Science Skeptical explains why:
There were times in history when ignorance and cowardice overshadowed human life. It was a time when our ancestors were forced to lead a life filled with superstition and fear because they were forbidden to use their creativity and fantasy. Religious dogma, like the earth being the centre of the unverse, or creationism, forbade people to question. The forbiddance of opening a human body and examining it prevented questions from being answered. Today these Medieval rules appear to us as backwards and close-minded. We simply cannot imagine this way of thinking having any acceptance.
Unfortunately today, they do. It is well-documented in nuclear and climate science.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s response to Fuskushima? She blinked, panicked and immediately shut down 7 of Germany’s nuclear reactors, and then announced an accelerated shut down of nuclear energy in Germany overall. I’m not aware of earthquake-prone Japan even shutting down its other nuclear reactors. Such actions are undertaken only by hysterical minds.
Superstition and prophesies of disaster pervade
Today in modern Germany, and in many western countries, phony catastrophe scenarios, both in nuclear science and climate science, are being served up as science when in fact they are pure dogma – i.e. gross departures of science – and are solely intended to spread fear. We are discouraged from asking questions; we are told to believe the “experts”. Do not dare to ask questions.
Religion in technology
The media and anti-nuclear technology activists are now applying religious terms to describe the Fukushima disaster: Armegeddon, mega-disaster, catastrophe, etc. Some have even attempted to connect the earthquake and tsunami to climate change, caused by man’s activity, without producing an iota of data to support this. Like God’s wrath on man in the Bible, it’s Nature’s wrath on man. Nuclear power has been branded as evil, although it has a very high level of safety in almost every country where it is used.
Sure there will be accidents and mishaps, but they will become rarer and smaller, and the benefits will far outweigh them. Just like all other technical products and systems.
Heller ends his essay:
I am a physicist. I’d like to live in a world that is willing to learn and to improve whatever is good. I would only like to live in a world where great strides in physics are viewed with fascination, pride and hope because they show us the way to a better future. I would only like to live in a world that has the courage for a better world. Any other world for me is unacceptable. Never. That’s why I am going to fight for this world, without ever relenting.
I agree with Dr. Heller and he has plenty of company. There are many out there who share his view. As dogma, fear, superstition take hold and western society slips backwards into dark times, more and more on Heller’s side will make their voices heard.

"Scott Morrison has responded to an impassioned speech by the Swedish teenage climate activistGreta Thunberg at the United Nations by declaring the climate change debate is subjecting Australian children to “needless anxiety”. The Australian prime minister, who will address environmental themes in his address to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, including ocean management, plastics, waste management and illegal fishing, was asked for his response to Thunberg’s excoriation of world leaders at this week’s climate action summit, when she accused the political class of failing the younger generations. Morrison told reporters he acknowledged “how deeply people feel about this issue” but said the public debate was replete with disinformation about Australia’s climate change policies. “It often comes as news to people when I share with them Australia has the highest per capita investment in renewable energy of any country in the world,” Morrison said – in the process neglecting to mention that his predecessor Tony Abbott had tried to wind back the renewable energy target, which triggered an investment strike. Morrison said he would use his looming address to the UN – his final public commitment before leaving New York for Australia on Wednesday – to address the lack of awareness about “the action Australia has been taking”. “I do understand that people feel strongly about this, but I think we also have to take stock, we have to ensure we get a proper context and perspective,” Morrison said. “I want children growing up in Australia to feel positive about their future, and I think it is important we give them that confidence that they will not only have a wonderful country and pristine environment to live in, that they will also have an economy to live in as well. “I don’t want our children to have anxieties about these issues.” Asked whether Australian children would be less anxious about the worst-case scenarios associated with climate change if Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were falling instead of rising, and if the Morrison government would make a clear commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said kids needed to be given “context and perspective”. He acknowledged that he spoke to his own daughters, aged 10 and 12, about climate change. “We don’t have deep conversations about emissions reduction targets and what’s happening with the Kyoto protocol and Paris, but we talk about fossil fuels and we talk about what they learn at school, and I encourage them to have a passionate independent view about how they see the world, but I also give them a lot of context. “I don’t allow them to be basically contorted into one particular view. I like them to make up their own mind but I also like to give them reassurance because the worst thing I would impose on any child is needless anxiety. They’ve got enough things to be anxious about. “We’ve got to let kids be kids. We can’t have them growing up as mushrooms, but we’ve got to get a bit of context into this.” Morrison said being present at the United Nations should also serve as a reminder that the world was fully capable of solving vexed problems and responding to existential threats. “Australia has dealt with so many issues in the past, and the world has dealt with so many difficult issues in the past, and here [at the UN in New York], we are reminded of that.” Australian observers in New York have told Guardian Australia Morrison’s failure to attend a UN climate action summit on Monday despite being in the US, and his apparent rejection of the need for Australia to do more to address its rising greenhouse gas emissions, had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist of Climate Analytics and a longtime adviser to countries at climate talks, has dismissed Morrison’s argument this week that China had to be treated as a developed  economy in the context of climate change and embark on more ambitious emissions reduction as a “ridiculous fake argument”. Hare said China, the world’s most populous country and biggest annual polluter, was not doing anywhere near enough to tackle the crisis, but was doing more than Australia on many measures. It had national policies in a number of areas – boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles and efficiency in industry – where Australia did not. Greenhouse gas emissions have been rising in Australia since the Coalition repealed Labor’s carbon price despite the country’s commitments to reduce pollution under the Paris agreement. Total national emissions have increased each year since 2014. The government says it will meet the commitments made under the Paris agreement, but its carbon pollution roadmap for doing so shows Australia is relying on a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet the 2030 target. The indicative roadmap for emissions reductions to 2030 includes an electric vehicle strategy that the government has not yet unveiled, and the government has also booked just under 100Mt of abatement to “technology solutions” that are not specified. Morrison signed a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum that included a commitment to “formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020” – but asked this week whether he would deliver on that undertaking, the prime minister hedged. Renewables have boomed after rebounding from the Abbott government’s efforts to dismantle the renewable energy target, but a recent forecast from the industry warned that investment has slowed right down in the absence of policy certainty in climate and energy. The Coalition abandoned a key policy mechanism for the electricity sector – the national energy guarantee – in the middle of the conservative-led strike on Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. The forecast from the Clean Energy Council says the large-scale RET, which winds down after 2020, led to 15,700MW of new capacity being financially committed over the past two years, with that generation either under construction or recently commissioned. “But with the absence of policy certainty beyond the 2020 RET and a range of regulatory barriers to overcome, investment commitments in new generation have fallen dramatically this year,” it said. “Quarterly investment commitments in new renewable energy projects reached a high of over 4500MW in late 2018, but has since collapsed to less than 800MW in each of the first two quarters of 2019.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember the prepsoterous Stern Report claiming warming is costing the planet dearly, and so we should avoid it?
Well, we know climate is always changing, which means only one of two things can happen – either it gets warmer, or it gets colder. We’ve been told time and again that we simply can’t tolerate any more dangerous warming. So what’s left? Cooling.
Many of us are getting a taste of it now. How do you like it?
The high costs of cooling
Airports are closed down, flights cancelled, thousands of travellers are stranded, motorways are jammed to a standstill, supply routes are blocked, railways are paralyzed, car accidents and injuries have skyrocketed, the economy has ground to a halt. Folks, this is going to cost a bundle. How much?
Dr. Karsten Brandt has roughly calculated the cost here at donnerwetter.de in his piece today titled:
Never has a winter been so expensive – 600 euros more costs per household
On average households can expect to incur €600 in extra costs compared to the average over the years. The biggest part of that will be heating and electricity costs of 300-400 euros. In addition there are other winter costs such as salt, winter damage to autos and other losses. The costs for households will reach €30 billion nationwide.
And if you include the waiting times resulting from the massive traffic jams on the motorways, that figure jumps to 80 to 100 billion euros.

This does not include the agricultural losses that are sure to be added. The construction industry is now completely idled as well. And it’s going to get worse.
The economic damage from the winter weather can only be roughly estimated. If the cold winter continues as forecast, we calculate an economic damage of about €100 billion from production shutdowns, losses with the supply chains, price increases in energy etc.
Send the bill to the Munich Re. A hundred billion euros means 2000 euros for each household in Germany. The figures are similar in Great Britain.
Government incompetence and willful neglect
Governments were woefully unprepared for this cooling, all because of close-mindedness and dogmatism.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and most politicians have been an abject failure over the last years. They stupidly based all their preparedness and winter planning for the future on the crystal balls and sorcerers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the the now disgraced Met Office in England. Policy based on fantasy. That’s gross negligence.
Also read how the biased Met Office mislead the public: gwpf.org.
Climategate did nothing to sway them to think that things might be a little amiss at theie climate research centres. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand when the scandal was uncovered. Indeed they even whitewashed away all the gross deficienies that had been exposed, and continued thinking it’s going to get warmer.  They are completely blinded by radical dogmatism, relying on incompetent scientists and tarot cards. This is horrible judgement and willful neglect on the part of Europe’s leaders.
These leaders need to make a U-Turn or resign. Leaders who cannot get past their dogmatism become menaces to the societies they’ve been entrusted to serve. They are costing us money – and lives.

My last article, Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real (But It’s Not From CO2, contained the statement: “No one (to my knowledge) has researched what part of the global temperature rise is due to energy use. All energy use ultimately goes to heat. This is what causes the heat islands.” This raised eyebrows in at least one reader, who commented, to paraphrase, that in his opinion, heat islands were caused by solar energy acting on and with the structures in the city, pavements, buildings, etc. The answer is: both solar and anthropogenic heat contribute to heat islands.
There have been studies done on some towns and cities. I cited the study done on Barrow, Alaska in A Light In Siberia. The heat island there is 2.2°C in winter when there is no sunlight at Barrow’s latitude north of the Arctic Circle. At Barrow, it is clear that the heat island is due to the fuel used to heat the village. To quote from that study, “There was a strong positive relation between monthly UHI magnitude and natural gas production/use. Integrated over the period September–May.”
Fairbanks, Alaska, has also been studied for heat island. There, the heat island was shown to grow with increasing population over the 50 year time period from 1949 to 1999. The temperature difference at the end of this period was 1°C in mid-winter at Fairbanks airport, 7 kilometers from downtown, compared to Eielson Air Force Base, about 40 kilometers away, and nil in the summer. Again, as Fairbanks is nearly at the Arctic Circle, solar heating cannot be the cause.
What about heat islands further south? This author has lived in the Pacific Northwest of the US for most of his life, the last 50 years in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. In winter, there have been several hundred occasions when it was raining in the downtown areas, and snowing in the suburbs or surrounding rural areas. These cities are well known for cloudy and rainy climate, especially in the winter, when the sun may not shine for months at a time. These winter heat islands cannot be solar caused.
In Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real, the article stated that the U. S. used 29 PetaWattHours of energy in 2005. This is from all sources: fossil fuels, hydroelectric, wood, solar, wind-turbines, and pedal-power included. The last three contributed insignificantly, so can be ignored. The total land area of the contiguous 48 states is just over 8 million square kilometers. In 2002, urban area was less that 3% of the land area, or 240,000 km2 and 79% of the population lived in these urban areas. If each person consumes roughly the same amount of energy, then roughly 23 PetaWattHours was used in less than 240,000 km2, or almost 1010 WattHours per square kilometer, or 100 kilowatthours per square meter annually in urban areas. This is 6.1% of the sun’s energy on that same square meter. This will raise the temperature in that square meter by 17.4°C.
This figure seems a little high, as it is more than the NASA heat images reveal (10 to 15°C), and more than most studies have stated. This is probably because more energy is consumed between urban areas, for transportation (jet fuel, long-haul trucks, auto travel), farm energy use, electricity transport losses, and losses from the wind simply blowing it away to the rest of the northern hemisphere. But it does indicate that energy use heating may be the large factor in urban warming.

But what about the city structure itself absorbing solar energy and providing it back to the environment? This undoubtedly happens. The ability of a land surface to reflect solar energy is called albedo. The scale is zero for no reflectance, or complete absorbance, to 1 for perfect reflection. Lamp-black has an albedo of nearly zero, and fresh fallen powder snow has an albedo of nearly 1. Cities are fairly dark because asphalt city streets and parking lots, along with most roofing materials, are a large percentage of the surface. Most cities have an albedo of between 0.1 and 0.2. The average albedo of the earth is between 0.29 and 0.35, but it varies widely from about 0.9 or more for Antarctica and Greenland, to 0.2 for forests and vegetated areas. Deserts and dry grasslands have an albedo of 0.4 to 0.5. The oceans have an albedo of less than 0.1.

Figure 1. Terrestrial earth albedo. Source: NASA Earth Observatory, http://www.eoearth.org/article/Albedo?topic=54300
A city with an urban core that has an albedo of less than 0.2, surrounded by desert or grasslands with an albedo of 0.4 to 0.5, will be warmer than the surrounding area because it absorbs more solar radiation. Any heat energy produced by the population will simply add slightly to that heat. Examples would be Phoenix, Arizona or Cairo, Egypt.
There is a study that compared energy use and albedo for several cities. The link is below. If a city is mostly light colored concrete, with an albedo of 0.2, and is surrounded by suburbs with green lawns and asphalt streets, with an albedo of 0.11 to 0.16, the city core may be cooler than the surrounding area because the city core reflects more heat than the darker surroundings. An example would be Los Angeles, California.
Cities north of about 45° latitude, such as New York City, Montreal, Moscow, and of course Fairbanks and Barrow Alaska, will tend to have more anthropogenic heat than solar heat. Cities south of that line will tend to solar heating. A compact city will have more anthropogenic heat than one that is spread out because the anthropogenic heat will warm a smaller area. Again, New York City, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and Moscow, Russia, are good examples of compact cities with extreme heat islands driven by energy consumption. St. Louis, Missouri, USA and Berlin, Germany are the opposite examples with heat islands that are predominately driven by the sun. A city’s location, days of sunshine, density, and the character of the structures, will define whether the heat island is predominately caused by the sun or by the people.
One of the commenters on Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real…wanted an explanation on why some urban surface stations show a cooling trend. The answer lies in the local trends in albedo. If cities or regions get lighter, (white concrete streets replacing asphalt, increasing numbers of white sheet metal, or white painted roofs replacing tarred or composition roofs, increasing parks and open spaces, etc.) conditions would favor declining temperatures. A recent paper about land use changes in Spain cites an example where greenhouse horticulture in the southeastern part of the country changed the albedo locally by +0.09 changing the local temperature trend to –0.3°C/decade. Changes in land use, population density, vegetation, or even changes in local building codes may change the local albedo and change the trend in temperature. Very small changes in local albedo will lead to noticeable changes in local temperature trends.
Temperature change driven by urban warming or cooling, and albedo changes are what makes the total global surface temperature trend so maddingly difficult to ascertain. In the absence of man’s influence on albedo or burning of fossil fuel (ignoring any possible CO2 influence), the earth may be warming, or it may be cooling. We simply do not know. Albedo changes and energy use are masking the truth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel has a report here today on what an accelerated shutdown of all 17 German nuclear reactors by 2020 would mean.
Germany was spooked by the nuclear disaster in Japan, all fueled by turbo-hysteria from its media. In a knee-jerk reaction, unmatched by no other country in the world, Angela Merkel’s coalition government ordered 7 of the country’s reactors be shut down immediately. Now activists are demanding the shutdown of all reactors.
This, of course, is easier said than done. Who or what would step in to fill in the 20.8 gigawatt gap?
Half of Germany covered by solar panels
In a nutshell, this would be horribly expensive, and ugly. Der Spiegel looks at what Germany would look like if it converted over to mainly renewables such as solar, wind and biogas by 2020 in place of the nuclear reactors. This is how Der Spiegel describes it:
The dream of a rapid shutdown of nuclear reactors is technically possible. But it would have a high price.
First of all it would profoundly alter the landscape of Germany.
In the 2020 scenario, the current status quo of wind and solar would be multiplied many times over: 46 gigawatts of wind energy, 52 gigawatts of photovoltaic and 8 gigawatts of biomass – quasi half of Germany would be paved with solar panels. Huge rotors would litter the landscape. On fields, there would be a questionable monoculture of bioenergy plants.”
So why does all this massive government intervention and state-controlled energy remind us of Soviet style central-panning? The consequences certainly threaten to be the same: an abject failure and bankruptcy.
Not only would this trash and ruin Germany’s once idyllic countryside, but it would probably bankrupt he country too. According to Der Spiegel stopping nuclear and switching over to  a hodge-podge of unsteady renewables would first require an investment of € 245 billion just to build up the needed equipment and infrastructure. Then consumers would also have to bear much higher electricity rates.
Lack of acceptance

Der Spiegel also looks at the problem of dwindling acceptance of renewable energy due to consumers’ displeasure with their rising electric bills and the scourge to the landscape they represent. Der Spiegel:
Indeed large wind turbines are again and agin met with fierce protest. And even the most green-blooded environmentalists fly into rages because of the growing corn monoculture.
Windmills and solar systems have short lifetimes
Unfortunately, Der Spiegel and the eco-masterminds also seem to have failed to notice another costly factor: operating lifetimes. While lifetimes of 40 years are not uncommon for coal and nuclear power plants, they are much shorter for renewable energy systems. 20 years is already a pipe dream.
This all means everything would have to be replaced soon, and again at a huge cost. Let’s not forget the higher maintenance costs as well.
Back to 200 years ago
But costs have never discouraged the eco-masterminds in their pursuit of their goals. People can be brainwashed into accepting them, at least that’s what Michael Sterner, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy Systems Technology (IWES) and advisor to the federal government, seems to think:
The acceptance for renewable energy must be urgently increased. Because of climate change, resource shortages and the atomic catastrophe, people have to be made aware that our energy supply system must return back above ground – just like it always was 200 years ago.”
The irony of the Japan earthquake is that in the end Germany may be the country that winds up with the most damage. Not because of the tsunami per se, but because of a tsunami of technical and economic blindness.
200 years back? That would be about right.
==============================================
UPDATE: I’d also like to remind the taxpayer-subsidised Fraunhofer Institute how energy needs were met 200 years ago. Have they ever wondered what happened to all of Europe’s forests back then?

"David Attenborough has criticised the Morrison government’s record on climate policy and support for new coalmines. In an interview that will air on Triple J’s Hack on Tuesday, the celebrated broadcaster and natural historian also said visiting coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, that have bleached due to warming oceans is “a tragic sight”.  Attenborough told the program that previous Australian governments had been “saying all the right things” on climate policy but this had changed. “You are the keepers of an extraordinary section of the surface of this planet, including the Barrier Reef, and what you say, what you do, really, really matters. “And when you’ve been upstanding and talking about what I see as the truth and and you suddenly say, ‘No it doesn’t matter ... it doesn’t matter how much coal we burn ... we don’t give a damn what it does to the rest of the world.” Attenborough also criticised then treasurer Scott Morrison for bringing a lump of coal to question time in 2017. “I don’t think it was a joke,” he said. “If you weren’t opening a coalmine OK I would agree, it’s a joke. But you are opening a coalmine.”  The conservationist said politicians are capable of building support for stronger action on the climate crisis by appealing “to what people think is right”. “Do you think it’s right that we go on destroying the natural world?” he said. He also said there was an economic advantage in taking more urgent action on global heating because businesses and the finance sector will be exposed to greater financial risk if the world doesn’t move quickly enough. In July this year, Attenborough told a UK parliamentary committee that the Great Barrier Reef was the starkest example of climate change’s impact that he had seen. He also told the parliament that Australia was an “extraordinary” example of a country where climate deniers remained in parliament despite the country facing some of the worst effects of global heating. In the interview with Hack, Attenborough said “a bleached reef is a tragic sight”. “A desperately tragic sight, particularly if you’ve seen it before, and you know what it could have been like.” The full interview is on Hack on Tuesday from 5.30pm and the ABC’s 7.30 program."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI get really nervous, I have to admit, when the President of the United States, who happens to be a leftist ideologue, sits down with really powerful people who happen to be the biggest players in the US Internet and communication technology. Politics the Chicago-way is not exclusive to Chicago.
This is the table where deals are made. “Cheers to helping me out”.
Obama meets with Internet and Technology executives. (Photo source: White House release, by Pete Souza)
 You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours. Corporations don’t make big changes in business plans and policy unless there are very promising incentives to do so. And the President of the United States is someone who is fully capable of delivering such incentives.
Is this really about creating jobs? A little. But anyone can tell you that the CEOs attending this dinner are capable of only creating so many jobs – a number that wouldn’t even change the US unemployment statistics.
Everyone also knows that most jobs get created by the small to medium-size companies. Give small business some incentives, and watch the economy take off. Yet, no one was there at the dinner to represent them.
Small and medium-size business are being ignored. And we already know how strained the relations between the representative of the these businesses, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Obama Administration are. I’d have to conclude that this meeting was not really about jobs, but about how to win next year’s election, and how to turn the tide of politics back to where it was 2 years ago.
One important way to do this would be to take stronger control over the internet. Doing this by law would backfire, of course. So just let the companies do the dirty work for you.
Take a look at some of the persons in attendence:

Eric Schmidt, Google
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
Dick Costolo, Twitter
Carol Bartz, Yahoo!
Steve Jobs, Apple
John Chambers, Cisco Systems
Larry Ellison, Oracle
Reed Hastings, CEO, NetFlix

Although these people won’t be able to create enough jobs to solve USA’s economic crisis, they are capable of rescuing Obama’s presidency with lots of money and assisting in providing “better communication” to the public. Again, it makes me nervous. Obama is fighting a war not in Iraq or Afghanistan, but at home.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back Steve Goddard was looking at unusual extreme events that occurred – back in the days when CO2 was at benign levels and the weather was supposedly always “normal”. Here’s another one. Anton Yevseyev of the Pravda.Ru news wrote about rare twisters hitting Russia. Though the main part of his report is about twisters that hit in 1984, he mentions one that hit way back in 1904 as well.
He writes:
The most destructive twister occurred in Central Russia in 1904   The twister appeared near Moscow, destroyed two villages and then ravaged the city itself. Over 100 people were killed and over 200 were wounded.”
Imagine the media if something like this happened today. More on the 1904 twister can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1904_Moscow_tornado. Yevseyev reminds us that twisters are not only confined to the American Midwest and South:
This natural disaster is most common for the south of the United States. However, twisters and tornadoes can appear anywhere in the world. The most important condition for them to appear is the presence of the so-called active convection zone in the atmosphere. Most frequently, twisters appear during warm seasons, in the afternoon from 3 to 6 o’clock amid thunder clouds of cold fronts and ahead of them. If a cold front arrives to a warm location, a twister is very likely to appear.
80 years later, in 1984, more twisters hit Russia, but killing fewer people – at least according to the Soviets. Yevseyev writes:
Twenty-seven years ago, on June 9, 1984, three fierce twisters struck several regions in the center of Russia. Such natural disasters have never occurred in Russia before. The unusual natural disaster, which ravaged Russia in 1984, killed 69 people. Fifty-seven of them died in Ivanovo. As many as 804 people were injured. However, one should not trust the Soviet statistics if it goes about catastrophes. The Soviet authorities preferred not to say anything about them at all.
Can’t only not trust the Soviets. The same brand of information politics is also practiced in much of the western media and at GISS. They also prefer not to say certain things.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe climate change train left the station long ago. Someone needs to tell Romney and Christie because they look awfully silly standing all alone there on the platform, waiting for the train to come. It left long ago with hardly anyone getting on it – just some Europeans and a few panhandlers.
The leftist German daily TAZ reports (bemoans) here that the Kyoto Protocol is dead, this according to former UN Climate General Secretary Yvo de Boer in an interview.
On getting a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, TAZ quotes de Boer (emphasis added):
The spirit of the Kyoto Protocol has disappeared. Its body is being artificially kept alive and perhaps some of the organs may get transplanted. But we have to admit that the Kyoto Protocol is dead.”
This, de Boer says, can be traced back to a lack of political will.

Politicians obviously have come to realize that implementing Kyoto-brand policy is far more risky than alleged climate change itself. The hoax has been exposed, the science discredited, and the tide of public opinion has shifted since Climategate rocked the climate science community in late 2009, causing the Copenhagen Conference and the global warming hypothesis as a whole to crumble to pieces. Resuscitating the climate patient failed – it’s dead on arrival.
Kyoto countries today represent only 20% of the world’s CO2 emissions
Indeed de Boer says the remaining Kyoto countries represent only 20% of the global CO2 emissions, down from 55% back in 1997. The air is out.
Yvo de Boer does not even believe a road map to a new Kyoto is possible.
We had a road map in Rio in 1992, in Kyoto, in Copenhagen, in Cancun. How many more road maps are necessary?”
De Boer favours incentives for saving energy rather than forcing countries to meet targets. But that would only mean more government meddling in markets. Best way out would be to accept the science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new book written by University of Konstanz Professor Gerd Ganteför is now being released by science publisher Wiley VCH: Klima – der Weltuntergang findet nicht statt (Climate – The End of the World Called Off).
Although Ganteför is a warmist, he dismisses the notion that a climate catastrophe is coming, and even adds that warming will bring advantages. This sort of optimism has sparked an angry response from the forces of German doom and gloom. The following clip is an interview of Professor Ganteför (in German).

At the start of the clip the interviewer asks Ganteför (right), with amazement: “The climate catastrophe is everywhere in the media, it really isn’t going to take place?” Ganteför responds:
Yeah, I’m really sorry about that, but the end of the world is not going to take place. Indeed we are going to have a warming, there’s going to be drought, there are going to be heavy rains, there’s going to be sea level rise, but these floods will be within the normal range of variation. Normal when you look at what happened over the last 2000 years. At the North Sea coast there have been large floods every 20 years, and it is not going to get any worse or better than what humans have experienced before.”
This kind of optimism and realism of course contrasts starkly with the dark images of catastrophe that get delivered by the crystal balls of AGW fortune tellers. For example, Ganteför’s realism has infuriated the catastrophe-obsessed cultists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PIK, who have since blasted Prof. Ganteför’s book, see Stefan Rahmstorf’s web blog of doom and pessimism Klimalounge.
Klimalounge wasted no time and spared few words in deriding Ganteför’s book, credentials and optimism, saying that he’s not a climate scientist and that any respectable publisher would have refused publishing such a work. Ganteför is just the latest enemy on the PIK’s ever growing blacklist.

Ganteför does not dispute that CO2 is causing warming, but adds:
This warming is neither worse nor better than the warming we’ve had in the past. There has always been climate change in the past. Two hundred years ago there was the Little Ice Age. This caused a lot of hardship for the people back then – with widespread hunger, bad harvests and so on. Back then we had a natural climate change that was negative. Now we are causing a positive climate change. If we didn’t do that, then it would probably get cooler, as we are scheduled for an ice age.”
I’m not sure about CO2 preventing an ice age, but I do get a kick out of the PIK when they claim we’re headed for the opposite kind of catastrophe. Both of these views are wild.
The book is also featured at: Readers Edition, which writes on how the book looks at three main topics:
Topic I: For environmental protection, the standard of living in undeveloped countries has to be improved. To achieve this, modern coal and nuclear power plants are necessary.
Topic II: The consequences of climate warming are not catastrophic, and even bring some benefits.
TpoicIII: The following should be supported to have climate protection: low-emission coal plants, modern nuclear power, wind energy, geo-thermal and nuclear fusion. Subsidies for bio-fuels, wood pellets and solar energy cause more bad than good.
Ganteför’s book is the latest in the starting and growing trend of seeing global warming as positive. Late last year, German news magazine FOCUS had a special called:
Global Warming Is Good For Us, 
which concludes warming has many positive benefits. Then a short time ago a German YouTube video parody featuring Jürgen Klimann appeared – asking where’s the climate change? And says warmth would be a welcome alternative to Germany’s otherwise gray, dreary and cool weather.
So maybe a little sanity and optimism is returning to Germany.

ARD public television is Germany’s flagship news channel which broadcasts its “Tagesschau” news at the prime-time slot of 8 p.m. You can compare it to the BBC News (unfortunately its reputation is following the same path).
It’s no secret that the German media has über-hyped the news in Japan in order to über-dramatize the nuclear power plant accident. So dramatic was the response to the incident in Japan that Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered the immediate shutdown of 7 of Germany’s older reactors in order to restore some semblance of calm among Germany’s freaked out population.
As an example of the media’s reckless reporting, Zettels Raum blog here brings our attention to 14 factual errors made in the ARD news last Thursday evening. Zettels Raum writes:
You will probably not want to believe what you are about to read, but it is the truth: In itsPrime-time newscast yesterday at 8 pm, the “Tageschau” reported 2:30 min on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. In these two and half minutes, there were 14 factual errors.”
The Zettels Raum author then lists all 14 errors and corrects them. As a whole, the entire ARD report was what Germans would call a media GAU (huge media meltdown). Of course all the errors, every one of them, served to exaggerate and over-dramatize the situation. I’ll now describe briefly each error.
Error 1: ARD claimed the military used water cannons and helicopters to cool the reactor, when in fact the water cannons were used by the police, and the military used helicopters of the fire department of a military base.
Error 2: ARD claimed that personnel risked their lives. Zettels Raum calls this claim “absurd”, saying that the guidelines for exposure to radiation by workers were fully adhered to.
Error 3:ARD claimed the radiation in the area had increased sharply, when in fact the radiation had dropped from 3. 8 mSv/h to 1.6 mSv/hr.
Error 4:ARD claimed that a video had been published in the Internet showing the destruction, when in fact the video was news footage from an NHK program.
Error 5: ARD claimed that the helicopter that made the video “flew over the reactor grounds,” when in fact  it was 30 km away.
Error 6: ARD claimed that the army way trying to prevent a reactor meltdown, when in fact the risk of such had not been in existence for days. The real concern were for the used fuel rods that were outside of the reactor.

Error 7 and 8: ARD claimed attempts by helicopters and water cannons to cool the reactors were interrupted and so precious time was being lost in the fight against a nuclear catastrophe, when in fact the water cannons were replaced by the more powerful fire-fighting vehicles of the military, and the claim that “precious time was being lost” was freely fabricated by ARD.
Error 9: ARD claimed that there was a hydrogen explosion at the building, in Block 3 an explosion in the building, when in fact the explosions did not occur once “at” and once “in” the building, but with both blocks in the reactor building.
Error 10:ARD claimed that the fuel rods had been exposed at times and that there was an explosion in Block 2 that may have damaged the reactor core and that after a fire the fuel rods were exposed and could not be cooled. But in fact, Zettels Raum blog writes:
A connection between the fire (likely burning lubrication oil) and exposed fuel elements is not known up to now. The elements are no longer suffciently covered by water because the pumps didn’t function, and the water in all cooling ponds – whether there was a fire or not – had evaporated.”
Error 11:And so, ARD claimed that the exposed fuel rods would eventually heat up to the point they would melt,  penetrate the concerte reactor encasing and eventually reach the earth and then radioactively contaminate the groundwater. Zettels Raum calls this claim: “one of the most absurd errors in this “Tagesschau” report, saying reactors 1-3  had long since ben cooled and that reactor 4 had not been in operation and thus no heating to lead to such a scenario.
Error 12: ARD claimed that experts were working feverishly to lay an emergency power supply line to the power plant in order to switch on the cooling system, when in fact it wasn’t an emergency power supply, but a line to the ordinary ordinary high voltage power grid.
Error 13: ARD claimed that line would be finished earliest on Friday, and that it was unknown whether or not the cooling unit would even switch on. At this point German viewers were probably biting their fingers off. But the fact was that it was already Friday in Japan – 4 a.m. – when the ARD report was being aired. So there was no way for the line to be finished on Thursday or earlier.
Error 14: How the ARD knew that it is”unknown” whether it would function is their “secret”. Of course pumps can be repaired and put back into operation. But you need power to do this.
Zettels Raum concludes as follows:
Is that only a mess, sloppiness or pure ignorance? Or is it political agitation? What is obvious, in any case, is that all the errors were made without exception in a way that exaggerated the actual damage and actual danger. If this were simply sloppiness, one would then expect some errors to be made in the other direction too.”
Also read here (German):  Super Meltdown In Media and Politics. Vera Langenfeld on the consequences of the hyper-hysteria spread by media and reckless politicians:
“In this regard, the super meltdown has occurred in Germany, and we are about to experience its impacts soon.”

"An “NHS forest” of a million trees would be planted at hospitals across the UK under a Labour government as part of the party’s plans for a green revolution. Under proposals due to be outlined at the party’s autumn conference, Labour will say it wants to plant the trees at hospitals to battle pollution and counteract the NHS’s carbon footprint.  The plan would also provide therapeutic spaces for patients and staff, which Labour believes would help recovery and promote wellbeing. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, will say the plans are part of a vision to make the NHS the greenest health service in the world, at a time when it is a significant contributor to carbon emissions in the UK. He will declare a climate emergency in the NHS and unveil new commitments to help the health service meet a net zero carbon emissions target, including the installation of 150,000 solar panels and replacing polluting ambulances with low-emission vehicles. Ashworth also wants clean air zones around NHS buildings and more energy efficient systems across the estate. “Actually, the NHS is one of the biggest polluters in the country, representing 6.3% of the carbon footprint in England. It’s more than the annual emissions from passenger aircraft departing from Heathrow. But I want to move to a net zero greenest health service in the world,” he said. “You’re not going to resolve air quality just by planting a million trees but it is an important gesture and also, particularly in mental health trusts, access to green space has a huge therapeutic value.” He will tell the party’s conference in Brighton next week: “Air pollution kills up to 40,000 people in England every year costing society more than £20bn. We have one of the highest rates of asthma deaths for young people in Europe. “As health secretary, I’ll declare a climate emergency across our NHS. It’s my commitment that a Labour government will deliver the greenest health service in the world. Our ambition is a net zero NHS.” He said hospitals would get green makeovers as ageing buildings were upgraded and repaired, prioritising solar panels and energy efficiency. “When the NHS procures it will do so ethically and sustainably. And we’ll guarantee a right to green space for patients and staff with an NHS forest planting 1 million trees across our NHS – a carbon-storing tree for every member of staff,” he will say. The policy will be unveiled as activists in Momentum, the grassroots group of Jeremy Corbyn supporters, announce plans at the party conference for Labour to adopt a Green New Deal agenda. Momentum has announced it is backing a target of zero carbon by 2030, which has been passed by about 90 constituency Labour parties and has backing from the Communication Workers Union. If passed, the target will be Labour’s most progressive green policy, with other political parties in the UK committing to net zero by 2050. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is preparing to speak at the youth climate strike in London on Friday. He is expected to thank participants for “educating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss”. “I know the situation can look bleak,” he will say. “We have a prime minister that has called global warming a ‘primitive fear without foundation’. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn’t care. “But when we see young people demanding urgent action, it’s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing – and it’s growing every day – I know we can tackle the climate emergency. “The next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick start a green industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it’s there to give life and joy to generations to come.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere is no energy shortage. What we have is a shortage of energy that we are ALLOWED to be used.
The list of energies we are allowed to use just keeps getting shorter. Techno-politico elitists are busily crossing out everything on the list, like coal, nuclear, all petroleum products, wood, and biofuels. The latest to join that list is the hope of the future: natural gas, this according to the The Hill blogsite here.
Recently there has been a flurry of reports of huge natural gas reserves in shale formations that are abundant enough to supply the world’s energy needs for decades, read here.
The Hill has posted a draft of a new study from scientists at Cornell University that concludes that natural gas mined by using hydraulic fracturing is even more dangerous than burning coal due to high fugitive methane emissions. The study will appear in the “Climatic Change Letters“.
Natural gas-fired power plants were once viewed as the ideal supplement to balance out the irregular supply of wind and solar energy. Coal and nuclear power plants are unable to react quickly enough to fluctuations in supply and demand. The Hill has posted the entire paper – here’s the abstract:
Abstract:
We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30% more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured — as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids — and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.”
No problem, let’s just set up more windmills, enviro-nutjobs and kooks may say. But these plants, aside from their technical problems, are now facing grassroots opposition as well.
This is where we stand today. We are literally standing on huge reserves of cheap natural energies, just waiting to be taken, yet some zealot, power-mad earth-nannies, armed with nothing more than climate change wive tales, are telling us we have to go without.

"Million-year-old ice buried deep in Antarctica could hold crucial information about the planet’s past and help climate predictions. And scientists with the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) are a step closer to unearthing it.   On Monday, they unveiled a drill designed to reach three kilometres below the surface of the frozen continent. “What we’re embarking on over the next few years is to solve one of the last great problems in climate science,” glaciologist Tas van Ommen said. The ice, believed to be up to 1.5m years old, is the target of several international research projects. “We’ll see in the ice, tiny bubbles that are trapped between snowflakes in the ice as it gets buried,” van Ommen said. “These tiny bubbles are time capsules of past atmosphere. “We want to get that ice, analyse those time capsules and understand what [carbon dioxide] did in that period around one million years ago when the climate was changing.” About 1 million years ago the Earth shifted from a 40,000-year ice age cycle to a 100,000-year cycle, van Ommen said. “[Carbon dioxide] is tied up in that change and it changes the rate at which ice ages have worked in the past,” he added. “We need to understand if the CO2 we put in the atmosphere will have long-term consequences for the Earth in the future.” The drill, made from stainless steel, aluminium bronze and titanium, is a mix of international and Australian technology and can withstand -55C. But reaching the buried ice won’t be a quick, or easy, feat. Drilling is expected to begin in 2021 and take four years in total.  A mobile 500-tonne base will take equipment to the work site, 1,200km inland from Antarctica’s coast.  “We are sending men and women into the most remote extreme environment on earth,” AAD director, Kim Ellis, said. “It’s a really challenging adventure.”"

Frigid cold in the forecast for Europe
If the following chart is anywhere accurate, Europeans better get the heavy winter gear out and heat up the the Gluhwein. If this pans out, the Dutch will surely be ice skating in the canals like they used to do  in the good ol days of global cooling.

Right now snow shovels, snow tires, sleds, road salt and even hip joints are in short supply. So many accidents and slips are occurring, which is resulting in a spike in broken bones, that patients are no longer able to quickly get the replacement joints they need. The hospitals in Germany are running out.
That’s what happens when you depart from reality and start believing the fantasies of junk science. So many have been preparing for warming when in fact the opposite is happening.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember the rare and exciting snowfall projection? That’s what the leading experts using their tuned models and super-computers told us. And whenever the rest of us had the audacity to doubt these longterm forecasts, we were scolded, got one across the knuckles, and branded as deniers.
The gods are surely laughing.
Germany’s central location in Europe acts as a rough barometer for measuring general weather harshness in Europe as a whole, and so we can say that Europe in general is not getting its promised warmth. Meteorologist Karsten Brandt at Germany’s donnerwetter.de has a report out (in German) titled: Snow Without End – 2010 Is On Track To Set A Record. Here’s what Dr Brandt says:
The year 2010 is about to go down in weather history. The number of snow days is at a record level, between 70 and 110 days so far. By the end of the year Bonn for example could see 80 snow days, in Berlin it will be well over 100, and it will be between 90 and 120 snow days in other cities. As a result, it will exceed the number snow days set in the record year of 1963. In many parts of Germany, so many days of snow have not been counted in the last 100 years.
Note that snow days here means the number of days that have snow on the ground.

Gee, I wonder if the German media are all scrambling to report this? Maybe Der Spiegel will resurrect its old 1974 Ice Age piece I wrote about yesterday. This time, they could blame it on global warming. But don’t get your hopes up – the odds of the media reporting on this are, I’d say, 1 in 10,000.
200% to 300% more frost and snow days.
In addition, Dr Brandt says here that governments ought to be preparing for harder winters and not for warmth.
In the next years we will have to anticipate many more hard winters. Compared to the 1990s and 2000s, the number of frost and snow days is 200% to 300% higher. The reason for this careful estimation is the weakness of the Gulf Stream and the longer-term changeover of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation.
…the trend is definite: colder rather than warmer.”
This of course is all a very difficult act for the government to handle. The people are supposed to believe in warming, yet be asked to prepare for bitter cold and snow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m sure there were winters over the last millenium that won’t be matched, of course. No one seriously expects the Thames to freeze over, like it did during the little ice age of the 17th century. But if the computer forecasts pan out, it could very well be one of the worst winters for northwestern Europe of the millenium – maybe in that elite class of the top 50.

Say Happy New Year! (Graphic: http://www.wetter24.de/de/home/wetter/profikarten)
Sweden in Britain are already well on their way to recording a “December of the century”. Joe Bastardi, like Piers Corbyn, pretty much hit it right on the nail – almost. Joe actually forecast the cold to be more centered in southern Europe, and not Northern Europe. But he wasn’t that far off.

Outlook for January 6, 2011
How did the Met Office do with their forecast? Forget them, except for the IPCC and others who like to be fooled all the time, they’re not relevant anymore.
The harsh winter only is likely going to get worse

The above graphic shows what the temperatures are going to be like when we’re toasting in the New Year. To the left it shows temperatures 5 days later. No let up! That’s freaking cold! You can view these graphics here at: meteogroup profikarten.
(The DWD says, however, that the forecasts at the moment have a lot of uncertainty, which probably means they are not sure how the storms are going to track.)
Is Piers Corbyn expecting this to continue? For how long? I’ve been hearing until the end of March from various sources. Say it aint true!
If this stuff goes on into March, then the Thames River has a chance of freezing over. If not, then many ports waterways and canals on the mainland will still be in serious trouble.  Things can change of course. There are going to be days where things will thaw a bit, hopefully, later on. Then governments really ought to use these occasions to ensure that supplies get rammed through to the max.
And when you have cold with the pattern shown above, you tend to get lots of snow.
For years we were told that the above charts would be coloured green or even yellow. All the so-called climatologists discounted the NAO and PDO and solar cycles, etc.  They didn’t want to hear it though. They went on preparing for warmth. Now it may end up costing millions of people dearly. Warming is indeed a whole nicer.

Can we provide enough energy to power the world using alternative sources, such as wind, solar, or bio-fuels?
This is a question that has largely been ignored, in hopes that the answer will prove to be in the positive. This article is the first in a series, taking the question one technology at a time.


Figure 1. Solucar PS10 solar concentrator power plant near Seville, Spain. Source: Wikipedia Commons

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg
Four problems with wind and solar power are: the area needed for the plants, energy storage when the wind or the sun is not available, transmission costs, and energy losses in storage and transmission. For solar power in the U. S., the power is available in the southwest of the country, and the power is needed in the northeast. In Europe, sunshine is abundant in Spain, but not so much in Germany. In general, environmentalists oppose additional transmission lines nearly everywhere. But let us assume that the transmission problem is solved. Is there enough area to collect sunlight to support all the energy needs? Let us take the area where this author lives as an example.
New Mexico – area 314,460 km2 – insolation 7 kWh/m2/day
Not all of the area is usable. Mountains, forest, wilderness, National Monuments, farm and urban areas, military training areas, bombing and missile ranges, are off limits. Perhaps 10% of the land area might be available for solar if all the ranchers are bought off and the environmentalists are bound and gagged. That likelihood seems very remote, considering that every patch of sagebrush seems to harbor an endangered lizard. (In California the animal holding up solar plants is the Desert Tortoise).

The power available on 10% of the area of New Mexico is:
31,446,000,000 m2 X 7 kWh/m2 X 365 = 80,344,530,000,000 kWh or 80.345 PetaWatthours (PWh)
This sounds like plenty of energy. The U. S. currently uses about 30 PWh per year. But there are problems. This figure is for a two-axis solar concentrator if it runs at 100% efficiency. The real efficiency of a solar thermal plant is in the range of 8 to 15%, about the same as photovoltaic panels. The Sierra SunTower plant in Lancaster California generates 5 MW peak, with no thermal storage, occupies 20 acres of land, about 81,000 m2, or about 62 W/m2. It is in a zone with 7 to 8 kWh of solar radiation available. That is an efficiency of about 8%. The Andasol 1 and 2 plants in Spain claim 15% annual average efficiency with 8 hours of thermal storage.
So, using the above efficiency figures, 10% of the area of New Mexico would supply 6 to 12 PWh of electricity or 20 to 40% of the energy needed for the US. We would need to build the same number of plants in at two or three more states, California, Nevada, and Arizona would be candidates.
Storing the heat for use at night is the next biggest problem. With current technology the most efficient thermal storage (molten salt) stores heat for about 8 hours. The salt used is a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate (fertilizer). It takes about 28,000 metric tonnes of salt to support the Andasol 1 plant for 8 hours of heat storage. Sodium and potassium nitrate are also known as saltpeter, the oxygen source in gunpowder. Now visualize a terrorist-driven airliner full of jet fuel (the carbon source) crashing into the storage tanks at one of these plants. It would be the equivalent of a small tactical nuclear bomb.
The total world production last year for nitrate fertilizers was 154 million tons, but most of that was ammonium nitrate. Chile, the chief supplier, only produced about a million tons of sodium and potassium nitrate. If all one million tons were used for energy storage, that would supply thirty-six 50 MW plants, or 0.018 PWh of electricity annually, 0.06% of that needed for the whole US, and less than 0.15% of that needed for all the above plants in New Mexico. One hundred years of Chilean production would build 6% of the needed solar plants for the U. S. alone.
There are other heat sinks that can be used, but they have problems of their own. The most efficient heat storage is the above described nitrate salts. The other proposals are more costly or have less volume specific heat capacity. One of the cheapest is concrete blocks with embedded pipes. But the structural stability of the pipes and concrete over many temperature cycles is a problem, and the mass needed is 250% of that needed using nitrate salt. For a plant the size of Andasol 1, 70,000 metric tonnes of concrete would be required. That volume takes up ground area, lowering the overall plant efficiency, and requiring more area for a given power output.
Let’s say we have beaten the above problems. We have paved 10% of four western US states with solar plants of 15% efficiency and are providing more than 30 PWh of electricity to the US, all the power we need. The problem then is that we are dumping nearly 200 PetaWh of heat into the environment, almost seven times what we are dumping now, and twice what the whole world is producing. What will happen to the temperature? The southwest US will be uninhabitable at something like 10 or 15°C hotter than at present. If the same thing is done in Europe, the rain in Spain will no longer fall anywhere. It will bring on the catastrophe that Hanson et al have been warning us will happen.
A solar power solution requires vast areas, with a high environmental cost that probably cannot be paid, and the waste heat load would make any projected CO2 warming look benign. Solar plants are not the long-term solution to our energy requirements.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe prophets of doom and gloom insist the end is coming and that we must fight to save the planet. Join the movement for salvation.
It’s supposed to be based on science and data, yet whenever data that contradicts the end-of-world claims appear, which is often, the prophets take on an us-versus-them approach, often portraying skeptics as infidels or even criminals.
So not surprisingly to many observers, a large part of the global warming movement is seen to have long since departed from the realms of science, evolved and moved into a cult-like realm. Has climate catastrophism become a cult?
When one goes down the list of signs that identify a cult in the list below, the similarities are striking.
Definition of a cult
According to Merriam Webster’s dictionary:
1:  formal religious veneration: worship
2:  a system of religious beliefs and ritual; also: its body of adherents
3:  a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also: its body of adherents
4a: system for the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator (health cult)
5a : great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or work (as a film or book); especially : such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad b: the object of such devotion c : a usually small group of people characterized by such devotion.
How do we know if a movement is a cult?
Some cults are benign, while others are dangerous and can lead to tragedy. If many of the following apply, then it’s a sure that we are dealing with a cult-like organization (from www.apologeticsindex.org and other sources):
1. The movement is over-zealous – and regards its belief system, ideology and practices as Truth.
2. The group is elitist, claiming a superior status and purpose (e.g., to be on a mission to save humanity).
3. The group often prophesies the end of the world.
4. The group promises salvation.
5. Dissent is not tolerated and is even punished.
6. The leadership dictates how members should think, act, and feel. Leaders prescribe how they live, whether to have children, etc
7. The group instructs its members not to read information that is critical of the group.
8. The group has a confrontational “us-versus-them” mentality that leads to conflict.
9. The leaders do not view themselves as accountable to authorities, even advocating civil disobedience for the higher cause.
10. The group teaches that the ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may lead members to participate in illegal activities.
11. Mind-altering practices, such as the repeated use of propaganda and denunciation sessions are used to suppress doubts. Character assassination is a sure sign of a cult.
12. The group requires members to radically alter the personal activities they had before joining the group.
13. The group is active in bringing in new members.
14. The group is out to make money.

Dangerous cults are totalitarian and do not tolerate any criticism. Dangerous cults not only dictate what members believe, but also how members live. How often have we heard the climate catastrophism cult tell us what we should eat and drink, how to be mobile, what lights to use and how many children we should have? Cults are the antithesis of individual freedom.
Double standards
According to Apologetics Index, a destructive cult often has double standards. Members are expected to be obedient, while the cult leaders have their own special rules. A destructive cult has only two basic purposes: recruiting new members and making money. Destructive cults claim to be for the social good, but in reality the cult’s real goal is to increase prestige and often the wealth of the leader. In the Climate Catastrophism Cult, we see how leaders are getting wealthier and wealthier, while followers are asked to give up more and more.
A destructive cult claims that it is innovative, progressive and that it offers a new and better way that will cure the world’s ills. But, according to Apologetics Index, “These claims are empty and are only used to recruit members who are then surreptitiously subjected to mind control to inhibit their ability to examine the actual validity of the claims of the leader and the cult.”
Who is susceptible?
A cult needs followers. The more followers it has, the more powerful it becomes. One of the main traits that people who are susceptible to joining a cult have is a sense and desire for idealism. Those prone to joining a cult often display:
1. A desire to belong.
2. A desire for spiritual meaning.
3. The inability to say no or to express criticism.
4. Impaired capacity to question what one is told.
5. A need for quick and absolute answers.
6. Cultural disillusionment (alienation, dissatisfaction with the status quo.
7. Low self-esteem and a general lack of self-confidence.
8. to be naive.
Many followers tend to be young, disenchanted, frustrated, lonely and lacking a perspective for the future. Anyone that is going through a stressful period of transition in life is more susceptible to join a cult. It’s no wonder that older, retired people tend to be more skeptical of climate catastrophe. So, is global warming catastrophism a cult? It’s hard to find a movement that better fits the definition.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days back I wrote about a German meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt here, who claims climate prognoses are “not worth the paper they are printed on“.
Dr. Karsten Brandt says CO2 is completely overblown in climate models. Photo source: donnerwetter.de
At his website here, Germany’s new climate enfant terrible posted a report titled: The Future Of Our Climate In Europe (in German) where he fires blistering criticism at regional climate forecasts made by computer-models.
Worthless models – ocean currents are 100 to 1000 times more powerful than CO2
First Brandt takes a look at CO2 versus other climate factors. Brandt says that surely CO2 will have some impact over the long-term – over centuries, but over the shorter term (100 years) and on continental scales, CO2 plays nary a role compared to other factors like ocean currents:
At the continental level, ocean currents are especially capable of completely knocking our climate out of whack. In Europe, that would be of course the Gulf Stream. This has an influence factor on our climate that is 100-1000 in comparison to the long-term CO2 impact.
So how can we trust computer climate model forecasts made for the next 100 years? Can you leave out such factors like the sun, ocean cycles and volcanoes – which are all poorly understood – and still get a useful outlook? To answer this question Brandt uses a financial analogy (which Brandt knows something about, as he runs his own private meteorological services company):
Imagine you are preparing the financial plan for your company, but you completely forget the all-important factors of taxes and mandatory expenses for employee benefits. You’re sure to go bankrupt. That’s basically the appraoch used in the climate models and their prognoses. These models exclude numerous difficult details. Still, climatologists go out and hock their climate forecast maps of central Germany and Bavaria for the year 2060.
Gulf Stream factor 100+ times bigger factor than CO2. NASA photo
By now, any normal reader begins to understand just how dubious and worthless such forecasts truly are. Just months ago we recall how these climate forecasters predicted warm, mild winters for Europe, along with the end of the ski industry in the Alps. Now today, having their heads pulled out of the sand by meteorologists, the same climatologists are forecasting bitter cold winters in Europe. Gone suddenly is all the dreaded warming. If this to you all sounds like a swindle, you’re not alone.
Brandt tells us more about how climatologists behave:
 Just a small change in the Gulf Stream results in Europe shivering, thus rendering obsolete all the plans made for a mild future. What’s even worse, many climate scientists know this, but still claim to make precise prognoses. The business with the future is really great, especially when the speculation involves no risk, or if others have to bear the costs of the forecasts.”

Brandt is sure that the climatologists of 2040 will need a good supply of excuses for the climatologists of today, and suggests some for the newspapers of 2040:
‘Well, that was the state of the science back then.’
or:
The models were correct, they just under-estimated this one factor.’
Brandt adds:
Perhaps you can send your suggestions for excuses to PIK in Potsdam.”
He then presents tables of the strengths of impacts of various climate drivers for Europe. We see that Europe’s climate is significantly coupled to the Gulf Stream. If the Gulf Stream were to weaken, then forget about mild winters. Winters in England could become like winters in Newfoundland. Brandt summarizes:
If you still haven’t heard from the climate debate which climate factors must be taken into account when making regional forecasts, it certainly isn’t CO2.”
Brandt does say that CO2 will have an impact over larger timescales, i.e. 1000 years.  But who knows where the climate will be in 1000 years. The earth could be back into an ice age. The earth could also be obliterated by an asteroid. You choose the scenario! Brandt writes:
Over the very short term (2-50 years) and short-term (50-100 years) climate prognoses for continents, especially Europe, depend on a number of unpredictable factors. For the next 1000 years, the Gulf Stream is the decisive factor. Even changes in air currents have similar impacts as CO2 does. Over time, the earth’s orbital parameters, random volcanic eruptions, and, in a 1000 years, again the earth’s orbit will have huge impacts. That alone is already an explosive mixture for every climate computer model, in which the most important factor is still not even accounted for: the Gulf Stream.
If that doesn’t convince you that the models and claims made by climate institutes like PIK in Potsdam are useless crap at best, then you truly belong among the fundamentalists in the AGW religion.

"Human-induced climate change is a moral wrong. It involves one group of humans harming others. People of this generation harming those in future generations. People in the developed world harming those in the developing world. Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate-driven superstorms, floods, droughts and conflicts. And there’s the greatest moral wrong of all – the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth. Yet until recently, climate change has not been argued as a moral issue. Rather, it has been presented as a technocratic problem, a cost-benefit problem, where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster. The debates have been around taxes, jobs, growth and technologies. While such debates are important – there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis – the effect has been decades of inaction, denial and delay. When something is a moral wrong, particularly a deep, systemic moral wrong, we don’t wait around debating the optimal path or policy; we stop it.  Looking back in history, the climate movement can draw inspiration from another effort to right a deep moral wrong: the slavery abolition movement. There are clearly important differences between slavery and climate change, and I’m not drawing a moral equivalence between the two; slavery was a unique moral horror and climate change is immoral in its own terrible way. But the climate community can find inspiration in the 19th-century abolitionist movement’s courageous efforts to make slavery illegal around the world. Those who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was morally righteous and powerfully clear: abolish slavery, make it illegal. It is time to do this for climate change: to make human carbon pollution illegal in every country in the world. It is time for a “carbon abolition” movement, to put an end to emissions. This is exactly what the science tells us we must do. In order to contain warming to 1.5-2C we need to bring global human carbon emissions to net-zero between 2030 and 2050. Not just reduce it. Stop it. This principle is enshrined in the Paris agreement, although few signatories have grappled with its implications. A set of firm deadlines, enshrined in international law, would force countries to immediately begin enacting the policies required to meet them, and force companies to start changing their business models. Some will protest that these laws would kill jobs and growth. But such clear deadlines would finally give businesses and investors certainty that the fossil-fuel economy is coming to an end, and catalyse a historic boom in innovation – bringing to life a new clean-energy economy. Getting every country in the world to enact carbon abolition laws seems a distant dream today. But things must have looked similarly bleak to slavery abolitionists in the early 19th century. But then, after years of campaigning and civil action, Britain made slavery illegal in 1833, France in 1848, the US in 1865, followed by numerous other countries and international bans in 1890 and 1926. What set the cascade of change going was the development of abolition as a mass social movement. History tells us that mass social movements such as women’s suffrage, civil rights and gay rights have always used moral arguments to change politics. I can think of no mass movement that was sparked by a cost-benefit analysis. The climate movement is finally finding its moral voice. The school strikes, the global climate strike, Extinction Rebellion and growing support for a Green New Deal suggest that, at last, a mass social movement is rising that could tip our politics into action. But to catch fire this campaign needs a clear, simple demand, a rallying cry that everyone can share. “Stop climate change” is too vague and abstract, while the cacophony of narrower demands – “Stop fracking”, “Build more solar”, “Eat less meat” – is too confusing. These are all crucial issues, but many people are unsure of what to make of it all. Instead, by clearly showing the immorality of carbon pollution, we can activate people’s moral emotions and then focus those emotions on a specific action: making it illegal. We have a starting point: Britain recently joined the Nordic countries, France, New Zealand, the US state of California and 19 cities around the world in adopting net-zero targets, and the EU is considering a 2050 target. The next step is to shift these soft targets into hard carbon abolition laws. The 19th-century abolitionists were brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral enslavement of fellow human beings be stopped. Today, are we brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral destruction of life on Earth be stopped? • Eric Beinhocker is professor of public policy practice at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, and executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School.

"In your 10 charts explaining the climate crisis (21 September), aviation is targeted as a “difficult problem” to solve. Given that the global climate strike was organised by, among others, the student climate network, students need to ask their academic staff how much they are cutting down on flying to conferences. The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research states that academics are among the highest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. And while universities are increasingly committed to a green agenda for their own organisations in terms of carbon reduction, recycling and sustainable living, there is little evidence that academics are cutting down on their frequent flying habit. Some may argue that face-to-face meetings at conferences around the world are necessary for the exchange of ideas and production of knowledge. However, research at the University of British Columbia suggests that there is no clear relationship between those who fly more and the quality of research. The University of Lund in Sweden is exceptional in requiring staff to set out concrete personal reduction targets. Isn’t it time that all UK universities followed suit and that students held their lecturers to account by asking them what steps they are taking to fly less?Celia RobertsProfessor emerita, King’s College London  • It is good to see your week of articles regarding global warming concluding with graphs to support the case. Sadly, you overlooked the most important issue in the whole saga, namely the rise in human numbers since the beginning of the industrial revolution. About 200 years ago there were about 1 billion of us; today it is about 8 billion and rising. For the sake of human comfort we have used technology to systematically destroy the natural order of things – and the more of us there are, the worse it will become. To make up for this omission I suggest a future article on the issue. If you wish for ready data I’m sure the pressure group Population Matters will be only too pleased to help.John GamlinEast Bergholt, Suffolk • The statement that “climate action must never be reduced to individual choices” (Editorial, 21 September) needs to be qualified. Some responsibility should be placed on individuals, but as members of extended families expressing their mutual love and care for each other through making “family declarations” about the climate and loss of biodiversity. Pledging to become better informed and act accordingly, to be honest and transparent, and work collectively to reduce the carbon emissions for which they are responsible to zero by 2030 (with the larger reductions in the early years), and to lobby and rebel to achieve system change regarding the remainder. All global citizens are acquainted by applying only about six degrees of separation. Applying that number of links that normally are deeper and more loving, the sum of family declarations could amount to powerful and decisive influence on governments and businesses across the world, resulting in systemic change.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire • Although it is clear that we have to fly less or stop flying, what happens to poor countries which are very dependent on tourism? We were in Sri Lanka earlier this year when the bombs went off. Our small group stayed on, but we watched the hotels emptying out, the restaurants without diners and the increasing desperation of people who are dependent on visitors from distant countries. Will the rich west have to help such countries change their economic models to stop them being tourist destinations?Alicia BakerLondon • During the climate strike, mention was made of this being “bigger than Brexit” and it occurred to me that wasn’t David Cameron also the one who got rid of “all that green crap”: removing subsidies for renewables and thus giving the message to go ahead and keep exploiting finite resources?

Share this...FacebookTwitterHat-tip M White.Spaceweather.com has an excellent report today called: ALL-CLEAR IN THE STRATOSPHERE about volcanic aerosols and their impact on the earth’s climate and cooling. Turns out that they have a far greater impact than expected.
Today the earth’s stratosphere is as clean as it’s been in more than 50 years. What does that mean? It means more solar radiation can reach the earth, and is thus contributing to warming. The stratosphere is too clean – because of the lack of volcanic activity over the last 18 years. According to climate scientist Richard Keen of the University of Colorado:
Since 1996, lunar eclipses have been bright, which means the stratosphere is relatively clear of volcanic aerosols. This is the longest period with a clear stratosphere since before 1960.”
Keen examines lunar eclipses and the brightness of the umbra to assess the stratosphere. Here’s how it works:
When the stratosphere is clear, the umbra (and therefore, the eclipsed Moon) is relatively bright. On the other hand, if the atmospheric lens that illuminates the Moon becomes dirty enough, light will be blocked and the eclipse will appear dark.”
A very clean stratosphere leads to warming 
Looking at eclipses of the moon allows you to assess the cleanliness of the stratosphere, or its dirtiness, which plays a major role in global temperatures. If the stratosphere is dirty, like after a massive volcanic eruption, then sunlight gets blocked out, and cooling ensues.
But if the stratosphere is too clean, as is often the case after a long period without a major eruption, then the stratosphere becomes clear and thus more sunlight reaches the earth. This results in warming. Well, Keen says there hasn’t been a major eruption since 1992 and so the stratosphere is very clear today, the cleanest it’s been since 1960. That means more radiation – and more warming.
The comparison of images of the 1992 eclipse to 2003 shows that the stratosphere was very dirty in 1992 after the eruption of Pinatubo. In 2003 it was quite clear.

Dr Keen has an excellent presentation up: Volcanoes and Climate Change since 1980. According to the presentation, the earth has warmed about 0.25°C since 1980. The question is why? Keen suggests it’s in large part due to the lack of volcanic eruptions. To find out more, he conducted the lunar aerosol climate experiment (LUNACE).
A lunar eclipse occurs about once a year. By looking at the umbra, scientists can check volcanic impact on the stratosphere every year. Keen provides a historical background on this in Part 3, how it works (Part 4), and calculations (Part 5) in his presentation.
Interesting is that a major eruption that dirties the stratosphere has occurred about every 10 years during the 20th century. The last one was Pinatubo about 18 years ago. So we are a bit overdue now. The stratosphere is much too clean. Too much light is reaching the earth, and so it’s getting warmer.
Keen writes in his presentation:
Since 1997, when Pinatubo’s aerosol settled out, the stratosphere has been exceptionally clear.
In Part 6, Climate) Dr Keen sums it up.
Half or more of the warming since 1995 may due to the lack of large volcanic eruptions.
That’s about 0.13°C. Keen writes:
The remaining climate change is presumably caused by other forces, such as solar variability, El Nino, Atlantic AMO warming in 1995, lower Albedo and maybe even a little greenhouse gas.
So many factors out there that get ignored. Looks like it’s back to the drawing board for the climate modellers. A little advice: You’ll never get the models right unless you weight the factors correctly. Start by cutting CO2 by 90% or so. And don’t forget the clouds this time!

According to The Star Phoenix:

A group of ferocious Australian crocodiles were so traumatised by a maximum-strength cyclone last week that they hid under water and stopped eating, wildlife park officials said Friday.

Because the Star Phoenix doesn’t say it, I’ll do it for them: Man and his carbon emissions are responsible for the trauma the poor crocodiles had to endure!
No reports on whether crocodile counselors have been dispatched to the area to assist the crocodiles in dealing with the emotional scars of their days-long ordeal. And if counselors were sent, there are no reports of any coming back.
How long have crocodiles been on the planet?

"Just 1% of English residents are responsible for nearly a fifth of all flights abroad, according to previously unpublished statistics. The figures, published in a Department for Transport survey, also reveal that the 10% most frequent flyers in England took more than half of all international flights in 2018. However, 48% of the population did not take a single flight abroad in the last year. The new findings bolster calls for a frequent flyer levy, a proposal under which each citizen would be allowed one tax-free flight per year but would pay progressively higher taxes on each additional flight taken. The revelations follow a new report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s official adviser, which urged ministers to put tougher regulations on the international aviation and shipping sectors to keep the economy on track for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Environmental activists said the new figures showed the UK could cut air traffic and emissions without affecting ordinary holidaymakers. “There is this narrative that tackling the climate change problem from aviation means stopping people from taking holidays or seeing their families – and actually, when you look at this data that is wrong,” said Leo Murray, director of innovation at 10:10 Climate Action. “What we need to do is target a minority of problem flyers and stop them from taking so many flights,” he added. The findings are based on responses from more than 15,000 English residents who participated in the 2018 National Transport Survey and were revealed to the Guardian following a Freedom of Information request. The aviation sector accounted for about 7% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. It is projected to be the single biggest source of emissions in the UK by 2050 due to the steadily increasing demand for flights. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, also endorsed the idea of a frequent flyer levy. “It makes it easier for families to fly once a year, but the escalating tax on further flights means that the people responsible for most of the problem are the ones who end up paying most of the tax – or, ideally, flying a lot less,” he said. Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green party, said the new data showed the UK could cut its air traffic without hitting those who can least afford it. “It’s about people who fly again and again and again.” “A progressive tax on the most frequent flyers is a fair policy that most people would come behind if the government put it forward,” she added. Tuesday’s CCC report suggested a number of policy options to curb demand for flights, including a frequent flyer levy, and said technological improvements alone could not be the solution to the growing emissions problem. There is currently no country in which travellers pay an escalating levy on each flight they take in a year. “In the absence of a true zero-carbon plane, demand cannot continue to grow unfettered over the long-term,” it stated. Emissions from international aviation are not currently included in national carbon budgets such as the UK’s but instead managed by a dedicated UN agency – the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, some have said the body is too secretive and close to industry to take on the major polluters. The CCC said international air travel should be included in the UK’s climate strategy like any other business sector. “Not having [international aviation] in the target is a barrier to putting in place good policies to get us on the trajectory to be net-zero overall,” said Chris Stark, the CCC’s chief executive. He argued that the UK should take a leading role in cutting emissions from the sector, rather than wait for more comprehensive international agreements to be struck. “There should be no barrier to bringing aviation emissions into the carbon budgets and then putting in place a set of policies that at some stage in the future will be compatible with those international agreements,” Stark said. A DfT spokesperson said: “Tackling climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges that we face. Which is why this government has set a bold 2050 net zero target for the UK and a greener aviation industry will play a key role in that. “The government is funding the future of flight and have announced £5m in funding for new technologies like electric and autonomous aircraft to help us tackle climate change. We are working with our partners to ensure the government takes a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.”"

"A coalition of Pacific island nations wants to raise $500m (£400m) to make all shipping in the Pacific Ocean zero carbon by the middle of the century. The Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership, announced on Tuesday by the governments of Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, has set an emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030, and full decarbonisation by 2050.  The partnership intends to raise money through grants from multinational institutions, concessional loans, direct private sector investment and through issuing regional “blue bonds”. The money would be used to retrofit existing passenger and cargo ferries with low-carbon technologies, and to buy new zero-emissions vessels. Pacific island populations are dependent on shipping for travel, medicines, their livelihoods and connection to the outside world. Such countries are precariously dependent on imported fossil fuels and acutely vulnerable to price shocks or supply disruptions. The region imports 95% of its fuels. Imported petroleum accounts for an average of 40% of GDP in Pacific island countries, with the transport sector the largest fuel user. In archipelago states of small island populations spread over vast ocean distances, sea travel is vital for linking communities and for economic development. The lack of regular connectivity between islands is a major constraint on domestic, social and economic development and on international trade. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  The climate crisis is making travel significantly more difficult and disrupted. Rising sea levels and the increased frequency of dangerous weather are making sea journeys more difficult and slower, leading to more frequent cancellations of journeys and damaging ageing transport infrastructure such as ports and refuelling facilities. A joint Fiji-Marshall Islands government briefing paper said that compared with other major economic sectors, “investment in the sustainable development of sea transport for Pacific island countries has been extremely limited to date”. “A transition to sustainable, resilient and decarbonised sea transport at this scale will require substantial investment, including at least $500m to support implementation of the 10-year work programme.” The Marshall Islands environment minister, David Paul, told a forum at the UN climate action summit in New York that securing funding would spark a “rapid transformation of our … shipping sector”. The Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions, but in many instances is feeling the impacts of climate change first and most acutely. Sea levels have risen at nearly four times the global average rate in some parts of the western Pacific, and the increased frequency of natural disasters has weakened island nations’ ability to recover from repeated, worsening catasrophes. Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said in May that the globe’s major emitters and largest economies were not contributing enough to help the Pacific adapt to climate change. “We need major economies to strengthen their climate finance investments, including their replenishment of adaptation and green climate funds. It is the defining crisis of our time. And if we do not take action, that crisis will soon escalate into chaos that will consume the entire world.” He said Pacific dependence on shipping “demands a transformation of our maritime sectors which will require new kinds of financial partnerships with bilateral and multilateral assistance and, potentially, a regional blue shipping bond”. A blue bond is a debt instrument issued by governments, development banks or others to raise capital to finance marine- and ocean-based projects that have positive environmental, economic and climate benefits. The Seychelles last year launched the world’s first sovereign blue bond, a $15m 10-year bond to protect marine environments and safeguard fisheries. Dr Peter Nuttall, a scientific and technical adviser for the Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport at the University of the South Pacific, told the Guardian that shipping was the “absolute lifeline” of any Pacific community. “Without shipping, our economies die, our people can’t survive. In places like the Solomon Islands or the Marshall Islands, 80% to 90% of all goods arrive by ship. We have the most expensive shipping in the world, the longest transport routes, and the worst ships.” He said the Pacific was acutely vulnerable to oil shocks, citing examples from remote Pacific islands where critical services, such as visits by health professionals, had to be abandoned because fuel prices were too high. Nuttall said the Pacific “cannot wait for the rest of the world. We have to bespoke design a Pacific solution if it is going to work, not leave the Pacific to languish. “We’re running the biggest risk. The Pacific did nothing to cause climate change, but we’re about to get smashed by it. What is it we can practically do to make people’s lives better now? We know the answers, and we don’t have time to wait.”"

"This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. With today’s emissions levels, our remaining CO2 budget will be gone in less than 8.5 years You say you “hear” us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I don’t want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C degrees, and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50% is acceptable to you. But those numbers don’t include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my children’s generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us – we who have to live with the consequences.  To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise – the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business-as-usual and some technical solutions. With today’s emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not. • Greta Thunberg is a climate activist • This is the speech Greta Thunberg delivered to the UN Climate Action summit in New York on Monday"
"The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is now at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. There is no sign of these emissions starting to fall rapidly, as is needed. The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. Greenland has lost almost 4 trillion tonnes of ice since 2002. Mountain ranges from the Himalayas to the Andes to the Alps are also losing ice rapidly as glaciers shrink. A third of the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ice is already doomed. Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai. As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. Huge cost drops have seen renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and solve difficult problems such as aviation and farming. The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream. Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating hydrogen, will also be needed. This article was amended on 20 September 2019 to correct an error in the figure given for the rate of Greenland’s ice loss. The correct amount is 4 trillion tonnes of ice lost since 2002."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online NZZ from Zurich has a report on a recent multiple-proxy temperature reconstruction produced by a Swedish team of scientists. It wasn’t that long ago when European media outlets were saying Mann’s old hockey stick was settled science – that is until a series of scientific and statistical analyses by leading experts debunked it and the pressure to drop it became too much to bear.
Now Europe’s media are quietly abandoning it and returning to what years and years of reliable literature originally had stated: The temperature trend over the last several thousand years was by no means flat and that there were periods that were just as warm, if not warmer than today.
Here’s the 2000-year reconstruction of the Swedish team I found at the NIPCC site:
Swedish proxy temperature reconstruction: Source; http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2010/dec/15dec2010a4.html
The meticulous new reconstruction was produced by scientists of the University of Stockholm, led by Fredrik Ljungqvist, and the results were published last year in Geografiska Annaler. It’s a temperature reconstruction of the extra-tropical northern hemisphere (30°-90°N)  over the last 2000 years.
Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht Germany says it’s one of the best reconstructions he’s seen, and reminds us that proxy reconstructions aren’t easy. NZZ quotes Zorita:
Errors can be avoided only when paleoclimatologists and statistics experts work closely together. The right method for reconstructing temperature history hasn’t really been found up to now.”
Even when done meticulously, uncertainties can’t be eliminated. According to the NIPCC, this reconstruction was based:
…on 30 temperature-sensitive proxy records with annual to multi-decadal resolution, including two historical documentary records, three marine sediment records, five lake sediment records, three speleothem δ18O records, two ice-core δ18O records, four varved thickness sediment records, five tree-ring width records, five tree-ring maximum latewood density records, and one δ13C tree-ring record, but not employing tree-ring width records from arid and semi-arid regions…”
Indeed, Ljungqvist found temperature fluctuations that are markedly more pronounced than shown earlier in many reconstructions. NZZ writes:
According to his reconstruction, the Littel Ice Age, which took place between 1400 and 1850, was up to 0.8° Celsius colder than the climate average of the period 1961–1990. 
Perhaps the temperature dips of the past are even greater – Ljungqvist suspects that the cold of the Little Ice Age is underestimated.”
There’s still a lot of discussion on whether the current modern period is warmer than the MWP and the Roman Period. The study indicates that it was warmer in the past. The reconstruction also shows that the current warming started already way back in the early part of the 18th century, i.e. long before man started emitting CO2 in earnest. So what could be the cause of the temperature fluctuations? The NZZ writes:
Considered as causes are external factors such as volcano eruptions and solar changes, but also internal climate processes.”

The NIPCC also provides additional quotes from Ljungqvist, who notes:

…decadal mean temperatures in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere seem to have equaled or exceeded the AD 1961-1990 mean temperature level during much of the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period”
and
…the second century, during the Roman Warm Period, is the warmest century during the last two millennia,”
adding:
…the highest average temperatures in the reconstruction are encountered in the mid to late tenth century,”
Clearly the evidence shows that nothing unusual is happening. The Swedish reconstruction also uses “Mike’s nature trick“, tacking on the instrumental record for the last 20 years, but does not cover this up. And what about the claim that CO2 is causing the temperature to rise? Here’s how the NIPCC sums it up:
That claim — for which there is no supporting evidence, other than misplaced blind faith in climate models — is totally bogus.”
Do you now hear the hisses and gnashing of teeth from the AGW cultists?
Interestingly, the traditionally green NZZ first starts its story by glossing over some background and history on tree-ring temperature reconstructions, mentioning “pioneer” Michael Mann’s work and his iconic hockey stick graph, and provides some details about its embattled story, writing: 
…skeptical activists even accused Mann and other paleoclimatologists of fraudulently fabricating the curve.”
The NZZ refuses to believe this of course, but Mann most certainly did. But we understand the greenie media – sometimes it’s hard to say goodbye to an old friend that had served them so well. Good riddance to one of the most corrupt chapters in the history of modern science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel cover of August 11, 1986
The concept of “climate catastrophe” in Germany was born 25 years ago  writes German meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne here at his blogsite and, as of today, except for the media bluster, there are still no signs of it. Thüne writes:
Do you remember January 22, 1986? On this day a press conference took place in Bonn at the Hotel am Tulpenfeld. The German Physikalische Gesellschaft e. V. (German Physical Society) invited journalists and presented them with the “Warning of a Pending Climate Catastrophe”. Written on the invitation: ‘The Energy Work Group of the German Physical Society urgently warns in the accompanying document of an imminent threatening climate catastrophe’.
Later that year in August, Der Spiegel came out with its infamous Climate Catastrophe issue whose front cover showed Germany’s beloved Cologne Cathedral landmark half-submerged in sea water. The warning on the cover read: “Ozone Hole – Ice Cap Melt – Greenhouse Effect: Scientists warn of  THE CLIMATE CATASTROPHE”.
In its story Der Spiegel wrote:
A consequence of not immediately reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be sea levels rising dramatically and the Cologne Cathedral will find itself in the middle of North Sea water. The Greens reacted spontaneously and produced a paper on September 28, 1986 called:  “Overhaul of the Industrial Society“.
The sudden doomsday predictions even prompted the government in 1987 to launch the so-called Enquete Commission with the task “Precautions for Protecting the Earth’s Atmosphere.” And so the panic in Germany had begun. The following year in the United States, James Hansen gave his infamous, sweaty testimony before Congress.
Today, 25 years after Tulpenfeld, and after 15 UN climate conferences with nothing to show, the climate catastrophe still remains elusive. In fact sea level rise has decelerated over the last 5 years, and the 0.5°C is far less than what was projected 25 years ago, and is likely due to natural causes (PDO). Indeed the accumulated cyclone energy reached a record low last year.

Thüne explains in depth the origins and definitions of the term “climate”, calling concepts like climate catastrophe and climate protection absurd, and reminds us that “climate” is an abstract term, whose currently accepted definition hardly goes beyond a simplistic bureaucratic meaning, and is naively defined as the average of 30 years of weather.
Thüne slams attempts to limit global temperature rise to 2°C, or to steer weather so that it complies with the specifications of a “climate” that is derived by averaging an arbitrary 30-year period of weather. He calls such efforts “utopian pipe dreams”.
In view of our paleo-climatic knowledge that there have been numerous temperature fluctuations during the earth’s history, and picking a random 30-year period as the standard for the quality of the climate is an expression of unprecedented ignorance of nature.”
Even more absurd, says Thüne, is Chancellor Angela Merkel’s concept of implementing: “global climate justice“. Thüne adds:

No matter what is tried, man will never be able to stop the always ongoing process of weather-climate change.”
and:
The German Physical Society, with its climate warning, has outed itself as an anti-scientific lobbyist for special interest groups.”
The sun, not CO2, drives the climate
Thüne clearly thinks the focus on CO2 is grossly misplaced, saying solar and orbital factors play the biggest role by far. Thüne writes (emphasis added):
Suppressing this knowledge and making threats with a climate catastrophe is unforgivable, and is to be tagged as scientifically criminal. The German Physical Society has to know that the climate that it uses as a threat and for spreading fear, does not exist. That climate is an abstract term, a feature or, as Al Gore correctly says, a phantom.
Thüne explains how many people do not even understand the solar constant, which is not constant at all. Radiation is not constant at 1368 watts/m².
In reality, because of the earth’s varying distance from the sun during its orbit, the ‘solar constant’ is between 1320 and 1416 W/m2. That means that at the start of January the earth receives 96 W/m2 more in solar radiation then it does at the beginning of July.”
Thüne reminds that the solar climate on the sun indeed impacts the climate on the earth.
It always comes down to the angle of the sun rays striking the solar energy-absorbing earth’s surface. Every physicist or natural scientist has to know that.
Unfortunately, many are paid handsomely to ignore that, and to focus on CO2.

Today is World Liberty Day
Updated: 17 June, 5 p.m. CET
The above website I’ve linked to was set up in Germany as a project by liberty-enthusiastic individuals, led by Christoph Widenhorn of the German FREIHEITSWERK. Many people are not aware of this, and so I hope this spreads around a bit more. It is also supported by the Berlin-Manhattan Institute.

 These individuals are working to establish a Day of Liberty in Germany, and the world. The website is a 100% pro-bono project with no budget – all those involved are strictly volunteers. Sign up as a supporter!
I’m pleased and honoured to have helped out a bit in setting up the above-linked website. Take a few minutes to look at the different pages of the website.
Let your friends, family and other websites know about it. Here are just a few famous quotes on liberty and freedom:

The secret of happiness is freedom.
The secret of freedom is courage.  
– Pericles
For to be free is not merely
to cast off one’s chains,
but to live in a way that respects and
enhances the freedom of others.
– Nelson Mandela
Freedom is never more than one
generation away from extinction.
We didn’t pass it to our children
in the bloodstream.
It must be fought for, protected,
and handed on for them to do the same.
– Ronald Reagan
Liberty,
when it begins to take root,
is a plant of rapid growth.
– George Washington
As AGW-science skeptics know very well, freedom all over the world is always under attack. There are always people out there who think they ought to decide everything for us and run our lives. We see this, for example, in climate science as governments attempt to misuse it for the purpose of implementing intrusive bureaucracy, state-control and more taxation.

"Friday night and the lights were indeed low. You may have been in the mood for a dance but we were in the mood for a show, as the Upside put on its gladrags and morphed into a live event, complete with panellists, a quiz and the odd joke or two. I’ll set the scene: there was the biggest TV screen in Europe (though of course, soon it will merely be the biggest TV in Britain). There were 100 in the audience, wine in the green room and expertise primed to address the theme of the night: Why the world’s not as bad as you might think.  Yomi Adegoke explained how to look on the bright side if, like her, you share the triple economic disadvantage of being a millennial, female and black. Helen Russell, who lives in one of the world’s most agreeable countries, instructed us all in how to find happiness. Alice Snedden made us all laugh. And climatologist Mark Maslin detected the green shoots of hope in the new environmental movements determined to confront the climate emergency. That was certainly the dominant theme of our journalism this week, which included: 1. A global effort by 250 news organisations, including the Guardian, to boost climate coverage. 2. A fishy alternative to plastic. 90-second read 3. A plan to bring a billion people in from the dark. Two-minute read 4. A new drive to suck back carbon and “restore” the climate: 10-year strategy 5. And of course, millions of people on the streets. 24-hour action The New York Times takes a forensic look at the mortality of children and finds that almost everywhere it is falling. Reuters meanwhile reported on a new measure in Indonesia to raise the age at which women can marry to curb child marriages. The OECD said asylum requests fell sharply in 2018 (though we’d need to find out precisely why before celebrating that as good news). The 2019 #OECD Int #Migration Outlook helps us get the facts straight. People think there are far more migrants than there really are; inflows of permanent migrants in 2017&2018 were lower than in 2016; temporary migrants increased considerably, but contributed greatly to labour And record numbers of the poorest teenagers are getting into British universities. The plumber who works free for disadvantaged people. And this gentle call in the Atlantic for a revival of the lost art of the telephone call. Danny Diskin wrote in from Brazil: I run a reforestation organisation partnering with rural schools in Brazil to build sapling nurseries, and restoring springs and river systems. Is this the kind of solutions you’d like to hear more about? Yes, definitely, Danny. Do keep us in touch with your progress. And David Dunn had a radical suggestion: When money was based with gold it was controlled in availability by how much gold was available. Today we need it based with natural resources to regain the link of worth and value which has been lost to history. Scrap all existing taxes and replace (them) with a single natural resource tax collected at source and based on the eco damage caused by their use and consumption plus UBI (universal basic income) and a wealth tax. With Team No-Side in Japan, as the rugby world cup gets underway. Also in England, with the world’s largest hokey-cokey. And finally, with this delightful slice of absurdity in which emergency services take on the “Tetris challenge” by unpacking every last bit of kit in their trucks."
"The bitter irony of the current drought in Australia is that it has again called forth the same myths and false beliefs that got us into trouble in the first place. Mingled with a genuine desire to help farmers and rural people caught in a spreading tragedy are the age-old calls to “drought-proof’ the continent, to turn the rivers inland, to harvest all their water lest it run to waste in the sea.  We now know that these are not solutions but recipes for disaster that fight against the nature of the continent instead of working with it. Yet they recycle every generation and dominate the populist rhetoric of the public debate. They are simplistic solutions that will destroy Australia. Like the lotus-eaters, we inhabit a dreamworld where water is plentiful and the landscape resembles the soft, green hills of Europe. It is time to awake and accept where we live. The Australian psyche is dominated by dreams of water. Early settlers found the landscape harsh and arid, lacking the verdancy and park-like qualities of Europe. The rivers were untamed: within weeks the vast floods that spread across the plains became a chain of muddy pools. Yet like spectres from the dying land­scape, the old myths have arisen once again with the present drought. Myths burnt into our psyche and captured in our folklore that keep us forever locked into unsustainable dreams. Dreams advocating we should try to bash Australia into submission instead of accepting its nature and learning to live within it. The three great myths that still haunt our thinking are that: • any water allowed to run to the sea is wasted; • we must make the desert bloom; and • we must “drought-proof” Australia Consider the three myths in turn. The natural flow of water down a river to the sea is part of a healthy system. It is when we prevent this by damming, building weirs and, especially, by taking out too much of the flow for other uses that the river’s health is placed at risk. If the river cannot flush itself, it has no way to remove the salt, nutrients and pollution that build up in it, quite apart from river flows driving many critical carbon and nutrient cycles critical to our marine ecosystems. The Australian landscape, its plants and animals have evolved to cope with episodic flooding. By removing the water and preventing floods, we are also destroying that landscape and rivers functions that give life to it. The key lies in striking a better balance between the needs of the natural environment, agriculture and our cities. It also lies in being a lot smarter in how we use our water. For example, almost all of our urban storm water and most of our sewage effluent is not recycled. The second myth – of making the desert bloom by turning coastal rivers to run inland – is as much in vogue today as it was 100 years ago. The drought has prompted calls to revive the Bradfield scheme, a 1930-40s plan to turn the Tully, Herbert and Burdekin rivers back across the Great Divide into central Queensland and connect to the Murray-Darling. Two centuries of development in Australia seem to have taught us little about the hazards of salinity, soil and water degradation, loss of habitat and species and the simple fact that the communities from which the water is taken will one day want it back. An awful political dilemma. The third myth of “drought-proofing” our drier areas is equally fraught with risk because it invites us to grow things in areas where the nature of Australia makes it inadvisable to do so. It involves bringing water to places where it is normally only an episodic event, and can cause unforeseen problems. From a national perspective it is also unnecessary. Australia has a huge “fertile crescent” of reliable high rainfall country and fertile soils around our coastline, on which we could develop sustainable agriculture and horticulture. But instead of growing food, we have chosen to use these lands for urban sprawl, tourism and hobby farms. So we have squandered our most precious resource in an arid, infertile continent. What other country would put its best farmland under concrete, race­ horses and golf courses? We now have the tools to predict risk in farming. We can say, with high confidence, how many crops you can expect to get in a given area over a decade, and what sort of cash flows they will yield. There is no need to grow things in places where failure is likely. There is no need to risk landscape destruction. Learning to farm Australia sustainably is about having a good grasp of these risks. All that stands in the way are the mirages and myths with which we surround ourselves. Our rivers and landscapes are suffering once again and it is not due to drought. It is caused by poor policies and poor management. And these are driven by populist myths. The critical need is not to drought­-proof the inland, for that is impossible. It is to myth-proof Australians.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Germany’s flagship political daily, has a stinging commentary on the “growing green tyranny” in Germany. Its piece titled The Affectionate Ecological Dictatorship takes aim at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), headed by Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, NASA’s James Hansen, and German policymakers. The usually staid and measured FAZ uses a tone that is uncharacteristically harsh.Germany’s first (hardline) green state minister gets sworn in
The article comes at the heels of last Thursday’s swearing into office of Winfried Kretschmann – Germany’s first Green Party state minister in the industrial state of Baden Wurttemberg, home of automotive giant Mercedes Benz and sportscar manufacturer Porsche. The new State Minister Kretschmann means green business, and warns companies will have to change the way they do business.
If one should doubt that Kretschmann and the Greens really mean business, read some of the quotes the FAZ reports:
His words are neither to be taken as political-tactical provocation, nor as lip service to the base, but as dead serious: ‘We have to bring our model for living in agreement with the fundamentals of the planet. With our business and economic practices, we are harming the planet. For the automotive industry: ‘If the automobile industry fails to green up, then it will not have a future’.”
Kretschmann is not mincing any words as Germany begins to get a taste of the country’s first Green authoritarian hardliner, a harbinger of what may be in store for Germany if it continues on its current path to Green tyranny.  The country’s mad rush into ecological dictatorship is underpinned by science from the über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a science that is packaged and uncritically disseminated to the public by a green cheerleading mainstream media.
“Ecological tyranny is growing”
As Germany rides a wave of environmentalism in the wake of Fukushima, the public as a whole is hardly voicing any opposition to the bold state intrusion into corporate management and private lives. And not only the Greens are spurring on the enviro-movement, but all of Germany’s political parties. Opposition to the green movement is weak, and political leaders feel embolden to grab power. The FAZ writes (emphasis added):
For a long time now it is no longer just the Greens who are intruding into private and company freedoms with the aim of cutting the people down for an ecological lifestyle. An ecological tyranny is growing in Germany; it leans on a large majority. And the German federal government is leading the pack.”
The FAZ then cites a number of examples: the government mandating ethanol fuels that no consumer wants, reducing rental rights of tenants when landlords do ecological renovations, mandating energy saving lights and chimney filters, forcing homeowners to insulate their homes, forcing consumers to buy expensive green electricity, plans to massively subsidise electric cars – to name a few. In a nutshell, property owners are now being told by the power-obsessed state what to do with their property and how to spend their money.
“Forced feeding of ecologically correct products”
Still, for the greens, things are still moving far too slowly. And the federal government is committed to putting Germany on the Great Transformation fast-track, where the state would have full power to decide the future course of its citizens. Guidelines are already being drawn up for deciding what consumers will be allowed to eat and how much energy and water they will be allowed to consume.
On all the government’s intrusion on personal sovereignty, the FAZ writes:
‘Forced feeding with ecologically-correct products’ is what economist Carl-Christian von Weizsäcker called the government’s style of not taking the citizens’ consumer sovereignty and freedom to decide seriously. Those who don’t cooperate, get defamed.”
and (emphasis added):

‘It’s bad enough to be oppressed by a minority, but it’s worse to be oppressed by a majority,’ formulated British liberal Lord Acton more than 100 years ago. ‘We are moving towards an ecological dictatorship,’ Weizsäcker says today.”
Hans Schellnhuber has little patience with democracy.
Losing patience with democracy
Much of the science underpinning the Green tyranny comes from the overzealous and dogmatic Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, led by Hans Schellnhuber. The FAZ appears to be realising this. I don’t know how often I’ve warned how dangerous this Schellnhuber and his greenshirts are, e.g. read here. For them things are not moving quickly enough. The FAZ is beginning to notice and takes aim at both James Hansen and Schellnhuber. The FAZ on Hansen:
Foremost, climate scientists are losing patience with the slow moving democratic processes. The world renown climate researcher James Hansen, who heads the renown NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, regularly expresses doubt on whether democracy can stop climate warming. Recently he praised China’s autocratic regime as hope. There, sustainable living could be ordered.”
The FAZ reports on how Schellnhuber once said that the German Parliament needs to be supplemented by a “Council for the Future” – which would have a 10% say on passing laws. The FAZ focuses on Schellhuber’s 32-page Social Contract For Sustainability, writing:
 It is full of moralization and revolution.”
and:
It overrides ‘interests groups’ and ‘veto players’ who hinder ‘the transition to a sustainable society’.“
This is written by the FAZ – the WaPo of Germany! Clearly the author is spooked, and the rest of us ought to be as well.
Hans von Storch: “quite arrogant”
Now even some renown German warmist climate scientists appear to be concerned by Schellnhuber’s bold master plan to transform the world and the government’s enthusiasm for it as they rush to implement it. The FAZ writes and quotes Hans von Storch:
‘The tenor of the paper reveals a problematic understanding of democracy,’ says climate scientist Hans von Storch. Moreover: ‘The authors reduce the world’s problems to carbon. That is one-dimensional and even quite arrogant.’ There’s global hunger for example, but that is not in fashion today.”
Indeed it is not. Green policies, particularly those promoting biofuels, are about to profoundly exacerbate the problem.
This is the real deal – the rise of green supremacism. This green malignancy will not remain confined to Europe. Make no mistake – it is a global endeavour. This is no time for Neville Chamberlains.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Der Spiegel here reports on Ottmar Edenhofer, who once admitted that reducing CO2 emissions was really all about redistributing global wealth.
Edenhofer is a UN economist and researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and is responsible delivering the economic arguments for conducting the Great Transformation to a decarbonized society.
How much is it going to cost? According to Der Spiegel and Edenhofer, so far except for lots of wild ass guesses, there are no real reliable figures available.
Recently it was reported that it would require only a “mere” 12 trillion by 2025, read here. That IPCC WG3 report, read here contains a lot of “ifs” and “maybes” scattered over a broad spectrum. Even Edenhofer sees a huge information deficit. Der Spiegel writes:
‘Everyone talks about renewable energies, but no one knows the costs exactly’, he said on Monday at a press meeting in Berlin. He too was amazed at how bad the state of information was.
In the report 120 researchers tried to derive an estimate of the costs of renewable energy. They rummaged through studies and databanks, and what they found was hardly satisfactory. ‘The data have a wide range and are often not critically checked over’, Edenhofer reported.”
So the proponents of the Great Transformation have no ideas how much it is going to cost. Yet we can be sure that energy will be much more expensive, and much more expensive energy and food are going to cost the poor lots of money and so many lives. So what does one do when there is such broad uncertainty? Der Spiegel writes:

In the end the IPCC scientists could only present numbers accompanied with error bars, said Edenhofer. Politicians, who expect clear recommendations, were aggravated by this.”
For Germany, switching to renewables also means revamping the entire power transmission grid. For example windparks in the North Sea will need power lines to bring the power inland and to the south. Everything would have to be integrated with the current system. There’s very little literature available to show how much this would cost. Edenhofer says:
The integrations costs cannot be determined from the literature. There’s a large factor of uncertainty. Whoever converts systems has to anticipate many surprises.”
Edenhofer also sees no reduction in CO2 emissions without a binding global CO2 treaty. As long as there is no treaty with teeth, CO2 emissions will continue to rise.
Kyoto successor will be buried in Durban
So what are the chances of getting a treaty in Durban next year? Der Spiegel quotes Edenhofer:
I have the impression that the successor to Kyoto will be buried there.”
Let’s hope he is right – permanently. But Edenhofer has not lost all hope. According to Der Spiegel, he belives the chances of getting a climate treaty will be good in 2014 – after the release of the next IPCC assessment report.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media reported that because of ash from the 1625m Dubbi volcano in Eritrea in northeastern Africa being blown 15 km up into the atmosphere, Hillary Clinton had to change her travel plans. So did dozens of other flights have to be cancelled.
Satellite photos now show huge clouds of ash blotting out the sky, see left, centre.
The volcano began erupting on Saturday evening – the first time since 1861, the German daily Bild reported here.
But as Der Spiegel reports, French scientists had misidentified the volcano. It wasn’t Dubbi after all. Der Spiegel writes: 
The VAAC volcano monitoring center in south-France Toulouse, which monitors the air space over North Africa, made the volcano Dubbi responsible. But a closer assessment of the satellite photos now show: Not Dubbi, but the Nabro volcano exploded – for geologists that is sensational.
The 2200-meter high Nabro has not erupted since man can remember, it’s been asleep since at least 10,000 years.”

The instability of the magma in the region and the eruption are now so great that the eruption was associated with an earthquake that measured 5.7 on the Richter scale. Der Spiegel writes that VAAC experts were stunned that Nabro had erupted because they thought the volcano was inactive. The huge amounts of ash first obscured the real source (Nabro).
The region is collapsing rapidly
Geologists say that the Eritrea region of Africa is now crumbling rapidly, and soon will be taken over by the Red Sea. We wrote about this back in Jaunary here.

The area between the dotted lines could be submerged – soon! (Photo source: Wikipedia.

The reason for the East African collapse is explained here in a Nature report titled: The protracted development of the continent–ocean transition in Afar
Nabro’s eruption coincides with the South American Puyehue eruption. The Caulle chain of volcanoes in the Chilean Andes 1600 kilometers southwest of Buenos Aires has been spewing a huge amount of ash up to 10 kilometers into the atmosphere since Saturday.
Although none of these volcanoes is large enough to impact the climate on its own, yet together and considering how much tectonic instability now seems to be at play, climatic changes due to these tectonic forces of nature seem to be more in the works. Expect more eruptions soon.
The ash spewed out thus far certainly will not help those betting on more warming, especially in combination with the sleepy sun and the multidecadal ocean cycles.

"Until a few months ago I never imagined blocking a bridge and watching grandparents being carried off by police. Yet last weekend I was one of hundreds of Extinction Rebellion (XR for short) protesters who danced, sang and chanted on Princes bridge in Melbourne for several hours to draw attention to the climate crisis. The people who chose to be arrested (the police gave protesters plenty of warning and time to move on) included an assistant school principal, a clinical psychologist, a permaculturalist and a 73-year-old grandmother.  These are not the sort of activities I envisioned doing at this point in my life. In the words of that Powderfinger song, these days turned out nothing like I had planned. Then again, few people predicted the world would end up the way it has – other than climate scientists, of course, whose warnings have been ignored for decades. Just last week alone, the UN called the climate crisis the greatest threat to human rights. A former Liberal leader, John Hewson, described it as “an emergency 30 years ago”. It was revealed Australia’s top bureaucrats have been preparing for “national-scale systemic climate risks”. Meanwhile unprecedented bushfires swept across the country and New South Wales launched an emergency relocation of fish. And yet as new disasters unfold every week, our prime minister signalled that Australia will not make any new emissions reduction targets and continues to aggressively expand the fossil-fuel industry. Scott Morrison even refused to attend the UN climate action summit next week, even though he will be in America.  There are solutions to preventing the worst effects of climate change and they are so simple a child can understand them. But we need to face the fact that our compromised and cowardly political leaders are simply not listening, beholden to their mates and corporate sponsors. Given the circumstances, my wife and I decided it would not be right at this time to bring a child into this world, and we are not alone. That is a terribly sad feeling, but nothing compared to what many of our greatest minds are telling us will occur if drastic measures are not taken: food shortages and mass starvation, a climate apartheid, the displacement and deaths of hundreds of millions of people, the continued destruction of the natural world, and the potential collapse of human civilisation. When our planet is under attack, what do we do? Stand up and fight back. Some of our tools are protest and civil disobedience which can be powerful factors in building political will. History has many examples of civil disobedience leading to meaningful change, including the civil rights movement and the suffragettes. What is crazier: dancing on a bridge to build political will for urgent action on climate change, or continuing as if nothing is wrong? Going to the footy might be easier than attending a protest. But the right thing to do and the easiest thing to do are rarely the same thing. Initiatives such as reusable coffee cups and signing petitions are nowhere near enough. People who care for the future of the planet and our species need to change tack. Einstein’s definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again and expecting a different result. Feeling anxious and distraught (again I am not alone) I attended an XR presentation earlier this year called Heading for Extinction and What to Do About It. These are popping up all over the country. As an inherently cynical person (a film critic by trade) I admit that going in a part of me longed to poke holes in it. Instead I discovered a presentation comprising exactly what our political leaders continue to ignore: evidence and science. The dramatic bits of Extinction Rebellion, such as mass arrests and road blocking, receive the lion’s share of media attention. Largely unreported is one thing that distinguishes this movement from many others: a strong regenerative culture. In short, people look out for each other. While hundreds of us held banners, waved flags and chanted at the weekend, we were given water, nuts and delicious home-baked food by a range of people regularly checking to ensure everyone was feeling OK. At the beginning and end of every XR meeting, attendees are asked to say one word to describe how they are feeling. The regenerative culture team runs initiatives to keep people happy and comforted, and a vibrant arts team creates colour and spectacle. Much of its work involves creative applications of the expired hourglass symbol, which has become the peace sign for a new generation. “With love and rage” is a common refrain. As a result of joining XR my mental health has improved. I’ve redirected my anxiety about the climate crisis into other initiatives, such as (shameless plug!) building the first national index of climate change protests. Extinction Rebellion is hugely supportive: there are people to grieve with, to laugh with, to stand together with, to demand action with. Everybody is welcome provided they adhere to a set of core principles and values and agree to these three demands. And everybody is needed. In Australia, Extinction Rebellion is building towards its “spring rebellion” which begins on 7 October and will involve rolling protests across the country. I took my conservative 74-year-old Christian mother to the XR presentation. She is attending her first protest on Friday, standing up for her grandkids at the global climate strike. She told me that if I decide to get arrested she will support my decision. Now there’s a conversation I never thought I’d have. Before the protest at the weekend, the group practised a song we performed many times throughout the day. The lyrics go like this: People gotta rise like the waterOur future’s on the lineI hear the voice of my sons and daughtersSinging climate justice now • Luke Buckmaster is film critic and writer for Guardian Australia"
"António Guterres is this week hosting a major gathering of world leaders in an attempt to accelerate global action on climate change. The UN secretary general has made tackling fossil fuels, and especially coal, central to the summit’s success. He has urged governments to stop permitting new coal-fired power stations to be built and to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels. In this context, the countries that are subsidising and facilitating the expansion of coal, oil and gas production merit just as much critical scrutiny as those that are burning these fuels. Just as it would be wrong to tackle smoking by focusing only on smokers and ignoring the efforts of Big Tobacco, it is wrong to tackle the global fossil fuel addiction by ignoring the countries that deal heavily in the product.   When it comes to global fossil fuel dealers, Australia is a kingpin. It is the world’s largest coal exporter, having captured a larger share of the global seaborne coal market than Saudi Arabia has of the global oil market. Australia is the largest liquefied natural gas exporter, too. From 2000 to 2015, Australian coal exports more than doubled and LNG exports tripled, and since then LNG exports have nearly tripled again. When you tally the greenhouse gases from the fossil fuels exported by each country, Australia’s coal and gas exports total over 1.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide – more than double its domestic emissions – making it the world’s third largest exporter of fossil carbon, behind only Saudi Arabia and Russia. You might wonder, then, why so little diplomatic attention is focused on Australia. It’s a testament to the effectiveness of Australia’s assiduous diplomatic efforts on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. Not only does Australia encourage other countries to buy its toxic coal and gas, but it works tirelessly in international forums including the G20 and the UN climate system to ensure that its huge fossil fuel exports are not discussed, let alone criticised. Australia’s conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, is notably absent from this week’s climate summit. Despite being in the US anyway to dine with President Donald Trump at the White House, Morrison declined to attend the summit because his government has no new climate commitments to announce. Far from increasing its paltry commitments to climate action, Australia is continuing to ramp up its fossil fuel production, mostly for export. With 53 coalmines  proposed, Australia wants to double its existing production again by 2030, aspiring to be the supplier of choice to fuel a proposed new wave of power stations in Asia. It is expanding its LNG production, too, with numerous large projects finishing construction and 19 proposals for projects or expansions. The implication is simple: if Australia achieves its planned fossil fuel expansion, the world cannot achieve the climate goals of the Paris agreement. Part of the response must involve curtailing the market into which Australia is selling its product. That means ensuring that new power stations in Asia are non-fossil fuel and that steel is increasingly produced sustainably, rather than from traditional methods that use coking coal. But economics 101 tells us that the greater the quantity of a product that is supplied into a market, the lower its price, and the lower its price the more attractive to buyers it will be than substitute products. That’s why fossil carbon has to be cut with both arms of the scissors – with measures to regulate both demand and supply. Other governments, powerful companies and mass social movements must therefore ratchet up the pressure on Australia to ban new fossil fuel production and instead mandate an orderly phase-out of its existing production. They must add their voices and their support to the millions of Australians who want their government to be a responsible global leader in staving off the climatic breakdown that is already wreaking havoc in Australia, to say nothing of its Pacific island neighbours and beyond. There’s nothing new about the idea of regulating the supply of dangerous products. Australia itself, for example, is a world leader in tobacco control, with scores of regulations targeting the supply of cigarettes and their consumption. Globally, treaties regulate the supply of and international trade in uranium, asbestos, hazardous waste, ozone-depleting gases and dangerous weapons. Fossil fuel power stations are catastrophically dangerous weapons and fossil fuels are their ammunition. It’s high time the rest of the world treated Australia like the carbon kingpin it is. Richie Merzian is climate and energy director at the independent thinktank the Australia Institute. Fergus Green will be a postdoctoral research fellow at the Ethics Institute at the University of Utrecht from 1 November 2019 "

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Defence Minister (Dr?) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is under heavy fire amid allegations he plagiarised other works and included them in his doctoral thesis, read short report here.
Unlike Climategate, the media here is doing its work and reporting on these developments which are now breaking, thanks in large part to the work of bloggers.
The case against zu Guttenberg appears to be hardening, at least that’s what we are hearing from the media. If it turns out that he did indeed plagiarise, then his doctorate will be revoked, and he will be under massive pressure to resign. Others of course say that everyone makes mistakes, and so he ought to stay. I think he ought to resign if he did indeed plagiarise.
Although the media hype surrounding zu Guttenberg is immense, the general public is a bit more calm about it. Most Germans here will tell you that they would not be surprised if many doctoral degree holders probably have done the same to a greater or lesser extent.
This got me thinking about climate science and all the professors and scientists out there. How many were really honest in their doctoral theses? In climate science we’ve seen a lot of shady dealings, criminal activity, corruption and downright fraud. It certainly would be interesting to examine a few theses from some of these leading warmist scientists.
I’ll just come out and say it. Any scientist that has the habit of manipulating, torturing and misrepresenting climate data probably was also less than honest in writing his/her thesis. Dishonesty starts very early on in life. Sure, this is a dangerous path to take, and one that is probably best avoided. It would indeed signal the start of a whole new level of mud-raking that might do more harm than good. Even honest people make mistakes, after all. Everyone has lied at one time or another. Yet, while some people rarely lie, others are pathological.
Shouldn’t the public know?
Sometimes it is not even clear what is a lie. Many tell half-truths, which is a way of deception. At this blog I tend to tell only one side of the story – because I feel the other side has been told ten times already. Does that make me deceptive?
Shall we have a look at some doctoral theses?

Share this...FacebookTwitterI don’t have a single one of these damn things in our house, and I’m glad. Now the German online DIE WELT has a report here called: Energy Saving Lights Emit Toxic Substances.
Hat-tip DirkH
It was already widely known that CFLs released deadly mercury, but only if they broke, see here for example, or here onwhat to do if one breaks. Now, according to the German television news show “Markt“, which will air tomorrow evening at 8:15 pm, CFLs also emit cancer-causing fumes during their operation, principally phenol, which is highly toxic even in small amounts.
DIE WELT reports that the NDR news magazine selected a random sampling of CFLs from various manufacturers and had them tested by an independent laboratory.
DIE WELT writes:
The official expert for lighting, Peter Braun, confirmed the magazine’s claims that substances can find there way in the air in a room. ‘Of special concern was that all lights that were tested emitted cancer-causing substances while they operated, and these happened to be the substances that occurred with the highest concentrations,’ Braun told the network.”
One manufacturer said they would look into it, while another said they know of no concentrations that are a threat to anyone.
Great! Now we are creating a global Love Canal to make believe we are rescuing the behavior of the atmosphere.

Ronald Reagan – June 12, 1987

"Flying will have to become more expensive, especially for frequent flyers, to avoid climate chaos and keep the UK within its carbon targets, the government has been warned, while going ahead with a new runway at Heathrow would all but rule out airport expansion in the rest of the country. Ministers are likely to have to choose among options including hikes to air passenger duty, new levies on frequent flyers and changes to air taxation relative to rail and road in order to limit burgeoning demand for cheap flights in the next few years.  Aviation is likely to become the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by 2050, warned the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, even though technological advances will reduce aircraft emissions. The committee wrote to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, on Tuesday, setting out possible policy options for ministers to stay within the legally binding net-zero target. “If this is represented in the right way, it should not be unpopular and the vast majority of people need not be very affected,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change. “But it’s very important that the government is honest about aviation emissions. We have to plan for the whole economy.” The committee’s findings throw into doubt the government’s green light for a new runway at Heathrow, the consultation on which ended last week. The Department for Transport has previously conceded that the net-zero target, enacted by Theresa May after the Heathrow decision was taken, could provide arguments towards a review. While the committee stopped short of advising against Heathrow expansion, it warned: “Current planned additional airport capacity in London, including the third runway at Heathrow, is likely to leave at most very limited room for growth at non-London airports.” Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said ministers must go back to the drawing board: “The government’s current aviation strategy is incompatible with our net-zero target and must be revised. The new strategy must focus on restricting demand growth, and will either require Heathrow’s third runway being cancelled or capacity restrictions on other airports to balance Heathrow’s expansion.” While improvements in aircraft fuel efficiency, and new technologies and designs, will reduce emissions from aviation substantially, this will not be enough to reduce emissions in line with a net-zero target because of the projected rise in flying, according to the committee. New technology such as biofuels cannot satisfy fuel needs as demand for flights rises, while speculative technology such as electric aircraft is a long way off, and capturing and storing the carbon emissions from conventional aircraft would be highly expensive. Flying at present is “very skewed” towards a small number of people, said Stark. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year but a minority fly often. On current trends, the number of flights taken in the UK would rise by 50% by 2050, but the committee advised this must be halved to a 25% increase to stay within the zero-carbon target. Many green campaigners want policies to focus on penalising frequent flyers and curtailing airport expansion, along with improvements in public transport to make rail a better option than flying on short journeys. Leo Murray, director at 10:10 Climate Action, said: “Most of the environmental damage from air travel is caused not by annual family holidays but by very frequent leisure flights by those at the top end of the income spectrum. A frequent flyer levy is the fairest and most effective way to keep aviation within safe limits, while protecting access to some air travel for all.” As a first step, the government could amend the law to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and shipping are included in the net-zero carbon target for 2050. They are currently excluded, but Stark said there was “no practical barrier” to counting them. Shipping emissions could be brought down by new technologies, and international cooperation will be key, according to the letter. The committee also found that buying carbon offsets – by investing in measures and projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere – or ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would still be needed to balance out the emissions remaining after the other measures to reduce emission from shipping and aviation had been undertaken. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The fight against climate change is the greatest and most pressing challenge facing the modern world and this government recognises that aviation and shipping have a crucial role to play in tackling it. “The government has already made clear its commitment to zero emission shipping in the Clean Maritime Plan, which was published earlier this year. We are also committed to setting a clear ambition for the aviation sector and will carefully consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change when we publish our position on aviation and climate change for consultation shortly.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany of you may have noticed that Steve Goddard at his Real Science site has recently posted a number of similar articles, putting to rest that weather extremes are exclusive to today (because of our CO2 emissions). Indeed they were just as frequent in the past.
This story here is just the latest, from online Der Spiegel titled: Tree Rings Witness To Devestating Droughts.
Der Spiegel starts by mentioning that Mexican construction workers in 2007  in Tula had excavated into an ancient Toltec chamber which held the skeletons of 24 youths, all under the age of 15. Among the bones were small statues of the god of rain, Tlaloc. The children had not died of natural causes, but had been sacrificed – in the year 1150 AD.
They had been the victims of futile weather appeasement rituals performed by high priests.
Tree rings show extreme droughts in the past
A recent study by author David Stahle, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, shows that an ancient drought, previously confirmed for the U.S. Southwest, extended into central Mexico from 1149 to 1167, and thus likely delivered the potentially fatal blow to the Toltec culture.
Photo credit: David Stahle
Stahle and his co-authors assembled a new and complete 1,238-year-long tree-ring chronology – the longest and most accurate of its kind – for ancient Mexico and Central America (or Mesoamerica). It  is the first to reconstruct the yearly climate of pre-colonial Mexico over more than a millennium and identifies four ancient megadroughts down  to their exact years.
Stahle’s team used 30 specimens of the more than 1000 year old Montezuma bald cypress trees near Tenochtitlan, which served as the captial of the Aztec empire, and Tula. Our amazing planet.com writes:
Tree rings give a precise estimate for wetness for every single year, Stahle said. The researchers determined the year of formation for each tree ring and analyzed what the rings’ growth patterns had to say about how soil moisture varied from growth season to growth season over the years, a parameter directly associated with rainfall.”

Stahle and his team stumbled upon the reason why these children had been sacrificed: Severe droughts had been decimating the Toltec population, and so the Aztec priests appear to have had the children sacrificed to in a bid to end the weather extreme that had gripped the region and parched their agricultural activity. Der Spiegel writes:
For many years the fields yielded too few crops to feed the people. At the end, the drought was so bad that the residents of Tula offered the god of rain the blood of children in a bid to gain back mercy – but the drought stayed.”
The drought lasted 18 years, from 1149 to 1167, forcing an entire generation to grow up under constatnt hunger and killing thousands. Der Spiegel also writes that another major drought could be easily discerned from the tree-ring chronology, one beginning in the year 1514, five years before Cortez and the Conquistadors landed on the Mexican beaches, and ending in 1539.  Like the Toltecs, the Aztecs also performed human sacrifices. Der Spiegel:
Similar to the Toltecs, the Aztecs tried to appease god of rain Tlaloc; archeologists discovered the skeletons of 42 executed children in the large pyramids of the Aztec capital if Tenochtitlan.”
Strangely the ouramazingplanet.com article issues a message of warning to today’s societies, though probably not the one it intended. University of Tennessee/Knoxville archaeologist David Anderson says:
This study will prompt a great deal of follow-up research by archaeologists and paleoclimatologists alike, and offers lessons for our own civilization — specifically how vulnerable complex societies may be to drought-induced crop failures.”
If any lesson ought to be learned from all this, it is that rain-dancing and performing rituals to appease the weather gods with the aim to prevent “weather extremes” is not only ineffective, but is pure madness.
The difference today is that at least Toltecs and Aztecs waited until things were really desperate before embarking on their madness. In today’s modern world, at the very height of human prosperity, we have science lunatics proposing the same mad behaviour in a bid to prevent weather extremes in a distant future – based on tea leaves and crystal balls.

"Marshwood’s oaks are shedding an unexpectedly large crop of black acorns this autumn. These are stunted stubs of nut with an eggshell sheen, barely rising in their brown cups. Long stalks show they are from pedunculate or English oaks, Quercus robur, one of the commonest native hedgerow trees. I’ve found many under one particular oak that’s about 400 years old, whose massive, twisting, almost curly, branches overspan the lane. Its lower trunk has developed a huge burl, a woody, swollen growth, caused by long-ago injuries and beetle attacks.  Producing black acorns is a sign of stress. Immature seeds die mid-growth, with the stalk, or pedicle, withering on the twig. Some have hard shells but others are soft enough to split with a thumbnail, having been invaded by insects and softened by recent downpours. Last year was a mast year when the vale’s oaks were glutted with acorns – that particular tree could have produced more than 10,000 nuts. Mast years are generally followed by meagre cropping or even barren years as trees recuperate their energy. Long-term lack of water after a mast year can be particularly difficult for oaks, which need plenty of moisture. It has been unusually dry here for 18 months – during the winter there were patches of cracked earth. That was almost unheard of in a place where the isolated residents used to be nicknamed “stick-in-the-muds” because wet, churned clay made the roads impassable for five months of the year. These dark acorns falling now are failed ones, shaken from the tree by the wind. Those that remain are fat and green with a faint bloom, plugged tight into their tea-cosy cups. They will ripen and tan in the next month or so, before bulleting the ground to be picked over by squirrels and deer. Jays will seize a good number, taking them off to bury as winter stores. Not all of these bird-planted seeds will be unearthed and eaten; some will survive and shoot, becoming saplings and one day, perhaps, mature trees."
"The Northern Territory government has set a target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in a plan that says responding to climate change is “responsible economic strategy”. The NT’s Labor government’s draft climate change response says the territory will use its natural advantage in solar resources – “now the cheapest form of new electricity generation” – to transition away from fossil fuels.  Eva Lawler, the NT climate minister, said “climate change threatens everything that makes the territory lifestyle great” and governments needed to respond. “Responding to climate change helps us protect the things we value the most — the things we can’t put a price on — and will create economic opportunities for territorians and territory businesses through the creation of new industries and local jobs,” she said. State and territory governments are increasingly moving towards ambitious climate policies in the absence of effective national policy on climate change. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is in the US this week but won’t attend the UN climate summit in New York on 23 September. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, are being deployed instead. Countries have been asked to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but Australia has so far offered no new commitments beyond its 2030 targets. This week the Australian Capital Territory government announced a far-reaching plan for the electrification of transport and homes as it moves toward a net zero emissions target by 2045. The NT’s draft plan includes an aspirational target of net zero emissions by 2050 and says a 10GW renewable energy roll-out in the NT by 2030 could create more than 8,000 jobs and bring $2bn in revenue. The plan says the territory could gain additional export revenue if the minerals sector focuses on the minerals required for production of renewable technologies. The document also says that as electric vehicles move closer to cost parity with petrol and diesel in coming years, “the average NT household could reduce vehicle running costs from $3,398 per year to $672 per year – an 80% saving”. Much of the data in the draft plan is based on a report by Beyond Zero Emissions, which said renewable energy could be put at the centre of a sustainable NT economy, creating jobs and driving new export opportunities. “The Northern Territory government has shown we can really power our economy with renewables and it’s not costly, it’s actually an opportunity,” said BZE’s chair, Eytan Lenko. This year the territory government lifted a three-year ban on fracking for onshore gas exploration in the Beetaloo basin. Climate scientists have warned opening the basin will massively drive up carbon emissions. In its draft climate response, the NT government said it will develop climate change risk response strategies for government services and assets in climate-sensitive sectors. It said it climate risk would be considered “across government decision-making”. “A climate change response is a responsible economic strategy,” the plan says. “It recognises that as Australia and the world transition to a low-carbon economy and respond to climate risk, those that don’t will be left behind.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome sad news I am compelled to report today. The German poster child of Arctic ice melt, polar bear Knut, died mysteriously yesterday at the Berlin Zoological Garden.
No animal had ever been so instrumentalized by the German media for the purpose of rallying attention and sympathy to the mythical plight of the polar bears in the Arctic. According to Wikipedia:
Knut (born 5 December 2006 – died 19 March 2011) was a polar bear born in captivity at the Berlin Zoological Garden. Rejected by his mother at birth, he was raised by zookeepers. He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than 30 years. At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a tourist attraction and commercial success.After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping the cub in captivity, fans worldwide rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub’s life were sent from around the world.
Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed “Knutmania” that spanned the globe and spawned toys, media specials, DVDs, and books. Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007. Zoo attendance figures for the year had increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history. Knut died at the age of four on the afternoon of 19 March 2011.”
Unfortunately, Knut did not fare well in captivity. His chances surely would have been better if he had lived up in the Arctic (assuming no rejection by his mother), where the polar bear population has quadrupled over the last 50 years or so.
Bild tabloid today has the photos of Knut’s last moments at the Berlin Zoological Garden.
I wonder if Germany is going to declare a national day of mourning. Knut’s death is being reported everywhere. Rest in peace, Knut. Hopefully where you are now, you won’t have hordes of enviro-drones gawking at you all day long.
Am I being too hard on Knut tourists? Was there a “Brennpunkt” news special yesterday evening? Flags flying at half mast?…
Reading the controversy part of the Wikipedia account, I have to say the let-Knut-die proponents have an inhumane view. It wasn’t his fault he was born there. The keepers have a young animal on their hands, and it is their moral obligation to care for it. Sometimes I ask myself what for barbarians are out there. As short as his life was, I’m sure he had many moments of content.

"Donald Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. A senior UN official confirmed to the Guardian that the White House has booked one of the large conference rooms in the New York headquarters on Monday so that the president can address a gathering on religious freedom. The move is likely to be seen as a blatant snub to the UN climate summit, to be held in the same building on the same day. Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis. UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were “not panicked” given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly. “No one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,” the official said. It’s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his home town. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. “He’ll clog up the whole system,” said Mary Robinson, former Irish president and ex-UN high commissioner for human rights. “He won’t go to the climate summit and he wants the distraction factor, I suppose.” Even if Trump were to attend it is unlikely he would have been called to the podium to speak. Representatives from about 60 countries are expected to address the UN on Monday on the further commitments they are making to slash greenhouse gas emissions and deal with the flooding, storms and other impacts of global heating. The speakers will outline “only the best plans, only the most committed leaders will be on the stage”, according to Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN’s special envoy for the climate summit. Still, Trump’s presence in the UN building, at a time when climate protests swept around the world on Friday, will prove provocative. “Not participating and yet showing up at the building is throwing down a gauntlet,” said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute. “It’s most importantly a snub to the young people pleading for action on climate change. Donald Trump has made very clear internationally and domestically he has no interest in the science or this issue. It’s up to the rest of the world to get on with its business.” The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes you have a slow day in climate news and so you have to post something trivial. This is such a post. But it’s short.Hollywood environmental campaigns always seem to involve some “star” who sings and lectures us on saving the planet. But then the star hops on a private jet and flies circles around the globe, smothering it in jet exhaust.
One recent campaign is Disney’s Friends for Change campaign in Germany, which has a promo video featuring singer Selena Gomez. I just couldn’t help but notice in the music video, Make a Wave, that Gomez and her hunk are driving to the beach in a huge gas-guzzling 4WD SUV. Why didn’t they go by foot or by bicycle? At the very least, they could have used a small hybrid car?
I often get the impression that Disney and Hollywood elitists believe CO2 is a gas that is emitted only when “other people” use energy, jets and SUVs, but not when they do.
Reading up about Selena, I see that she’s only 18 years old, and so I won’t blame her. Obviously Hollywood is just exploiting her. I really doubt she knows the first thing about climate. Poor girl is all confused.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a mix of various news stories in Germany.
1. E. Coli epidemic in Germany (and handling with gloves)
Journalist Michael Miersch reports on the double standard in reporting the organic food catastrophe in Germany. Since E. coli bacteria infected the supply of food and so creating Germany’s worst food outbreak and scare in decades, the media have been doing all sorts of fancy acrobatics to play down this glaring Utopian green dream failure.
Officials now claim the source of the E. coli bacteria is indeed a “plant” in North Germany. That “plant” of course is an organic vegetable farm.


 

The above graphic shows the number of E. coli illnesses (and deaths in parentheses) for each German state. Source: http://www.stepmap.de/karte/2011-06-09-ehec-hus-154483 (3 deaths outide of Germany).
Now that we have so many deaths and hundreds ill, we ask: is the German government moving to shut down all organic farms in Germany, to protect the public, in a move similar to the shut-down of nuclear power plants in the wake of Fukushima? The answer is “no”.

Indeed news reports this morning say that the organic “plant” where the bacteria originated will be allowed to remain open!…citing “excellent hygiene standards”. I’m not convinced. A few days ago the Gärtnerhof Bienenbüttel organic farm showed workers in the food processing plant handling raw vegetables with their bare hands. The “bare hands” photos have since been taken down and replaced with scenic outdoorsy nature photos, see here. Hiding something? Noooooo.
2. Energy boss warns of German industrial exodus
Jürgen Großmann, a vocal critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to end Germany’s reliance on nuclear energy by 2022, told the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung the country was jeopardizing its economic foundation.
“Politicians would do well to review their actions, and consequences for the price of electricity,” he told the paper. “Consumers will pay more and many companies will think twice about whether they are in good hands in Germany. Continue reading here…
3. Green politician wants highway robbery of transport
Consumers aren’t paying through the nose enough, and they need more restriction. So says green European Parliamentarian Michael Cramer here. Cramer advocates a hefty “climate traffic toll” all across Europe. He says:
The problem is that the costs caused by trucks are not being accounted for. If they really were taken into account, then the tolls would have to increase considerably. Studies have shown that noise from trucks cause costs of 20 cents per kilometer.”
and (paraphrased):
Member countries should be able to increase toll rates by up to 175% during peak traffic times. The problem is that the EU has a lid on toll revenue. According to the Parliament, the toll rates outside of rush hours should be lower so that the state does not take in more revenue. So now there is no real incentive for less driving, rather there’s an incentive to drive during other times of the day.”
For the greens, it’s all about getting restricting people and stealing your money.

Here’s another “global warming is good for everything that’s bad, and bad for everything that’s good” story. Now according to the online Swiss suedostschweiz.ch:
Ticks could become more dangerous because climate change favours infected ticks. That’s the conclusion that researchers of the University of Neuenburg concludes. The study was supported the Swiss Nation Fund.”
Scientists claim that the infected blood-sucking critters live longer when it’s warmer. Every year 10,000 Swiss people are infected with the Lyme-Borreliose.
A team led by Lise Gern have been studying the Holzbock tick over 10 years and found they have become increasingly infected during that period. The Suedostschweiz.de says:
Climate warming could have enhanced this trend, the researchers fear.”
Could?
====================================================
Inflation In Germany and Europe Jumps
This certainly is no surprise to anyone. When sources of energy are villainized and citizens are forced to buy more and more expensive energy, plus the senseless shut own of nuclear power plants, eventually these dumb policies start having an impact on supply chains. The online Mitteldeutsche Zeitung here reports:
Consumer prices climbed in march like in February on a year earlier another 2.1 percent. That’s the highest increase in two and half years, according to the German Federal Office of Statistics. Foremost energy prices are fuelling inflation. Energy increased in price in March 10 percent. Heating oil (+ 32.8 percent) as well as gasoline and diesel (+ 11.2 percent) were at the top of the list. But also electric bills climbed sharply (+ 7.6 percent).”
There are no “coulds” here – just hard reality. The price of food, which requires substantial energy to produce, also jumped 2.2%. Unfortunately political shift to renewable energy has barely gotten underway, and so these increases are only a tiny sampling of what is in store should Europe plunge fully into the renewable energy madness.

There’s nothing wrong with a friendly bet among gentlemen. I’d like to think that Rob Honeycutt and NoTricksZone had a difference of opinion, and so we decided to cordially shake hands on it like two gentlemen would. No one tried to drag the other through the mud.
But what we see at Joe Romm’s Climate Progress here is something totally different. Irked by growing public skepticism and statements made by Joe Bastardi on why he thinks the globe is starting to cool, Romm just couldn’t take it anymore. Frustrated, he lashes out.
Like a schoolyard bully who has just lost his best marbles, he calls Joe Bastardi out to the schoolyard to settle it once and for all, publicly taunting and singling out Joe Bastardi to meet him out there to duke it out in a climate bet. Romm has clearly reduced himself to a sort of schoolyard climate punk, thinking he can drag people through the mud and settle things that way. Clearly he has long exhausted his professional means. 
Romm, you blew it; you’ve shown you got no class acting like that. Twelve-year olds can act like that, but not professionals.
Maybe some other punk in your neighborhood will show up for your classless bet, but Bastardi isn’t coming for it. He’s got something maybe you had long ago – CLASS.
Joe Bastardi has left his response at his European Website here. And he’s right; this is not about meeting out in the schoolyard to settle scores. Things will be settled in time, scientifically, professionally. That’s why I tell the cock-sure warmists…be patient, things will unfold. Qué será, será.
And Bastardi asks what I think is the key question:

But what will you do if it goes down? Will you actually stop your obsession with destroying those that disagree with you and shutting down debate? Can we get your committment to that? If it goes up, I will be forced to become an advocate for your position, which if I am proven wrong, I will. I rather doubt the vast majority of people opposed to me will open their eyes even if we went into a mini ice age, as some have opined. In the end, there is the difference. I am not guided by blind faith, but faith formed from the foundation of facts on past events. If the facts prove me wrong, then I will be guided by what I know to be is right.”
The answer to the above question depends on how much class these people have. So far, it looks like they don’t have much. Joe says that if the temperature rises in the next 10 years, he’ll change his position, not because of losing, but because of what obsrvation and science say. But Bastardi accepts the challenge, like a gentleman with class would.
But at the very least, the challenge has been accepted, and you can keep your money. What you need to do is be rich enough in your heart to open your mind to other ideas, and if need be, like me, change if you are proven wrong over the coming years.
Given what I have experienced so far, it’s much easier to believe the globe will cool than people actually admit it is doing so, no matter what.”
I hope that Joe Bastardi didn’t let Romm get under his skin too much. His reply was too long, meaning he spent too much time responding to a classless person that deserves to be ignored.
Overall in this preliminary wrestling match, Bastardi just pinned his opponent in about 6 seconds flat.

Update: Romm needs to spend less time in the schoolyard, and more time in the math classroom. http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/romm-math-fail/

The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research of the Helmholtz Association here reports that its Polar 5 research plane, loaded with measurement instruments, has just completed a 6-week expedition over the high Arctic, along with 2 other planes from the European and American space agencies ESA and NASA, to measure, among other things, the thickness of the ice.
On May 6 the Polar 5 Arctic expedition plane returned to Bremerhaven, Germany, where scientists will evaluate the volumes of data on sea ice, trace gases, aerosols and meteorological parameters that have been collected.
The Polar 5 route started in Barrow (Alaska) went over Inuvik, Resolute Bay, Eureka, Alert (all in North Canada), Station Nord (Greenland) and all the way to Longyearbyen at Spitzbergen. These locations were the base stations for the measurement flights over the uninhabited Arctic regions. The total flight time for measurement and travel was 130 hours. One of the main tasks was large-area sea ice thickness measurement in the inner Arctic, and this was done in close cooperation with the University of Alberta.
Preliminary results show thinner ice?
They used a four-metre long electromagnetic ice thickness probe, also called an EM-Bird. The Polar 5 towed the probe on an 80-meter long cable at a height of 15 meters over the ice surface. The AWI press release states:
A preliminary evaluation shows that one-year ice in the Beaufort Sea (north of Canada/Alaska ) is about 20-30 centimeters thinner this year than in the last 2 years. Ice thickness in 2009 was on average 1.7 meters, 2010 at 1.6 meters and 2011 at 1.4 meters. ‘I would expect this one-year thin sea ice will not survive the melt season this year“, estimates Dr. Stefan Hendricks. In a few weeks his colleagues at the sea ice group at the Alfred Wegener Institute will introduce their model calculations for the 2011 sea ice minimum.”

So the ice in the Beaufort Sea has gotten thinner? How does this assertion compare with PIPS, see here? Here are the PIPS ice thickness charts for the last three years, all for May 1st. Green is thicker and blue is thinner (see their site for the scale). For 2009:
May 1, 2009
and for 2010:
May 1, 2010
and for 2011:
May 1, 2011
Hmm. Clearly we see that somebody is overflowingly filled with crap. The charts show that Arctic sea ice is getting thicker.
So what is going on? We do know that the AWI is funded by the government, which happens not to be  interested in any news that may suggest they have been going down the wrong path and living in a planet-rescue fantasy. No, the ice has to be getting thinner – even if it is getting thicker – and their masterminded plan to rush into renewable energy indeed is going to rescue the planet. The scientists were probably summoned by the Klimateburo and told to watch what they release to the public, or else get the big cut-off! Who knows.
In the meantime maybe we can find an explanation for the huge discrepancy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s logical. Bad science leads to bad policy, which leads to bad decisions, which in turn inevitably leads to costly results.
Destructive “solutions”
A perfect example is the science behind palm oil plantations for producing biofuel. Here the costs outweigh the benefits probably 1000 to 1. But can you even put a price tag on rain forest destruction? Then there are the high food prices driven in part by biofuel crops, causing political unrest in poor countries, which now threatens to explode globally. Italy’s first boatloads of economic refugees from Tunisia are making the point clear to stubborn, reality-disconnected politicians in Europe. Another example are mercury-laden energy saving lights. They’re expensive, do little to reduce CO2, and their disposal is now poisoning the planet.
Face it, the preliminary concepts drawn on napkins always look good. That was the case for renewable energy like wind and solar. But when these were put on the test-stand of reality, the renewable energy sources were exposed as unreliable, highly costly, and did nothing for the environment. Wind farms transformed once beautiful landscapes into industrial eyesores that pose a danger to migratory birds. Resistance is mounting.
Worse, all of it is for nothing.
The unsteady supply of renewables, British lives at risk
Today the unsteady supply of energy from renewables is leading to huge costs for consumers. A steady supply of electricity is now in jeopardy. Nothing better illustrates this than Britain’s wind farms last December. Veteran science journalist and hyrobiologist Edgar Gärtner ín a commentary cites the near collapse of the British grid during the bitter cold of December:
Precisely on the bitter cold days did most of the 3000+ British windmills remain idle. On one of the cold days, the 283 wind farms with a total of 3153 windmills supplied a total of just 0.4% of Britain’s energy demand. In order to prevent a blackout, older coal power plants and gas turbines had to be urgently fired up. Large industrial consumers had their power rationed.”
Right when the supply of energy was most needed, was it the most unreliable. If it had not been for the despised conventional energy sources stepping in during the emergency, thousands of British lives would have been put at risk. Britain’s target of producing 30% of its energy demand by using renewable sources looks doubtful. Gärtner writes:
To reach that target, the number of windmills would have to double. At the same times, coal, oil and gas fired power plants would always have to be on stand-by for windless periods. But, according to the wishes of the EU Commission, there aren’t supposed to be any more oil and coal power plants. In any case, the energy costs for private households will double by 2020. every household will have to pay on average a 2,890 euros a year in heating and lighting.”
Soaring energy costs in Germany

The situation in Germany looks even gloomier. With its currently installed wind energy capacity, Germany will have to put old moth-balled coal burning plants back into operation or build new ones to assure capacity for windless days. That means 200% capacity to assure 100% delivery – hardly economical. Consumers will have to pay through the nose, and certainly will be angered by it. Gärtner writes:
In 2009 German power consumers subsidised ‘renewables’ with 9 billion euros, according to Prof. Dr. Ing. Helmut Alt. This year the amount is estimated to be over 14 billion euros. Here social dynamite is being kept tinder dry.
Cheap and plentiful supplies at home
The worst part about it all is that it is unnecessary. German consumers will become especially agitated when they start learning that there are now very cheap and plentiful reserves of natural gas available – right at home. Gärtner writes:
After successful test boreholes by ExxonMobil, Wintershall and BEB in Germany and Poland, it is sure that there are natural gas reserves large enough to supply domestic demand for decades, and thus eliminate the need for natural gas imports from Russia. Worldwide, using a new extraction technique, useable natural gas reserves will be 10 times greater, says a Texas geologist. Obviously this revolution does not accommodate Angela Merkel’s ‘energy concept’ for the simple reason that it was not planned.”
Just at a time when consumers are being punished by high energy prices does a cheap and plentiful supply appear, making future pain completely unnecessary. Gärtner adds:
It can be anticipated that natural gas on the European markets in the coming decades will be so plentiful and cheap that it will become increasingly difficult to continue on the German unilateral, go-it-alone ‘renewables course. It will be increasingly difficult for political leaders to sell a supply of expensive and unreliable energies to a hurting public when there is a a far better alternative readily available, especially in view of the colder upcoming winters forecast by experts.”
Forcing people to freeze in the coming colder winters when there’s a cheap supply directly under their feet can be socially explosive.
Energy snoops and a planned climate economy
For this reason the Dutch European Energy Review already writes of signs of a coming “Energy Civil War” in Germany. This is why the EU and German politicians are getting nervous and pushing hard to invest 200 billion in revamping the energy grid so that it can work with solar and wind sources over international borders. But that won’t be enough to solve the technical problems. Consumers will have to be forced to use less – much less. That’s why the Handelsblatt reported on February 9 of the EU Commission’s plan to prepare a new ordinance that would send inspectors in factories and businesses:
These inspectors will force private industry to move faster so that the EU reaches its 20% reduction target for energy efficiency by the year 2020. This increases the fear that the centrally planned climate economy will make interference in private property rights necessary. Such intervention will certainly be met with massive resistance.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuestion: A man sitting next to a radiator in his living room wants to feel 0.2°C cooler. What should he do?
a) Move his chair a couple centimeters further away from the radiator, or
b) Go out and pay $5000 for a completely new heating system from a shady manufacturer who promises it will be 0.2°C cooler.
Sane persons of course will answer with “a”. But if you’re the European Union and your advisers are German economist Ottmar Edenhofer, and sleazy furnace salesmen Hans Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Malthusian Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), your answer is “b”.
In fact salesmen Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf have convinced the man that unless he buys the new, cooler furnace today, he’ll soon fry.
Worse, the furnace that promises to solve “the problem”, does not even work when there’s no sun or little wind. No matter though, you still have to buy it. This is what Schellnhuber and Edenhofer of the alarmist/activist PIK are demanding of every global citizen today. The absurdity and arrogance simply could not be more profound.
Call it a field plan for a green September 1, 1939 kind of bank account invasion (US citizens, watch your 401k). It’s that crazy.

According to the green-fundamentalist Klima Der Gerechtigkeit (in English: Climate of Justice), the teutonic Edenhofer of the PIK) on Monday will introduce to the public his master economic plan for mitigating dangerous global warming, dubbedSpecial Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation.
The Special Report sums up 164 existing studies and tries to get an overview of just how much renewable energies can contribute in solving the “climate problem”. This of course involves spending gargantuan sums of money that an almost bankrupt planet does not have. How much will it cost? Klima der Gerechtigkeit writes (emphasis added):
Witha mere twelve thousand billion dollars by 2030, a global energy transformation could be achieved that would lead to about 3/4 regenerative energy worldwide by 2050.”
Yes, for that “mere” amount of money, we can get a temperature change that no one will even notice. That “mere” amount is about 8 times the direct cost of WWII for the planet, see here (h/t ArndB). So far I have yet to find a single language that has the words to describe the magnitude of this proposed folly.
As it stands now for the greenshirts, we are nowhere near where we have to be. Klima der Gerechtigkeit writes:
Indeed the current situation is dismal: Almost the entire energy mix comes from coal, gas and oil. Nuclear energy is only 2% (and growth here is very improbable). About 13% is already generated by“renewables”, by behind this is unfortunately too much biomass that is used conventionally, i.e. firewood, and so directly drives  deforestation (and the climate problem) . ‘Water power then follows (2.3%), wind energy (0.2%), solar energy and geothermal (each 0.1%) as well as ocean energy(0.002%).’ (Zeit)”
How many tens of billions have flowed into renewables so far? 0.3% is all we have to show for it? The 12 trillion number can be doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled, and you still will never reach the 75% target by 2050. In the end as a result, we’ll have a hollowed out society with hundreds of millions more suffering and dying in abject poverty.
What we need is economic sustainability, and not sustainable wealth destruction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the German media are now in full panic mode. They can no longer get their stories straight.Desperate to stem the flood of doubt now sweeping Germany, as the country is gripped by its harshest December in 100 years, including record snowfalls in Potsdam, the hyper-alarmist PIK and the German media are now throwing all they’ve got to explain away the embarrassing cold.
For years they preached endlessly that Germany would be experiencing balmy, southern European-type winters. Snow indeed had been relegated to the history books. The tables have since turned.
Everybody had predicted a brutal winter
Back in late summer and fall, meteorologists like Piers Corbyn, Joe Bastardi, and other German private forecasters, were all predicting cold winters ahead. Even Russian and Polish scientists had forecast the possibility of the harshest winter in a 1000 years. But the PIK and Met Office climatologists scoffed. The Met Office in England even went so far as to forecast a mild and wet winter, again.
So far, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Germany have experienced one of the worst Decembers on record, if not the worst.
PIK suddenly sees the writing on the wall
By early November even the climate scientists at the dogmatic PIK eventually recognized the writing on the wall, and so scrambled to fabricate a cartoonish “new study”, authored by PIK scientist Vladimir Petuchov, that suddenly predicted cold winters would be likely for Europe, and claimed it was consistent with global warming. Their models had just uncovered it.
The media blitz – conflicting stories
The heavy snows and extreme cold hit as expected. The public was caught off guard and demanded an explanation. And so the propaganda machinery switched into high gear. FOCUS online, two days ago on Tuesday, had the title Colder Winters Because of Global Warming. Der Spiegel and other major news outlets, along with radio and TV, all joined in spreading the PIK propaganda – all reporting this sudden new discovery by PIK.
Here Focus wrote how a PIK computer model shows how the disappearance of sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas influences the climate in northern continental regions. Less sea ice in these seas leads to release of energy into the atmosphere.
As a result, large-scale changes in air currents could occur so that polar winds make their way to Europe and North Asia, whereby the probability of cold winters triples.”
Emphasis added. They (PIK) aren’t sure amd are simply floating this out. The study’s lead author Vladimir Petuchov then adds a line, which I think will become infamous down the road:
Hard winters do not refute global warming, instead they more so confirm it.”

So, according to their latest climate models, global warming will lead to colder European winters. The probability of the such is 3 times higher. Now enters Stefan Rahmstorf.
No no…stop! Warming leads to warmer colder winters!
Meanwhile Stefan Rahmstorf is watching the back door. No matter what happens, they’ll all be able to say “We were right”. Also on Tuesday, the online Die Welt quotes Rahmstorf, also from the PIK, in an article titled: Hard Winter Not a Sign of Climate Change. (Petuchov to the contrary said that it was).
We will certainly have to anticipate milder winters rather than cold ones.”
Die Welt then adds:
PIK scientist Prof. Stephan Rahmstorf also points out that the “cold“ winters have gotten warmer.”
Stop right there. These guys can’t even get their stories straight! One PIK scientist says we’ll get warmer winters, while the other one says we’ll get colder ones. Well, which is it? Rahmstorf seems to be saying we’ll get colder winters that will be warmer. Oh, now I get it…global warming will now lead to warmer colder winters!
It was all recently discovered by their climate models
Dr. Peter Werner, also of the PIK, said on NDR Radio (also on Tuesday) that their climate models had just recently uncovered the Barents and Kara Sea phenomena, claiming it’s all consistent with man-made climate change.
Tuesday was a busy press release day for the alarmists in Potsdam. It also appears to have been a very chaotic one too.
Conclusion
So what can we conclude from all this? No matter what the climate does, they will be able to say their models predicted it. Falsification is impossible. Jared Olar of Echo-Pilot.com here says it best:
The natural sciences have terms for that kind of hypothesis. ‘Unfalsifiable’ is one of them. ‘Unscientific’ is another. An idea may be true, but if it is incapable of being ‘falsified’ or proven wrong, then whatever else that idea is, it certainly isn’t science.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterClearly there is a pattern. We’ve seen it with Bill Clinton, allegedly Al Gore, and now we have the IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the Socialist Party France.They are all proponents of a powerful, domineering state that demands citizens bend to its will. Submit to the state and all shall be well, the statists tell us.
It’s all over the news today. But unlike Al Gore, Strauss-Kahn is not that central to the global warming religion, and so there’s much less at stake with him getting arrested.
What is it about some people that leads them to believe everyone else has to bend to their will? They are so convinced of themselves, elitist, all-knowing, believe they have all the answers and expect everyone to follow their instructions.
In climate science, they (politicians, activists like Al Gore, and a number of scientists) demand everyone else fall to their knees and start acting according to their instructions. “Don’t do this, don’t do that – do this and do that. Stop resisting – you know you want it…”
Giving instructions while being the beneficiaries of the consequences of the instructions is fun. But notice how they rarely ever follow their own instructions. They continue their lives of private jets, mansions and pleasure. They sure do like it on top, don’t they?
I’m not passing blanket judgement. But I am saying beware of people who constantly and habitually demand we bend and submit to their will – especially when the science is bad and it serves to satiate a personal need. Throw in power, arrogance, and a lack of checks and balances, and soon you get disaster.
Of course we have to wait and see the results of the investigation before concluding. Clearly it’s another case of the weak up against the very powerful. The political deck is firmly stacked against the young woman – good luck reaching justice. The bearer of truth here once again will probably come out of this smeared, ruined – a victim for a second time.
If a smear campaign is launched against the victim, or if a huge amount of hush money gets paid, then we’ll know the truth. Rules for you, but not for me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHardly! Ed Caryl brings us a classic example of GISS temperature data “adjustment”.
====================================================
Urban Heat Island at Providence Rhode Island
By Ed Caryl
A recent paper by Ping Zhang and Marc Imhoff of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA materials found here), pointed out the incredible heat island around some eastern U.S. cities, including Providence, Rhode Island, and Buffalo, New York. This author decided to examine this data, and compare it to the GISSTemp data for the same location.
First, here is the image from the NASA paper, and below it, a heat map image derived from it. Note the temperature scale on the bottom of both images. The temperature scales are from 20 to 40 degrees C. Find the airport in these images.
Original NASA image
and
NASA image converted to a false-color heat map
The airport should the easy to find, it is the hottest place on the map, about 15 degrees hotter than the cool countryside at the edges of the images. This is the Warwick/Providence TF Green State Airport.
Now, where do you suppose the temperature is being measured at this airport?
As at most airports, it is in between the main runway and the taxiway in front of the terminal. Right next to that purple spot on the heat image, the hottest place on the map. After all, the pilots want to know the runway temperature when they plan their landings and takeoffs.
Look at the 2 images below from the U. S. Geological Survey, and Google respectively. The weather instruments are near the navigation beacon (the dark spot, at the arrow, near the center of the USGS photo):

What does GISSTemp say about this location? There are two records in the GISS database: a raw data file, and a corrected file that they use for further processing, such as the U.S. and the global average temperature. The default file is the uncorrected raw data. The URL looks like this:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/gistemp_station.py?id=425725070060&data_set=1&num_neighbors=1
If you change the digit after the “set=” to a 2, you get the corrected data. Both sets of data are available as text files from a link below the resulting chart. Both sets of data were downloaded and charted below, along with the mathematical difference, the “correction”.

Both sets of data show a warming trend, but the uncorrected data (Providence 1) shows much more warming than Providence 2. The difference is a stepwise correction, warming the past by as much as 1.2 degrees C.
One would think that any correction should be to cool the more recent temperatures to correct for the increasing UHI, but that isn’t what they have done. And, most of the correction was done to data before 1940. This doesn’t make sense either, as most of the infrastructure and population buildup around the airport didn’t happen until WWII and after. Also, the correction amount doesn’t approach the UHI temperature rise measured by Dr Zhang.
Will Drs Hansen and Zhang get together?
Most of the surface temperature data that goes into the averages, whether world-wide, or here in the U. S., come from airports. In the U. S., the number is 121 out of 134 stations. Each of the airports in the images in the NASA paper can be clearly seen as a hot spot. Clearly, some work needs to be done to correct the surface temperature record in light of this information.
When will GISS get around to that?

Will the new 2011-2020 decade be warmer or cooler than the last one?
That’s what we’re betting on.
The warmists are betting it’s going to be warmer. But the coolists say it will be cooler because of natural cycles, which are now beginning to have a cooling effect. Here’s why I feel us coolists are going to win:
1. CO2 is wildly exaggerated as a climate driver.
2. The PDO has entered it’s negative phase – meaning more La Ninas in the pipeline.
3. Solar activity is low.
4. The AMO is also about to head towards its negative phase.
5. We are overdue for a disruptive volcano.

This bet by the way is named after the initiator: warmist Rob Honeycutt, who has pledged to match all the bets from the cool side, up to $5000.00, and is happy about the money from the losers going to charity (That’s very generous of him :)). I’ve been in e-mail contact with Rob, and he really is a good guy. He means well.
And if the cool side can get that many pledges from the coolists, then Rob will start looking for more warmists to join in to up the ante. Let’s see how high we can get this.
Payment will be made 2021, and so if you think inflation and/or lack of interest paid, etc. will erode the amount, then just add a little more to your pledge. Again, we want to keep it simple.
If you are interested in joining this bet, you can read how to:
JOIN THE CLIMATE BET FOR CHARITY 
It’s very uncomplicated. Just leave a comment making your pledge, and I’ll put your user name, e-mail address and amount on a list. That’s it! We’ll come knocking at your door in 2021 (if you lose). And hey – it’s for a good cause.
The coming decade is going to settle the science
In fact, it may take only a few years. Here’s the life-story of the AGW scare:
1980s: AGW scare was born.
1990s: AGW scare lived.
2000s: AGW scare was killed.
2010s: AGW scare will be buried.
The oceans are cooling, and cold winters are returning, which is bad news for the planet. We’d be much better off with another one or two degrees of warming. The latest tree ring study we saw in Science clearly shows that warm is better. I hope that us coolists lose this bet. But I doubt we will.

"The US is to stage its largest ever day of protest over the climate crisis, with tens of thousands of students joined by adults in abandoning schools and workplaces for a wave of strikes across the country. Climate strikes will take place in more than 1,000 locations in the US on Friday, with major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. Globally, more than 4,500 strikes are planned across 150 countries. The young strikers’ totemic figure, the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, will take part in the New York walkout and will speak to massed protesters in Manhattan. Authorities in New York have announced that its student population of 1.1 million is able to skip school to attend the strikes. In March, more than 1 million school students took part in a global climate strike but Friday’s iteration is likely to be swelled further by adults encouraged to walk out of their workplaces in support of the young protesters, who are demanding a halt to fossil fuel projects and a complete shift to renewable energy. Dozens of companies, including Patagonia, Ben and Jerry’s and the Guardian, will support striking staff, with major unions also backing the walkouts. Thousands of websites, such as Tumblr and Kickstarter, are set to “go dark” as tools are downed on Friday lunchtime. Hundreds of doctors have written medical notes to excuse students from their classes due to the threat posed by the climate crisis. “This is going to be the largest mobilization for climate action in history,” said Alexandria Villaseñor, a 14-year-old who has been protesting outside the UN headquarters over climate every Friday since December. “World leaders can either listen now or listen later, because our voice is only going to get louder as the climate crisis gets more urgent. Adults need to step up and support us. Civil disobedience breaks the system and once it’s broken it’s an amazing opportunity to make things better.” Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, an 18-year-old from San Francisco, said she will be striking because “I want children of my own and I want them to have a better life than me. I don’t want that to be taken away by climate change.” Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. “We are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,” Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style economic mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A parallel protest will take part in New York, highlighting the impact of the climate crisis on people of colour and to mark the second anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico. In Seattle, more than 1,500 Amazon employees will strike over the company’s climate policies. The strikes have been backed by several cities. “When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm,” read a joint statement by the mayors of New York, Paris and Los Angeles. “Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity, are doing just that.” The sprawling strikes represent a remarkable escalation of Thunberg’s decision last year to start skipping school on Fridays to protest against inaction by the Swedish government over the climate crisis. A global movement has since grown from the 16-year-old’s stand, and young people have expressed outrage that their generation is being left a world with increasingly punishing heatwaves, storms, flooding and societal unrest. Thunberg, who has abjured plane travel, arrived in New York on a solar-powered racing yacht last month and has since become a focal point for the climate movement, appearing on talkshows and in Congress to excoriate its members. She has also met Barack Obama, who called her “one of our planet’s greatest advocates”. Her US sojourn will culminate with the UN climate summit, to be held in New York on Monday. She will address world leaders who have assembled to help revive the flagging international effort to avoid disastrous global heating. The US and Brazil, led by nationalist leaders disdainful of climate science, have slowed momentum, with a UN report last week warning that the required ambition is lacking among most countries. “The audacity of kids simply asking leaders to lead is extraordinary. We are indebted to them,” said Rachel Kyte, special representative for the UN secretary general for sustainable energy. “They are rightly impatient. “Not every country is aligned to the need for fast action. The hope is that the US will join in at the point where public opinion is able to influence the national voice more than it does today.”"

"Greta Thunberg has excoriated world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through their inertia over the climate crisis at a United Nations summit that failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating. In a stinging speech on Monday, the teenage Swedish climate activist told governments that “you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.” Days after millions of young people joined protests worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered for the annual United Nations general assembly aiming to inject fresh momentum into efforts to curb carbon emissions. But Thunberg predicted the summit would not deliver any new plans in line with the radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are needed to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” a visibly emotional Thunberg said. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.” As the summit spooled through about 60 speeches from national representatives, it became clear that Thunberg’s forecast was prescient. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, told delegates that “the time for talking is over” in announcing a plan to ramp up renewable energy but didn’t announce any phase-out of coal – a key goal set by António Guterres, the UN secretary-general who convened the summit. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did set out the end of coalmining in her country but only by 2038 – a lengthy timeframe that disappointed environmentalists. Meanwhile, China declined to put forward any new measures to tackle the climate crisis. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called for the European Union to deepen its emissions cuts and said that France would not make trade deals with countries not signed up tor the landmark Paris climate agreement. “We cannot allow our youth to strike every Friday without action,” Macron said, in reference to Friday’s global climate strikes. Despite Guterres’ efforts, the summit was somewhat overshadowed by its absentees – most notably the US, and Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil, whose representatives were reportedly not selected to make a presentation there because of Brazil’s failure to outline plans to strengthen its efforts to counter climate change. Donald Trump did visit the UN on Monday but only briefly dipped into the climate summit to see Modi’s speech before attending a meeting which he had called on religious freedom. As he arrived at the UN, Trump crossed paths with Thunberg, who fixed the president with a hard stare. The summit was designed to accelerate countries’ ambition to address the climate crisis amid increasingly urgent warnings by scientists. A new UN analysis has found that commitments to cut planet-warming gases must be at least tripled and increased by up to fivefold if the world is to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement of holding the temperature rise to at most 2C above the pre-industrial era. The world is currently on track to warm by as much as 3.4C by the end of the century, the UN warned, a situation that would escalate disastrous heatwaves, flooding, droughts and societal unrest. Major coral reefs and many other species face extinction. “There’s a big dissonance between every leader saying to Greta ‘we hear you’ and the commitments they are putting on to the table,” said Isabel Cavelier, a former climate negotiator for Colombia who is now senior adviser at the Mission 2020 climate group. “China said absolutely nothing new, India mentioned commitments made in the past, the US, Canada and Australia aren’t here. We are seeing governments showing up empty-handed. There’s a feeling that the big emitters are holding things back.” There were a few signs of progress. A group of nearly 90 large companies promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, while a handful of countries said they will be winding down coal use. But it became apparent that most of the ambition was coming from developing countries, rather than the major polluters. Trump has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, while other major powers are wary of making further commitments ahead of key UN climate talks in Glasgow next year. Thunberg’s speech was “very emotional and grounded in science”, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If I were a world leader I’d feel very uncomfortable. But we’ve seen nothing from the big national leaders, the G20 players. It’s hard to say the summit moved the needle on the emissions curve.” “Other countries must follow our lead,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, a country situated on coral atolls in the Pacific that is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. “Falling short will represent the greatest failure humanity has ever seen. The summit must be the moment we choose survival over selfishness.” But delegates at the summit warned that the international effort to stave off dangerous global heating was being undermined by a wave of nationalism. “If you look at the US and Brazil, it’s a result of populist politics that is turning its back on the climate,” said Cavelier. “That needs to be made explicit and isolated from the world.” Amid the stunning rise of the youth climate movement, Thunberg, who arrived in the US last month on a solar-powered yacht, has directly castigated Congress and leaders at the UN, as well as spearhead the largest ever climate protest last week. On Monday she joined 14 other children to lodge a formal complaint under the UN convention on the rights of the child. The complainants, from countries including Argentina, the Marshall Islands, France, Germany and the US, claim that countries’ failure to address the climate crisis violates the international convention. “Each one of us had our rights violated and denied, our futures are being destroyed,” said Alexandria Villaseñor, a 14-year-old from New York who has taken to protesting outside the UN headquarters every Friday. Thunberg said that world leaders were endangering children by ignoring climate breakdown. “They promised to protect the rights of the child and they have not done this,” she said at a media conference at the offices of Unicef. “The message is that we have had enough.” • This article was amended on 1 October 2019 because an earlier version misdescribed the 2015 Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to at most 2C above the pre-industrial era, as limiting global heating to at least 2C above the pre-industrial era. This has been corrected."
"Scott Morrison is increasingly seen as running a “denialist government” that is not serious about finding a global climate solution and uses “greenwash” to meet its emissions commitments, analysts and former diplomats say. Australian observers in New York said Morrison’s failure to attend a UN climate action summit on Monday despite being in the US, and his apparent rejection of the need for Australia to do more to address its rising greenhouse gas emissions, eroded goodwill for the country on the issue.  While representatives from about 60 nations spoke at the summit, Morrison gave a keynote speech at the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs in which he challenged China to do more heavy lifting on climate change and suggested it should be treated as a “newly developed” economy rather than a developing one. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist of Climate Analytics and a longtime adviser to countries at climate talks, said the UN summit had been “very disappointing” as most larger polluters, including Australia, had failed to meet the secretary general Antonio Guterres’ call to increase commitments, leaving ambitious strides to smaller nations. He said country representatives at the summit were dismissive of Australia’s intentions. “Diplomatic officials from countries that I speak with see Australia as a denialist government,” he said. “It’s just accepted that’s what it is. It is seen as doing its own promotion of coal and natural gas against the science.” Hare said Morrison’s suggestion China should be doing more on climate, and be treated similarly to the most developed countries, while Australia’s emissions continued to increase year-on-year was a “ridiculous fake argument”. He said China, the world’s most populous country and biggest annual polluter, was not doing anywhere near enough to tackle the crisis, but was doing more than Australia on many measures. It had national policies in a number of areas – boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles and efficiency in industry – where Australia did not. “Is that having enough of an effect in China? No. But will China peak its emissions by the end of the 2020s? Yes,” Hare said. “Will Australia? There is no evidence that Australia will peak its emissions as far as I’ve seen in any projections that have been published.” A report backed by the world’s major climate science bodies released on the eve of the summit found current plans would lead to a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100, a shift likely to bring catastrophic change across the globe. Richie Merzian, a former climate diplomat who now works at progressive thinktank the Australian Institute, said Australia was seen by other countries as denying the severity of the problem and in engaging in “greenwashing” by using accounting tricks to meet targets while actual emissions increased. While leaders from other countries did not attend – notably Japan, Brazil and South Africa, while Donald Trump made a surprise passing appearance – Merzian said Morrison’s absence was seen as condescending as he was nearby. “If prime minister Morrison thinks he has skipped this meeting and not damaged his relationship with the Pacific, he’s in denial,” Merzian said. With Morrison absent, having not being invited to speak, Australia’s delegation was instead led by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling. The former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd told the ABC Morrison’s failure to attend sent a message to corporate Australia it was not serious about climate action. National emissions have increased each year since the carbon pricing scheme was abolished in 2014. “When you have a prime minister of the country not stepping up to the plate, addressing the world’s forum, and indicating what Australia’s future carbon reduction commitments will be, it sends a very clear message to the Australian domestic community and the international community that the Australian government is just not serious,” Rudd said. “We are free-riding on the rest of the world. I believe it’s unacceptable.” Asked about criticism thrown at the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who gave an impassioned address at the summit, Rudd said she represented “the anger of that generation and does so effectively”. “It might insult a whole lot of middle-aged white guys, because it is not the way that we would talk, or we think that it is inappropriate for a young girl to speak that way, but when I speak to young people around the world, whether it is in China, here in the United States or back home in Australia, frankly there is a rising rage that our generation has failed to step up to the plate,” he said. Dean Bialek, a former Australian diplomat to the UN, now working with the Mission 2020 campaign led by ex-UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said Australia was increasingly perceived as a “self-interested laggard”, pointing to the Morrison government’s support for new coalmines as the mainstream science community and the UN secretary general called for thermal coal to be rapidly phased out. He said Australia was also seen as engaging in double-speak as it claimed to be meeting its international commitments while planning to use “carryover credits” from the Kyoto protocol that did not represent new emission cuts and were not referred to in the Paris agreement. Australia was also ignoring a key part of the Paris deal: that the targets volunteered in France, in Australia’s case a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels by 2030, were not enough and would be reviewed and ramped up. “Not only has Australia started with a very weak target but it is now saying it is not planning to increase that very weak target next year,” Bialek said. “There seems to be complete amnesia about this big commitment made in Paris.” Under questioning in the US, Morrison ducked questions about when Australia would develop an emissions reduction strategy for 2050, despite signing on at the Pacific Islands Forum to a communique pledging to develop one next year. He said his government would meet the 2030 commitments made at the election. Asked what the plan beyond that was, Morrison said: “We are making our commitments to 2030, that’s what we are doing. We keep setting the targets and we keep meeting them.” – Additional reporting by Amy Remeikis"

Share this...FacebookTwitterComputers have been forecasting a wicked cold winter for Europe this year. Looks like it’s shaping up to be just that.
Later this week a blast of Arctic air is set to sweep across northern and central Europe, as a huge high pressure zone off in the Atlantic combined with low pressure system Gundula to east over the Baltic pump frigid air over the continent.
One meteorologist says such a weather pattern was last seen 70 years ago.
Wetter.com writes here:
Cold air will clash with moist air and, as a result, we will get more and more snow in the days ahead. But that’s not all. By and by the cold will tighten its grip, and by Friday temperatures will not get above freezing.
That is still not the end of it. This weekend temperatures nationwide [Germany] will be between 5 below and 13°C below at night. But hang on tight. Next week will be even colder – especially at night, where for example, the temperature in the Black Forest will drop to 26°C below!
And if that is not enough, then drive out to the Swiss mountains. 38°C below is the forecast during the night from Sunday to Monday!

German tabloid Bild newspaper reports here, quoting meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net:
The weekend will be bitter cold. Daytime highs will climb to only -8°C to -2°C . Nighttime temperatures will drop to -10°C. But in areas with clear skies and snow cover, especially in the central mountain regions, temperatures of -25°C will be reached.
Jung says such a weather pattern can stay around a long time before it goes away. He tells Bild newspaper:
When cold polar air is really there, than it’ll stick around for awhile. At the moment weather models show no end in sight for the coming cold wave. Quite to the contrary, the first weekend of December is going to be even colder, and there’s the threat of heavy snowfalls.
We’ll be getting temperatures like we would only expect in the dead of winter. A similar weather pattern led to the extreme winter in 1939/1940.”
And it’s still autumn officially!
Strange how the leaders of the world’s most climate-activist countries will be discussing ways to prevent warming in balmy Cancun Mexico just when their respective countries will be struggling in bitter cold. The Gods have a sense of humour.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHead for the hills folks! Sea levels are rising. But first read Ed Caryl’s latest essay on sea levels. It sure helps ignoring the climate catastrophe cultists for a few minutes and taking a sane look at the data.
———————————————————————————
A Level Look At Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
Figure 1: Sea level rise since the last glacial maximum 20,000 years ago. (Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png 
One of the tenets of the AGW crowd is the idea that sea level rise is going to be catastrophic in the next 100 or 200 years, drowning our coasts and harbors, and in the case of low-lying countries, like The Netherlands, whole countries. These are not the facts.
Figure 1 shows the sea level rise over the last 20,000 years. In the last 8 thousand, the curve looks flat. It looks like there has been no rise since civilization began, and that the recent rise of about 20 cm (Figure 2) since 1900 is “unprecedented.” That is not true. The sea level has risen and fallen several times in the last few thousand years.
Figure 2: Recent sea level rise. Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Recent_Sea_Level_Rise.png
In Figure 3, one can see that the sea level did not abruptly level off after the rather swift rise as the major continental glaciers melted, but slowly continued to rise, with one episode of falling between 3 and 4 thousand years ago.
Figure 3: Magnified view of sea level rise in the last 8,000 years. Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Sea_Level.png 
A closer look at the last 2000 years is wanted. An article describing the sea level at Barrow Alaska was found. Here is the abstract in full:
Eustatic rises of sea level between A. D. 265 and 500 and between A. D. 1000 and 1100 caused the formation of raised beaches. After the first rise, sea level dropped about 2 meters below the present level, permitting Eskimo settlement of Birnirk about A. D. 500. The second rise of the ocean flooded Birnirk. At present, sea level is about 0.6 to 1.0 meter below the high water levels; the ocean partially floods Birnirk.”
The rises and falls at Barrow mirror the Roman Warm Period, the Dark Age Cool Period, the Medieval Warm Period, and the last fall in sea level in the Little Ice Age, with a slow rise since then. (See From Hockey Sticks to Boomerangs for the temperatures during this period.) But we are still below the high water levels seen at Barrow. These events are somewhat visible in the data points of figure 3, but the author of that chart has chosen to use a straight line to depict the sea level for the last two thousand years, not showing the natural variation.
 The same rises and falls happened in the Fenlands of eastern UK. This description is from Wikipedia. The Roman period in the UK was from 43 CE to 410 CE, well into the Dark Age Cool Period.
The peak of the water levels in the fens was in the Iron Age; earlier Bronze and Neolithic settlements were covered by peat deposits, and have only been found recently.[11] During the Roman period, waters levels fell once again, and settlements were possible on the new silt soils deposited near the coast. Though water levels rose once again in the early medieval period, by this time artificial banks protected the coastal settlements and the inland from further deposits of marine silts, though peats continued to develop in the freshwater wetlands of the interior fens.[12]”
 Then there are the Roman fish pens. Described at this site, but the story is all over the internet as proof of AGW caused sea level rise. It proves no such thing.

‘The Romans dug these fish pens into bedrock, and the water line in these well-preserved structures shows that the sea level along the Italian coast 2000 years ago was 1.35 metres below today’s levels. “They were used for only a very short time, so they make rather nice markers,’ says Lambeck.”
He then analysed how land elevations changed along the Italian coast due to both plate tectonics and the after-effects of the last ice age. In a paper to appear in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, he concludes that geological processes affecting land levels over the past two millennia accounted for 1.22 metres of the change, which means that the global sea level rose by 13 centimetres.”
The only problem with this story is that the sea level changed several times in the intervening years, both up and down. The fish pens are just one marker in time. They were used only for a short time because after that they were either above sea level and dry, or below sea level and unusable. Is there a chart of sea level over the last 2000 years? There is this one at CISRO, but the error bars are very long and it shows nothing useful. We only begin to get good data from tide gauges in the last 300 years.
 A problem with measuring sea level is that isostatic rebound, post-glacial rebound, or glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), is still happening. It affects tide gauge readings all over Europe, especially in Scandinavia. One way to correct for this is to use GPS readings to find the actual earth movement and subtract that from the tide gauge measurements. When this is done, the real sea level rise in recent years begins to dwindle. This quote is from the abstract of Geocentric sea-level trend estimates from GPS analyses at relevant tide gauges world-wide.
Sea level change in the era of the recording tide gauge. Int. Geophys.Ser., 75, pp. 37–64.] rules, whose estimate is 1.84±0.35 mm/yr after correction for the GIA effect [Peltier, W.R., 2001. Global glacial isostatic adjustment and modern instrumental records of relative sea level history. Int. Geophys. Ser., 75, pp. 65–95.]. We obtain a value of 1.31±0.30 mm/yr, a value which appears to resolve the ‘sea level enigma’ [Munk,W., 2002. Twentieth century sea level: an enigma. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 99(10), pp. 6550–6555]. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
S. Jevrejeva et al (Figure 4) did another sea level reconstruction using several European tide gauges and correcting for GIA in 2008. This shows a steady rise of about 300±100 mm since 1800. This is about 1.5±0.5 mm/year. This is a steady rise since the end of the Little Ice Age, with no unusual rise after the increase in CO2. This natural rise began long before mankind began burning fossil fuel in earnest.

Is sea level rising? Yes, as it has been since the end of the little ice age 200 years ago. It will continue to rise. The remnant glaciers will continue to melt until the next cool cycle. But there is no catastrophe. At 1.31±0.30 mm/year, or 1.5±0.5 mm/year, if the trend is linear, it will be up 10 to 20 cm by 2110. The Dutch will need to put more blacktop in their dike roadways, which they normally do anyway, several times in the next 100 years. But if the current solar minimum continues for a few years we won’t need to worry about it. We will be in a cool cycle.
Anticipating questions, these are provided:
What about Bangladesh? The river silt has kept up with sea level rise so far, and will in the future, in fact, 250 years ago, much of Bangladesh was flooded all the time. To learn more look: here, here, here, and here.
What about the Pacific Islands, the Maldives, etc? Coral grows much faster than 2 mm/year, and has kept up with sea level rise so far, and it will in the future. Many of those islands are only there because of coral growth.
What about our harbors? Infrastructure is continuously wearing out, being torn down, and rebuilt. The docks of 1700 are no longer there. They have been replaced, 300 mm higher.

"Fox News has apologized after a guest criticized the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg as a “mentally ill Swedish child”.  Appearing on Fox News on Monday, the rightwing commentator Michael Knowles launched an extraordinary attack on Thunberg, 16, who is campaigning in the US to urge action on the climate crisis. Knowles’s swipe at Thunberg followed one from Laura Ingraham, one of Fox News’s most prominent presenters, who compared Thunberg and other young climate activists to the characters in Stephen King’s horror story Children of the Corn. Holy shitMichael Knowles of Daily Wire just called Greta Thunberg a ""mentally ill Swedish child.""@ChristopherHahn tore into him pic.twitter.com/Ki0cK6W3Ev Thunberg gave a blistering speech at the United Nations summit, criticizing world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through a lack of action on the climate crisis. Knowles, a guest on Fox News’s The Story, was invited to discuss Thunberg’s speech and the climate crisis. He was dismissive of both. “If it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” Knowles said. The commentator Christopher Hahn, appearing on The Story to theoretically offer a liberal perspective, immediately criticized Knowles. “Yeah, I mean, you’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child. Shame on you,” Hahn said. A Fox News spokesperson subsequently told the Daily Beast: “The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful. We apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.” Fox News told the Hollywood Reporter it had “no plans” to book Knowles as a guest in the future. The channel has not commented on Laura Ingraham’s attack on Thunberg. Ingraham used her show The Ingraham Angle to suggest, incorrectly, that Thunberg wanted people to “cede control of our economy, our way of life, our way of transport, how many children you want to have, and if we don’t go along, we will be punished by our own children. “Does anyone else find that chilling?” Ingraham said. “I can’t wait for Stephen King’s sequel, Children of the Climate.” King’s fictional story The Children of the Corn focuses on a group of children in a remote town who believe anyone over the age of 19 should be killed. Curtis Ingraham, Laura Ingraham’s brother, swiftly criticized his sister, suggesting that her rightwing pronouncements were motivated by financial gain. He said: “Clearly my sister’s paycheck is more important than the world her three adopted kids will inherit. “I can no longer apologize for a sibling who I no longer recognize. I can and will continue to call out the monstrous behavior and the bully commentary born out of anger.”"

"It’s possible that the implications of Justin Trudeau’s blackface episode (I can’t recall how often I blacked up, says Trudeau, 20 September) will be taken as simply personally unfortunate, the result of “a bit of fun” and careless playacting coming back to hurt his political prospects. It should make us ask serious questions. What kind of world is it where a white person getting made up to look like a black person can cause such trouble? Two recent Guardian articles pointing to our continuing refusal to talk about race, by Mithu Sanyal (Whisper it, but it’s finally OK to talk about race in Germany, Journal, 18 September) and Alex Clark (‘What we can learn is, be aware of the beginnings. Be aware of racism, be aware of nationalism’, Review, 14 September), are good places to start looking for answers.  The blackface issue is so powerful because it reveals white people’s almost total failure to appreciate the ongoing violence of racism and how this is fixed on the skin, making it the most basic index of racial identity. A white person “blacking up” cannot help but tease out all the most injurious features of race while allowing them to play in the inversion of its hierarchies and the fictions of its construction. Many people believe race does not exist and that, like the makeup, it can be wiped away. This is only possible if it’s not your skin that is in the game, a point powerfully made by the black American comic and civil rights activist Dick Gregory, to white audiences in 1962: “Wouldn’t it be a helluva joke if all this was really burnt cork and you people were being tolerant for nuthin?”Rod EarleShalford, Surrey • It should not surprise us that such revelations about Justin Trudeau appear right before a tight election. Trudeau has been fighting to maintain a federal carbon tax; powerful international oil interests would prefer that Canadians elect Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who voted against the Paris agreement, is a fierce opponent of the carbon tax and has promised to stop Trudeau’s “war on cars”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Alfred Wegener Institute has issued a press release about a comprehensive study on the erosion of Arctic coastlines it has recently released. Many media outlets in Germany were busy peddling the “dramatic results” over the last day or so. So what data do we have to back up all the drama? Only about 10 years worth, it turns out.
Dramatic! Most coastlines are stable or actually agrading. (Source: Alfred Wegener Institute)
Excerpts of the AWI press release (emphasis added):
The coastline in Arctic regions reacts to climate change with increased erosion and retreats by half a metre per year on average.  This means substantial changes for Arctic ecosystems near the coast and the population living there. A consortium of more than thirty scientists from ten countries, including researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association and from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, comes to this conclusion in two studies published in Estuaries and Coasts and online on www.arcticcoasts.org. They jointly investigated over 100,000 kilometres and thus a fourth of all Arctic coasts and their results have now been published for the first time.”
I’d think data from up there is probably rather scant going back more than 10 years, certainly when you go back 50 years or more.
The changes are particularly dramatic in the Laptev, East Siberian and Beaufort Seas, where coastal erosion rates reach more than 8 metres a year in some cases. Since around a third of the world’s coasts are located in the Arctic permafrost, coastal erosion may affect enormous areas in future.”
Two thirds of the Arctic coasts do not consist of rock, but of frozen soft substrate (permafrost). And precisely these coasts are extremely hard hit by erosion. As a rule, Arctic regions are quite thinly populated. However, as nearly everywhere in the world, the coasts in the far north are important axes for economic and social life. The growing need for global energy resources as well as increasing tourism and freight transport additionally intensify anthropogenic influence on the coastal regions of the Arctic. For wild animal stocks, like the great caribou herds of the north, and the widespread freshwater lakes near the coast progressive erosion brings about significant changes in ecological conditions.

This looks more and more like a touchy feely nature documentary we often see on TV. No one lives there, yet it has an economic impact? Ice ages have also had an impact on these regions, like being covered by a mile of ice. Most animals get a bit disturbed by that too.
‘When systematic data acquisition began in 2000, detailed information was available for barely 0.5% of the Arctic coasts,’ says Dr. Hugues Lantuit from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).”
10 years of data? That’s it? That’s enough to call the situation dramatic?

Photo of coastal erosion. Source: Wikipedia – (Pacific coastline, not the Arctic).
These are impacts due to weather. We have little historical data with which to compare this to. Coastal erosion has been around since we have had oceans and seas. I seriously doubt there is much there except a subtle plea for more funding. Finding a spot or two along the Arctic shores with 8 meters of erosion makes for nice headlines.

"I was born into a world in which my future and my past are uncertain. Born into a world where my inheritance is slipping into the sea. Born into a world where my people are going extinct. I am 20, and I am suing the executive branch of the federal government for causing the climate crisis. I am one of the 21 youth plaintiffs in the Juliana v United States climate lawsuit taking action against our government for denying us our constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. I am also a first-generation Garifuna-American. My people are an Afro-indigenous community originally from the island of St Vincent in the Caribbean. In the 18th and 19th centuries, we were pushed from our homeland on St Vincent by British colonial power, settling on the eastern coast of Central America in Honduras and Belize. Despite overwhelming adversity, we organized our community and emancipated ourselves to protect our future as a people. However, the struggle continues for me and my people. As sea levels rise and the coral reefs upon which we depend disappear, the Garifuna’s future is uncertain. Again, we are being pushed from the lands upon which we settled. The land that my family has inhabited for generations, the land that I am supposed to inherit, will be underwater in a few decades unless the federal government stops actively promoting fossil fuels as our primary energy source. Until the unprecedented Superstorm Sandy, my mom hadn’t had to prepare for a natural disaster since she left Honduras. She raised me in White Plains, New York, a place that for her, promised safety and relief from disasters like Sandy. During the hurricane, I spent days hunkered down in her bedroom without power as the storm raged around us. I was a terrified middle-schooler waiting for one of the many trees surrounding my house to come crashing down on us, just like I’d seen happen on the TV. The anxiety from that event and its immediate aftermath seven years ago is still with me. This anxiety is increased by the knowledge that the identities that I inhabit: first-generation, trans, indigenous, Latinx, black, youth; all make me uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. That is why I have dedicated the past four years of my life to holding the federal government accountable for the harm it has caused and continues to cause me, by knowingly perpetuating the climate crisis. Like the youth in other famous civil rights lawsuits, such as Brown v Board of Education, we are demanding that the government address the injustices its policies have wrought to ours and future generations. In our lawsuit, we are not asking for money, but instead, seek a government-prepared climate recovery plan sufficient to protect our constitutional rights and ensure a climate system capable of sustaining human life. Like the Garifuna have done for centuries, we are fighting for justice, and for our survival. People of color, indigenous communities, low-income communities and young people face a significantly higher risk of experiencing the impacts of climate change I first learned of the institutional racism and injustice underlying our political system during the height of Black Lives Matter (BLM), a movement that brought increased attention to the police murder of unarmed black people across the country. Coming just a few years after Superstorm Sandy, a disaster that disproportionately impacted people of color in my community, it wasn’t hard to draw the connection between the systemic injustice highlighted in BLM and the climate crisis. Just as police, our supposed protectors, perpetuate violence on black bodies because of the color of their skin, our federal government is perpetrating violence on these same bodies through its policies that create and maintain our nation’s fossil fuel-based energy system and cause catastrophic climate change. As I dug deeper into this issue, I found that climate change has long been impacting marginalized demographics around the country and the world. People of color, indigenous communities, low-income communities and young people face a significantly higher risk of experiencing the impacts of climate change than the general populace and young people from marginalized demographics are especially vulnerable. One thing that is clear to me now is that the climate crisis is a social justice issue – and is having a profound impact on my life and my identity. What’s worse is that the executive branch of the United States government – a government, that, in theory, was created to protect us – has known that burning fossil fuels will cause climate chaos for more than 50 years. Instead of working to curb emissions, it has colluded with corporate interests – actively enshrining the fossil fuel energy system into our nation’s policies. Because of the actions taken by the United States government and the fossil fuel industry, my generation has never known a world free from the impacts of climate change. We must find new ways to fight by listening to the stories of our ancestors There is a lesson to be learned from my ancestors. No matter the adversity that we face, we must organize our communities against the systemic injustices driving climate change, or disappear altogether. We must find new ways to fight by listening to the stories of our ancestors. By looking back at the story of my people, of people all over this planet, tribes and communities who knew they had to do anything in their power to avoid losing everything. This decade is our last chance to stop the destruction of our people and our planet. This is our time to hold our government accountable for the actions it has taken, and continues to take, to perpetuate the climate crisis and to stand in solidarity with communities around the country and the world in our fight for a just future. This is why I will join millions in the street on 20 September for the Global Climate Strike. We have no choice but to act when the alternative is to sit and watch our world burn. We have no choice but to act when the alternative is extinction. Vic Barrett is a plaintiff with Juliana v United States"
"A hoax photo that claims to show rubbish left behind by Australian climate strike protesters is circulating on Facebook, despite being revealed as fake months ago. Though it lacks any verification, and was debunked in April, the image and false caption have been shared 19,000 times in 12 hours, and thousands of times from copycats. On Friday, an estimated 300,000 Australians, and millions of people around the world, took part in protests against inaction on the climate emergency. Hours later, an Australian pro-coal page reposted the photo, which originated in April. It was captioned: “Look at the mess today’s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park.” However, the photo is not from a climate strike, not from Friday and was not taken in Australia. It is from a marijuana-based festival called 420 held in London in April 2019. In Sydney, there was no climate strike held in Hyde Park on Friday. Nor was there in London, where the event was held outside the Houses of Parliament. Viral misinformation doing rounds. This pic is from an event in Hyde Park, London in April unrelated to climate protests. https://t.co/Ro1fcFLcyS pic.twitter.com/G5aaKLiDzd London’s Royal Parks authority had already addressed the hoax back in April. There's a lot of incorrect information doing the Twitter rounds this morning. This photo is the result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday, not the #ExtinctionRebellion protestors in Marble Arch.It costs us millions to clear #litter every year. Please take it home. pic.twitter.com/F1JtAqmnVO According to the fact-checking site Snopes, the London marijuana event was held next to an Extinction Rebellion protest. The photo does show London’s Hyde Park but the rubbish was created by the 420 attendees, not climate protesters. According to organisers, Extinction Rebellion protesters helped clean up the mess made at the 420 event. Snopes says the confusion began due to ambiguous wording from a Facebook page THTC (The Hemp Trading Company) that was trying to shame 420 attendees to clean up. “This is #HydePark after #420,” it said. “Ashamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn’t be bothered to clean up after yourselves…#cannabiscommunity you can do better – you need to do better. After the misinformation began to spread, the THTC page clarified later, posting: “IMPORTANT EDIT: a lot of people are misreading this post. This was the aftermath of Hyde Park 420 – and was *cleaned up* by Extinction Rebellion crew.” This is from a totally separate event that took place in Hyde park. #ExtinctionRebellion activists went to help tidy up anyway because it grossed us out as much as it does you. In the UK on Friday, more than 300,000 people attended more than 200 events, making it the biggest environmental protest the UK had seen. An estimated 300,000 people also turned out in Australia, with at least 100,000 in Melbourne and 80,000 in The Domain in Sydney – not Hyde Park."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a clip I missed -broadcast late last year by German ARD television in a news show called Report MÜNCHEN (Report Munich). H/T to Rudolf Kipp, who commented at another blog. See video in German:
Report München on biofuels
It’s yet another glittering jewel of an example of the destruction wreaked by the AGW cult movement. It’s scorched earth policy to save the planet. Meanwhile cult leaders are profiting as the world gets burned. The clip description:
Indonesia: Instead of rainforests, more and more palm oil plantations. Palm oil for our kitchens, cosmetics and biofuels. Report MÜNCHEN shows the latest pictures from Borneo and the ecological catastrophe taking place there. A devastating climate result is the bottom line. Yet parts of the EU-Commission obviously wants to cover this up.”
Biofuel deforestation produces 20% of CO2 emissions
It’s the destruction of the rainforest in the name of climate protection. Clearing the land to make way for palm oil plantations. Prof. Jürgen Schmid of the Fraunhofer IWES Institute:
“We have recommended the German government to completely stop its support of bio-fuels.
The ARD calls the clearing of forests in Asia:
An ecological catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions.”
Unfortunately, huge areas of jungle have already been completely cleared so that palm trees can produce a relatively minuscule amount of biofuel to burn in Europe. Burning the biofuels will reduce CO2 emissions a tiny bit. But this is all offset, and then far far exceeded, by the CO2 that is released from the large-scale deforestation. Prof. Florian Siegert, University of Munich:
It is estmiated that the deforestation causes 20% of the total CO2 emissions on the planet.”
Producing 20% of the CO2 emissions to save a few tenths. A proud result of the destructive AGW cult movement. What do the EU leaders have to say? They are covering this up. Report Munich received classified documents showing that EU bureacrats suppressed this information and kept it out of the public’s view. In an e-mail:

Hypothetical values from an indirect land use change should be removed from the texts.”
Sustainability swindle
EU guidelines do state that primary forests may not be cleared to make biodiesel starting in 2012. But Report Munich calls this labelling fraud. Deforestation of primary forests is not restricted when it comes to clearing primary forests for palm oil for the food industry, and as a result, only a shift on paper takes place. That means rainforests may be cleared away also in the future for palm oil for food. On the old plantations, palm oil for biofuels will move in. Now you see it, now you don’t.
That’s how EU bureaucrats are saving the planet from the climate catastrophe. ARD TV calls it “greenwashing”. Prof. Jürgen Schmid calls it:
Sustainability Swindle”
The Fraunhofer Institute presented their urgent warnings to the EU. But the devastating results were simply deleted in reports – whitewashed. The final report on biofuels was only 10 pages long, and there was no mention of the rainforest devastation caused by the EU’s biofuel policy. Infuriated by the EU, the Fraunhofer Institute added their disclaimer to the report:
The final presentation of the results do not reflect the views of the Fraunhofer ISI.”
When confronted by journalists, EU leaders were quick to duck the brutal reality and busied themselves giving sustainability awards to corporations like Mercedes Benz for building bio-fuel cars. Meanwhile, the German government is even now ignoring the recommendations of its own scientific advisory board, and intends to go ahead in boosting the use of biofuels by the year 2050.
Says Prof Jürgen Schmid:
The German government’s target is to boost bio fuels share as a fuel to 90%. That is madness.”
But destructive cults are mad. And that’s the way the green movement is going ahead. That’s how to save the planet: Just burn it!
The video report was produced by Thomas Kiessling, Mike Lingenfelser (29 Nov 2010).

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s an example of what dissenting opinions have to face here in what was once called the land of poets and thinkers. (In climate science Germany is more the land of dogmatists and intolerants, unfortunately. But as I’ve said, that’s slowly changing).
Yesterday I posted a piece “Climate Science” Now Questioned At German Universities about Professor Dr Werner Kirstein of the University of Leipzig and a seminar he held last June called “Where Is The Climate Change?”
Taking apart “climate science” is not a real achievement in itself. The science has been crumbling rapidly for quite some time now. Dr Kirstein’s real achievement in this story is, however, daring to speak up against the climate science religion. To do so in Germany, one has to expect multiple character assassination attempts. Georg Hoffmann attempts just that, ridiculing not only Dr Kirstein, but the University of Leipzig as well.
Kirstein’s seminar at the University of Leipzig did indeed upset the climate clergy, not surprisingly, and so they have sent out an underling, Georg Hoffmann, to attack, ridicule and attempt to slap down Kirstein and the University of Leipzig, and it should all serve as a reminder to anyone else who might dare to speak up. Hoffmann wrote his hit piece yesterday at his blog site. The title in English:
Climate Hack Of September 2010 – Professor Kirstein And the University of Leipzig.
The highly acclaimed Climate Hack Of The Month Award for September 2010 goes to Professor Kirstein and his employer, the University of Leipzig. The claim made by Kirstein that “Greenland was mostly ice-free during the Middle Ages” belongs to the Top Ten of probably the most senseless statements ever made on the subject of climate change. Congratulations from the jury.

Here we have a person childishly ridiculing a distinguished professor and an entire university. Seldom do we witness such hubris in Europe, except of course in “climate science”. This is precisely what “climate science” dissenters have to deal with regulary. And such attacks are generously funded by European governments.
I watched the entire Kirstein presentation, and everyone knows what he meant with Greenland. Hoffmann is simply hiding behind his computer in Paris, or wherever, and attacking from the safety of his hinterhalt, like a true coward. He nitpicks and takes things out of context. Of course he cherry-picks his data at every opportunity, and applies post-normal science throughout.
Yet, we all know that if called out to debate face to face in public, people like Hoffmann are the last to show up. Open debate for post-normal scientists is foreign, and it has proven to be nothing but disastrous in the past.
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9082151
Before the debate
GW is a crisis:   Yes 57%  No 29%
After the debate
GW is a crisis:   Yes 42%  No 44%
Those were results at a time when belief in the climate religion was at its zenith. Today doubt is much higher. So expect more cheap shots to come out from the hinterhalts.

"Hundreds of thousands of Australians took to the streets on Friday as they called for greater action on the climate emergency in more than 100 cities and towns across the country. Organisers of the school strike for climate claimed about 300,000 people attended dozens of rallies, including an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne and 80,000 in Sydney. The unprecedented climate crisis protests were likely the largest public demonstrations in Australia since the marches against the Iraq War in 2003.  “I fight for climate justice because everyone deserves a safe future,” 17-year-old student Niamh told a crowd that spilled out of a Melbourne park and into the city streets. “The government is not supporting it yet, but together we will change that.” Sparked by the first climate striking student, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, the protests have grown into a global movement. In Australia, they have garnered support from the wider environmental movement, but also from other non-profits and charities, unions and some businesses. Friday’s crowds doubled the size of the student strikes in March, organisers said. Protesters ranging in age from toddlers to the elderly chanted slogans such as “we are not drowning, we are fighting,” and held up signs and placards. Many were personally critical of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who is currently in the US to visit Donald Trump. Morrison drew criticism this week after confirming he would not attend the United Nations Emergency Climate Summit in New York. In Sydney and Melbourne, there were long lines to enter the rallies, which brought parts of both cities to a halt. Throngs of students, families, mums with strollers, officer workers and unionists filled Sydney’s Domain to hear from protest organisers, Indigenous students, Pasifika activists, and union leaders. Pacific climate warriors: “I have a right to set foot on my islands... to see its beauty and everything it has to give. My generation and generations to come have a right to stand on the same soil our ancestors did.”#ClimateStrike #sydney pic.twitter.com/b6asT8WDL1 Moemoana, 18, had come from Wollongong to the protest, and her homeland is Samoa. “I’ve come to fight for the Pacific,” she told Guardian Australia in the crowd. “Seas are rising and it’s affecting Pacific Islands, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, it’s a real threat and Australia needs to know that Pasifika are neighbours and Australia really needs to help out.” Marlie Thomas, a Kamilaroi high school student from Gunnedah, said she was attending the rally on the authority of her elders, not the department of education. “I’ve had to help collect bottled water for our family in Walgett,” she said, about the western NSW town which has run out of water after rivers dried up. Oscar interviews Zac who is losing his voice after leading the crowds in chants at the Brisbane #ClimateStrike. “It’s so great, chanting with all the other people for what we think is right”. pic.twitter.com/79pa58MUPH About 35,000 people attended a protest in Brisbane. Across Queensland, climate strikes had a very direct local message to match the ambitious global demands of protesters: a stop to the Adani Carmichael coalmine and action to save the Great Barrier Reef. Large crowds turned up in places torn between coal basins and the Queensland coast in places like Mackay and Townsville, which have mineworkers’ jobs and a tourist industry at stake. “We strike because our future is in their hands,” said Brisbane year 12 student Morgan. “Our very existence sits precariously on the shoulders of politicians who care more about whether almond milk can be called milk than they do about climate change.” Esther Plummer (13 years old) interviews fellow climate strikerJasper (15 years old) about why he is attending the #ClimateStrike in Byron Bay. pic.twitter.com/YTrFpOJrC3 In Melbourne, where the protests coincided with the last day of the school term, the rally packed out Treasury Gardens and spilled onto Spring Street, where the state’s parliament sits. “I feel like there isn’t going to be very much of a future, or if there is, it will be very short unless we do something,” said Michaela Pam, 15, who took the day off school to attend. But the Coburg High School student told Guardian Australia of the large crowds: “It makes me feel really happy. You get a little bit of hope.” Some Coburg High students. The school said they could come if their parents let them. #climatestrike pic.twitter.com/uHmoydLa0z Melbourne school strikers #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/wtLI8WcoCV Melbourne organisers Niamh and Freya, 16, told the crowd the protesters did not blame those who worked in the fossil fuel industry for the climate crisis. “We understand the role fossil fuels have played in putting food on the table for families,” said Freya. “It’s vital we all work together, not against one another. It’s not about jobs versus the environment.” Large numbers also gathered in Australia’s other major cities. Organisers estimated about 15,000 attended a strike in the capital, Canberra, while there were about 10,000 people at rallies in both Perth and Adelaide. Organisers in Tasmania said 22,000 people attended an event in Hobart. Bob Brown, a former leader of the Greens and a giant of the environmental movement, said the crowds were larger than those during protests against the Franklin Dam in the 1980s. Students and protesters also gathered in smaller centres, from the beaches of Byron Bay on Australia’s east coast to the outback towns of Alice Springs and Katherine. In the Queensland town of Chinchilla, a lone striker, Ariel Ehlers, 12, staged her own strike. Organisations striking included 33 Australian unions, 2,500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, Domain and Intrepid, and faith institutions including the Anglican Church and Uniting Church, organisers said. Universities said they would not penalise students who missed classes to attend, while the Uniting Church synod for NSW and the ACT also allowed their students to strike. Catholic and Anglican church-run schools as well as NSW public schools said students should remain in class. The acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the rallies should have been held on a weekend so they didn’t disrupt businesses, schools and universities."

This from Reuters: Exclusive: Sierra Club sues over California solar plant. Hat tip: DirkH.
These guys don’t even know what they want. They’re against everything – and now even the things they once said would save the planet – like windmills, solar panels and crops for bio-diesel.
The report starts as follows (emphasis added):
A leading environmental advocacy group is suing the state of California’s Energy Commission over its approval of a giant solar plant, underscoring the growing challenge to the nation’s renewable-energy goals from within the environmental community.”
I suspect it’s because they have come to learn that these things are in reality ugly, dangerous, inefficient, expensive, and will end up doing real damage to wildlife, environment and landscape.
Now all we have to do is to get them to realize that CO2 is nowhere near as bad as they think, and that it actually makes the planet greener. That’ll take probably another 10 years to do, or a full-blown ice age.
Not only environmentalists are protesting the construction of solar plants, but regular folks and landowners have already had real success. Reuters:
In December, the Quechan Indian tribe won an injunction blocking construction of the Imperial Valley solar project, under development near California’s border with Mexico by NTR’s Tessera Solar.
The Calico plant was also under development by Tessera until the company sold the plant last month to K Road Sun, a subsidiary of New York investment firm K Road Power. Tessera has been struggling to find funding for its plants, which cost about $2 billion.
With the huge areas of land needed and overall opposition, it’s getting more and more difficult to find investors. These projects are turning into hot potatoes.

"Angela Merkel’s government has promised more than half a billion euros to revitalise the country’s crisis-hit forests in the fight against climate change. A third of Germany’s landmass is covered in woodland, and forests play an important role in the country’s national folklore, from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to the poems of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  But a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 250,000 football fields, forcing the government to convene an emergency “forest summit”, held on Wednesday in Berlin. “Every missing tree is a missing comrade-in-arms against climate change,” agriculture minister Julia Klöckner said ahead of the gathering of around 170 organisations representing both environmental groups and industry. “Whatever we don’t reforest today, our grandchildren will, of course, miss.” In the face of the numerous challenges, Germany’s federal government has announced making available €547mover the next four years to remove dead trees and plant new ones, with state contributions boosting the emergency fund to €800m. The defence minister and CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has pledged the military’s help with the effort. Woodland owners however insist their trees deserve better financial compensation for cleaning polluted air. Representatives of the country’s influential forestry industry – employing some 720,000 people, almost as many as the car sector – have already warned the funds won’t be enough to replace the forest that has been lost. Umbrella organisation AGDW, representing forest owners and forestry workers, has called for direct investments of €2.3bn, as well as a new tax on industrial pollution that would help to subsidise forests at €125 a year per hectare of forest. Trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO₂), and their leaves can trap the toxic pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone, and harmful microscopic particles produced by diesel vehicles, cooking and wood burning. According to AGDW, Germany’s forest currently compensates 14% of the country’s CO₂ emissions. “Those who pollute our environment with dirt have to pay for it, and those who receive the dirt should be financially compensated in turn”, forest owner Ferdinand Graf von Westerholt told broadcaster ZDF. “That’s the solution.” But even how the funds already made available can be used has become a divisive issue between landowner and environmentalists. The forestry industry proposes replanting areas of destroyed forest with some non-native species that are more suited to a drier and hotter climate, such as the Japanese larch, the North American Douglas fir or the northern red oak. Environmental groups warn this could have a devastating impact on local wildlife, which could struggle to adapt to the new environment. Hubert Weiger, chair of the German branch of Friends of the Earth said cash should be injected on “public money for public services” principle: “Taxpayers’ money should only be spent to build up natural broad-leaved deciduous forests made up of native species”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAntarctic sea ice simply refuses to melt, and stubbornly remains at a very high level. In fact in 2010 it reached its second highest level ever since satellite measurement began over 30 years ago. Normally Antarctic sea ice peaks at about 18.3 million sq km around September 20.
But this year, Antarctic sea ice reached that value already on about August 9 or so – over 5 weeks early! I’m using the graphic below to draw up these statements.
Stubborn Antarctic sea ice refuses to melt. 
In 2010 Antarctic sea ice remained at or above the normal high peak (18.3 million sq km) for well over 2 months, from early August until late October. That’s quite awhile for the ice to hang around. I bet lots of penguins are happy about this.
Granted I haven’t gone back and taken a look at the stats over the years, but I doubt you’ll find very many years where this has happened. So you just have to laugh when physicists impostoring as climate scientists tell you the Antarctic is in trouble. 
Fact is, it’s the climate scientist impostors who are in trouble, as we expose day by day. Don’t be surprised if soon another model or paper comes out claiming global warming is causing more ice! Read here. Call it desperate pre-emptive damage control on their part.
Global sea ice
Overall global sea ice was steady until about 2004, then declined for a few short years. Since 2007 it has been trending upwards. We’re at where we were about 20 years ago.
Total global sea ice is trending a recovery. 
Many are now predicting a recovering Arctic over the next couple of years, like Joe Bastardi. With no further ice melt, the peculiar absence of tropical storms, and bitter winters returning, it all means alarmists will have to be content with the meager pickings of isolated heat waves, floods or droughts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman sporting and dog magazine Wild und Hund reports that thousands of domestic and wild animals are falling ill from tainted waste from green “climate-friendly” biogas plants, which is then used as an agricultural fertilizer in fields.
Hat tip: Dirk Maxeiner here (in a commentary titled: “Gross negligence in green”).
Wild und Hund has put out a press release announcing a report appearing in its latest issue, now available at news stands today. The Wild und Hund press release reads as follows (slight editing added for international readers):
DEATH FROM THE BIOGAS PLANT – CHRONIC BOTULISM
There’s been a terrible suspicion for years. The residue from biogas plants that produce “clean” green electricity is causing a deadly disease among domestic and wild animals, and humans – chronic botulism.
Wild und Hund not only examines the disease, but also looks into the background as to why such a hazard has not been publicly discussed for 10 years. In the aftermath of Fukushima, the public wishes to shift to renewable energy sources. Today in Germany already over a million acres of land are producing corn for biogas plants. German Agriculture Minister Ms Ilse Aigner announced on 27 April 2011 that land used for growing plants for producing energy will be significantly expanded to an area anywhere between 4 to 6 million acres. Today biogas plants are sprouting everywhere in the countryside.
However, the supposedly environmentally friendly supply of energy is likely hiding a lethal bacteria in its waste. Christoph Boll of the hunting magazine WILD UND HUND has investigated the disease, whose existence has been denied by the industry, and whose impact on wildlife could be catastrophic to wildlife. In the German region of Vogtland in Saxony, 600 cows and the farmer himself fell seriously ill. Diagnosis: chronic botulism. And that was no isolated incident says Professor Dr. Helge Böhnel of the University of Göttingen. The scientist reveals that the number of sick animals observed runs to 4-digit numbers. Dr Böhnel is convinced that chronic and visceral botulism could impact all birds and mammals  – including humans.
In general botulism is a lethal type of poisoning. But chronic botulism can also stealthily drag on in small quantities for years. Dr. Böhnel believes that biogas plants are “very likely” the source. How is it caused exactly? In early spring when harvesting biomass plants, foremost green rye, young wildlife end up getting minced by harvesters and end up as an ingredient in the biogas plant brew. In a addition slaughterhouse waste and other meat, such as old hens, along with manure slurry, get thrown in as raw material. At a brewing temperature of 40°C, bacteria multiply with abandon, which in turn leads to the production of enormously resistant botulinum spores that survive the hygienisation process (heating to 70°C). The waste material that is left at the end of the biogas process then gets used as fertilizer for agriculture, and so the spores wind up spread all over the landscape where they get ingested by grazing animals (domestic livetsock, wildlife, birds, etc.). Once in the digestive tract they then convert into the bacteria that produce the deadly toxin. Often the amount of toxin is not sufficient for a quick death, rather the poisoning is slow and chronic.”
So add another to the list of wonderful things delivered by the green revolution, which already includes a mercury contaminated environment from energy saving lights, birds getting shredded by windparks that have devastated the local landscape, biofuels that drive up the price of food and so lead to hunger for millions more, etc.

Finally, I wonder if they use this all-natural fertilizer from the “clean” biogas plants as a fertiliser for the organic food farms?

Cause of the suffering and dead cows: chronic botulism. Worse! The infected cattle shown that are still alive are being slaughtered and sold as fresh meat to supermarkets! The moderators says:
“The state veterinary officials say chronic botulism does not warrant the cattle be stopped from being slaughtered. ‘For the delivery of cattle for slaughter…there are no restrictions.’ “
and
Experts say up to 1000 farms may be affected – thousands of dead animals are the result.”
In the meantime, the infected cattle are being sent to slaughterhouses, and the meat to the supermarkets. The German health officials don’t want to hear about it, the report says. The Green movement keeps moving. This is a scandal.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLevermann claims La Nina is warm. (Photo credit: PIK)
The usual German media outlets today feature the usual scientists who are out in force spreading the dreck science that global warming is leading to more weather extremes, and La Ninas.
These “scientists” are from the usual source: the alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).  Amazingly, one of these scientists even claims that the current La Nina is warm, and caused by global warming. 
The interviews come on the heels of Der Spiegel’s report late last week on a paper appearing in Science that shows just the opposite has been true in history: Warming leads to milder climates, which lead to human prosperity.
German Stern magazine did an interview with PIK scientist Anders Levermann, who is a lead author on the IPCC 5th Assessment Report on the subject of sea level.  Here’s his comment on the media-ballyhooed weather extremes we’ve been hearing about:
Certain is: In a rapidly warming world, we will experience more frequent stronger extreme weather events like flooding, droughts and high winds.”
Everything is caused by global warming – even the “record snowfalls in Germany”. Other than sci-fi reports from reinsurer Munich Re, I have yet to see one scientific report that links these weather events to global warming. In fact Accumulated Cyclone Energy last year reached a record low.
On the Australian floods, Levermann attributes them to warm waters around Australia, in combination with the current La Nina, which he says:
Together with the La Niña climate phenomena, which provides a warming of natural origin, the warmer water temperatures lead to the worst rainfalls in a 100 years. The higher ocean temperatures in turn are very likely a consequence of global warming.”
[Update: To be fair, Levermann here most likely meant: The higher ocean temperatures near Australia (and not the Pacific in general) in turn are very likely a consequence of global warming. I guess he wants to say the La Nina pushed the warm water to Australia, and this water is warmer than usual because of warming. The statement he makes above  is very misleading, to say the least].
On weather extremes in Germany this winter, Levermann serves up this observation (fantasy):

In any case one has to say that the snowfall of last winter was unusual. Also this winter was a record winter when compared with the past 100 years. Such 100-year records are tumbling one after the other, and it’s going to happen even more often in the future.”
Rahmstorf says there’s a connection (but he doesn’t see it yet)
The online Handlesblatt also features an interview with PIK Prince of Panic Stefan Rahmstorf about the same weather extremes. The Handelsblatt asks Rahmstorf if it is connected to global warming:
The planet is getting hotter and wetter. 2010, together with 2005, was the warmest year since measurements began, and it was also the one with the most precipitation. Also the increase in devastating floods can be explained by global warming says Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).”
Stefan Rahmstorf (Photo: PIK)
Everything today can be attributed to global warming. The theory is unfalsifiable. If it happens, it’s because of global warming. Anf if it doesn’t happen (droughts), that too is because of global warming.
The Handelsblatt then asks Rahmstorf if the floods in Australia and Brazil are not the results of the La Nina? Here’s Rahmstorf’s reply:
Of course these events are, in the forefront, traced back to La Niña. But the change between El Niño and La Niña is a cyclic phenomena occurring every three to seven years. But that does not explain why this year records which have stood for 100 years  have been broken. There are experts who believe that the fluctuations between El Niño and La Niña are more severe. Right now we are having an Extreme-La-Niña. In 1998 we had the most extreme El Niño.”
His colleague Levermann suggests it’s because of global warming. Note that Rahmstorf cites some experts who say so. But what does Rahmstorf himself believe? Handelsblatt:
 But I do believe that it’s still too early to robustly show there is indeed a change.”
This has been typical of Rahmstorf and PIK lately, having it both ways. Notice how he starts by claiming that the extremes are due to global warming, and that the ENSOs are getting more extreme too. But then he says he can’t robustly show a connection between global warming and ENSO extremes. It’s there, it just can’t be shown.
Just another day at the PIK. Doing all it can to link everything to global warming.

It’s the latest for teaching German kids the end of the world is coming, unless…!

It’s the year 2500 and what’s left of mankind is on the verge of absolute extinction. Climate change has taken its toll. The planet in no longer hospitable. The few people left live in caves and tunnels. What’s left of the protective ozone layer is about to get wiped out by a solar storm.
It’s the climate meltdown, and we’re right in the middle of it!
Their time is running out, as shown at the 0:54 mark, where a sort of Mann’s hockey stick is used to illustrate this. Something has to be done!
So a group of courageous heroes find a rickety time machine and decide to risk it all to try and go back in time in an attempt to avert the man-made climate catastrophe. Only hero Fay makes it through the time machine and lands in the year 2050.

There she tries to convince the people of what they are doing to the planet – but damn those sceptics and deniers.
San Francisco under water? Tornadoes in Europe?
Finally, Fay end up meeting cranky climate scientist Bent Svensson and begs him to continue his research on his clean fuel, which he has abandoned because his wife died. Can Fay convince Dr Svensson and save the planet?
Now only you can rescue the planet!
This computer game is sure to provide kids with hours of entertainment and education on living responsibly.
Actually, I’m a bit surprised that the end of the world has once again been pushed back 490 years. Al Gore said it would come in 10 years and Prince Charles said 2 years. Now it keeps getting postponed and we have to wait half a millenium.
If Fay had been clever she would have gone back to at least  2000 and disposed of the “deniers” and the HadCrut hacker (if only we knew who he or she was). 2050 seems awfully late. I’d would interpret that as having at least 40 more years to think about the problem. What’s the rush?
Two thumbs down.

"Jainey Bavishi is all business as she takes off from Battery Park to walk the perimeter of lower Manhattan. It’s a muggy afternoon, a breeze barely lifting off of the New York Harbor, after days of heavy rain. She maneuvers throngs of tourists, construction workers and suits streaming out of office towers for lunch as she walks north from the waterfront park toward the Brooklyn Bridge. In a skirt suit and flats, Bavishi fits in among lower Manhattan’s workday hustle. But there’s no one else with a job like hers: director of the New York City’s mayor’s office of resiliency. She is the woman tasked with protecting all 580 miles of New York City shoreline from more frequent and extreme storms and expected sea rise due to the climate crisis. “We have got a chance to really reimagine the waterfront,” she says, heading underneath FDR Drive past interim flood barriers erected by the city following Hurricane Sandy. There’s an air of promise and forward-thinking in her stride. “I think that’s really exciting,” she exhales. This walk with Bavishi is, in fact, an exercise in imagining: in March, the mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced an ambitious $10bn proposal to extend Manhattan’s southern coastline into the East River as far as 500ft. Bavishi’s walk from Battery Park almost to the Brooklyn Bridge is the roughly one-mile span proposed for expansion. It includes the financial district, sparkling residential towers and the luxury mixed-use community Battery Park City, where a one-bedroom condo is about $1m. Twelve miles north, in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, the waterfront outlines a much different scene. A stench rises from the sidewalks in the summer heat, open garages reveal heaps of auto body parts and cyclists swerve between box trucks that dominate the streets. About 13,000 people live in ageing apartment buildings at the center of this peninsula, lined on either site by heavily industrialized waterfront. Hunts Point residents and activists fought for years to increase access to the waterfront as well as address longstanding environmental issues. More recently they have engaged with the mayor’s office of resiliency, formed in 2014 to oversee New York City’s $20bn portfolio of programs to make the city more resilient to the climate crisis. In Hunts Point, residents reimagined a waterfront that addressed longstanding environmental injustices and poverty that persists in the area. The Hunts Point community spent five years developing a  plan for protective waterfront infrastructure doubling as public green space, a “Levee Lab” to study resiliency efforts and create local jobs, and a tri-generation plant creating low-carbon cooling and a micro-grid to supply backup power in emergencies. But around the same time de Blasio introduced his $10bn proposal, the office of resiliency decided it would not fund that plan, due to high cost and because Hunts Points residents do not live in the floodplain. That decision hit this community hard, one of several in New York City finding it can’t face a future of climate change without quality of life issues being addressed first. In preparing for its future, the city would have to confront injustices of its past, and some environmental activists fear the city is not up to the task. The mayor’s office of resiliency set a goal for holistic resiliency planning across the five boroughs, but there’s a lingering question: how does the city enforce waterfront protection for all, when some of it is home to billions of dollars of real estate, infrastructure and investment, and elsewhere it has been neglected for decades? As the climate crisis promises to lay bare the stark disparities of New York City, the answer has never been more pressing. ••• For the past five years, the environmental activist Angela Tovar has posted flyers, maps, renderings, artwork and a rally poster that reads “Pollution Isn’t the Solution” all over the South Bronx Community Resiliency Agenda Lab at the cavernous Hunts Point community hub called the Point. As director of community development at the lab, Tovar is constantly hustling about, running late today because a discussion about the Point’s community-led resiliency plan with the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ran long. “Our work on climate justice started a long time ago,” she says. “And it came from an understanding that there are a high volume of toxic substances in this area, which is also vulnerable to storm surge.” Tovar points to a large map with about 20 red dots marking the peninsula’s waterfront – they represent businesses with high volumes of toxic substances. She identifies the residential blocks between the waterfront as an “environmental justice community where about half the community lives below the poverty line, and there are really serious public health issues we know will be compounded by climate change.” Tovar then points to a chunk of the peninsula, the entire north-eastern half, occupied by the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, which spans 60 acres and supplies food to the entire north-eastern corridor. “Not only are we talking about a potential threat of storm surge hitting an environmental justice community, and hitting businesses with toxic chemicals, we are talking about how that would impact the food distribution center,” she says. Hurricane Sandy prompted the office of resiliency to focus its attention on protecting the food distribution center. Meanwhile, community organizers like Tovar had already been advocating for the city to also take stock of the poverty, isolation and longstanding environmental injustices across the peninsula. The office of resiliency ultimately decided to focus on strengthening buildings inside the food distribution center instead of moving ahead on a comprehensive waterfront resiliency plan. (Bavishi says the decision was made because the Hunts Point’s residential community is not located in the floodplain.) Her voice strains and head shakes recalling how that news came around the same time de Blasio announced his $10bn investment in building new land in lower Manhattan. “It felt like a tremendous slap in the face, to be honest,” she says. Tovar acknowledges that the $10bn is far from secured, but points out the South Bronx lacks even a promise of funding. “All we’re saying is make that same commitment to the most vulnerable communities in New York City,” she says. “Get up on stage, make that commitment and say: ‘Low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately burdened by climate change.’” Local activists have moved ahead on smaller projects with more modest amounts of city funding, such as launching a community wifi network resistant to power and internet outages. The Point also runs the Be a Buddy program, which is building a network of local volunteers who learn how to provide resources, aid and immediate support during climate emergencies like heatwaves or storms. “We just have to continue to move on our own,” Tovar says, with a hint of defeat in her voice. ••• In another borough on another waterfront, another underserved community has come up with their own program to train residents to help one another. It’s called Local Leaders and is a 10-week emergency preparedness training run by the not-for-profit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) out of a converted warehouse a few blocks from the Gowanus Expressway, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Unlike the South Bronx, Hurricane Sandy devastated Red Hook, transforming RHI into de facto recovery headquarters. The thousands of residents seeking help were primarily public housing residents – this neighborhood has the second highest concentration in the city. Red Hook embodies perhaps the greatest challenge facing New York as it braces for the climate crisis: nearly one-fifth of all housing units within New York’s floodplain are public housing, and the city’s public housing agency struggles to provide even basic services to residents. Tevina Willis moved into the sprawling public housing complex about a decade ago. During Sandy, she and her neighbors ran up and down stairs, hauling water and spreading information about available resources. She was one of the first graduates of Local Leaders after RHI initiated it in 2013 to empower residents with emergency preparedness tactics such as CPR and conflict resolution; now she facilitates incoming groups. “Local Leaders further connected me to my neighbors,” Willis says, “And it took off from there.” During an August block party hosted by RHI, a conversation with Willis about resiliency kept returning to housing. “Our electricity constantly goes out, every other day there’s an electrical fire in someone’s apartment,” she details over pop and rap music blasting from the DJ booth. “A lot of our tenants experience gas outages.” She points to a resident who recently went without gas for six months. Willis is helping spearhead the next phase for trained Local Leaders: “a social justice and community organizing campaign to fight for policy change” with a focus on improving public housing. “We need resiliency inside our apartments,” she says. On a quieter day, RHI’s chief strategy officer, Javier Lopez, spoke about the larger resiliency vision for the neighborhood. While the city has installed some interim flood protections since Sandy, a larger plan to install floodwalls, raise streets and improve drainage to protect housing has yet to be implemented. Like Willis, Lopez struggles to reconcile the planning process with glaring needs of public housing residents. “It’s hard to project the future when the present hasn’t been addressed,” he says. He spoke of a divide between low-income, marginalized residents and the scientific, architectural and urban planning community advancing resiliency plans. “Sometimes we walk into these meetings and the architects and scientists are coming in at a 10, and we’re at a two,” he says. “No one from the resiliency world has had the awareness to take into account that neighborhoods have faced structural racism and various forms of disinvestment,” he continues. “There are voices missing, there are areas of concern, there hasn’t been a restoration of what was lost since Sandy.” ••• Along our lower Manhattan walk, and again in a quick telephone conversation, I ask Bavishi how she weighs the needs of different waterfront communities in resiliency planning. “An incredible amount of community engagement,” she says. “Our goal is to be thoughtful and inclusive, recognizing there is no silver bullet and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We have to work with communities to figure out the right solutions for particular neighborhoods.” She points to an inter-agency plan developed in Edgemere, in Rockaway, Queens. Edgemere has been called one of the most neglected neighborhoods in New York City and is particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because it’s sandwiched between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. During Sandy, flooding from both waterfronts – one lined with a defunct landfill, the other a city-owned wasteland – debilitated the neighborhood. “We were able to engage communities in thinking holistically about what would make their neighborhood more resilient,” Bavishi says. The resulting plan includes buying hurricane-destroyed houses to turn into parks, transit upgrades, raising homes and the shoreline, building a new mixed-use complex and improving the public housing lining the bay. Sonia Moise watched the calm waters of the bay meet the fierce waves of the ocean from her bedroom window in Edgemere the night of Sandy. The promise of Edgemere as a more resilient neighborhood is overshadowed by her seven-year struggle to recover from that day. “There’s no amount of people who complain like we do about [recovery] work not being done the right way,” she says. “I honestly believe we were treated the absolute worst because of location.” Outside of her three-story home hoisted atop a slab of concrete, she mentioned how long it took to grow backyard grass because the property was built atop rocks and sand. This spring she wrapped a stormproofing renovation, funded by her savings as well as the city’s post-Sandy rebuilding program, Build it Back. But the saga isn’t over: she recently hired a lawyer to dispute the quality of work from Build it Back, which she feels will not sufficiently protect her from the next storm. “We need to feel we’re safe,” she says of her community’s lingering trauma recovering from Sandy. But there’s a larger threat beyond the next storm: Edgemere will be one of the first New York neighborhoods made uninhabitable by the climate crisis. There’s already a division emerging on Moise’s block: homes with raised elevation – like her own – and those still at ground level. “The people who haven’t raised their houses know they won’t be able to stay,” she says. The city offered to buy Moise’s property following Sandy, but she declined. “I don’t trust the city, that they’d give the money you want for your house,” she says. Would she consider selling if she knew she would get a fair payment? “Probably not,” she says, considering the grievances built up during the recovery process. “I have a disdain for the city.” So Moise will stay, as her neighborhood is both transformed by the climate crisis and the city’s efforts to protect it. On the cusp of such transformation, there’s a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere walking the streets – even a level of disbelief that Edgemere does, in fact, belong to the same city as lower Manhattan. ••• When de Blasio announced his ambitious proposal to expand lower Manhattan, he listed the reasons it was worth saving: home to a half-million jobs, 90,000 residents, the nexus of nearly all the city’s subway lines. He left out that the city and private sector have heavily invested in this neighborhood since the early 1700s, when it emerged as a financial hub, as other waterfronts became places to house poor New Yorkers, often alongside toxic industrial sites. Bavishi’s goal to holistically address it all is daunting, if not impossible. Funding sources to implement many of the city’s resiliency plans – including lower Manhattan’s – are uncertain. Implementation in neighborhoods such as Red Hook has taken longer than residents expected. Crucial city agencies such as the New York City housing authority, which oversees public housing along the floodplain, lack its own vision and funding for resiliency. And, as Tovar mentioned in the resiliency lab, De Blasio still has yet to get on a stage and acknowledge low-income communities are disproportionately burdened by the climate crisis. Bavishi ultimately acknowledges the office of resiliency does not have the capability to address all the longstanding concerns of marginalized communities. “There’s an urgency to climate challenges we’re facing and we want to take that seriously,” she tells me over the phone. “We also want to make sure we’re not raising expectations for other solutions that are out of sync with the resources we have.” So New York is left to see how its most vulnerable residents will survive as the city’s shorelines are transformed – when the ambitious resiliency plans fall through, when stormproofing can’t address day-to-day needs like safer housing. “Having an exciting, bold vision is not enough,” Tovar says of the Hunts Point resiliency plan, though she could be talking about the rest of the city. “I hope the city comes back to the table to think big and do something unprecedented, because we’re New York City. But how do we encourage them to do that?” • This article was updated on 21 September 2019 to clarify that on the Red Hook resiliency plan, while an early plan under a different mayor never panned out, the city says their newest plan is on time."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Joachim Schellnhuber, German architect of the masterplan, dubbed the Great Transformation, warned back in 2009 that unless the world heeds his message, 6 billion people would perish. This was reported in the New York Times here, which wrote: 
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if the buildup of greenhouse gases and its consequences pushed global temperatures 9 degrees Fahrenheit higher than today — well below the upper temperature range that scientists project could occur from global warming — Earth’s population would be devastated.
According to the New York Times, Schellnhuber also said at a plenary session at the international climate change conference in Copenhagen (emphasis added): 
“In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something –- namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people.”
What Angela Merkel’s climate advisor is saying is that there are billions of us too many on the planet and that more lebensraum is needed. He then adds:
What a triumph. On the other hand do we want this alternative? I think we can do much, much better.”

Even more bizarre, one year earlier in a Nov. 13th, 2008 interview with news television PHOENIX TV he reveals his thoughts on growing human prosperity and population, see this Youtube video link here:
The video text caption at the start reads:
Already with the current world population of 6.6 billion people, an overuse of resources is taking place. In the year 2050, 9.4 billion people will be living on the planet.”
Well that is simply too many and all very frightening for Schellnhuber. In the video he says with somber tones:
The earth likely will be populated by at least 9 billion people by 2050. You have to imagine that these people will reach an average level of consumption that Portugal has, one of the poorer countries in Europe. When you imagine that if all these 9 billion people claim all these resources, then the earth will explode.”
Of course Paul Ehrlich made similar absurd predictions 40 years ago, and the exact opposite happened. Ehrlich was exposed as a charlatan. So far all the model projections that his Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research have produced in the past have turned out to be all wrong.

This bet is also known as the Honeycutt Climate Bet for Charity, named after Rob Honeycutt who first proposed this bet. You can find the background info here.
The cool side takes an early lead!
Will the new 2011-2020 decade be warmer or cooler than the last one? The first month, January – 2011,  came in well below the 2001-2010 average. Call it a 3-pointer for the coolists – a message to the warmists! We’ve taken the early lead. And looking at the La Nina that’s taken hold, that early lead will certainly grow. Is it going to be a blowout?
It’s a long ballgame though – 119 more months! Here are the bets so far (I hope I haven’t left anyone off the list. If so, let me know and I’ll repost the table).
The cool side bets so far:

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it, Germany’s elitst leaders think that by righteously adopting positions of “protecting the climate” and the “responsible” use of energy, they’ll be able to assume the role as the world’s moral leaders.
The pious, like Chancellor Angela Merkel and all the leaders of all other parties, media, etc., all insist they have truly learned the lessons of history and are now ready to take on moral leadership of the world and exercise the authority to admonish the rest of the world for its wasteful energy use.
Almost daily does the German public hear of a new energy-savings plan announced by these annoyingly pious and wise leaders on how to be even more responsible, and demands to make even more energy sacrifices, e.g. like shutting down power plants, installing more solar and wind farms, eliminating light bulbs, imposing tougher auto emissions standards, mandating ethanol, regulating people’s fireplaces, plans to increase tax on energy, and even master plans for the great transformation of world society. The list is endless.
Readers here would think that Germany surely will soon be a carbon-free paradise, an island of nature and morality. Well, think again. According to the Swiss online ee-news, Germany’s primary energy consumption spiked 4.6%  in 2010 – due to the “economic rebound and cooler weather“. EE-News writes:
The higher energy consumption led to an increase in energy-dependent CO2 emissions. According to the calculations of the AG Energy Management,  there were very little changes in the energy mix as a whole and about two thirds of the energy increase came from carbon-based energy sources. The increase in energy-dependent CO2 emissions was at about 4%.”
While Germany’s leaders demand other countries reduce their carbon footprints and be more responsible with the use of energy, they have no qualms about their own growing consumption. Especially burning anthracite coal, which James Hansen compared to death trains, shot up 15.4%. The use of anthracite coal increased even much more than the “booming” renewable energies, which increased only a relatively weak 9.9%.
Yet, let’s not blame the average citizen’s desire to stay warm, and to work and use more energy to fill customer orders. I say be happy they are burning more and not less. German products are solutions that make other people’s lives easier all over the world. So hopefully Germans will consume even more in the future, and so continue producing more technology, machinery and solutions to fulfill human needs for comfort and dignity. Indeed, using more energy to help others is arguably a moral obligation.
Here are some of consumption increase statistics (%):
Petroleum: +1.3%
Natural gas: + 4.2%
Anthracite coal: + 15.4%
Brown coal: +0.2
Renewables: + 9.9%

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany's version of Stephen Schneider (Wikipedia)
I think some people are not aware of, or seriously underestimate, Germany’s contribution to this global warmist movement. It really isn’t scientific at all. It’s purely political. Science (junk science) is just one of the engines they use to propel it.
A reader brought my attention to an interview with Hartmut Grassl at the leftwing newspaper TAZ in Berlin. Grassl is one of the grand-daddies of the German global warming movement.
He was the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI), a member of the Enquête Commission, a main Kyoto Protocal player, director of climate research programs at the World Meteorological Organization, board member of the über-alarmist Munich Re re-insurer and also the Academy of Sciences in Hamburg. He’s kind of like the German version of Stephen Schneider.
Here’s how this seemingly distinguished individual views the growing scepticism (answers from the TAZ interview paraphrased).
On handling sceptics (paraphrased):
Have they ever published anything? In 99% of the cases, that’s already the end of the debate – their literature has nothing to do with science.
What motivates the sceptics (paraphrased)? 
Some get money from oil companies. Others are just people who are against everything. I used to try to convince them with scientific arguments, but it was hopeless. When I get e-mails from them they are highly aggressive and filled with exclamation points and sentences in block letters.
On Climategate (paraphrased)
They were released just before Copenhagen. They always get real loud before major conferences. In the USA the sceptics have been traditionally strong; a lot of money flows in part from the oil industry.
On storms and exaggerations (recall he is a board member at Munich Re!):

One also has to say that people who exaggerate climate change are not helpful. Some environmental organisations even claim that climate change leads to more storms.”
Are there any credible sceptics? (paraphrased)
Yes, but very few. Richard Lindzen from MIT in Boston for example: He doesn’t dispute CO2’s greenhouse gas, but doubts the feedback effects. The climate models have probably gotten better as a result of his critique. But, the debate over his objections is pretty much over.
On Henrik Svensmark
Also Svensmark has been refuted a number of times. But scientists are often unable to let go of worn out theories, especially their own.”
What about the geologists?
Of course there have been temperature rises of 4 to 5 °C over periods of 10,000 years. But today we are talking about a warming of  2 to 3°C within 100 years!
There you have it. Sounds like our reader Dana doesn’t he? I mean that in a friendly way. I really like his answer about Svensmark. It’s kind of like the black pot insisting the white porcelain vase is black.
And shall we add a few more exclamation marks to the last statement and put it in block letters as well? Which 100 years is he talking about anyway? The computer model-fantasy century?
Just for the record, so far in this observed century the temperature has risen 0°C. plus or minus a few hundredths.
Source: http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/rebuking-bs-with-more-bs/
Expected climate warming: +1.5 to +5.5°C.
This century’s trend so far:  – 0.2°C.
I think I’m going to post “This Century’s Trend So Far” every month.
But in the future I will not cheat. and use instead UAH and RSS, which below shows a slight warming of about 0.6°C per century, well below the IPCC scenarios.
So far this century, the temperature is showing a slight increase.

"Volunteers are being urged to do their bit to stop the climate emergency by grabbing a spade and signing up for the biggest mass tree-planting campaign in the UK’s history. Plots in suitable sites around the country are being prepared for 30 November, when the Big Climate Fightback campaign will start with pledges sought from 1 million people. Local groups are being encouraged to run tree-planting events and councils are being asked for permission to plant trees on their land, or outside schools and other publicly owned properties. Businesses are also being urged to plant trees on their own premises if possible.  People without gardens or the means to plant their own trees are being encouraged to spot potential sites and ask their local council or the landowner for permission to plant. By 2025, the Woodland Trust – the charity behind the Big Climate Fightback – hopes to have planted a tree for every person in the country. All of the trees provided by the charity will be native broadleaf varieties, such as oak, birch and hawthorn. The writer and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig has pledged to plant a tree and called on others to do the same. “Climate change is a real threat and affects us all, but there is the simplest of all solutions: the humble tree,” she said. “I urge people to get off their sofas and plant a tree. It’s very simple and you could be one in a million.” According to the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers on the climate crisis, the UK should have 1.5bn new trees by 2050 to meet the net zero carbon target, set in line with international scientific warnings on the climate crisis. The government has set a target of 5,000 hectares a year for England alone, but planting rates have fallen well short of that, with last year only 1,420 hectares (3,508 acres) of new woodland planted. However, trees will also need to be cared for after planting to ensure they survive, so groups are encouraged to participate beyond the planting stage. The Woodland Trust also warned that tree planting alone was not enough. “As individuals, we all need to do much more to reduce our impact on the planet by cutting emissions and reducing pressure on resources,” said Darren Moorcroft, the charity’s chief executive. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Working with the Woodland Trust and other organisations, we also want to encourage everyone to play a part and help us to plant more trees. We’ve already kick-started the creation of a Northern Forest, which will see 50m trees planted from Liverpool to Hull, and we have set up two funds worth £60m to drive up planting rates, including in our towns and cities. Later this year we will be consulting on a new English Tree Strategy, focusing on how to accelerate woodland creation across the country.”"
"Mark Butler wants to make one thing clear: the shadow minister for climate change and energy is not for turning. It wasn’t a mistake to pursue an ambitious climate policy in the 2019 election and “we are not going to change our position to get to a level of profound irresponsibility [on policy], like the government”, he tells Guardian Australia’s politics podcast. “Our position on climate is unshakeable.”  This declaration might seem hard to square with Butler’s swingeing self-assessment of just over a week ago. The shadow minister, a leftwing powerbroker and close ally of Anthony Albanese, used a speech at a book launch in Canberra to send a message to colleagues that there can be no sugarcoating Labor’s election loss, and all policies, including the ones for which he had direct portfolio responsibility, needed to be subjected to a “ruthless and unsparing” review. Butler says that ruthless and unsparing inquisition is already in train, with campaign reviewers Jay Weatherill (a long-time friend and factional ally) and Craig Emerson considering the impact of various policies on the May result, including his in climate and energy. But he insists the scope of the official reflection is policy detail, not core principle. “Our principles on climate change are utterly clear and unshakeable.” He’s not yet sure which specific election commitments survive the cull, and which don’t, but Labor, he says, will implement the Paris agreement, look for policies that will keep warming below 2C, move to net zero emissions by 2050 and set medium-term emissions reduction targets “that are consistent with these principles and guided by the best available scientific and economic advice”. As well as looking at how to recalibrate the policy offering within those fixed parameters, Butler says Labor is also looking at its messaging. He says Labor has not been clear enough in the past that the transition in coal communities that will happen as a result of decarbonisation is more a function of decisions being made by trading partners in Australia’s major export markets than of domestic climate regulation. He says it is hard to separate out what is happening globally from what is happening locally and communicate that comprehensively when Labor is being wedged on both the right and the left, but he says “that is the challenge, to try and make those things a little clearer”. Butler says working on the interface between Labor’s climate policies and the viability of coal communities in regional Queensland and the Hunter Valley is “something we are going to have to work hard on dealing with over the next couple of years”. “Decisions taken by our trading partners have a very real impact on regional communities … I understand why people feel so passionately about this, and want to have some agency in it, but it is our responsibility as politicians to speak truth. What happens to mines, whether they can wash their face, is not going to be determined at all by what happens in [Canberra] – it’s a direct function of the export market.” He says while Labor understands the backlash in coal communities that has prompted fellow frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon, who represents an electorate in the Hunter, to speak out more assertively and positively about coal – he argues there is no substantial internal dissent about climate ambition. He says the new Labor MPs who have entered parliament post-election have made it clear they believe climate action is a core part of the social democratic project in 2019. But he says the political environment, for Labor, remains fraught. The Greens, with crossbench backing, are proposing to bring forward a parliamentary motion declaring a climate emergency. Butler says it is abundantly clear there is a climate emergency. “I’ve said so in the parliament on a number of occasions.” But he says there is also zero prospect of that motion getting up in the current parliament, and he’s “not sure it is realistic to have a debate”. He says some in the Coalition are also emboldened by the May victory, and as a consequence of the voter affirmation, there will be a centre of gravity in the centre right that wants to keep weaponising climate change as an issue. Butler says the past decade in Australian politics has demonstrated there is a “business model” in division, and Labor has washed up consistently since the Rudd period on the wrong side of bursts hyper-partisanship on the left and the right. While he has concern about some in the government digging in and declaring climate change “always has to be weaponised” – he also thinks it is possible Scott Morrison will shift on climate during the coming term, particularly if the Australian community remains vocal on the issue, and business also continues to demand policy certainty to allow it to deal with carbon risk. He says for people who want practical climate action, as opposed to rhetoric, bipartisanship remains “the holy grail”. Butler says Morrison is not Malcolm Turnbull on climate, and not Tony Abbott, but somewhere in the middle. He suspects the prime minister has no “deep beliefs” on the issue, but that could enable him to pivot to a more plausible policy position in the event he makes a judgment that climate change is harming the electoral prospects of the Coalition. Perhaps Morrison, he says, can take “some baby steps to break down the culture war”. He says while there is a significant risk climate change will become even more polarised in Australia as citizens become more frustrated and angry with the lack of policy action, and elements of the Coalition seek to weaponise the issue against progressive parties in contests in the coal basins – community organisation and action is very important over the coming parliamentary term. “It is really valuable to have the community put pressure on this building,” he says. Butler says all the survey evidence he has seen indicates Australian voters are alarmed by the lack of policy action on climate change, and the issue rates second behind concerns about cost of living pressure. He says he is “utterly convinced” that public opinion in favour of action is “broad, deep and growing”. Politicians, he says, need to be particularly aware that young people are hugely motivated on climate change. Butler has teenaged children and meets regularly with young activists. “I can see it in their eyes,” he says. “They think our generation is from a different planet.” He says there is a risk of climate change widening the generation gap, which is more substantial now, he thinks, than at any time since the 1960s, “and we know what happened out of that” – good things, he says, “but a lot of turmoil”. He says the challenge of the term will be to try and keep moving forward and to build a constituency for change. “We can’t continue in the next decade to have the wars we’ve had in the last decade. The last decade was supposed to be the critical decade. I don’t know what beyond critical is. “If we get to 2030 with the level of inertia we’ve had over the last decade, then we have profoundly let down our children and grandchildren”."

At his Der Wettermann website retired German meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne is calling for an immediate stop of all state-funded climate research.
h/t DirkH
Dr Thüne, who is sort of Germany’s version of John Coleman, has been one of Germany’s most outspoken critics of climate science and the huge waste of taxpayer money all the research involves.
Dr. Thüne:
For decades billions of US dollars of taxpayer money have been pumped into climate research without getting any detectable progress. Climate experts still have not even succeeded in delivering the physical proof of the claimed “greenhouse effect”.
The meteorological fact is that at no point on earth and at no time of the year do either the daily or yearly air temperature and CO2 concentrations causally correlate. There is no correlation! Also a radical reduction of ‘greenhouse gases’ in Europe, or “achieving a ‘CO2-free Europe’, would have absolutely no impact on the weather over the course of the annual seasons.”

Thüne then blasts EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard’s “Energy-Climate-Package” which calls for spending €270 BILLION every year over the next 40 years in order to reduce CO2 emissions by 80%, calling it a “senseless physical endeavour”. He adds:
No state, already under a mountain of debt, can morally justify the burning of  billions, and yes trillions, on the ‘protection of the global climate’ without leaving proof of having any effect whatsoever.
The correlation between the CO2-value in Hawaii and the annually calculated ‘global temperature’ is a fictitious correlation that imposters as causal effect, but is in reality only a make believe correlation.”
Thüne then reminds us that the earth’s climate has been proven to correlate with the angle of the sun’s rays striking the earth’s surface and that ‘it is as old as the planet itself’, has nothing to do with industrialisation and that the calculated temperature increase of 0.7°C  that has taken place since 1860 is a normal earthly process.
Thüne clearly labels the state’s attempt to regulate global temperature, while at the same time delivering social justice, a folly. He adds: “weather cannot be disciplined, and weather alone determines what climate a location or a state has”. Thüne ends by reminding us:
Humankind would be helped in practical ways if 20% of research resources were instead devoted to better weather forecasting and the remaining 80% devoted to combating hunger and poverty.”

"There is a celebrated line in Jared Diamond’s Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive, his bestselling study of ecocide and sudden social implosion. Referring to the “self-inflicted environmental damage” on Easter Island by deforestation, Diamond asked: “What did the Easter islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it?” While there has been much academic controversy about the accuracy of his shorthand for what happened on Easter Island, what remains, however, is a powerful and affecting metaphor, one ever more resonant in the midst of the escalating global climate emergency. The question “What on earth are we thinking?” is, today, no longer an experiment in supposition. We can see the shape of the calamity and measure our responses and the hypocrisies and contradictions inherent in them. Confronted by a climate emergency on a vast scale, and with the widespread failure of our political leaders, we continue to behave as if someone else – anyone else – will solve the problem, rather than tackling it ourselves. So we worry. And we continue to consume. And sometimes we consume as a way of escaping the worry of consuming – even as we struggle to step back and see the wider, and blindingly obvious, picture. It is a cycle that has placed a well-founded sense of anxiety about humankind’s future, perhaps not experienced so viscerally since the depths of the cold war and the fear of nuclear annihilation, against a profound sense of powerlessness. Solutions can seem beyond our reach as individuals and, if solvable at all, are in the hands of governments. There are, then, deep and pressing reasons to be desperately worried. But there are also reasons for optimism. Alongside a wider democratic crisis, last week’s climate strike – and the wider Extinction Rebellion represented by figures such as the teenage climate campaigner Greta Thunberg – exists as a potent reminder that activism is not simply about lobbying the seats of power but about our power. As individuals, we can shape the culture, societies and politics we live in and drive them towards better results. In the heat of political debate, we forget sometimes the importance of individual acts While it is easy to be cynical about the impact of protest in an age of populism, where politicians seem determined to find ways to become ever less accountable, the global reach and scale of last week’s strike suggest a shifting of public opinion. Where once events such as Climate Camp could attract a few thousands, mainly committed activists, the climate strike has attracted vast numbers across the world, many of them protesting for the first time. If we need leaders such as Thunberg, it is as a reminder of the importance not only of organised action but of what we can and should do for ourselves. It is a philosophy that was best summed up by the US philosopher and educator John Dewey in The Ethics of Democracy. Dewey rejected the idea that democracy should be confined to narrow ideas of government, political institutions and electoral mandates. Rather, he argued, it should be seen as a way of life, recognising that it is individuals and their intrinsic interactions with society that make majorities for change. A lesson that has sometimes been obscured is that we know who Thunberg is because of decisions that she made as an individual, as a person who refused to be intimidated by the scale of the problem and chose to organise for change. Some reject the notion that individual action – recycling or changing how much meat we eat or how we travel – is a sufficient response to the sheer scale of the problem confronting the planet. But this misses a key point about how we live our lives. In the heat of political debate, we forget sometimes the importance of individual acts. What we put in our breakfast bowl, small issue as it is, became – for me at least – something that made me think about the sustainability and provenance of what I ate when a friend pointed out that huge amounts of water are used to produce my once favourite almond milk.  Our individual moral choices – as consumers (and indeed how and whether to consume), how we vote, and what initiatives we support or we reject – might seem insignificant. But it is those small changes that can transform societies. Indeed, profound social change has often come incrementally. Consider the abolition of slavery, the movements for universal adult suffrage, trade union and gay rights. For the majority of us, the most powerful statement we can make beyond voting and occasional protest is in choosing how we live our lives in a consumer society and how we communicate those choices as part of the widening debate. While it is easy for figures such as Donald Trump to mock the demand for the phasing out of plastic straws or the need for low-energy lightbulbs, the reality is that he is pushing against a wider and far more sophisticated appreciation of environmental impact. What’s more, an increasing number of large corporations have internalised their vulnerability to changing patterns, making consumers more powerful than many suppose. A case in point is the major car manufacturers that have moved into electric vehicle production not because they feel it is the right thing to do but because they sense it is what customers will want in the future, because it is increasingly what future legislation will dictate and because they believe they will make money out of it. There are two crucial lessons from last week’s climate strikes. The first is that we need to overcome our own sense of paralysis in the face of an epochal moment of anxiety. The second is that we are more powerful than we think. And perhaps – just perhaps – the accumulation of small acts can lead to immeasurably larger outcomes. What is certain is that without asking what we are doing and acting on it, like the Easter islander with the axe in Diamond’s metaphorical question, we have absolutely everything to lose. • Peter Beaumont is a senior reporter on the Guardian’s Global Development desk"

"An artificial dune of nearly 2m cubic metres of sand has been created on the Norfolk coast in an innovative approach to slowing coastal erosion. In the £20m sandscaping scheme, enough sand to fill one and a half Wembley stadiums has been dredged from existing North Sea seabed extraction sites off Great Yarmouth and ferried to the rapidly eroding coastline beside the large gas terminal at Bacton. Nearly four miles (6km) of coastline has been replenished with new sand, deposited up to seven metres deep in places in an irregular form so the wind can create dunes to buffer the soft sandy cliffs. Although the sand is expected to erode and move with storms and currents, the project’s engineers say it will buy 15 to 20 more years for a coastline where seaside communities are predicted to have to move inland later this century because of rising seas caused by the climate crisis. Villages to the south of Bacton have blamed increased erosion on the concrete sea defences around the gas terminal. These have prevented the natural movement of sediment from sandy cliffs drifting southwards to replenish neighbouring beaches. The new mobile defences are calculated to work with the longshore drift which will carry the sand southwards where it will protect other coastal villages that are increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis. It is the first scheme of its kind outside the Netherlands where the Zandmotor project used 10 times as much sand to protect a half-mile stretch of coastline in south Holland. The Dutch engineering company that designed the project has identified up to 20 coastal locations where sandscaping could be used, including Lincolnshire and the shingle coast at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. The company is currently discussing with Cornwall county council a potential sandscaping solution in Penzance where coastal erosion threatens the railway line. Jaap Flikweert, the coastal management adviser for Royal HaskoningDHV, said the Norfolk project was “a little nephew of Zandmotor”. “It’s less radical and it looks like a big, slightly more curvy beach nourishment scheme … it sticks out less from the shoreline but this is the best concept for the clients,” he said. Local people at Walcott in Norfolk – where the 2013 storms wrecked homes – welcomed the scheme but pointed to the loss of 1 metre of sand from the lower part of the beach since it was placed there in August. “A lot of it seems to have disappeared already,” said Ken Crowe. “I hope it does what it set out to do. Time will tell.” “People say the beach used to be like this 60 years ago,” said Cathy Kerby. “It’s improved the beach for everyone … we trust the experts know what they are doing and it will work.” According to Flikweert, some sand will be moved by the tides and currents and will disappear on to offshore sand banks in the winter but is expected to return in the summer. “That’s the dynamic of the beach. Of course it looks worrying, especially for local people, but that’s how it works.” The Zandmotor scheme in south Holland has surpassed initial expectations. The natural sea defence was expected to last for 20 years but a recent analysis suggested it could last twice as long. The Bacton project caused controversy in the spring when netting placed on the cliffs prevented returning sand martins from nesting in their regular holes. However, according to Natural England which monitored the sand martins, the birds dug new nest holes nearby and enjoyed a successful nesting season with as many birds as before. The new sand is also expected to provide habitat for shore-nesting birds such as ringed plover. Two-thirds of the £20m British scheme has been funded by the owners of Bacton gas terminal – including Shell – with £5m from the Environment Agency and additional funding from councils. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “The climate crisis requires innovation and collaboration between countries, organisations, sectors and communities. The Bacton to Walcott scheme is a model for other climate resilience projects, protecting key national infrastructure while also delivering added coastal protection to the local villages.” The Bacton gas terminal brings ashore 20% of the UK’s gas needs and is designated critical national infrastructure. When the terminal was built in the 1960s it was 100 metres from the sea but this had dwindled to 20 metres before the 2013 storms. After these storms, in places the sea was just 10 metres from the terminal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn my last post, I wrote about some German politicians who have woken up to the fact that energy saving lights are highly toxic, and dangerous to use in households.They now want to have them banned, and bring back the old incandescent bulb Edison brought us 130 years ago. I also posted a link to a shocking German documentary that exposes the reckless recycling of the mercury-laden bulbs.
Parts 2 and 3 of the documentary show the horrific handling of the used ESLs, which I describe here in English.
Part 1/3: The North Sea island of Nordeney changes over to energy saving lights in a project with Philips
The 2009 report on NDR German television investigated the energy saving lamps (ESL) in detail and found it is probably far worse for the environment than any one could have imagined. In Part 1, the North Sea island of Nordeney wants to eliminate all incandescent light bulbs, and thus become a model for the world. So Norderney teams up with ESL manufacturer Philips to replace all normal lights with ESLs.
Citizens expressed their concerns about the toxic mercury in the lamps. But the Philips spokespersons downplay the risk and tell lies about the risk. The TV documentary asks the question: “Are ESLs really that good for the environment?” The answer to this question becomes shocking when all factors are examined.

Part 2: The ESLs are transported and reloaded over hundreds of kilometers, leaving a trail of toxic mercury and broken lamps behind. 
As Part 2 shows, many of the residents of Nordeney are worried about the toxic mercury, and want to know how the ESLs are to be safely transported off the island once used. Is it possible to put them in containers without breaking and releasing mercury? In a town meeting with citizens, a Philips sales manager simply answers that it is not the responsibility of the manufacturer, but rather that of the recycling companies. Here the Philips spokesmen underplays the hazards of their ESL’s.
The citizens want to know if recycling companies properly handle the ESLs? To answer the question, the NDR reporter follows the entire recycling route of the ESL. What he finds is horrific.
Taking the old lamps back to the shop
Part 2 of the documentary shows that shops gladly take back the ESLs once used, and carefully collect them for recycling. When you buy a new lamp, then just bring back the old one. The shops collect the old ESLs and a disposal company later picks them up and takes them to a disposal centre. But as you will see, the route to recycling is one that is riddled with released mercury and broken lamps. Work conditions for workers are horrendous.
Toxic work conditions
Used ESLs first are first collected at the Müllumschlagstation (Waste Gathering Station) on Norderney. As the NDR reporter shows, the Müllumschlaganlage Norderney is poorly equipped to handle the old ESLs. The company doesn’t have the proper containers for storing and transporting them. As a result many of the ESLs break and release their toxic mercury into the environment. Here a worker handling the broken ESLs is asked if he was afraid of the mercury. He replied,
“No, we wear gloves – and we have been immunised.”
Immunized against mercury? The disposal company spokeswoman then explains that the correct containers for holding the old ESLs are actually wire mesh boxes, but they don’t have any in Norderney, and then adds that ESL breakage is rare anyway and so it isn’t a real problem. But as the reporter shows, there are broken ESLs everywhere.
Once the lamps are sorted, trucks pick them up and transport them off from the island. Where do they go next?
Unloading and reloading – broken lamps everywhere
The reporter follows the truck on its trip from Norderney to the MKW disposal centre on the German mainland located in Grossefehn, just east of Emden. But here the facility is also not a recycling centre. It is just another logistics collection centre where the “improper” containers are unloaded and the lamps reloaded again (more lamps break). No recycling is done here. Here, the broken ESLs are sorted out by workers who only wear gloves and no masks. One worker is picking broken pieces and putting them in a paper box and brings them to a container – an open wire mesh container. When a wire mesh container is full, it is picked up by a truck and the journey continues.
More unloading and reloading – more broken lamps

From Grossefehn the truck transports the ESLs to a 3rd location where there are many more wire mesh containers filled with old broken ESLs exposed to the air. At this third location, ESLs are also only collected, and not recycled, and then sent to yet a 4th location. But where? The reporter then follows the ESLs, now held in the “correct” wire mesh containers, all the way to Bad Oeynhausen, several hundred km away. But at this location, the reporter is not allowed to film.
The reporter does, however, find out that the next location for the old lamps is the DELA recycling company near the city of Essen. By now the old lamps have travelled more than 600 kilometres since leaving Norderney. Many do not even survive the trip. And the energy the lights had saved by consuming less electricity is certainly used up by the long and complicated logistics chain.
At DELA, the manager spoke openly about the recycling process, proud to be a part of protecting the environment. On the subject of breaking ESLs, he assured that it happened very rarely. Says manager DELA Ralf Kölzer:
Broken glass is immediately sorted out and there is practically no breakage in the wire mesh containers. The amount of breakage is negligible.”
But the reporter then shows a truck being unloaded. As the truck is opened, many small shards of mercury contaminated glass fall to the ground. No problem though. Two workers simply sweep up the broken contaminated glass and throw it away.

Part 3: Horrific work conditions at the recycling plant
Finally at DELA, the 5th location, recycling begins – first the ESLs are unloaded from the mesh containers and thrown into a crusher by hand. The workers here are not even wearing any type of masks. “No problem”, says manager Kölzer, “The mercury vapours are simply removed by the overhead vacuum hood”. The crushed material is then separated according to size and type. The crushed and sorted material is then packed into so called Big Bags (you can see a cloud of dust blowing out from the bag when a worker moves it).
Recycling the ESLs consume lots of energy
The ESLs from Norderney are also crushed in Bad Oeynhausen and then delivered to DELA in big bags. There the crushed material is separated and goes through a complex process that requires a lot of energy. How much energy? No one can answer that question. EU bureaucrats say that the energy savings are worth it, even with the mercury problem. Environmental groups like Greenpeace are also active supporters of the ESLs. But Greenpeace in Hamburg refused an interview with NDR.
I also tried to get a comment from Greenpeace, but got nothing.
Nowhere is it possible to find a complete life cycle study on CO2 and energy that compares ESLs and standard lights. More important, what about the mercury in the environment? What about the health of the workers?

The NDR reporter also researched to see if the ESL lights really do last longer than the normal lights and use less energy. The results show that they do not.

"What is the “green industrial revolution”? The Labour party’s answer to the climate emergency is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in new industries and reforms to existing practices, to generate economic opportunities, particularly in areas where old industrial jobs have vanished. The ideas behind it are similar to those of the international move for a Green New Deal, espoused by leading Democrats in the US, but draw on the UK’s specific industrial resources, skills and heritage.  What measures have been announced? On Monday, a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points, to ensure rapid refuelling for long and short journeys. There will also be interest-free loans for electric car buyers, with the aim of electric vehicles making up two-thirds of those on UK roads by 2030. Energy generation is another key target: home insulation and solar panels will be introduced free for more than a million people in low-income and social housing. If elected, a Labour government would renationalise the electricity grid, with a national energy agency and regional agencies taking over the task of delivering energy and balancing demand, while suppliers would remain private. Labour would also ban fracking. What other measures are likely? Labour will announce plans to remove planning restrictions that stop onshore windfarms. A large proportion of the proposed £250bn national transformation fund will be spent on the “green industrial revolution”, in ways yet to be laid out in detail. Additional Treasury policies could include adjusting the discount rate to make investments in green measures cheaper and changes to tax. Public procurement would be reformed so that suppliers to the public sector have to meet stringent green standards. And there may be a move to bring forward the government’s current target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, enacted by Theresa May. What will this mean for jobs? Labour claims the measures will create tens of thousands of new jobs around the country, and unions are broadly in favour, backing a “just transition” from high-carbon industries to a low-carbon economy that would create high-quality jobs to replace those lost in industries such as coal. How is this being received? There is support among party members, with Labour for a Green New Deal and Momentum backing the idea, and it seems to play well among young people in particular. Businesses seem more wary, with the CBI telling the Guardian that “renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions”. Will Brexit have an impact? Plans for green industry are being presented as separate to Brexit, representing a way forward that all sides of the Brexit debate can espouse, as they are targeted at new green jobs and an industrial revival. But a close relationship with Europe is viewed as essential, to collaborate on green standards and carbon accounting. The UK will host the major UN climate conference in 2020, called COP26, so Labour would seek to showcase the “green industrial revolution” on the international stage if in power next December. What about aviation? One key issue that must be addressed is the forecast rapid rise in emissions from aviation, and Labour has been divided over a new runway at Heathrow, in contrast to the Liberal Democrats who want a moratorium on all airport expansion. Improved and cheaper public transport is key to Labour plans: the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, pointed to flights within the UK that are much cheaper than rail journeys as one target for action."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a magical element about that number. Maybe because it is 1000 squared. Or maybe it’s a quantity that is very high, yet still within the realms of human imagination. It’s a number that certainly exudes magnitude.

There are a number of phrases with the word “million”, some examples:
– millionaire
– thanks a million
– not in a million years
– one in a million
– million dollar question
– million-dollar deal
– multi-million dollar project
– million dollar baby
– I told you a million times (CO2 is not driving the climate!)
As I mentioned earlier this morning, today is a special day for NoTricksZone – this site reached the milestone of 1,000,000 hits – some time around 11 a.m. this morning – a little more than a year after first starting on 1 April, 2010. 
THANKS A MILLION – READERS!
Okay – compared to other blogs, which get this in just weeks, or even days, it’s not so much. Yet, it far surpasses anything I expected when I first got started. The first days of blogging saw a few dozen hits, and I thought maybe some day I’d get 100 or even 500 hits a day. One hundred thousand hits seemed so remote. But here we are – 1,000,000!
The first 6 months NTZ saw 220,000 hits, and the next 6 months and 10 days we got 780,000 hits.
Also thanks to the guest writers who contributed, namely Matt Vooro, Ed Caryl, Juraj, Jimbo (I know I’m missing a person or two here, so please forgive me) and all the regular readers. Readers are always welcome to contribute as guest writers.
And hopefully readers will keep dropping by.
Thanks to other sites for posting and mentioning my posts, particularly Climate Depot, WUWT, Tom Nelson and others. All of this contributes to readers getting stories and insights that they might not otherwise see. My main focus will be to continue writing about climate news in Germany and Europe so that people can get a feel of what is going on here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe animated graphic below was created by geophysicist Joachim Saul from the Helmholtz Association GFZ Research Centre for Geosciences, read here and shows the sequence of quakes since March 9. The animated image is available at www.gfz-potsdam.de. Click the image to activate.

The GFZ press release writes:
It shows the earthquake activity in the region of Honshu, Japan, measured at the GFZ since 8 March 2011. After a seismically quiet 8th March, the morning (coordinated universal time UTC) of the March 9 began with an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 off the Japanese east coast, followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.
The morning of March 11 sees the earthquake disaster that triggered the devastating tsunami. This earthquake is followed by many almost severe aftershocks, two of which almost reach the magnitude 8. In the following time period the activity slowly subsides, and is dominated today (March 16) by relatively small magnitude 5 quakes, though several earthquakes of magnitude 6 are being registered on a daily basis.
By analysing over 500 GPS stations, the GFZ scientists Rongjiang Wang and Thomas Walter have found that horizontal displacements of up to five meters in an eastern direction occurred at the east coast of Japan. The cause lies in the earthquake zone, i.e. at the contact interface of the Pacific plate with Japan. Computer simulations of this surface show that an offset of up to 25 meters occurred during the earthquake.
Calculations of the GFZ modeling group headed by Stephan Sobolev even yielded a displacement of up to 27 meters and a vertical movement of seven meters. This caused an abrupt elevation in the deep sea, and thus triggered the tsunami. The images of the GPS displacement vectors and the computer simulations can also be found among the online material provided by the GFZ.
Already shortly after the quake Andrey Babeyko and Stephan Sobolev of the GFZ modeled the propagation and wave heights of the tsunami in the Pacific over the first 16 hours. The tremendous force of the earthquake is highlighted here, too: in the open Pacific, relatively large wave heights of over one meter were calculated, which agrees very well with the observations. How high the tsunami is piled up on the coast is largely determined by water depth and the shape of the coastline. The GFZ material also contains an image and an animation regarding this work.”

Geological events often take their time, where a few millimeters per year is fast. But in this case, Mother Nature appears to have hit the super fast-forward button, demonstrating her awesome power.
Erte Ale volcano awakes from it's slumber. Photo source: filippo_jean (Wikipedia)
Volcano Erta Ale (above) in northeastern Ethiopia has begun to gurgle and widespread seismic activity threatens to redefine the map (see below) of the African east near the Red Sea – and to do so very quickly. Der Spiegel (in English) reports on dramatic geological events now unfolding.
The area between the dotted lines could be submerged. (Photo source: Wikipedia.
Der Spiegel headlines and writes:

Violent Seismic Activity Tearing Africa in Two
Researchers say that lava in the region is consistent with magma normally seen on the sea floor — and that water will ultimately cover the desert.
The earth is in upheaval in northeastern Africa, and the region is changing quickly. The desert floor is quaking and splitting open, volcanoes are boiling over, and seawaters are encroaching upon the land. Africa, researchers are certain, is splitting apart at a rate rarely seen in geology.”

For now, the only thing holding back the Red Sea water from the Danakil Depression (see following graphic) are hills, and they appear to be sinking quickly, writes Der Spiegel.
Afar Drape. The Danakil Depression is located in the upper center. Graphic source: Wikipedia). 
And now that the Erta Ale volcano nearby is erupting – something no one anticipated, it could disrupt that last barrier that keeps the Red Sea at bay. Der Spiegel:
The magma coming out of Erta Ale has the same chemical composition as the kind that emerges from deep-sea volcanoes. The entire region increasingly resembles an ocean floor — one without water.”
Magma typically seen under the Red Sea is flowing underneath the continent, and eventually something has to give. Fissures are appearing at many locations in the region. According to geologist Tim Wright, fellow at the University of Leeds’ School of Earth and Environment:
The hills could sink in a matter of days”
Tectonic activity has increased recently not only in that African region, but has also spread into Saudi Arabia. De Spiegel quotes Oxford University’s David Ferguson on his predictions for volcanic eruptions and earthquakes in the region over the next decade, saying they will…:
  …become of increasingly large magnitude.”

"Millions of people demonstrated across the world yesterday demanding urgent action to tackle global heating, as they united across timezones and cultures to take part in the biggest climate protest in history. In an explosion of the youth movement started by the Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg just over 12 months ago, people protested from the Pacific islands, through Australia, across-south east Asia and Africa into Europe and onwards to the Americas. For the first time since the school strikes for climate began last year, young people called on adults to join them – and they were heard. Trade unions representing hundreds of millions of people around the world mobilised in support, employees left their workplaces, doctors and nurses marched and workers at firms like Amazon, Google and Facebook walked out to join the climate strikes. In the estimated 185 countries where demonstrations took place, the protests often had their individual targets; from rising sea levels in the Solomon Islands, toxic waste in South Africa, to air pollution and plastic waste in India and coal expansion in Australia. But the overall message was unified – a powerful demand for an urgent step-change in action to cut emissions and stabilise the climate. The demonstrations took place on the eve of a UN climate summit, called by the secretary general, António Guterres, to inject urgency into government action to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement. Carbon emissions climbed to a record high last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that there is little more than a decade left to act to slash emissions and stabilise the climate. Donald Trump will be at the UN headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead, in what will be seen by many as a snub. On Friday, the voices of key political leaders were noticeable by their absence. Instead it was a day for people to set forth their demands, ranging from a ban on new mining in countries like South Africa and Australia, to a “green new deal” in the UK and US to better air quality and more trees in countries like India. “We are out here to reclaim our right to live, our right to breathe and our right to exist, which is all being denied to us by an inefficient policy system that gives more deference to industrial and financial objectives rather than environmental standards,” said Aman Sharma, a young protester in Delhi. The action began in the Pacific Islands, where citizens have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea took part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events and discussions. Students held placards in Kiribati and chanted: “We are not sinking, we are fighting.” The demonstrations spread across Australia – the world’s biggest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas – where more than 300,000 people took to the streets in 100 rallies, prompting a tweet from Thunberg – awake in New York – that the “huge crowd” would set the standard. Incredible pictures as Australia’s gathering for the #climatestrike This is the huge crowd building up in Sydney. Australia is setting the standard! Its bedtime in New York...so please share as many pictures as you can as the strikes move across Asia to Europe and Africa! pic.twitter.com/7eAPUQPq5C The Australian finance minister, Mathias Cormann, had said on Thursday that students should stay in class rather than go on strike. In a retort, Danielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student said: “World leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work. I’d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.” In Tokyo, hundreds of students and environmental activists marched through the business and shopping district of Shibuya, chanting “Climate Justice!” while holding hand-painted placards made of cardboard with messages such as “Go Green,” ‘‘Save the Earth,” and “the Earth is on fire.” Smaller rallies were held in more than a dozen cities around Japan, including Kyoto. No protests were authorised in China, the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another. “Chinese youth have their own methods,” she said. “We also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.” There was action, however, in Taiwan, where dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks. In Thailand, hundreds of young people demonstrated outside the environment ministry in Bangkok and dropped to the ground feigning death. “We are the future and we deserve better,” said 12-year-old Ralyn ‘Lilly’ Satidtanasarn – who has been dubbed “Thailand’s Greta” for her campaign against plastic bag use in a country where each person uses 3,000 throwaway bags a year. In India’s capital Delhi, where the suffocating air pollution was the target of the demonstration, Rishika Singh, 18, said: “It’s the poorest who suffer the most. The rich are better off – they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort.” An armoured personnel carrier was deployed in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to protect about 100 young people as they marched, led by a group of young women carrying a banner emblazoned with “Fridays for Future”. Fardeen Barakzai, one of the organisers and head of the local climate activist group, Oxygen, said: ”We want to do our part. We as the youth of our country know the problem of climate change.” In Kenya’s capital Nairobi some young protesters wore hats and outfits made from plastic bottles to highlight the dangers of plastic waste, a major threat to people living in the developing world. Strikes took place in several Nigerian cities, including Lagos, which is often beset by formidable quantities of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU.  “Leaders should listen to what the climate scientists are saying. No leader should forfeit the future of younger generation,” said Oladosu Adenike, an activist in the Fridays4Future campaign in Nigeria. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. “We don’t really have a way out of this,” said Natalie Kapsosideris, 16. “The future looks really dismal at this point. There’s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us … and it’s all because they want to make money.” Demonstrations took place in most European countries, with huge crowds in Warsaw, Poland and more than 1.4 million people taking action across Germany. In Berlin, demonstrators blocked roads and protested outside the German chancellery. In response, Angela Merkel announced a €50bn package of new measures to curb carbon emissions and review progress towards reaching its climate goals by 2030. Merkel said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Thunberg’s motto “unite behind the science”. “The chances are very good, they have grown, that we will reach our climate goals this time,” Merkel said. “If we should realise we’re not on track, then we will correct this.” In Brussels one rather poetic placard read: “Respect existence or Expect resistance!” Thousands took to the streets in Dublin. Luke Corkery, a university student, said in a tweet: “Blown away … This is a movement led by young people across the globe. We’re not just looking for an excuse for a day off school or college; we’re standing up for the future of our planet.” The global protest culminated in New York which was anticipating one of the largest climate strikes. Education chiefs in the city gave every one of the 1.1 million children in its schools permission to attend the climate strike and hear Thunberg speak at a rally at the United Nations headquarters. “Greta! Greta! Greta!” the crowd chanted as she took to the stage. The 16-year-old directed her speech to the students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. “We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,” she said. “Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?” She sparked laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and “tell us they really, really admire what we do” yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. “We demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?” It was estimated that more than 250,000 people turned out for the protests in New York, with thousands more demonstrating in Boston, Miami and San Francisco. In Mexico City, protesters chanted “Se ve, se siente, la tierra está caliente” – “You see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.” In Brazil, where recent fires in the Amazon have drawn attention to the climate emergency, students attended protests in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and the capital Brasília. • This article was amended on 23 September 2019. In an earlier version the words of Aman Sharma were incorrectly attributed to , a climate activist who tweeted a video interview with Sharma."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have to keep repeating this because the irresponsible media keeps distorting everything.
Zettels Raum brings the latest update here. So far every single one of his reports has been spot on. 
Here are the latest main points:

Works on the nuclear power plant have made amazing progress. One can say with high probability that no big accident will occur. The catastrophe, which the media has been filled with, will not take place.

The first days of activity focused on preventing a meltdown of the reactors. To do this the pressure inside the containment had to be lowered by releasing air out of the containment and into the reactor building. That led to two consequences:  
1) the air was radioactive and escaped into the surrounding environment. This improvement naturally led to a worsening situation on the other hand. This makes every decision a difficult balancing act.
2) hydrogen had gathered in the room between the containment and the building roof when the valves were opened, which led to an explosion. The resulting harmless fire outside of the containment made for good pictures for the media and led them to falsely claim that the reactor had been reduced to rubble and ash. These picture were shown repeatedly on TV. See here.


The fact is that there was very little damage – and workers were back immediately putting the system back into order.Such trade-offs have been the order of the last day.Now also Blocks 3 and 4 are now connected to the power grid and so this allows the control room to be put back into operation. But switching on the the power is not possible as long as huge amounts of water continue to be sprayed  onto the reactor building. This leads to a difficult decision: When can you risk stopping the external cooling – at least temporarily – to allow the power to be switched back on and to change over to normal cooling by pumps?
As NHK reported this evening at 18:01 CET, normal cooling of Block 3 will begin tomorrow, provided that the external cooling of this block ends. This is all about making the transition from improvised cooling  over to normal cooling operation in a coordinated manner, and making sure that cooling goes as uninterrrupted as possible.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowly, but surely, more and more people in Germany are speaking up against the hoax that is man-made global warming. Websites and blogs are sprouting and scepticism is spreading. The old, established narrative is now being seriously challenged.
The latest example is a piece written by Ronald Gläser in the online news and commentary magazine called eigentümlich frei:
Brutal Media Campaign Against Climate ‘Deniers’
For starters, Gläser calls the 10:10 no pressure film “only the latest high point in the ongoing campaign against climate sceptics”.
In the run-up to the climate conference in Cancun, which starts on November 30, the propaganda machinery of the academic-media complex will get even shriller.
Gläser then cites the slanderish Der Spiegel piece called Science As The Enemy which suggests only a handful of US scientists are sowing doubt on the AGW theory, and that “97% of all climatologists support the theory”. Gläser equates this Der Spiegel claim to communist East German propoganda.
This is a percentage that not by coincidence reminds of the old Communist East German election results.

The Der Spiegel hit-piece was designed to intimidate other scientists into silence. Gläser writes;
This is Mao’s favorite principle: Educate hundreds by punishing one.
Gläser then provides the background on the resignation of University of California Santa Barbara professor Hal Lewis from the American Physical Society (APS), after having been a member for 67 years. Gläser summarises:
With his open letter he has shown again, for the zillionth time, what’s behind the so-called consensus on the topic of global warming: nothing!
